[1] "As has been demonstrated with many molecules, the chemical properties of these three profiles can vary significantly for a single admetal/host metal pair. For example, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe bimetallic systems have been shown to exhibit increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of a PEMFC due to the fact that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration binds to atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups more weakly than pure Pt(111) [5, 6]."

[2] "The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[3] "Parallel with the predictions from DFT, experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation."

[4] "This follows the same trend predicted by DFT that the subsurface PtNiPt configuration should be more stable on the (100) crystal facet than the (111) facet, as shown earlier in Fig. 2."

[5] "The similar segregation behavior in Figs. 7 and 8 reveals that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrate, bridging the materials gap."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Structural configurations: Bimetallic catalysts can exist in different configurations (surface, subsurface, or intermixed), each with distinct chemical properties. The subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems has shown increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells due to weaker binding with oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

2. Environmental effects: The preferred configuration of bimetallic catalysts depends on the reaction environment. DFT predictions and experimental results show that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is favored with adsorbed oxygen.

3. Adsorbate-induced segregation: The presence of adsorbates like oxygen can induce segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface. This phenomenon has been verified experimentally and the activation barriers for such segregation have been quantified.

4. Crystal facet effects: The stability of bimetallic configurations varies with crystal facets. For example, the subsurface PtNiPt configuration is more stable on the (100) crystal facet than on the (111) facet.

5. Applicability to real catalysts: The segregation behavior observed in single crystal studies is applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap between model systems and practical catalysts.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between thermodynamics, kinetics, and reaction environment when designing and optimizing catalysts for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，特别是对于基于Pt的系统如Pt-3d合金。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 结构构型：双金属催化剂可以存在不同的构型（表面、亚表面或混合），每种构型都有独特的化学性质。在PtNi、PtCo和PtFe系统中，亚表面Pt3dPt(111)构型对燃料电池中的氧还原反应(ORR)表现出更高的活性，这是因为与纯Pt(111)相比，它与氧和羟基的结合更弱。

2. 环境影响：双金属催化剂的优选构型取决于反应环境。DFT预测和实验结果表明，在真空和吸附氢的情况下，亚表面PtMPt(111)构型是优选的，而在吸附氧的情况下，表面MPtPt(111)构型更受青睐。

3. 吸附物诱导的偏析：氧等吸附物的存在可以诱导亚表面3d原子向表面偏析。这种现象已经通过实验得到验证，并且这种偏析的活化能已被量化。

4. 晶面效应：双金属构型的稳定性随晶面而变。例如，亚表面PtNiPt构型在(100)晶面上比在(111)晶面上更稳定。

5. 对实际催化剂的适用性：在单晶研究中观察到的偏析行为适用于多晶基底，这弥合了模型系统和实际催化剂之间的材料差距。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性，并强调了在设计和优化特定应用的催化剂时，考虑热力学、动力学和反应环境之间相互作用的重要性。
