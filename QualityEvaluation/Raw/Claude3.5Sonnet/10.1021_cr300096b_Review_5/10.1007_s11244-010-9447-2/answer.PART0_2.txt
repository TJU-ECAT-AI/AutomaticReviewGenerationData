[1] "As defined in previous publications [16, 38], a positive \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value in Fig. 2 indicates that the subsurface PtMPt(111) is thermodynamically stable. The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[2] "Parallel with the predictions from DFT, experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation."

[3] "The similar segregation behavior in Figs. 7 and 8 reveals that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrate, bridging the materials gap."

[4] "For example, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe bimetallic systems have been shown to exhibit increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of a PEMFC due to the fact that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration binds to atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups more weakly than pure Pt(111) [5, 6]."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts depends on the environment they are exposed to:

1. In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen: The subsurface configuration (PtMPt) is thermodynamically preferred for Pt-3d alloys.

2. With adsorbed oxygen: The surface configuration (MPtPt) becomes thermodynamically favored, leading to segregation of the 3d metal to the surface.

These preferences have been predicted by DFT calculations and verified experimentally on both single crystal and polycrystalline substrates.

The structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts has significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Subsurface configuration (e.g., Pt3dPt(111) in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems) exhibits increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This is due to weaker binding of atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

2. Surface configuration may lead to different catalytic properties, potentially affecting reaction rates and selectivity.

The ability of these catalysts to undergo adsorbate-induced structural changes (e.g., oxygen-induced segregation) can impact their long-term stability and performance in various applications. Understanding and controlling these structural changes is crucial for designing more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for specific reactions and environments.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在以Pt为基础的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些催化剂的稳定性取决于它们所处的环境：

1. 在真空和吸附氢气的环境中：Pt-3d合金的亚表面构型（PtMPt）在热力学上是优先的。

2. 在吸附氧气的环境中：表面构型（MPtPt）在热力学上变得更有利，导致3d金属向表面偏析。

这些偏好已通过DFT计算预测，并在单晶和多晶基底上通过实验验证。

这些双金属催化剂的结构构型对其催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 亚表面构型（例如，PtNi、PtCo和PtFe系统中的Pt3dPt(111)）在质子交换膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）中表现出对氧还原反应（ORR）的活性增强。这是因为与纯Pt(111)相比，它们对原子氧和羟基的结合更弱。

2. 表面构型可能导致不同的催化性能，潜在地影响反应速率和选择性。

这些催化剂在吸附剂诱导下发生结构变化（例如，氧诱导偏析）的能力可能影响它们在各种应用中的长期稳定性和性能。理解和控制这些结构变化对于设计更高效和稳定的双金属催化剂以适应特定反应和环境至关重要。
