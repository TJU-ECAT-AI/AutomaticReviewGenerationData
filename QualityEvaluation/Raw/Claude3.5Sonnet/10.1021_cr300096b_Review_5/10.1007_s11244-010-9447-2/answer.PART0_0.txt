[1] "As defined in previous publications [16, 38], a positive \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value in Fig. 2 indicates that the subsurface PtMPt(111) is thermodynamically stable. The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[2] "Parallel with the predictions from DFT, experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation."

[3] "As determined from glancing incidence XRD, the Pt foil is comprised of nearly equal amount of the two main crystal facets for fcc (111) and (100) [16]. Figure 8 shows the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for a subsurface PtNiPt sample on polycrystalline Pt exposed to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The AES results suggest that there are two regions of segregation."

[4] "This follows the same trend predicted by DFT that the subsurface PtNiPt configuration should be more stable on the (100) crystal facet than the (111) facet, as shown earlier in Fig. 2."

[5] "The similar segregation behavior in Figs. 7 and 8 reveals that DFT predictions and experimental measurements on single crystal bimetallic surfaces are applicable to polycrystalline substrate, bridging the materials gap."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts depends on the environment they are exposed to:

1. In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen (0.5 ML H), the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred.

2. With adsorbed oxygen (0.5 ML O), the surface MPtPt(111) configuration becomes thermodynamically favored.

3. The crystal facet also plays a role in stability, with the subsurface PtNiPt configuration being more stable on the (100) crystal facet than on the (111) facet.

4. Experimental measurements confirm these DFT predictions, showing adsorbate-induced segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen.

5. The stability trends observed in single crystal surfaces are also applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap.

These structural changes have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The subsurface configuration often exhibits different binding energies compared to the surface configuration, which can significantly affect catalytic activity.

2. Adsorbate-induced segregation can lead to changes in surface composition during reactions, potentially altering catalytic performance over time.

3. The different stabilities on various crystal facets suggest that nanoparticle shape and size could influence the overall stability and performance of the catalyst.

4. Understanding these stability trends allows for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts with desired properties for specific applications, such as fuel cells or chemical synthesis.

5. The ability to predict and control surface composition under different reaction conditions is crucial for maintaining optimal catalytic performance and longevity in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统(如Pt-3d合金)中。这些催化剂的稳定性取决于它们所处的环境：

1. 在真空和吸附氢(0.5 ML H)的条件下，次表面PtMPt(111)构型在热力学上是优先的。

2. 在吸附氧(0.5 ML O)的条件下，表面MPtPt(111)构型在热力学上变得更有利。

3. 晶面也在稳定性中起作用，次表面PtNiPt构型在(100)晶面上比在(111)晶面上更稳定。

4. 实验测量证实了这些DFT预测，显示在氧存在下次表面3d原子的吸附诱导偏析。

5. 在单晶表面观察到的稳定性趋势也适用于多晶基底，弥合了材料差距。

这些结构变化对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 次表面构型通常表现出与表面构型不同的结合能，这可能显著影响催化活性。

2. 吸附诱导的偏析可能导致反应过程中表面成分的变化，可能随时间改变催化性能。

3. 在不同晶面上的稳定性差异表明，纳米粒子的形状和尺寸可能影响催化剂的整体稳定性和性能。

4. 理解这些稳定性趋势允许为特定应用（如燃料电池或化学合成）理性设计具有所需性能的双金属催化剂。

5. 在不同反应条件下预测和控制表面成分的能力对于在各种应用中维持最佳催化性能和寿命至关重要。
