Figure 8 shows the normalized Ni/Pt AES ratio for a subsurface PtNiPt sample on polycrystalline Pt exposed to increasing amounts of oxygen at various temperatures. The AES results suggest that there are two regions of segregation."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Structural configurations: Bimetallic catalysts can exist in different configurations (surface, subsurface, or intermixed), each with distinct chemical properties. The subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems has shown increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells due to weaker binding with oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

2. Environmental effects: The preferred configuration of bimetallic catalysts depends on the reaction environment. DFT predictions and experimental results show that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is favored with adsorbed oxygen.

3. Adsorbate-induced segregation: The presence of adsorbates like oxygen can induce segregation of subsurface 3d atoms to the surface. This phenomenon has been verified experimentally and the activation barriers for such segregation have been quantified.

4. Crystal facet effects: The stability of bimetallic configurations varies with crystal facets. For example, the subsurface PtNiPt configuration is more stable on the (100) crystal facet than on the (111) facet.

5. Applicability to real catalysts: The segregation behavior observed in single crystal studies is applicable to polycrystalline substrates, bridging the materials gap between model systems and practical catalysts.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between thermodynamics, kinetics, and reaction environment when designing and optimizing catalysts for specific applications.

2. 环境影响：双金属催化剂的优选构型取决于反应环境。DFT预测和实验结果表明，在真空和吸附氢的情况下，亚表面PtMPt(111)构型是优选的，而在吸附氧的情况下，表面MPtPt(111)构型更受青睐。

3. 吸附物诱导的偏析：氧等吸附物的存在可以诱导亚表面3d原子向表面偏析。这种现象已经通过实验得到验证，并且这种偏析的活化能已被量化。

4. 晶面效应：双金属构型的稳定性随晶面而变。例如，亚表面PtNiPt构型在(100)晶面上比在(111)晶面上更稳定。

5. 对实际催化剂的适用性：在单晶研究中观察到的偏析行为适用于多晶基底，这弥合了模型系统和实际催化剂之间的材料差距。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性，并强调了在设计和优化特定应用的催化剂时，考虑热力学、动力学和反应环境之间相互作用的重要性。

1. Subsurface configuration (e.g., Pt3dPt(111) in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems) exhibits increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This is due to weaker binding of atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

2. Surface configuration may lead to different catalytic properties, potentially affecting reaction rates and selectivity.

The ability of these catalysts to undergo adsorbate-induced structural changes (e.g., oxygen-induced segregation) can impact their long-term stability and performance in various applications. Understanding and controlling these structural changes is crucial for designing more efficient and stable bimetallic catalysts for specific reactions and environments.

The thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts is highly dependent on the environment they are exposed to.

In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, the subsurface configuration (PtMPt) is thermodynamically preferred for Pt-3d alloys. However, when exposed to oxygen, the surface configuration (MPtPt) becomes more stable. This adsorbate-induced segregation has been both predicted by DFT calculations and experimentally verified.

The activation barriers for this oxygen-induced segregation vary among different Pt-3d systems. For example, the activation barrier for Co segregation is lower than that for Ni, indicating that PtNiPt is more resistant to oxygen-induced segregation than PtCoPt. Additionally, the crystal facet plays a role, with Pt3dPt(100) structures generally having higher activation barriers for oxygen-induced segregation compared to Pt3dPt(111) structures.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The subsurface configuration often exhibits enhanced catalytic activity for certain reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells. However, the tendency for surface segregation in oxygen-rich environments can lead to changes in surface composition and potentially affect catalyst performance over time.

The stability and segregation behavior of these bimetallic catalysts are crucial factors in their practical applications. Understanding these phenomena allows for the rational design of more stable and efficient catalysts for specific reaction environments. For instance, catalysts that resist surface segregation in oxygen-rich environments may maintain their enhanced activity for longer periods in fuel cell applications.

在真空和吸附氢的条件下，Pt-3d合金的亚表面构型（PtMPt）在热力学上是优选的。然而，当暴露在氧气中时，表面构型（MPtPt）变得更加稳定。这种吸附剂诱导的偏析已经通过DFT计算预测并通过实验验证。

这种氧诱导偏析的活化能在不同的Pt-3d系统中有所不同。例如，Co的偏析活化能比Ni低，表明PtNiPt比PtCoPt更能抵抗氧诱导偏析。此外，晶面也起着作用，Pt3dPt(100)结构的氧诱导偏析活化能通常比Pt3dPt(111)结构高。

这些结构变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响。亚表面构型通常对某些反应（如燃料电池中的氧还原反应）表现出增强的催化活性。然而，在富氧环境中表面偏析的倾向可能导致表面成分的变化，并可能随时间影响催化剂性能。

这些双金属催化剂的稳定性和偏析行为是其实际应用中的关键因素。理解这些现象可以为特定反应环境设计更稳定、更高效的催化剂提供理论基础。例如，在富氧环境中能够抵抗表面偏析的催化剂可能在燃料电池应用中保持较长时间的增强活性。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts depends on the specific environment and adsorbates present.

However, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the surface MPtPt(111) configuration becomes more stable. This adsorbate-induced segregation has been predicted by DFT calculations and verified experimentally.

The structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance. For instance, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems shows increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells due to weaker binding of oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111).

These adsorbate-induced restructurings represent a significant degradation mechanism for bimetallic alloys. The dynamic nature of these catalysts under reaction conditions can lead to changes in their surface composition and structure, affecting their long-term stability and performance in various applications. Understanding and controlling these phenomena are crucial for designing more effective and durable bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.
