[1] "As defined in previous publications [16, 38], a positive \( \Updelta E_{Seg}{A} \) value in Fig. 2 indicates that the subsurface PtMPt(111) is thermodynamically stable. The DFT results in Fig. 2 predict that the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is preferred in vacuum and with 0.5 ML H, while the surface MPtPt(111) configuration is predicted to be preferred with 0.5 ML O."

[2] "DFT results predict that the surface 3dPtPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed oxygen. Parallel with the predictions from DFT, experimental measurements have been performed to verify the predicted segregation of subsurface 3d atoms in the presence of oxygen, as well as to quantify the activation barrier for the adsorbate-induced segregation."

[3] "For example, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe bimetallic systems have been shown to exhibit increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode of a PEMFC due to the fact that the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration binds to atomic oxygen and hydroxyl groups more weakly than pure Pt(111) [5, 6]. On the other hand, the 3dPtPt(111) surface binds oxygen much more strongly than pure Pt(111) [7], which could lead to surface passivation and admetal dissolution in the environment of the cathode."

[4] "This highlights one of the added degradation mechanisms for bimetallic alloys, the adsorbate-induced restructuring of the alloy metals near the surface, which has been predicted and demonstrated to occur for a number of bimetallic systems [720]."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The stability of these catalysts depends on the specific environment and adsorbates present.

In vacuum and with adsorbed hydrogen, the subsurface PtMPt(111) configuration is thermodynamically preferred. However, in the presence of adsorbed oxygen, the surface MPtPt(111) configuration becomes more stable. This adsorbate-induced segregation has been predicted by DFT calculations and verified experimentally.

The structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts has important implications for their catalytic properties and performance. For instance, the subsurface Pt3dPt(111) configuration in PtNi, PtCo, and PtFe systems shows increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells due to weaker binding of oxygen and hydroxyl groups compared to pure Pt(111). Conversely, the surface 3dPtPt(111) configuration binds oxygen more strongly, which can lead to surface passivation and admetal dissolution in certain environments.

These adsorbate-induced restructurings represent a significant degradation mechanism for bimetallic alloys. The dynamic nature of these catalysts under reaction conditions can lead to changes in their surface composition and structure, affecting their long-term stability and performance in various applications. Understanding and controlling these phenomena are crucial for designing more effective and durable bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统如Pt-3d合金中。这些催化剂的稳定性取决于特定的环境和存在的吸附物。

在真空和吸附氢的情况下，亚表面PtMPt(111)构型在热力学上是优选的。然而，在吸附氧的存在下，表面MPtPt(111)构型变得更稳定。这种吸附物引起的偏析已经通过DFT计算预测并通过实验验证。

这些双金属催化剂的结构构型对其催化性能和表现有重要影响。例如，PtNi、PtCo和PtFe系统中的亚表面Pt3dPt(111)构型在燃料电池中表现出对氧还原反应(ORR)的活性增加，这是由于与纯Pt(111)相比，氧和羟基的结合更弱。相反，表面3dPtPt(111)构型与氧结合更强，在某些环境中可能导致表面钝化和添加金属的溶解。

这些吸附物引起的重构代表了双金属合金的一个重要降解机制。在反应条件下，这些催化剂的动态性质可能导致其表面组成和结构的变化，影响它们在各种应用中的长期稳定性和性能。理解和控制这些现象对于设计更有效和耐久的双金属催化剂至关重要。
