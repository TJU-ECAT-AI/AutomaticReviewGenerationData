[1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

[2] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface; see Fig. 1)."

[3] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

[4] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below (some experimental studies have already shown significantly modified catalytic activity, along the lines of our theoretical predictions, even on non-ideal NSAs10,11)."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, including Pt-based systems. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step procedure that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects. 

Surface segregation tendencies can be estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and host metals. This approach helps predict whether hydrogen-induced segregation will occur under specific conditions.

In real NSAs, deviations from idealized models may occur. For example, some solute atoms in subsurface alloys might segregate deeper into the host metal. However, these deviations generally do not significantly alter the main trends in adsorbate behavior observed in idealized models.

The structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can vary based on thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. This variability can lead to different catalytic properties and performance in various applications. Despite deviations from ideal structures, experimental studies have shown that non-ideal NSAs can still exhibit significantly modified catalytic activity in line with theoretical predictions.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. By understanding and controlling the factors that influence stability, segregation, and structural configuration, researchers can design more effective bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. This approach allows for the tailoring of catalytic properties, potentially leading to improved performance in areas such as fuel cells, chemical synthesis, and other catalytic processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，包括以Pt为基础的系统。近表面合金（NSAs）的稳定性可以通过一个两步过程来评估，该过程考虑了真空组成和氢吸附效应。

表面偏析趋势可以通过比较溶质的偏析能与纯溶质和纯主体金属之间的氢结合能差来估计。这种方法有助于预测在特定条件下是否会发生氢诱导偏析。

在实际的NSAs中，可能会出现与理想模型的偏差。例如，亚表面合金中的一些溶质原子可能会更深地偏析到主体金属中。然而，这些偏差通常不会显著改变在理想模型中观察到的吸附剂行为的主要趋势。

双金属催化剂的结构构型可能会根据热力学偏好和反应条件而变化。这种可变性可能导致在各种应用中表现出不同的催化性能。尽管与理想结构存在偏差，实验研究表明，非理想NSAs仍然可以表现出与理论预测相符的显著改变的催化活性。

这些发现对催化性能和表现有重要影响。通过理解和控制影响稳定性、偏析和结构构型的因素，研究人员可以为特定应用设计更有效的双金属催化剂。这种方法允许定制催化性能，潜在地可以在燃料电池、化学合成和其他催化过程等领域提高性能。
