[1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

[2] "If, for example, Eseg is positive, then in vacuum the solute will be found in the subsurface layers of the host. Further, if H binds more strongly to the host than to the solute, surface hydrogen will not attract the solute to the surface, and no hydrogen-induced segregation will occur."

[3] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

[4] "In other cases, the total coverage of solute in the surface region may differ from one monolayer, leading to different types of subsurface alloy structures."

[5] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, including Pt-based systems. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step process that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects.

For Pt-based systems, if the segregation energy is positive, the solute tends to remain in subsurface layers. Hydrogen-induced segregation is prevented if hydrogen binds more strongly to the host (Pt) than to the solute. However, real NSAs may deviate from idealized models, with solutes potentially segregating deeper into the host or varying in total coverage.

These structural variations can lead to different types of subsurface alloy structures. Despite these deviations, the main trends in adsorbate behavior generally remain consistent. This suggests that while the exact configuration may vary, the overall catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloys are relatively robust across different structures.

The implications for catalytic properties and performance are that these bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems, can maintain their designed functionality even with some structural variations. This robustness allows for potentially wider application in various catalytic processes, as the desired properties can be achieved across a range of non-ideal structures that may form under different reaction conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，包括以铂为基础的体系。近表面合金(NSAs)的稳定性可以通过考虑真空组成和氢吸附效应的两步过程来评估。

对于以铂为基础的体系，如果偏析能为正，溶质倾向于留在亚表面层。如果氢与主体(铂)的结合比与溶质的结合更强，则可以防止氢诱导的偏析。然而，实际的NSAs可能偏离理想化模型，溶质可能更深地偏析到主体中，或在总覆盖率上有所变化。

这些结构变化可能导致不同类型的亚表面合金结构。尽管存在这些偏差，吸附质行为的主要趋势通常保持一致。这表明，虽然确切的构型可能会变化，但铂基合金的整体催化性能在不同结构中相对稳定。

对催化性能的影响是，这些双金属催化剂，特别是铂基系统，即使在一些结构变化的情况下也能保持其设计的功能。这种稳健性允许在各种催化过程中有更广泛的应用潜力，因为在不同反应条件下可能形成的一系列非理想结构中都可以实现所需的性能。
