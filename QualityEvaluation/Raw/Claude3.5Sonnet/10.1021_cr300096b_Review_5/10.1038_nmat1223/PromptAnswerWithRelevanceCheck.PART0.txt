[1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

[2] "We have found, for example, that the thermodynamics are favourable for hydrogen to pull substrate Pt atoms to the Au surface of the Au*/Pt overlayer NSA."

[3] "In general, Fig. 1 suggests that hydrogen will not induce surface segregation for most solute/host transition metal pairs, at least at low temperatures and pressures."

[4] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

[5] "Migration of solute atoms deeper into these subsurface alloys does reduce the calculated decrease in BEH compared with the pure host, but the decrease is still significant"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, including Pt-based systems. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step process that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects. 

For some systems like Au*/Pt overlayer NSAs, hydrogen can induce surface segregation by pulling Pt atoms to the surface. However, for most solute/host transition metal pairs, hydrogen-induced surface segregation is not expected at low temperatures and pressures.

Real NSAs may deviate from idealized models. In some cases, solute atoms in subsurface alloys may segregate deeper into the host metal. This migration can affect the hydrogen binding energy (BEH), but the change in BEH compared to the pure host metal is still significant.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The structural configuration of the NSA affects the binding energy of hydrogen and other adsorbates, which in turn influences catalytic activity and selectivity. The stability of the NSA structure under reaction conditions is crucial for maintaining desired catalytic properties over time.

For Pt-based systems, such as Pt-3d alloys, the specific arrangement of atoms in the near-surface region can lead to unique electronic properties that modify adsorbate binding strengths and activation barriers. This allows for the design of catalysts with tailored properties for various applications, such as fuel cells, hydrogenation reactions, or hydrogen storage and separation.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural effects is essential for rational catalyst design, as it allows researchers to predict and control the surface composition and properties of bimetallic catalysts under relevant reaction conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，包括基于Pt的系统。近表面合金（NSAs）的稳定性可以通过考虑真空组成和氢吸附效应的两步过程来评估。

对于某些系统，如Au*/Pt覆盖层NSAs，氢可以通过将Pt原子拉到表面来诱导表面偏析。然而，对于大多数溶质/宿主过渡金属对，在低温和低压下不会发生氢诱导的表面偏析。

实际的NSAs可能会偏离理想化模型。在某些情况下，亚表面合金中的溶质原子可能会更深地偏析到宿主金属中。这种迁移可能会影响氢结合能（BEH），但与纯宿主金属相比，BEH的变化仍然显著。

这些因素对催化性能和表现有重要影响。NSA的结构构型影响氢和其他吸附质的结合能，进而影响催化活性和选择性。在反应条件下NSA结构的稳定性对于长期保持所需的催化性能至关重要。

对于基于Pt的系统，如Pt-3d合金，近表面区域原子的特定排列可以导致独特的电子性质，从而改变吸附质结合强度和活化能垒。这允许设计具有针对各种应用（如燃料电池、加氢反应或氢存储和分离）的定制性能的催化剂。

理解这些热力学偏好和结构效应对于理性催化剂设计至关重要，因为它允许研究人员在相关反应条件下预测和控制双金属催化剂的表面组成和性质。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The stability of these catalysts can be assessed through a two-step process that considers both vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects. 

Surface segregation tendencies are estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and host metals. This comparison helps predict whether hydrogen will induce surface segregation under specific conditions.

In real near-surface alloys (NSAs), the structural configuration may deviate from idealized models. Solute atoms in subsurface alloys may segregate deeper into the host metal, affecting the catalyst's properties. However, even with this migration, the decrease in hydrogen binding energy compared to the pure host metal remains significant, though reduced.

These factors have important implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications. The ability to predict and control surface composition and structure allows for the design of catalysts with specific properties, such as weak hydrogen binding combined with easy hydrogen activation. This unique combination can lead to improved catalytic performance in applications like selective hydrogenation reactions and fuel cell anodes.

Despite deviations from ideal structures, experimental studies have shown that non-ideal NSAs can still exhibit significantly modified catalytic activity in line with theoretical predictions.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. By understanding and controlling the factors that influence stability, segregation, and structural configuration, researchers can design more effective bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. This approach allows for the tailoring of catalytic properties, potentially leading to improved performance in areas such as fuel cells, chemical synthesis, and other catalytic processes.

[2] "If, for example, Eseg is positive, then in vacuum the solute will be found in the subsurface layers of the host. Further, if H binds more strongly to the host than to the solute, surface hydrogen will not attract the solute to the surface, and no hydrogen-induced segregation will occur."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, including Pt-based systems. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step process that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects.

For Pt-based systems, if the segregation energy is positive, the solute tends to remain in subsurface layers. Hydrogen-induced segregation is prevented if hydrogen binds more strongly to the host (Pt) than to the solute. However, real NSAs may deviate from idealized models, with solutes potentially segregating deeper into the host or varying in total coverage.

These structural variations can lead to different types of subsurface alloy structures. Despite these deviations, the main trends in adsorbate behavior generally remain consistent. This suggests that while the exact configuration may vary, the overall catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based alloys are relatively robust across different structures.

The implications for catalytic properties and performance are that these bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-based systems, can maintain their designed functionality even with some structural variations. This robustness allows for potentially wider application in various catalytic processes, as the desired properties can be achieved across a range of non-ideal structures that may form under different reaction conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，包括以铂为基础的体系。近表面合金(NSAs)的稳定性可以通过考虑真空组成和氢吸附效应的两步过程来评估。

对于以铂为基础的体系，如果偏析能为正，溶质倾向于留在亚表面层。如果氢与主体(铂)的结合比与溶质的结合更强，则可以防止氢诱导的偏析。然而，实际的NSAs可能偏离理想化模型，溶质可能更深地偏析到主体中，或在总覆盖率上有所变化。

这些结构变化可能导致不同类型的亚表面合金结构。尽管存在这些偏差，吸附质行为的主要趋势通常保持一致。这表明，虽然确切的构型可能会变化，但铂基合金的整体催化性能在不同结构中相对稳定。

对催化性能的影响是，这些双金属催化剂，特别是铂基系统，即使在一些结构变化的情况下也能保持其设计的功能。这种稳健性允许在各种催化过程中有更广泛的应用潜力，因为在不同反应条件下可能形成的一系列非理想结构中都可以实现所需的性能。
