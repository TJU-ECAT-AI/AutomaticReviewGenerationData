[1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

[2] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host"

[3] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

[4] "Migration of solute atoms deeper into these subsurface alloys does reduce the calculated decrease in BEH compared with the pure host, but the decrease is still significant"

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The stability of these catalysts can be assessed through a two-step process that considers both vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects. 

Surface segregation tendencies are estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and host metals. This comparison helps predict whether hydrogen will induce surface segregation under specific conditions.

In real near-surface alloys (NSAs), the structural configuration may deviate from idealized models. Solute atoms in subsurface alloys may segregate deeper into the host metal, affecting the catalyst's properties. However, even with this migration, the decrease in hydrogen binding energy compared to the pure host metal remains significant, though reduced.

These factors have important implications for the catalytic properties and performance of bimetallic catalysts in various applications. The ability to predict and control surface composition and structure allows for the design of catalysts with specific properties, such as weak hydrogen binding combined with easy hydrogen activation. This unique combination can lead to improved catalytic performance in applications like selective hydrogenation reactions and fuel cell anodes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构配置，特别是在以铂为基础的系统中。这些催化剂的稳定性可以通过一个考虑真空组成和氢吸附效应的两步过程来评估。

表面偏析趋势可以通过比较溶质的偏析能与纯溶质和宿主金属之间的氢结合能差来估计。这种比较有助于预测在特定条件下氢是否会引起表面偏析。

在实际的近表面合金（NSAs）中，结构配置可能会偏离理想化模型。亚表面合金中的溶质原子可能会向宿主金属深处偏析，影响催化剂的性能。然而，即使发生这种迁移，与纯宿主金属相比，氢结合能的降低仍然显著，尽管有所减弱。

这些因素对双金属催化剂在各种应用中的催化性能和表现有重要影响。预测和控制表面组成和结构的能力允许设计具有特定性质的催化剂，例如弱氢结合与易氢活化相结合。这种独特的组合可以在选择性加氢反应和燃料电池阳极等应用中带来更好的催化性能。
