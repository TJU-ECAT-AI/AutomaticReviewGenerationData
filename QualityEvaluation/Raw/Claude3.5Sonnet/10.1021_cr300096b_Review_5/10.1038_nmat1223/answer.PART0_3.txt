[1] "The stability can be assessed using a simple, two-step procedure, first considering the composition in vacuum, and then accounting for the effects of hydrogen adsorption."

[2] "We find that a reliable estimate of the tendency of hydrogen to induce surface segregation can be made by comparing Eseg of the solute to the difference in the magnitudes of the hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and the pure host (BEHsol  BEHhost, where BEH is the energy change when atomic hydrogen is adsorbed from the gas phase onto the metal surface; see Fig. 1)."

[3] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

[4] "We have found that these possible deviations from our idealized NSA structures do not substantially affect the main trends in adsorbate behaviour presented below (some experimental studies have already shown significantly modified catalytic activity, along the lines of our theoretical predictions, even on non-ideal NSAs10,11). However, the deviations from the idealized cases do have a quantitative effect on the properties of adsorbates on these NSAs."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, including Pt-based systems. The stability of near-surface alloys (NSAs) can be assessed through a two-step process that considers vacuum composition and hydrogen adsorption effects. 

Surface segregation tendencies are estimated by comparing the segregation energy of the solute to the difference in hydrogen binding energies between the pure solute and host metals. This approach helps predict whether hydrogen will induce surface segregation under specific conditions.

In real NSAs, deviations from idealized models can occur. For instance, solute atoms in subsurface alloys may segregate deeper into the host material. While these deviations don't substantially alter the main trends in adsorbate behavior, they can have quantitative effects on adsorbate properties.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. Even non-ideal NSAs have shown significantly modified catalytic activity in line with theoretical predictions. The ability to control and manipulate these properties through careful design of NSA composition and structure offers potential for tailoring catalysts for specific applications, such as hydrogen-related reactions or fuel cell anodes.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构配置有显著影响，包括铂基系统。近表面合金（NSAs）的稳定性可以通过一个两步过程来评估，该过程考虑了真空组成和氢吸附效应。

表面偏析倾向可以通过比较溶质的偏析能与纯溶质和主体金属之间的氢结合能差来估计。这种方法有助于预测在特定条件下氢是否会导致表面偏析。

在实际的NSAs中，可能会出现与理想模型的偏差。例如，亚表面合金中的溶质原子可能会更深地偏析到主体材料中。虽然这些偏差不会实质性地改变吸附质行为的主要趋势，但它们可能对吸附质性质产生定量影响。

这些因素对催化性能和表现有重要影响。即使是非理想的NSAs也已经显示出与理论预测一致的显著改变的催化活性。通过精心设计NSA的组成和结构来控制和操纵这些性质，为针对特定应用（如氢相关反应或燃料电池阳极）定制催化剂提供了潜力。
