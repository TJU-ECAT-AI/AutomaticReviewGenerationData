[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "The segregation structures in the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the first layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites 1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were the result of exchanging M atoms from the first layer and Pt atoms at the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The catalytic activity of alloys is highly dependent on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation. 

In Pt-based systems such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), surface segregation phenomena are observed. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This indicates that different Pt-based systems respond differently to reaction conditions.

The study investigates how oxygen adsorption affects surface segregation on stepped (211) surfaces. The segregation structures in core-shell configurations are formed by exchanging Pt atoms in the first layer with core atoms in the second layer, while in Pt3M systems, segregation occurs by exchanging M atoms from the first layer with Pt atoms in the second layer.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure, which are influenced by segregation phenomena, directly affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Understanding and controlling these processes can lead to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells and other electrochemical systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统中。合金的催化活性高度依赖于表面前2-3层的原子排列，而这受到表面偏析的影响。

在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(核心)，可以观察到表面偏析现象。然而，Pt/Ir(核心)结构即使在存在吸附氧的情况下也表现出反偏析行为。这表明不同的基于Pt的系统对反应条件的响应不同。

该研究调查了氧气吸附如何影响阶梯(211)表面上的表面偏析。核壳构型中的偏析结构是通过第一层的Pt原子与第二层的核心原子交换形成的，而在Pt3M系统中，偏析是通过第一层的M原子与第二层的Pt原子交换发生的。

这些发现对催化性能和性能有重要影响。受偏析现象影响的表面成分和结构直接影响催化剂的活性和选择性。理解和控制这些过程可以导致设计出更高效和稳定的催化剂，用于各种应用，如燃料电池和其他电化学系统。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The catalytic activity of alloys depends heavily on the arrangement of atoms in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation. 

In Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) structures. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure uniquely exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This variation in segregation behavior can significantly impact the catalytic properties and performance of these materials.

The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can further influence surface segregation. This interplay between surface composition, adsorbate interaction, and segregation behavior has important implications for catalytic performance in various applications. It affects the availability of active sites, electronic structure, and overall reactivity of the catalyst surface.

Understanding and controlling these phenomena are crucial for optimizing the design and performance of bimetallic catalysts for specific applications, such as fuel cells or other electrochemical processes. The ability to tailor surface composition through controlled segregation or antisegregation can lead to improved catalytic efficiency, stability, and selectivity in various catalytic reactions.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The arrangement of atoms in the first 2-3 layers of the catalyst surface dramatically affects catalytic activity. Surface segregation is a key phenomenon that impacts this arrangement.

In the studied Pt-based systems (Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co core-shell), surface segregation was observed. However, the Pt/Ir core-shell structure showed antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This suggests that different Pt-based alloys can have varying tendencies for surface segregation depending on their composition and structure.

The adsorption of oxygen on the surface can affect the surface segregation phenomenon. This interaction between adsorbates and surface segregation has implications for the catalytic properties of these materials, as it can alter the surface composition and structure during reactions.

The structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts can be complex, involving exchanges of atoms between different layers of the material. For core-shell structures, segregation involves exchanges between Pt atoms in the first layer and core atoms in the second layer. In Pt3M alloys, segregation occurs through exchanges between M atoms in the first layer and Pt atoms in the second layer.

These factors collectively influence the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in various applications. The ability to control and predict surface segregation and structural changes under reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in fuel cells and other catalytic applications.

在研究的基于Pt的系统（Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co核壳结构）中，观察到了表面偏析现象。然而，Pt/Ir核壳结构即使在存在吸附氧的情况下也表现出反偏析行为。这表明不同的基于Pt的合金可能因其成分和结构而具有不同的表面偏析倾向。

氧在表面的吸附可以影响表面偏析现象。吸附质与表面偏析之间的这种相互作用对这些材料的催化性能有影响，因为它可以在反应过程中改变表面成分和结构。

这些双金属催化剂的结构构型可能很复杂，涉及材料不同层之间的原子交换。对于核壳结构，偏析涉及第一层的Pt原子和第二层的核心原子之间的交换。在Pt3M合金中，偏析通过第一层的M原子和第二层的Pt原子之间的交换发生。

这些因素共同影响基于Pt的双金属催化剂在各种应用中的催化性能。在反应条件下控制和预测表面偏析和结构变化的能力对于优化燃料电池和其他催化应用中的催化剂性能和稳定性至关重要。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The catalytic activity of alloys is heavily dependent on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation phenomena. In Pt-based systems such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), surface segregation is observed, indicating a tendency for certain atoms to migrate to the surface. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen.

These structural changes have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and atomic arrangement directly influence the catalyst's ability to adsorb reactants, facilitate electron transfer, and promote desired reactions. For instance, the presence of certain atoms at the surface can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst, altering its binding strength with reactants and intermediates. This, in turn, can affect reaction rates, selectivity, and overall catalytic efficiency.

Furthermore, the stability of these surface structures under reaction conditions is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time. The fact that oxygen adsorption can influence segregation behavior suggests that the catalyst surface may dynamically restructure during reactions, potentially leading to changes in activity or selectivity over time.

Understanding these phenomena is essential for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells, where Pt-based catalysts are commonly used for the oxygen reduction reaction. By tailoring the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, it may be possible to optimize their performance for specific reactions and operating conditions.

这些结构变化对催化性能和表现有重要影响。表面组成和原子排列直接影响催化剂吸附反应物、促进电子转移和促进所需反应的能力。例如，某些原子在表面的存在可以改变催化剂的电子结构，改变其与反应物和中间体的结合强度。这反过来可能影响反应速率、选择性和整体催化效率。

此外，这些表面结构在反应条件下的稳定性对于长期保持催化性能至关重要。氧气吸附可以影响偏析行为的事实表明，催化剂表面可能在反应过程中动态重构，可能导致活性或选择性随时间发生变化。

理解这些现象对于设计更高效和稳定的催化剂至关重要，特别是在燃料电池等应用中，其中基于Pt的催化剂常用于氧还原反应。通过调整双金属催化剂的组成和结构，可能优化它们在特定反应和操作条件下的性能。
