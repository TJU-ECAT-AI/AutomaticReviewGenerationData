[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "The segregation structures in the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the first layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites 1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were the result of exchanging M atoms from the first layer and Pt atoms at the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The arrangement of atoms in the first 2-3 layers of the catalyst surface dramatically affects catalytic activity. Surface segregation is a key phenomenon that impacts this arrangement.

In the studied Pt-based systems (Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co core-shell), surface segregation was observed. However, the Pt/Ir core-shell structure showed antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This suggests that different Pt-based alloys can have varying tendencies for surface segregation depending on their composition and structure.

The adsorption of oxygen on the surface can affect the surface segregation phenomenon. This interaction between adsorbates and surface segregation has implications for the catalytic properties of these materials, as it can alter the surface composition and structure during reactions.

The structural configuration of these bimetallic catalysts can be complex, involving exchanges of atoms between different layers of the material. For core-shell structures, segregation involves exchanges between Pt atoms in the first layer and core atoms in the second layer. In Pt3M alloys, segregation occurs through exchanges between M atoms in the first layer and Pt atoms in the second layer.

These factors collectively influence the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in various applications. The ability to control and predict surface segregation and structural changes under reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in fuel cells and other catalytic applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。催化剂表面前2-3层原子的排列对催化活性有显著影响。表面偏析是影响这种排列的一个关键现象。

在研究的基于Pt的系统（Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co核壳结构）中，观察到了表面偏析现象。然而，Pt/Ir核壳结构即使在存在吸附氧的情况下也表现出反偏析行为。这表明不同的基于Pt的合金可能因其成分和结构而具有不同的表面偏析倾向。

氧在表面的吸附可以影响表面偏析现象。吸附质与表面偏析之间的这种相互作用对这些材料的催化性能有影响，因为它可以在反应过程中改变表面成分和结构。

这些双金属催化剂的结构构型可能很复杂，涉及材料不同层之间的原子交换。对于核壳结构，偏析涉及第一层的Pt原子和第二层的核心原子之间的交换。在Pt3M合金中，偏析通过第一层的M原子和第二层的Pt原子之间的交换发生。

这些因素共同影响基于Pt的双金属催化剂在各种应用中的催化性能。在反应条件下控制和预测表面偏析和结构变化的能力对于优化燃料电池和其他催化应用中的催化剂性能和稳定性至关重要。
