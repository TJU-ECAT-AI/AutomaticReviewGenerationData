[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Therefore, it is important to characterize the surface atomic distribution of catalytic alloys and to elucidate the effect of segregation on surface structure."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The catalytic activity of alloys depends heavily on the arrangement of atoms in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation. 

In Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys, surface segregation is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) structures. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure uniquely exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This variation in segregation behavior can significantly impact the catalytic properties and performance of these materials.

The presence of adsorbates, such as oxygen, can further influence surface segregation. This interplay between surface composition, adsorbate interaction, and segregation behavior has important implications for catalytic performance in various applications. It affects the availability of active sites, electronic structure, and overall reactivity of the catalyst surface.

Understanding and controlling these phenomena are crucial for optimizing the design and performance of bimetallic catalysts for specific applications, such as fuel cells or other electrochemical processes. The ability to tailor surface composition through controlled segregation or antisegregation can lead to improved catalytic efficiency, stability, and selectivity in various catalytic reactions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统中。合金的催化活性很大程度上取决于表面前2-3层原子的排列，而这受到表面偏析的影响。

在基于铂的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中，Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(核心)结构中观察到表面偏析。然而，Pt/Ir(核心)结构独特地表现出反偏析行为，即使在有吸附氧存在的情况下也是如此。这种偏析行为的变化可能会显著影响这些材料的催化性能。

吸附物（如氧）的存在可以进一步影响表面偏析。表面组成、吸附物相互作用和偏析行为之间的这种相互作用对各种应用中的催化性能有重要影响。它影响催化剂表面活性位点的可用性、电子结构和整体反应活性。

理解和控制这些现象对于优化双金属催化剂在特定应用（如燃料电池或其他电化学过程）中的设计和性能至关重要。通过控制偏析或反偏析来调整表面组成的能力可以提高各种催化反应中的催化效率、稳定性和选择性。
