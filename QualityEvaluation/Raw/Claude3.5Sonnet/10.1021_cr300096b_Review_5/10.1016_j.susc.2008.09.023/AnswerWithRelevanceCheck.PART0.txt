          [1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "The segregation structures in the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the first layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites 1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were the result of exchanging M atoms from the first layer and Pt atoms at the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. The catalytic activity of these alloys depends dramatically on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation phenomena.

In Pt-based systems like Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), surface segregation is commonly observed. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure uniquely exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This variation in segregation behavior can significantly impact the catalytic properties and performance of these materials.

The study investigates surface segregation on stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by oxygen adsorption. In core-shell structures, segregation involves exchanges between Pt atoms in the first layer and core atoms in the second layer. For Pt3M alloys, segregation occurs through exchanges between M atoms in the first layer and Pt atoms in the second layer.

These factors collectively influence the catalytic properties and performance of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts in various applications. The ability to control and predict surface segregation and structural changes under reaction conditions is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance and stability in fuel cells and other catalytic applications. Understanding and controlling these phenomena are essential for designing more efficient and stable catalysts, as they affect the availability of active sites, electronic structure, and overall reactivity of the catalyst surface.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。这些合金的催化活性在很大程度上取决于表面前2-3层原子的排列，而这受到表面偏析现象的影响。

在基于Pt的系统（如Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co核壳结构）中，通常观察到表面偏析现象。然而，Pt/Ir核壳结构独特地表现出反偏析行为，即使在存在吸附氧的情况下也是如此。这种偏析行为的变化可能会显著影响这些材料的催化性能。

该研究调查了阶梯(211)表面上的表面偏析现象，以及它如何受到氧气吸附的影响。在核壳结构中，偏析涉及第一层的Pt原子和第二层的核心原子之间的交换。对于Pt3M合金，偏析通过第一层的M原子和第二层的Pt原子之间的交换发生。

这些因素共同影响基于Pt的双金属催化剂在各种应用中的催化性能。在反应条件下控制和预测表面偏析和结构变化的能力对于优化燃料电池和其他催化应用中的催化剂性能和稳定性至关重要。理解和控制这些现象对设计更高效和稳定的催化剂至关重要，因为它们影响催化剂表面活性位点的可用性、电子结构和整体反应活性。
