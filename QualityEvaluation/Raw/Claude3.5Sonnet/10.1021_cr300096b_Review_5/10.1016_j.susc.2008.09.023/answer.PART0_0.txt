[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "The segregation structures in the core-shell structure were obtained exchanging Pt atoms of the first layer and core atoms of the second layer through any of sites 1 to 3, whereas for the Pt3M system the segregation structures were the result of exchanging M atoms from the first layer and Pt atoms at the second layer through sites 1 or 3 [23]."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The catalytic activity of alloys is highly dependent on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation. 

In Pt-based systems such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), surface segregation phenomena are observed. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. This indicates that different Pt-based systems respond differently to reaction conditions.

The study investigates how oxygen adsorption affects surface segregation on stepped (211) surfaces. The segregation structures in core-shell configurations are formed by exchanging Pt atoms in the first layer with core atoms in the second layer, while in Pt3M systems, segregation occurs by exchanging M atoms from the first layer with Pt atoms in the second layer.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure, which are influenced by segregation phenomena, directly affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Understanding and controlling these processes can lead to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells and other electrochemical systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统中。合金的催化活性高度依赖于表面前2-3层的原子排列，而这受到表面偏析的影响。

在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(核心)，可以观察到表面偏析现象。然而，Pt/Ir(核心)结构即使在存在吸附氧的情况下也表现出反偏析行为。这表明不同的基于Pt的系统对反应条件的响应不同。

该研究调查了氧气吸附如何影响阶梯(211)表面上的表面偏析。核壳构型中的偏析结构是通过第一层的Pt原子与第二层的核心原子交换形成的，而在Pt3M系统中，偏析是通过第一层的M原子与第二层的Pt原子交换发生的。

这些发现对催化性能和性能有重要影响。受偏析现象影响的表面成分和结构直接影响催化剂的活性和选择性。理解和控制这些过程可以导致设计出更高效和稳定的催化剂，用于各种应用，如燃料电池和其他电化学系统。
