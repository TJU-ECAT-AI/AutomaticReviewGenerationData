[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Therefore, it is important to characterize the surface atomic distribution of catalytic alloys and to elucidate the effect of segregation on surface structure."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The catalytic activity of alloys is heavily dependent on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation. This phenomenon is particularly important in stepped surfaces, such as (211), and can be further influenced by the adsorption of species like oxygen.

In Pt-based systems, such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core) structures, surface segregation is commonly observed. However, some systems like Pt/Ir(core) may exhibit anti-segregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen. These differences in segregation behavior can significantly affect the catalytic properties and performance of these materials in various applications.

The structural configuration and surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, as influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions, play a crucial role in determining their catalytic properties. Understanding and controlling these factors is essential for optimizing the performance of Pt-based catalysts in applications such as fuel cells and other electrochemical processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于铂的系统中。合金的催化活性在很大程度上取决于表面前2-3层的原子排列，而这又受到表面偏析的影响。这种现象在台阶表面（如(211)表面）上尤为重要，并且可能会进一步受到氧等物种吸附的影响。

在基于铂的系统中，如Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(核心)结构，通常可以观察到表面偏析。然而，某些系统如Pt/Ir(核心)可能表现出反偏析行为，即使在存在吸附氧的情况下也是如此。这些偏析行为的差异可能会显著影响这些材料在各种应用中的催化性能。

双金属催化剂的结构构型和表面成分，受热力学偏好和反应条件的影响，在决定其催化性能方面起着关键作用。理解和控制这些因素对于优化基于铂的催化剂在燃料电池和其他电化学过程等应用中的性能至关重要。
