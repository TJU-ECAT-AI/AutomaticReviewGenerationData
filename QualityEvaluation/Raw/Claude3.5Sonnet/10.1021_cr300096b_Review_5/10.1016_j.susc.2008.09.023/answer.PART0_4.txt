[1] "For alloys, it has been reported that catalytic activity depends dramatically on how the atoms arrange in the first 23 layers of the catalyst surface [912] and it is influenced by the surface segregation phenomenon."

[2] "Therefore, it is important to characterize the surface atomic distribution of catalytic alloys and to elucidate the effect of segregation on surface structure."

[3] "In this work, we investigate the surface segregation phenomenon carried out in stepped (211) surfaces and how it is affected by the adsorption of oxygen."

[4] "Surface segregation phenomena is observed in Pt3Co, Pt3Ir and Pt/Co(core) systems. The Pt/Ir(core) structure was the only one, among the studied systems, that showed antisegregation behavior even in presence of oxygen adsorbed."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. The catalytic activity of alloys is heavily dependent on the atomic arrangement in the first 2-3 surface layers, which is affected by surface segregation phenomena. In Pt-based systems such as Pt3Co, Pt3Ir, and Pt/Co(core), surface segregation is observed, indicating a tendency for certain atoms to migrate to the surface. However, the Pt/Ir(core) structure exhibits antisegregation behavior, even in the presence of adsorbed oxygen.

These structural changes have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and atomic arrangement directly influence the catalyst's ability to adsorb reactants, facilitate electron transfer, and promote desired reactions. For instance, the presence of certain atoms at the surface can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst, altering its binding strength with reactants and intermediates. This, in turn, can affect reaction rates, selectivity, and overall catalytic efficiency.

Furthermore, the stability of these surface structures under reaction conditions is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time. The fact that oxygen adsorption can influence segregation behavior suggests that the catalyst surface may dynamically restructure during reactions, potentially leading to changes in activity or selectivity over time.

Understanding these phenomena is essential for designing more efficient and stable catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells, where Pt-based catalysts are commonly used for the oxygen reduction reaction. By tailoring the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, it may be possible to optimize their performance for specific reactions and operating conditions.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。合金的催化活性严重依赖于表面前2-3层的原子排列，而这又受到表面偏析现象的影响。在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt3Co、Pt3Ir和Pt/Co(核)，观察到表面偏析现象，表明某些原子倾向于迁移到表面。然而，Pt/Ir(核)结构即使在存在吸附氧的情况下也表现出反偏析行为。

这些结构变化对催化性能和表现有重要影响。表面组成和原子排列直接影响催化剂吸附反应物、促进电子转移和促进所需反应的能力。例如，某些原子在表面的存在可以改变催化剂的电子结构，改变其与反应物和中间体的结合强度。这反过来可能影响反应速率、选择性和整体催化效率。

此外，这些表面结构在反应条件下的稳定性对于长期保持催化性能至关重要。氧气吸附可以影响偏析行为的事实表明，催化剂表面可能在反应过程中动态重构，可能导致活性或选择性随时间发生变化。

理解这些现象对于设计更高效和稳定的催化剂至关重要，特别是在燃料电池等应用中，其中基于Pt的催化剂常用于氧还原反应。通过调整双金属催化剂的组成和结构，可能优化它们在特定反应和操作条件下的性能。
