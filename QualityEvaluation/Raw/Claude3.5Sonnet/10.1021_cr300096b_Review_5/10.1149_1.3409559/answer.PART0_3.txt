The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly in ternary alloy systems. 

Ternary alloys demonstrate a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces. This surface segregation phenomenon has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance.

The presence of the Pt monolayer on the surface leads to weaker binding strengths of O and OH species compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This weakened binding suggests enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in ternary alloys.

Additionally, the Pt-skin surfaces of certain ternary alloys exhibit improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This enhanced stability is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time in various applications.

These findings highlight how the structural configuration and surface composition of Pt-based alloy catalysts, influenced by thermodynamic preferences, can significantly impact their catalytic properties and performance in applications such as fuel cells.

文献提供了关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响基于Pt的双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型的见解，特别是在三元合金系统中。

三元合金表现出强烈的Pt表面偏析倾向，导致在其表面形成Pt单层。这种表面偏析现象对催化性能和表现有重要影响。

表面Pt单层的存在导致O和OH物种的结合强度相对于双金属合金表面更弱。这种减弱的结合强度表明三元合金对氧还原反应(ORR)的催化活性有所提高。

此外，某些三元合金的Pt皮层表面对合金表面Pt原子的溶解表现出更好的电化学稳定性。这种增强的稳定性对于在各种应用中长期保持催化性能至关重要。

这些发现强调了基于Pt的合金催化剂的结构构型和表面组成（受热力学偏好影响）如何能显著影响它们在燃料电池等应用中的催化性能和表现。
