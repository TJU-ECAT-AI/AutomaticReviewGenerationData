Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In Pt-based ternary alloys, there is a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on the surface. This surface segregation affects the catalytic properties by weakening the binding strengths of O and OH on the surface, which can lead to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the Pt-skin surfaces formed through this segregation process demonstrate improved electrochemical stability, particularly in resisting the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These effects have important implications for the catalytic performance and durability of these materials in various applications, especially in fuel cell technologies where ORR activity and catalyst stability are crucial factors.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。在基于Pt的三元合金中，存在强烈的Pt表面偏析趋势，导致表面形成Pt单层。这种表面偏析通过削弱表面O和OH的结合强度影响催化性能，与双金属合金表面相比，可能导致氧还原反应(ORR)活性的提高。此外，通过这种偏析过程形成的Pt皮层表面表现出改善的电化学稳定性，特别是在抵抗Pt原子从合金表面溶解方面。这些效应对这些材料在各种应用中的催化性能和耐久性有重要影响，尤其是在燃料电池技术中，ORR活性和催化剂稳定性是关键因素。

The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly ternary alloys. These factors have significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation: Ternary alloys show a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces. This segregation behavior affects the structural configuration of the catalyst.

2. Binding strengths: The presence of the Pt monolayer on the surface leads to weaker binding strengths of O and OH species in ternary alloys compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This change in binding strength suggests enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

3. Stability: The Pt-skin surfaces of certain ternary alloys demonstrate improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This enhanced stability is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time.

These findings indicate that the thermodynamic preferences for surface segregation and the resulting structural configuration of Pt-based ternary alloys can lead to improved catalytic properties, including enhanced ORR activity and increased electrochemical stability. These characteristics make such alloys promising candidates for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where ORR catalysts play a critical role.

The literature discusses how thermodynamic preferences influence the stability and surface segregation of Pt-based alloy catalysts. In ternary alloys, there is a strong tendency for Pt to segregate to the surface, forming a Pt monolayer. This surface configuration affects the catalyst's properties in several ways:

1. Binding strength: The Pt monolayer on the surface leads to weaker binding of O and OH species compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This weaker binding is associated with enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

2. Stability: The Pt-skin surfaces of certain alloys (specific compositions not provided in the given excerpt) demonstrate improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface.

These findings suggest that the surface segregation of Pt in ternary alloys can lead to both improved catalytic activity and enhanced stability, which are crucial factors for catalyst performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells where the ORR is a key reaction.

The structural configuration resulting from surface segregation (Pt monolayer on the surface) appears to play a significant role in determining the catalyst's properties. This highlights the importance of understanding and controlling surface composition and structure in the design of effective Pt-based catalysts.
