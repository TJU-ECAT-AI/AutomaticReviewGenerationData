[1] "Ternary alloys exhibit a strong Pt surface segregation tendency leading to the formation of a Pt monolayer (ML) on their surfaces."

[2] "The presence of such top Pt ML induces relatively weaker binding strengths of O and OH in the ternary alloys, suggesting further activity enhancement for the ORR compared to the corresponding bimetallic alloy surfaces."

[3] "Moreover, the Pt-skin surfaces of and show an enhanced electrochemical stability with respect to the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems. In Pt-based ternary alloys, there is a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on the surface. This surface segregation affects the catalytic properties by weakening the binding strengths of O and OH on the surface, which can lead to enhanced activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. Additionally, the Pt-skin surfaces formed through this segregation process demonstrate improved electrochemical stability, particularly in resisting the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. These effects have important implications for the catalytic performance and durability of these materials in various applications, especially in fuel cell technologies where ORR activity and catalyst stability are crucial factors.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统中。在基于Pt的三元合金中，存在强烈的Pt表面偏析趋势，导致表面形成Pt单层。这种表面偏析通过削弱表面O和OH的结合强度影响催化性能，与双金属合金表面相比，可能导致氧还原反应(ORR)活性的提高。此外，通过这种偏析过程形成的Pt皮层表面表现出改善的电化学稳定性，特别是在抵抗Pt原子从合金表面溶解方面。这些效应对这些材料在各种应用中的催化性能和耐久性有重要影响，尤其是在燃料电池技术中，ORR活性和催化剂稳定性是关键因素。
