The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly ternary alloys. These factors have significant implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface segregation: Ternary alloys show a strong tendency for Pt surface segregation, resulting in the formation of a Pt monolayer on their surfaces. This segregation behavior affects the structural configuration of the catalyst.

2. Binding strengths: The presence of the Pt monolayer on the surface leads to weaker binding strengths of O and OH species in ternary alloys compared to bimetallic alloy surfaces. This change in binding strength suggests enhanced catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

3. Stability: The Pt-skin surfaces of certain ternary alloys demonstrate improved electrochemical stability against the dissolution of Pt atoms from the alloy surface. This enhanced stability is crucial for maintaining catalytic performance over time.

These findings indicate that the thermodynamic preferences for surface segregation and the resulting structural configuration of Pt-based ternary alloys can lead to improved catalytic properties, including enhanced ORR activity and increased electrochemical stability. These characteristics make such alloys promising candidates for various applications, particularly in fuel cell technologies where ORR catalysts play a critical role.

文献提供了关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响基于Pt的双金属催化剂（特别是三元合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构配置的见解。这些因素对其催化性能和应用表现有重要影响：

1. 表面偏析：三元合金表现出强烈的Pt表面偏析趋势，导致在其表面形成Pt单层。这种偏析行为影响了催化剂的结构配置。

2. 结合强度：表面Pt单层的存在导致三元合金中O和OH物种的结合强度较双金属合金表面更弱。这种结合强度的变化表明氧还原反应（ORR）的催化活性得到了提高。

3. 稳定性：某些三元合金的Pt皮层表面表现出对合金表面Pt原子溶解的改善的电化学稳定性。这种增强的稳定性对于长期维持催化性能至关重要。

这些发现表明，三元Pt基合金的表面偏析热力学偏好及由此产生的结构配置可以带来改善的催化性能，包括增强的ORR活性和提高的电化学稳定性。这些特性使得这类合金成为各种应用的有前景的候选者，特别是在ORR催化剂发挥关键作用的燃料电池技术中。
