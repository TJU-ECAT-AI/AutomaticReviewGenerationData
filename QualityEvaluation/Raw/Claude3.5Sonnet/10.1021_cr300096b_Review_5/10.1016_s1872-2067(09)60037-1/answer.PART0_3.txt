[1] "The growth of Fe overlayers on Pt(111) was attempted at different temperatures, and layer-like Fe films were successfully prepared at the substrate temperature of 487 K."

[2] "Our XPS results (Fig. 2(b)) indicated that the higher growth temperature at 487 K led to a stronger interaction between the first layer Fe and surface Pt, which would decease the interface energy and, consequently, favor the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."

[3] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[4] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[5] "Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K)."

[6] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys. The following factors play crucial roles:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote stronger interactions between Fe and Pt atoms, favoring layer growth and alloying. For example, Fe films form layer-like structures on Pt(111) at 487 K, while island growth is observed at lower temperatures.

2. Annealing conditions: Vacuum annealing at elevated temperatures induces inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt subsurface region, forming a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)). This process is driven by the thermodynamic preference for Pt surface segregation.

3. Oxidative environment: Annealing in oxygen at high temperatures (>700 K) causes outward diffusion of Fe, forming a FeO surface structure on Pt(111). This demonstrates the strong influence of the gaseous environment on surface segregation.

4. Reduction conditions: Mild reduction in hydrogen at lower temperatures (<650 K) can reduce surface FeO to metallic Fe, while higher temperature reduction (800 K) leads to Fe diffusion back into the subsurface region, restoring the Pt-skin structure.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Reversible modulation: The ability to switch between Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) structures by controlling treatment atmosphere and temperature allows for fine-tuning of catalyst surface properties for specific applications.

2. Electronic effects: The presence of subsurface Fe in Pt-skin structures can modify the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

3. Bifunctional catalysis: The formation of surface FeO structures enables bifunctional catalysis, where both Pt and Fe oxide sites can participate in reactions, as seen in CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams.

4. Stability considerations: The tendency for surface restructuring under different conditions highlights the importance of considering catalyst stability under reaction environments when designing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural transformations is crucial for rational design of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with optimized performance and stability for various catalytic applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-Fe合金）中。以下因素起着关键作用：

1. 温度：较高的温度可以促进Fe和Pt原子之间的更强相互作用，有利于层状生长和合金化。例如，在487 K下，Fe膜在Pt(111)上形成层状结构，而在较低温度下观察到岛状生长。

2. 退火条件：在高温下真空退火会导致Fe向Pt亚表面区域内部扩散，形成Pt皮层结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)）。这个过程是由Pt表面偏析的热力学偏好驱动的。

3. 氧化环境：在高温（>700 K）下的氧气中退火会导致Fe向外扩散，在Pt(111)上形成FeO表面结构。这表明气相环境对表面偏析有很强的影响。

4. 还原条件：在较低温度（<650 K）下用氢气进行温和还原可以将表面FeO还原为金属Fe，而在较高温度（800 K）下还原会导致Fe重新扩散到亚表面区域，恢复Pt皮层结构。

这些发现对催化性能和应用有重要影响：

1. 可逆调控：通过控制处理气氛和温度，可以在Fe/Pt(111)、Pt/Fe/Pt(111)和FeO/Pt(111)结构之间切换，从而可以为特定应用精细调节催化剂表面性质。

2. 电子效应：Pt皮层结构中亚表面Fe的存在可以改变表面Pt原子的电子性质，可能会增强某些反应的催化活性。

3. 双功能催化：表面FeO结构的形成使双功能催化成为可能，其中Pt和Fe氧化物位点都可以参与反应，如在富氢气流中的CO氧化反应中所见。

4. 稳定性考虑：在不同条件下表面重构的趋势突出了在设计特定应用的双金属催化剂时考虑催化剂在反应环境中稳定性的重要性。

理解这些热力学偏好和结构转变对于理性设计基于Pt的双金属催化剂至关重要，可以为各种催化应用优化性能和稳定性。
