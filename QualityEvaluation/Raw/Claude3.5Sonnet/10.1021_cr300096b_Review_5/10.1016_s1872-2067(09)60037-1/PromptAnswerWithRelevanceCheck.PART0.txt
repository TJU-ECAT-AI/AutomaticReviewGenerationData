[1] "The surface composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces are critical for their properties and performance."

[2] "Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt [6,10]. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations."

[3] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt."

[4] "The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[5] "Here, in an extension of our previous work [21], we present a detailed description of the preparation and transition of various Fe-Pt structures, including surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface. The strategy to modulate the Fe-Pt structures was by controlling of the temperature and gaseous environment."

[6] "The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled us to derive the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts."

[7] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[8] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[9] "The surface stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced, and gas-induced Fe surface segregation may occur under some circumstances, e.g. an oxidative environment [35,36]."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Surface composition and structure: The surface composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces are critical determinants of their properties and performance. Different preparation procedures and reaction conditions can result in various surface configurations, such as Fe overlayers in metallic or oxidized states on the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt.

2. Pt-skin structures: For certain reactions, like oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or other transition metals in the subsurface regions exhibit higher activity than pure Pt. This enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of surface Pt by subsurface Fe, which influences the adsorption and reaction characteristics of surface species.

3. Temperature and gaseous environment control: The structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be modulated by controlling temperature and gaseous environment. For example, Fe-Pt structures can be prepared and transitioned between surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface by manipulating these conditions.

4. Annealing effects: Annealing in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at elevated temperatures can induce inward diffusion of surface Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region, altering the surface composition and structure.

5. Oxidative environments: The stability of Pt-skin structures can be reduced in oxidative environments, potentially leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation.

6. Reversible modulation: By controlling treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature, it is possible to reversibly modulate Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces, creating different configurations such as Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111).

These findings have important implications for catalyst design, as they demonstrate the ability to control and manipulate surface structures to optimize catalytic properties and performance. Understanding the relationship between structure and catalytic properties enables the design of high-performance, low-cost catalysts for various applications.

[1] "The -Fe phase has been observed in thin Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) and other metallic substrates at RT and 500 K [2,10,29,30]. Thus, we suggest that the -Fe phase should form on Pt(111) under our growth conditions (300 and 487 K)."

[2] "Our XPS results (Fig. 2(b)) indicated that the higher growth temperature at 487 K led to a stronger interaction between the first layer Fe and surface Pt, which would decease the interface energy and, consequently, favor the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."

[3] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[4] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[5] "Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K)."

[6] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys. The stability and surface composition of these catalysts are highly dependent on temperature and environmental conditions.

In vacuum conditions, Fe tends to diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt at elevated temperatures, forming a Pt-skin structure. This is due to the lower surface energy of Pt compared to Fe, which thermodynamically favors Pt segregation to the surface.

However, in oxidative environments, Fe tends to segregate to the surface and form an oxide layer (FeO) at high temperatures. This is driven by the strong affinity of Fe for oxygen and the thermodynamic stability of iron oxides.

The growth temperature also plays a crucial role in determining the initial structure of the bimetallic surface. Higher growth temperatures lead to stronger interactions between Fe and Pt, favoring layer growth and potentially alloying.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)) can exhibit enhanced activity for certain reactions due to electronic modifications of surface Pt by subsurface Fe. The FeO/Pt(111) structure may be beneficial for reactions involving oxygen, such as CO oxidation.

The ability to reversibly modulate the surface structure between Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) by controlling treatment atmosphere and temperature provides a powerful means to tune catalytic properties for different applications. This structural flexibility allows for the optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions by selecting the most appropriate surface configuration.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在以铂为基础的系统（如铂-铁合金）中。这些催化剂的稳定性和表面组成高度依赖于温度和环境条件。

在真空条件下，铁倾向于在高温下扩散到铂的亚表面区域，形成铂皮层结构。这是由于铂的表面能较低，从热力学角度有利于铂偏析到表面。

然而，在氧化环境中，铁倾向于在高温下偏析到表面并形成氧化物层（FeO）。这是由铁对氧的强亲和力和氧化铁的热力学稳定性驱动的。

生长温度在决定双金属表面的初始结构方面也起着关键作用。较高的生长温度导致铁和铂之间的相互作用更强，有利于层状生长和可能的合金化。

这些结构变化对催化性能和表现有重要影响。铂皮层结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)）由于亚表面铁对表面铂的电子修饰，可能对某些反应表现出增强的活性。FeO/Pt(111)结构可能有利于涉及氧的反应，如CO氧化。

通过控制处理气氛和温度，可以在Fe/Pt(111)、Pt/Fe/Pt(111)和FeO/Pt(111)之间可逆地调节表面结构，这提供了一种强大的手段来调整不同应用的催化性能。这种结构灵活性允许通过选择最合适的表面构型来优化特定反应的催化剂性能。

[1] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR [4]."

[2] "The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons [13]. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[3] "The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres [21]."

[4] "From the Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K)."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Surface segregation: Under different reaction conditions, there is a tendency for one element to segregate to the surface. For example, in Pt-Fe systems, Fe tends to remain in the subsurface region under reducing conditions, forming a Pt-skin structure. However, under oxidizing conditions, Fe can be drawn to the surface to form FeO.

2. Structural configuration: The arrangement of atoms in the catalyst can be controlled by temperature and gas environment. For instance, high-temperature reduction can create a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)), while high-temperature oxidation can form a FeO surface structure.

3. Stability: The stability of different structures varies with temperature and reaction atmosphere. Pt-skin structures are stable under reducing conditions, while FeO surfaces form under oxidizing conditions.

4. Catalytic properties: The structural configuration greatly affects catalytic performance. Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe show higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) than pure Pt, with Fe49Pt51 alloys demonstrating 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR.

5. Electronic effects: The presence of subsurface Fe modifies the electronic structure of surface Pt atoms, influencing adsorption and reaction characteristics of surface species. This electronic modification contributes to the unique catalytic properties of Pt-skin surfaces.

6. Reversible transformation: The ability to reversibly control surface and subsurface structures through oxidation and reduction treatments allows for the design of catalysts with tunable properties for specific applications.

These findings highlight the importance of understanding and controlling the surface and near-surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts to optimize their performance in various catalytic applications.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys. The following factors play crucial roles:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures can promote stronger interactions between Fe and Pt atoms, favoring layer growth and alloying. For example, Fe films form layer-like structures on Pt(111) at 487 K, while island growth is observed at lower temperatures.

2. Annealing conditions: Vacuum annealing at elevated temperatures induces inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt subsurface region, forming a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)). This process is driven by the thermodynamic preference for Pt surface segregation.

3. Oxidative environment: Annealing in oxygen at high temperatures (>700 K) causes outward diffusion of Fe, forming a FeO surface structure on Pt(111). This demonstrates the strong influence of the gaseous environment on surface segregation.

4. Reduction conditions: Mild reduction in hydrogen at lower temperatures (<650 K) can reduce surface FeO to metallic Fe, while higher temperature reduction (800 K) leads to Fe diffusion back into the subsurface region, restoring the Pt-skin structure.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Reversible modulation: The ability to switch between Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) structures by controlling treatment atmosphere and temperature allows for fine-tuning of catalyst surface properties for specific applications.

2. Electronic effects: The presence of subsurface Fe in Pt-skin structures can modify the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

3. Bifunctional catalysis: The formation of surface FeO structures enables bifunctional catalysis, where both Pt and Fe oxide sites can participate in reactions, as seen in CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams.

4. Stability considerations: The tendency for surface restructuring under different conditions highlights the importance of considering catalyst stability under reaction environments when designing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural transformations is crucial for rational design of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with optimized performance and stability for various catalytic applications.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The literature provides insights into these influences, especially for the Fe-Pt system:

1. Temperature effects: At elevated temperatures (above 700 K) under vacuum conditions, Fe tends to diffuse inward from the surface into the Pt(111) subsurface region. This leads to the formation of a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)).

2. Oxidative environments: In the presence of oxygen at high temperatures (above 700 K), Fe tends to segregate to the surface and form an FeO structure. This demonstrates that oxidative conditions can reverse the inward diffusion of Fe observed under vacuum.

3. Reductive environments: Strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at high temperatures (e.g., 800 K) can produce the Pt-skin structure from a Fe/Pt(111) surface.

4. Reversible transformations: The structural configurations can be reversibly controlled by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. Three distinct structures - Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) - can be interconverted based on the treatment atmosphere and temperature.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition control: The ability to control surface composition through temperature and gas environment allows for tuning of catalytic properties.

2. Stability in different environments: The reversible nature of these transformations suggests that the catalyst structure may change during reactions, potentially affecting long-term stability and performance.

3. Oxidation state control: The ability to form either metallic or oxidized surface structures provides opportunities for optimizing catalytic performance in different types of reactions.

4. Subsurface modification: The Pt-skin structure with subsurface Fe can modify the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

5. Bifunctional catalysis: The ability to form surface FeO structures on Pt could be beneficial for reactions that require both metal and oxide functionalities.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and reaction-induced structural changes is crucial for designing high-performance and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells, chemical processing, and emissions control.
