          [1] "The surface composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces are critical for their properties and performance."

[2] "Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt [6,10]. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations."

[3] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt."

[4] "The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[5] "Here, in an extension of our previous work [21], we present a detailed description of the preparation and transition of various Fe-Pt structures, including surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface. The strategy to modulate the Fe-Pt structures was by controlling of the temperature and gaseous environment."

[6] "The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled us to derive the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts."

[7] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[8] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[9] "The surface stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced, and gas-induced Fe surface segregation may occur under some circumstances, e.g. an oxidative environment [35,36]."

[10] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

[11] "The -Fe phase has been observed in thin Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) and other metallic substrates at RT and 500 K [2,10,29,30]. Thus, we suggest that the -Fe phase should form on Pt(111) under our growth conditions (300 and 487 K)."

[12] "Our XPS results (Fig. 2(b)) indicated that the higher growth temperature at 487 K led to a stronger interaction between the first layer Fe and surface Pt, which would decease the interface energy and, consequently, favor the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."

[13] "Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K)."

[14] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR [4]."

[15] "The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons [13]. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[16] "The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres [21]."

[17] "From the Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K)."

[18] "The Fe 2p signal was almost unchanged until 700 K, and then it decreased rapidly with annealing temperature. The Fe 2p signal decreased to 39% on annealing the surface at 850 K for 6 min. The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. Key factors include:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures promote stronger Fe-Pt interactions, favoring layer growth and alloying. For example, Fe forms layer-like structures on Pt(111) at 487 K.

2. Annealing conditions: Vacuum annealing at high temperatures induces inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt subsurface, forming a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)).

3. Oxidative environments: High-temperature annealing in oxygen causes outward diffusion of Fe, forming FeO surface structures on Pt(111).

4. Reductive environments: Strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at high temperatures can produce Pt-skin structures from Fe/Pt(111) surfaces.

These factors have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition control: The ability to manipulate surface composition through temperature and gas environment allows for tuning of catalytic properties.

2. Electronic effects: Subsurface Fe in Pt-skin structures modifies the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

3. Reversible modulation: The ability to switch between Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) structures allows for fine-tuning of catalyst surface properties for specific applications.

4. Enhanced activity: Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe show higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt surface showed 25 times the ORR activity of pure Pt catalysts.

5. Stability considerations: The tendency for surface restructuring under different conditions highlights the importance of considering catalyst stability under reaction environments.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and structural transformations is crucial for rational design of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with optimized performance and stability for various catalytic applications.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。关键因素包括：

1. 温度：较高的温度促进Fe-Pt之间更强的相互作用，有利于层状生长和合金化。例如，Fe在487 K下在Pt(111)上形成层状结构。

2. 退火条件：高温真空退火导致Fe向Pt亚表面区域内扩散，形成Pt皮层结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)）。

3. 氧化环境：在氧气中高温退火导致Fe向外扩散，在Pt(111)上形成FeO表面结构。

4. 还原环境：在真空或H2中进行强还原可以从Fe/Pt(111)表面产生Pt皮层结构。

这些因素对催化性能和表现有重要影响：

1. 表面成分控制：通过温度和气体环境控制表面成分的能力允许调节催化性能。

2. 电子效应：Pt皮层结构中的亚表面Fe修改了表面Pt原子的电子性质，可能增强某些反应的催化活性。

3. 可逆调控：在Fe/Pt(111)、Pt/Fe/Pt(111)和FeO/Pt(111)结构之间切换的能力允许为特定应用精细调节催化剂表面性质。

4. 增强活性：具有亚表面Fe的Pt皮层结构在氧还原反应（ORR）中表现出比纯Pt更高的活性。例如，表面为100%Pt的Fe49Pt51合金在ORR中的活性是纯Pt催化剂的25倍。

5. 稳定性考虑：在不同条件下表面重构的趋势突出了考虑催化剂在反应环境中稳定性的重要性。

理解这些热力学偏好和结构转变对于理性设计具有优化性能和稳定性的基于Pt的双金属催化剂至关重要，可用于各种催化应用。
