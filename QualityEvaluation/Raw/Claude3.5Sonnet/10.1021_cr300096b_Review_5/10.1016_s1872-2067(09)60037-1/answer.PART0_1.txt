[1] "The -Fe phase has been observed in thin Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) and other metallic substrates at RT and 500 K [2,10,29,30]. Thus, we suggest that the -Fe phase should form on Pt(111) under our growth conditions (300 and 487 K)."

[2] "Our XPS results (Fig. 2(b)) indicated that the higher growth temperature at 487 K led to a stronger interaction between the first layer Fe and surface Pt, which would decease the interface energy and, consequently, favor the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111)."

[3] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[4] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[5] "Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K)."

[6] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-Fe alloys. The stability and surface composition of these catalysts are highly dependent on temperature and environmental conditions.

In vacuum conditions, Fe tends to diffuse into the subsurface region of Pt at elevated temperatures, forming a Pt-skin structure. This is due to the lower surface energy of Pt compared to Fe, which thermodynamically favors Pt segregation to the surface.

However, in oxidative environments, Fe tends to segregate to the surface and form an oxide layer (FeO) at high temperatures. This is driven by the strong affinity of Fe for oxygen and the thermodynamic stability of iron oxides.

The growth temperature also plays a crucial role in determining the initial structure of the bimetallic surface. Higher growth temperatures lead to stronger interactions between Fe and Pt, favoring layer growth and potentially alloying.

These structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)) can exhibit enhanced activity for certain reactions due to electronic modifications of surface Pt by subsurface Fe. The FeO/Pt(111) structure may be beneficial for reactions involving oxygen, such as CO oxidation.

The ability to reversibly modulate the surface structure between Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) by controlling treatment atmosphere and temperature provides a powerful means to tune catalytic properties for different applications. This structural flexibility allows for the optimization of catalyst performance for specific reactions by selecting the most appropriate surface configuration.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在以铂为基础的系统（如铂-铁合金）中。这些催化剂的稳定性和表面组成高度依赖于温度和环境条件。

在真空条件下，铁倾向于在高温下扩散到铂的亚表面区域，形成铂皮层结构。这是由于铂的表面能较低，从热力学角度有利于铂偏析到表面。

然而，在氧化环境中，铁倾向于在高温下偏析到表面并形成氧化物层（FeO）。这是由铁对氧的强亲和力和氧化铁的热力学稳定性驱动的。

生长温度在决定双金属表面的初始结构方面也起着关键作用。较高的生长温度导致铁和铂之间的相互作用更强，有利于层状生长和可能的合金化。

这些结构变化对催化性能和表现有重要影响。铂皮层结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)）由于亚表面铁对表面铂的电子修饰，可能对某些反应表现出增强的活性。FeO/Pt(111)结构可能有利于涉及氧的反应，如CO氧化。

通过控制处理气氛和温度，可以在Fe/Pt(111)、Pt/Fe/Pt(111)和FeO/Pt(111)之间可逆地调节表面结构，这提供了一种强大的手段来调整不同应用的催化性能。这种结构灵活性允许通过选择最合适的表面构型来优化特定反应的催化剂性能。
