[1] "The surface composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces are critical for their properties and performance."

[2] "Depending on the preparation procedures and reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxidized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt [6,10]. Different reactions can produce different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations."

[3] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt."

[4] "The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[5] "Here, in an extension of our previous work [21], we present a detailed description of the preparation and transition of various Fe-Pt structures, including surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface. The strategy to modulate the Fe-Pt structures was by controlling of the temperature and gaseous environment."

[6] "The controlled preparation of the various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled us to derive the relationship between the structure and catalytic properties, which would help the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts."

[7] "Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. The evolution of the surface composition and structure with annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM."

[8] "The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[9] "The surface stability of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced, and gas-induced Fe surface segregation may occur under some circumstances, e.g. an oxidative environment [35,36]."

[10] "Therefore, the three different surfaces of Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be prepared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Surface composition and structure: The surface composition and structure of bimetallic surfaces are critical determinants of their properties and performance. Different preparation procedures and reaction conditions can result in various surface configurations, such as Fe overlayers in metallic or oxidized states on the topmost surface or in the subsurface region of Pt.

2. Pt-skin structures: For certain reactions, like oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or other transition metals in the subsurface regions exhibit higher activity than pure Pt. This enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of surface Pt by subsurface Fe, which influences the adsorption and reaction characteristics of surface species.

3. Temperature and gaseous environment control: The structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts can be modulated by controlling temperature and gaseous environment. For example, Fe-Pt structures can be prepared and transitioned between surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface by manipulating these conditions.

4. Annealing effects: Annealing in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at elevated temperatures can induce inward diffusion of surface Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region, altering the surface composition and structure.

5. Oxidative environments: The stability of Pt-skin structures can be reduced in oxidative environments, potentially leading to gas-induced Fe surface segregation.

6. Reversible modulation: By controlling treatment atmosphere and annealing temperature, it is possible to reversibly modulate Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces, creating different configurations such as Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111).

These findings have important implications for catalyst design, as they demonstrate the ability to control and manipulate surface structures to optimize catalytic properties and performance. Understanding the relationship between structure and catalytic properties enables the design of high-performance, low-cost catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面组成和结构：双金属表面的组成和结构是决定其性能和表现的关键因素。不同的制备程序和反应条件可能导致各种表面构型，如在Pt的最外层表面或亚表面区域形成金属态或氧化态的Fe覆盖层。

2. Pt皮层结构：对于某些反应，如氧还原反应（ORR），具有亚表面Fe或其他过渡金属的Pt皮层结构表现出比纯Pt更高的活性。这种增强的催化性能归因于亚表面Fe对表面Pt电子结构的修饰，影响了表面物种的吸附和反应特性。

3. 温度和气相环境控制：可以通过控制温度和气相环境来调节双金属催化剂的结构构型。例如，通过操控这些条件，可以在Pt表面Fe、Pt表面Fe氧化物和Pt亚表面Fe之间准备和转变Fe-Pt结构。

4. 退火效应：在超高真空（UHV）中高温退火可以诱导表面Fe向Pt(111)亚表面区域的内向扩散，从而改变表面组成和结构。

5. 氧化环境：在氧化环境中，Pt皮层结构的稳定性可能降低，可能导致气体诱导的Fe表面偏析。

6. 可逆调制：通过控制处理气氛和退火温度，可以实现Pt(111)表面Fe结构的可逆调制，创造出不同的构型，如Fe/Pt(111)、Pt/Fe/Pt(111)和FeO/Pt(111)。

这些发现对催化剂设计有重要意义，因为它们展示了控制和操纵表面结构以优化催化性能的能力。理解结构与催化性能之间的关系，有助于为各种应用设计高性能、低成本的催化剂。
