[1] "For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface regions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR [4]."

[2] "The Pt-skin structures also showed high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons [13]. The unique catalytic properties of the Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction characteristics of the surface species [14,15]."

[3] "The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design and control of the surface structural configurations and needs information on the stability of the various structures at elevated temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres [21]."

[4] "From the Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K)."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications:

1. Surface segregation: Under different reaction conditions, there is a tendency for one element to segregate to the surface. For example, in Pt-Fe systems, Fe tends to remain in the subsurface region under reducing conditions, forming a Pt-skin structure. However, under oxidizing conditions, Fe can be drawn to the surface to form FeO.

2. Structural configuration: The arrangement of atoms in the catalyst can be controlled by temperature and gas environment. For instance, high-temperature reduction can create a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)), while high-temperature oxidation can form a FeO surface structure.

3. Stability: The stability of different structures varies with temperature and reaction atmosphere. Pt-skin structures are stable under reducing conditions, while FeO surfaces form under oxidizing conditions.

4. Catalytic properties: The structural configuration greatly affects catalytic performance. Pt-skin structures with subsurface Fe show higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) than pure Pt, with Fe49Pt51 alloys demonstrating 25 times the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR.

5. Electronic effects: The presence of subsurface Fe modifies the electronic structure of surface Pt atoms, influencing adsorption and reaction characteristics of surface species. This electronic modification contributes to the unique catalytic properties of Pt-skin surfaces.

6. Reversible transformation: The ability to reversibly control surface and subsurface structures through oxidation and reduction treatments allows for the design of catalysts with tunable properties for specific applications.

These findings highlight the importance of understanding and controlling the surface and near-surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts to optimize their performance in various catalytic applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于Pt的体系（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响：

1. 表面偏析：在不同的反应条件下，一种元素倾向于偏析到表面。例如，在Pt-Fe体系中，在还原条件下Fe倾向于保留在亚表面区域，形成Pt-皮层结构。然而，在氧化条件下，Fe可以被吸引到表面形成FeO。

2. 结构构型：催化剂中原子的排列可以通过温度和气体环境来控制。例如，高温还原可以创建Pt-皮层结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)），而高温氧化可以形成FeO表面结构。

3. 稳定性：不同结构的稳定性随温度和反应气氛而变化。Pt-皮层结构在还原条件下稳定，而FeO表面在氧化条件下形成。

4. 催化性能：结构构型极大地影响催化性能。具有亚表面Fe的Pt-皮层结构在氧还原反应（ORR）中表现出比纯Pt更高的活性，Fe49Pt51合金在ORR中的活性是纯Pt催化剂的25倍。

5. 电子效应：亚表面Fe的存在修改了表面Pt原子的电子结构，影响表面物种的吸附和反应特性。这种电子修饰贡献了Pt-皮层表面的独特催化性能。

6. 可逆转变：通过氧化和还原处理可逆控制表面和亚表面结构的能力，使得可以设计具有可调性能的催化剂以适应特定应用。

这些发现强调了理解和控制双金属催化剂表面和近表面组成和结构的重要性，以优化它们在各种催化应用中的性能。
