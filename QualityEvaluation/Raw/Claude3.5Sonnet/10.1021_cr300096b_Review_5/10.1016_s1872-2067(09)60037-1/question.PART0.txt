Abstract: Monolayer Fe films on Pt(111) and their derived structures under different environments were investigated by scanning tunneling 
microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The growth of monolayer Fe films was seen at 487 K. The surface 
composition and structure of the Fe/Pt(111) surface were monitored by XPS and STM during stepwise annealing under vacuum. Surface Fe 
was driven into the subsurface region during annealing above 800 K. This resulted in a Pt-skin surface of Pt/Fe/Pt(111). Oxidation of the 
Pt-skin structure in O2 produced a FeO surface structure, FeO/Pt(111). This was transformed into a surface Fe structure by mild reduction in 
H2 (600 K) and into subsurface Fe by further severe reduction (800 K). The transformation of surface Fe (FeO) and subsurface Fe in Pt(111) 
was reversible in cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. The results demonstrated the controlled preparation of various Fe-Pt surfaces. 
This can be important for the design of high-performance and low-cost catalysts.

Fe-Pt bimetallic structures have many important applica-
tions in physics and chemistry, such as magnetic recording 
[1,2] and heterogeneous catalysis [36]. The surface composi-
tion and structure of the bimetallic surfaces are critical for their 
properties and performance. For example, ultrathin Fe over-
layers on Pt substrates have been extensively investigated 
because of their importance in magnetism. The growth mode of 
Fe overlayers [2] and the resulting PtFe surface alloy structure 
[7] had significant effects on the surface magnetic properties. 
In catalysis, Pt modified with Fe often gave a superior catalytic 
performance at a lower cost than pure Pt and has been widely 
used in many industrial catalytic reactions and energy related 
processes [8,9]. Depending on the preparation procedures and 
reaction conditions, Fe overlayers with either metallic or oxi-
dized states may be present as the topmost surface or in the 
subsurface region of Pt [6,10]. Different reactions can produce 
different Fe-Pt surface structural configurations. 
For oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), Pt-skin structures 
with Fe or some other transition metals in the subsurface re-
gions showed a higher activity than pure Pt. For instance, 
Fe49Pt51 alloys with 100% Pt as the topmost layer had 25 times 
the activity of pure Pt catalysts in ORR [4]. It has been further 
shown that it was only the Pt-skin structures that was stable in 
the acidic electrochemical environment of ORR reactions, and 
Fe-Pt alloys with Pt-skin surfaces are more active than pure 
polycrystalline Pt [11,12]. The Pt-skin structures also showed 
high activity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of unsaturated 
hydrocarbons [13]. The unique catalytic properties of the 
Pt-skin surfaces were attributed to the modification of the 
electronic structure of the surface Pt by the subsurface Fe 
underneath, which influenced the adsorption and reaction 
characteristics of the surface species [14,15]. 
On the other hand, Fe oxides (by themselves or combined 
with Pt) are often active in reactions involving O2. The oxida-
tive dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene is 
industrially carried out over potassium-promoted Fe-oxide 
catalysts, and the Fe oxide centers were confirmed to be the 
active sites [9,16]. Fe-Pt catalysts have also been used in the 
preferential oxidation (PROX) of CO in excess H2, and a high 
selectivity of approximately 100% for CO oxidation was ob-
MA Teng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 2432 
 
tained at low temperatures (< 100 qC) [1719]. Many studies 
indicated that a bifunctional reaction mechanism was respon-
sible for the PROX reactions, and the surface Pt and surface Fe 
oxides work synergistically in CO oxidation [19,20]. 
The optimization of the performance of Fe-Pt structures in 
magnetism and catalysis places a high demand on the design 
and control of the surface structural configurations and needs 
information on the stability of the various structures at elevated 
temperatures and under different reaction atmospheres [21]. 
Here, in an extension of our previous work [21], we present a 
detailed description of the preparation and transition of various 
Fe-Pt structures, including surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe oxides 
on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface. The strategy to 
modulate the Fe-Pt structures was by controlling of the tem-
perature and gaseous environment. First, surface Fe overlayers 
were deposited on Pt(111) either as 2-dimensional (2D) Fe 
films or 3D Fe islands. Then, it was shown that three Fe-Pt 
surface structures, including surface Fe on Pt, surface Fe ox-
ides on Pt, and subsurface Fe on the Pt surface, were mutually 
transformable by annealing in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and 
well defined atmospheres. The controlled preparation of the 
various Fe-Pt surface structures enabled us to derive the rela-
tionship between the structure and catalytic properties, which 
would help the design of high-performance and low-cost 
catalysts. 
1  Experimental 
All experiments were carried out in a three-chamber UHV 
system with a base pressure of 2.0 × 108 Pa. The system is 
equipped with various surface techniques, including X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron 
spectroscopy (UPS), ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS), high 
resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, variable tem-
perature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and photo-
emission electron microscopy. The detailed description of the 
instruments has been given elsewhere [22]. 
The Pt(111) sample was held in a Mo sample holder and had 
a type K thermocouple welded on the backside. The sample can 
be heated to 1100 K by resistive heating. The sample surface 
was cleaned by cycles of oxidation at 800 K under 1.1 × 104 Pa 
O2, 2.0 keV Ar+ sputtering with a target current at 20 μA, and 
UHV annealing at 1000 K until a clean surface was achieved. 
The Fe source was made up of a coil of 0.1 mm diameter Fe 
wire (purity 99.998%, Johnson Matthey) wrapped around a 0.5 
mm diameter tungsten filament (99.95% purity, Johnson Mat-
they). Before Fe deposition, the Fe source was degassed for 
more than 10 min. During deposition, the vacuum was better 
than 1.2 u 107 Pa. The Fe flux was controlled by the current 
through the tungsten filament. It was 0.100.12 monolayer 
(ML) per minute as determined by STM. The gases of O2 and 
H2 (purity of 99.999%) were dosed directly into the vacuum 
system by backfilling using leak valves. 
STM images were acquired in a constant current mode at 
room temperature (RT) using a W tip. XPS measurements were 
performed with Mg K (1253.6 eV) using a pass energy of 30 
eV. All the binding energy (BE) values were calibrated by the 
Pt 4f7/2 peak at 71.0 eV for the clean Pt(111) surface. ISS 
spectra were measured at a partial pressure of He of 5.0 u 106 
Pa with 1.0 keV primary energy. The ion incidence angle was 
set at 50q with respect to the sample surface. 
2  Results and discussion 
2.1  Monolayer Fe on Pt(111) 
The growth of Fe overlayers on Pt(111) was attempted at 
different temperatures, and layer-like Fe films were success-
fully prepared at the substrate temperature of 487 K. Fe over-
layers with increasing coverage were consecutively grown on 
Pt(111) at 487 K. The surface morphology shown by STM is 
shown in Fig. 1. For example, at a coverage of 0.7 ML Fe, 
Pt(111) terraces were partially covered by flat and continuous 
Fe islands, and the depth profile analysis of the 2D islands gave 
the monolayer height (0.20 nm, Fig. 1(a)). Surface steps were 
preferentially covered by the Fe islands, while leaving small 
parts of the terrace uncovered. When the Fe coverage was 
increased to around 1.0 ML (Fig. 1(b)), all the Pt(111) terraces 
were fully covered by monolayer Fe overlayers. In addition, 
some irregular second layer Fe islands sitting on top of the first 
Fe layer were observed, which may be due to a little excess 
deposited Fe over 1 ML. 
On the surfaces of the monolayer Fe structures, a network of 
fine lines can be discerned in the STM images (Figs. 1(a) and 
(b)). For a closer inspection of this structure, a smaller region in 
Fig. 1(b) was selected and observed in more detail. As shown 
in Fig. 1(c), a network consisting of double lines was seen more 
clearly. The height of the lines was measured to be about 0.02 
nm, which was much less than the thickness of monolayer Fe 
(0.20 nm). However, the lines could not be seen in the second 
Fe layer. For the epitaxial growth of one metal on another metal 
surface, a lattice mismatch between the two metals would 
produce strain in the metal overlayers. Quite often, dislocation 
networks formed in order to relieve the accumulated strain 
energy. Thus, we suggest that the observed networks were 
dislocation lines formed in the monolayer Fe films, as had been 
reported in other metal/metal systems, such as Ni films on 
Pt(111) [23], Co films on Pt(111) [24,25], and Cu films on 
Ru(0001) [26]. 
For comparison, the deposition of Fe at 300 K was con-
ducted under the same conditions. A typical STM image ac-
quired for 1 ML Fe grown on Pt(111) at 300 K (Fig. 1(d)) 
showed Fe islands with a thickness that ranged from 1 to 3 ML 
on the surface. A similar 3D island growth of Fe on Pt(111) at 
300 K was also observed previously [2]. Our STM results 
indicated that the growth temperature was critical for the 
MA Teng et al. / Chinese Journal of Catalysis, 2010, 31: 2432 
 
growth mode of the Fe films on Pt(111), and an elevated sub-
strate temperature helped give layer-like Fe films. 
XPS was used to monitor the Fe film growth on Pt(111). The 
XPS Fe 2p and Pt 4f spectra were recorded for surfaces covered 
by different amounts of Fe at 487 K. The intensity of the Fe 2p 
and Pt 4f peaks was plotted as a function of Fe deposition time 
or Fe coverage (Fig. 2(a)). A linear dependence of the XPS 
intensity on the deposition time was found in the initial growth 
stage, and a kink was found at the deposition time of 10 min. 
The occurrence of the distinct kink and the linear segments in 
the intensity-thickness curves [27] indicated the layer growth 
of Fe on Pt(111) in the first 10 min. This is consistent with the 
STM results (Fig. 1). 
The Fe 2p spectra from the deposited Fe overlayers also 
showed the different state of the Fe overlayers prepared with 
various growth conditions. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was at 707.2 eV in 
the case of 1 ML Fe grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, while the Fe 
2p3/2 peak was at 706.8 eV for the deposition of 1 ML at 300 K 
(Fig. 2(b)). It is known that the bonding between Fe and Pt 
results in a charge transfer from Fe to Pt, which will shift the Fe 
2p BE to higher values [28]. Accordingly, the +0.4 eV BE shift 
from the Fe film grown at 487 K suggested that the surface Fe 
atoms strongly interacted with the surface Pt atoms, perhaps in 
an alloying reaction. A strong interfacial bonding between the

interfacial Fe and Pt atoms can be further deduced from the fact 
that the Fe 2p3/2 BEs shifted down to 706.9 and 706.7 eV when 
the thickness of the Fe overlayers grown on Pt(111) at 487 K 
was increased to 2 and 3 ML, respectively (Fig. 2(b)). The Fe 
atoms in the second and third layers are separated from the 
surface Pt atoms, and free of the interfacial bonding, and 
showed core level BEs close to that of the bulk Fe. The XPS 
results demonstrated that the growth temperature influenced 
the chemical state of the deposited Fe atoms, and a higher 
substrate temperature increased the bonding strength between 
Fe and Pt. 
The -Fe phase has been observed in thin Fe overlayers 
grown on Pt(111) and other metallic substrates at RT and 500 K 
[2,10,29,30]. Thus, we suggest that the -Fe phase should form 
on Pt(111) under our growth conditions (300 and 487 K). In 
general, the layer growth of films obeyed the condition of 
substrate > film + interface, where substrate, film, and interface are the 
surface energy of substrate, film, and the interface, respec-
tively. The smaller surface free energy of -Fe (2.15 J/m2) 
than that of Pt (2.34 J/m2) [10] favored the layer growth of Fe 
on Pt(111). Besides the surface energy factor, the interface 
energy should also be considered. Our XPS results (Fig. 2(b)) 
indicated that the higher growth temperature at 487 K led to a 
stronger interaction between the first layer Fe and surface Pt, 
which would decease the interface energy and, consequently, 
favor the layer growth of Fe on Pt(111). On the other hand, the 
higher temperature, e.g. at 487 K, could induce Fe adatoms to 
diffuse down into the Pt(111) surface and overcome the kinetic 
limiting of the growth [31]. All these factors contribute to the 
growth mode transition from island growth at 300 K to layer 
growth at 487 K. 
2.2  Subsurface Fe on Pt(111) 
Starting with the 1 ML Fe film grown on Pt(111) at 487 K, 
the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface was stepwise annealed in UHV. 
The evolution of the surface composition and structure with 
annealing temperature was studied by XPS and STM. As 
shown in Fig. 3(a), there are no obvious changes in the Pt 4f 
intensity, but there was a small Pt 4f BE shift (< 0.2 eV) from 
annealing the surface up to 850 K. In contrast, a large variation 
in both the Fe 2p intensity and peak position was seen during 
the annealing (Fig. 3(b)). The Fe 2p peak area and Fe 2p3/2 peak 
position have been quantified from the original spectra using 
the Omicron EIS software (Fig. 3(c)). The Fe 2p3/2 BE was 
found to shift from 707.2 eV on the as-deposited 1 ML 
Fe/Pt(111) surface to 707.8 eV after annealing at 850 K. The 
0.6 eV BE shift would be due to the strengthened Pt-Fe bond-
ing, i.e., it was due to alloying, upon annealing. The Fe 2p 
signal was almost unchanged until 700 K, and then it decreased 
rapidly with annealing temperature. The Fe 2p signal decreased 
to 39% on annealing the surface at 850 K for 6 min. The de-
crease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at 
elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of 
Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region. 
The distribution of the diffused Fe in the subsurface regions 
can be simply estimated using the attenuation equation, 
IFe,n/IFe,0 = exp(nd/(OFe,PtcosT)) [32,33]. IFe,0 and IFe,n are the 
intensity of Fe 2p3/2 peak from the Fe overlayers at the topmost 
surface and in the nth subsurface layer, respectively. d, the 
thickness of one layer of Pt(111), is 0.23 nm. OFe,Pt is the ine-
lastic mean free path of Fe 2p photoelectrons in Pt, which is 
close to 0.86 nm [34].  is 36, the angle between the energy 
analyzer axis and the sample surface normal. If 1 ML Fe had 
diffused into the first subsurface layer, the attenuation of the Fe 
2p intensity would be around 30%. As shown above, the 61% 
attenuation of Fe 2p after annealing at 850 K suggested that 
only part of Fe remained in the first subsurface layer and the 
remaining Fe had diffused into the second subsurface layer or 
even deeper. On the basis of the above equation, the amount of

Fe in the first subsurface layer was estimated to be 0.5 ML. 
A similar trend of the XPS Fe 2p binding energy shift and 
signal intensity decrease was also observed by annealing a 1.5 
ML Fe overlayer on Pt(111) to form a Fe-Pt alloy surface [6]. 
However, the Fe-Pt surfaces were Fe-containing even at 950 K 
in these experiments, which may be due to the short annealing 
duration (10 s). 
The surface structure of the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) annealed at 
different temperatures was also investigated by STM. At rela-
tively low annealing temperatures, e.g. < 750 K, the surface 
was rough with dislocation lines. After annealing at 800 K, the 
surface became atomically flat. Interestingly, a network of 
oriented lines appeared again on the surface (Fig. 4(a)). The 
high resolution STM image clearly showed the existence of 
these lines, which caused surface corrugation (Fig. 4(b)). It 
should be noted that under this annealing condition, surface Fe 
has almost all diffused away from the surface, as confirmed by 
XPS data (Fig. 3(b)) and ISS data (Fig. 4(e)). Moreover, the 
STM images showed that the step height on the surface was 
close to that of pure Pt(111). Therefore, the line network 
formed at the so-called Pt-skin surface, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and the 
occurrence of the oriented lines was induced by the presence of 
subsurface Fe. Similar bright lines have been observed on other 
Pt-skin surfaces, which were produced by strain due to sub-
surface Cu [33] and Ni [23] atoms. 
Upon further annealing the 1 ML Fe/Pt(111) surface at 850 
K, the surface appeared quite uniform (Fig. 4(c)). The atomi-
cally resolved STM image (Fig. 4(d)) revealed that the surface 
had the symmetry of Pt(111), and only a Pt signal was seen in 
the ISS spectrum (Fig. 4(e)). The fine lines observed for the 
surface annealed at 800 K were not found. We conclude that 
annealing at the higher temperature led to the diffusion of 
subsurface Fe into deeper regions, which would alleviate sur-
face strain and remove the surface lines. 
2.3  Monolayer surface FeO on Pt(111) 
As discussed above, annealing the Fe/Pt(111) surface in 
vacuum induced the surface segregation of Pt and formed a 
stable Pt-skin structure with subsurface Fe. The surface stabil-
ity of the Pt-skin structure can be reduced, and gas-induced Fe 
surface segregation may occur under some circumstances, e.g. 
an oxidative environment [35,36]. 
The Pt-skin surface, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), was stepwise annealed in 
1.1 × 104 Pa O2 from 400 to 850 K. Figures 5(a) and (b) show 
the XPS spectra for Fe 2p, O KLL Auger transition, and O 1s 
during the annealing. The Fe 2p3/2 BE, Fe 2p intensity, and O 1s 
intensity were plotted as a function of the annealing tempera-
ture (Fig. 5(c)). The Fe 2p intensity did not change until an-
nealing to 700 K. In contrast, the O 1s peak area increased in 
the whole temperature range, and the Fe 2p3/2 BE continued to 
shift to higher values from 400 to 750 K. ISS is a topmost 
surface sensitive technique, and it was applied to monitor the 
surface O, Pt, and Fe signals during the annealing of the surface 
in O2. Figure 6(d) shows the ratio of the Fe/Pt and O/Pt signals 
in the ISS spectra recorded from the annealed surface. It can be

seen that the surface O ISS signal did not increase below 700 
K. On the basis of the ISS and XPS data, we suggest that sur-
face adsorbed oxygen had probably diffused into the subsur-
face layers and remained bonded with the Fe atoms there. 
Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt 
signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 
2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the 
FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe 
to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the 
Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K). 
Figure 6 displays STM images of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface 
annealed in 1.1 × 104 Pa O2 at 600 and 850 K. In the case of 
oxidation at 600 K, black dots can be seen on the surface, 
which may be due to the presence of O species on the surface or 
in the subsurface regions (Figs. 6(a) and (b)). After annealing at 
850 K, the whole surface exhibited a superstructure with a 
periodicity of 2.5 nm (Fig. 6(c)). The high resolution STM 
image (Fig. 6(d)) further showed the atomic structure of this 
superstructure, which is the same as the typical Moir pattern 
from FeO films grown on Pt(111) by the direct oxidation of 
metallic Fe overlayers on Pt(111) in O2. The Moir pattern 
structure is formed due to the lattice mismatch between the 
monolayer FeO film and Pt(111) substrate. It has been exten-
sively studied in the past ten years by multiple methods, such as 
X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD), low energy electron 
diffraction (LEED), and STM [16,3739].  
2.4  Reversible modulation of surface Fe and subsurface 
Fe at Pt(111) 
The above results demonstrated that the surface metallic Fe 
atoms tended to diffuse into the subsurface or bulk regions 
during annealing of the surface in vacuum, while subsurface Fe 
would diffuse out to form surface FeO in an oxidative envi-
ronment. In the following, we will show that the Fe-Pt(111) 
surface structure indeed can be reversibly transformed between 
surface Fe or FeO and subsurface Fe on the Pt(111) surface by 
cycles of oxidation and reduction. 
From the FeO/Pt(111) surface, a surface reduction was 
conducted by annealing in 1.1 × 104 Pa H2 at temperatures 
between 500 and 800 K. As shown in Fig. 7, the XPS O 1s 
intensity started to decrease and the Fe 2p3/2 BE shifted down 
after reducing the surface at 500 K. Up to 650 K, there was only 
a weak O 1s signal left from the surface, and the Fe 2p3/2 BE 
was 707.6 eV, approximately the value of the monolayer Fe 
film. The results implied that the surface FeO overlayer had 
been fully reduced at this temperature. However, the un-
changed Fe 2p intensity excluded the possibility that reduced

Fe atoms had diffused inwards into the subsurface region. 
Thus, we suggest that surface FeO had changed to surface 
metallic Fe under this reduction condition. The STM image 
from the surface (Fig. 8(a)) showed that annealing in H2 at 650 
K led to roughening of the surface, which had many pits, per-
haps due to the etching effect of H2. With annealing tempera-
tures above 650 K, the Fe 2p peak area decreased rapidly, 
suggesting the inward diffusion of the surface Fe. The surface 
reduced at 800 K had the typical clean Pt(111) surface mor-
phology (Fig. 8(b)). 
During one cycle of oxidation and reduction, the Pt-skin 
structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), was first transformed to the FeO/ 
Pt(111) structure in O2, which was transformed into the 
Fe/Pt(111) structure after low temperature reduction (< 650 K) 
and subsequently back to the Pt-skin surface upon high tem-
perature reduction, e.g. at 800 K. The same oxidation and 
reduction experiments, i.e. oxidation in 1.1 × 104 Pa O2 at 850 
K and reduction in 1.1 × 104 Pa H2 at 800 K, have been cycled 
another three times. The surface processes were similarly re-
peated [21,40]. 
On the basis of these results, the surface processes upon 
oxidation and reduction treatments are summarized in Fig. 9. 
First, the surface Fe structure, Fe/Pt(111), was obtained by the 
deposition of Fe on bare Pt(111) in vacuum or mild reduction 
of the FeO/Pt(111) surface in H2 (< 650 K). From the 
Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be

produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively 
high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can 
be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high tem-
perature (850 K). Therefore, the three different surfaces of 
Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can each be pre-
pared by controlling the treatment atmosphere and annealing 
temperature. The results demonstrated the possibility of the 
reversible modulation of Fe structures on Pt(111) surfaces. 
3  Conclusions 
Monolayer Fe films were formed on Pt(111) at 487 K. A 
transition from layer growth to island growth for Fe deposited 
on Pt(111) was observed when the substrate temperature 
changed from 487 K to 300 K. The higher temperature induced 
a strong bonding of Fe adatoms with surface Pt atoms, which 
decreased the interface energy and favored the layer growth of 
Fe on Pt(111). The monolayer Fe films grown on Pt(111) can 
be driven into the subsurface region by UHV annealing up to 
850 K, which formed the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111). Fe 
can be brought back to the topmost surface by oxidizing the 
Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2, which formed the FeO/Pt(111) 
surface. The surface Fe (or FeO) and subsurface Fe structures 
on the Pt(111) surface can be reversibly controlled by cycled 
oxidation and reduction treatments. The three structures of 
Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) can be transformed 
one into another.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
