[1] "The Fe 2p signal was almost unchanged until 700 K, and then it decreased rapidly with annealing temperature. The Fe 2p signal decreased to 39% on annealing the surface at 850 K for 6 min. The decrease in the Fe 2p signal intensity after UHV annealing at elevated temperatures was attributed to the inward diffusion of Fe into the Pt(111) subsurface region."

[2] "Above 700 K, both the XPS Fe 2p intensity and the ISS Fe/Pt signal increased rapidly with the annealing temperature. The Fe 2p3/2 BE was constant at 709.2 eV. This is characteristic of the FeO structure. The results indicated the outward diffusion of Fe to form FeO on the top surface during annealing of the Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface in O2 at high temperatures (> 700 K)."

[3] "From the Fe/Pt(111) surface, the Pt-skin structure, Pt/Fe/Pt(111), can be produced by strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at relatively high temperatures (e.g. 800 K). The Pt/Fe/Pt(111) surface can be transformed to surface FeO by oxidation in O2 at high temperature (850 K)."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. The literature provides insights into these influences, especially for the Fe-Pt system:

1. Temperature effects: At elevated temperatures (above 700 K) under vacuum conditions, Fe tends to diffuse inward from the surface into the Pt(111) subsurface region. This leads to the formation of a Pt-skin structure (Pt/Fe/Pt(111)).

2. Oxidative environments: In the presence of oxygen at high temperatures (above 700 K), Fe tends to segregate to the surface and form an FeO structure. This demonstrates that oxidative conditions can reverse the inward diffusion of Fe observed under vacuum.

3. Reductive environments: Strong reduction in vacuum or H2 at high temperatures (e.g., 800 K) can produce the Pt-skin structure from a Fe/Pt(111) surface.

4. Reversible transformations: The structural configurations can be reversibly controlled by cycled oxidation and reduction treatments. Three distinct structures - Fe/Pt(111), Pt/Fe/Pt(111), and FeO/Pt(111) - can be interconverted based on the treatment atmosphere and temperature.

These findings have important implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition control: The ability to control surface composition through temperature and gas environment allows for tuning of catalytic properties.

2. Stability in different environments: The reversible nature of these transformations suggests that the catalyst structure may change during reactions, potentially affecting long-term stability and performance.

3. Oxidation state control: The ability to form either metallic or oxidized surface structures provides opportunities for optimizing catalytic performance in different types of reactions.

4. Subsurface modification: The Pt-skin structure with subsurface Fe can modify the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms, potentially enhancing catalytic activity for certain reactions.

5. Bifunctional catalysis: The ability to form surface FeO structures on Pt could be beneficial for reactions that require both metal and oxide functionalities.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and reaction-induced structural changes is crucial for designing high-performance and stable bimetallic catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells, chemical processing, and emissions control.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，特别是在基于Pt的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。文献为这些影响提供了见解，尤其是对于Fe-Pt系统：

1. 温度效应：在真空条件下，高温（700 K以上）会导致Fe从表面向Pt(111)亚表面区域扩散。这导致形成Pt皮层结构（Pt/Fe/Pt(111)）。

2. 氧化环境：在高温（700 K以上）下存在氧气时，Fe倾向于偏析到表面并形成FeO结构。这表明氧化条件可以逆转在真空下观察到的Fe向内扩散。

3. 还原环境：在真空或H2中进行强还原（例如800 K）可以从Fe/Pt(111)表面产生Pt皮层结构。

4. 可逆转变：结构构型可以通过循环氧化和还原处理进行可逆控制。三种不同的结构 - Fe/Pt(111)、Pt/Fe/Pt(111)和FeO/Pt(111) - 可以根据处理气氛和温度相互转换。

这些发现对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 表面成分控制：通过温度和气体环境控制表面成分的能力允许调节催化性能。

2. 不同环境中的稳定性：这些转变的可逆性表明催化剂结构可能在反应过程中发生变化，潜在影响长期稳定性和性能。

3. 氧化态控制：形成金属或氧化物表面结构的能力为优化不同类型反应的催化性能提供了机会。

4. 亚表面修饰：具有亚表面Fe的Pt皮层结构可以修改表面Pt原子的电子性质，可能增强某些反应的催化活性。

5. 双功能催化：在Pt上形成表面FeO结构的能力可能有利于需要金属和氧化物功能的反应。

理解这些热力学偏好和反应诱导的结构变化对于设计各种应用（如燃料电池、化学加工和排放控制）的高性能和稳定的双金属催化剂至关重要。
