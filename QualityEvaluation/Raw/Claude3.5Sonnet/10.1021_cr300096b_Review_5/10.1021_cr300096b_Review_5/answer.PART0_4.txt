[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."

[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum."

[4] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

[5] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPtPt(111) surface structures.

However, the presence of adsorbates can dramatically alter these preferences. While weak adsorbates like hydrogen typically maintain the subsurface configuration, strong adsorbates such as oxygen can induce surface segregation of subsurface 3d metals. This is due to the difference in binding energies between surface and subsurface configurations, which can outweigh the thermodynamic potential for maintaining the subsurface structure when the coverage of strong adsorbates is high enough.

These changes in surface structure and composition have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is crucial, as it directly affects the catalytic behavior of the material. For instance, in fuel cell applications, the formation of a Pt skin on Pt3d alloys can influence the catalytic activity and durability of the electrode materials.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and adsorbate-induced structural changes is essential for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications. It allows for better prediction and control of catalyst behavior under different reaction conditions, potentially leading to improved performance and stability in catalytic processes.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，特别是在基于铂的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。在真空条件下，铂终止的双金属表面通常是热力学优先的，其中Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构比3dPtPt(111)表面结构更稳定。

然而，吸附质的存在可以显著改变这些偏好。虽然像氢这样的弱吸附质通常会保持亚表面构型，但像氧这样的强吸附质可以诱导亚表面3d金属的表面偏析。这是由于表面和亚表面构型之间的结合能差异，当强吸附质的覆盖率足够高时，这种差异可以超过维持亚表面结构的热力学势能。

这些表面结构和成分的变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响。双金属表面结构在反应条件下的稳定性至关重要，因为它直接影响材料的催化行为。例如，在燃料电池应用中，Pt3d合金上形成的Pt皮层可以影响电极材料的催化活性和耐久性。

理解这些热力学偏好和吸附质诱导的结构变化对于设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂至关重要。它允许更好地预测和控制催化剂在不同反应条件下的行为，可能导致催化过程中性能和稳定性的提高。
