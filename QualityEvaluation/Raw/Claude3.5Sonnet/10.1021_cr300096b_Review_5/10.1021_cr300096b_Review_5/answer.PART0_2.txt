However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are often thermodynamically preferred, as evidenced by the formation of a Pt skin on Pt3d alloys used in fuel cell applications. However, the presence of adsorbates can dramatically alter this preference.

The stability of surface and subsurface structures depends on the nature and coverage of adsorbates. For instance, while hydrogen adsorption generally maintains the thermodynamic preference for subsurface configurations in Pt-3d systems, the presence of atomic oxygen can reverse this preference, causing subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface.

The strength of adsorbate binding plays a crucial role in determining surface segregation. Weakly binding adsorbates like hydrogen have minimal effect on the thermodynamic potential for configuration changes. In contrast, strongly binding adsorbates like nitrogen or oxygen can significantly alter the thermodynamic landscape, potentially causing surface segregation of subsurface metals when present in sufficient quantities.

These adsorbate-induced changes in surface composition and structure can profoundly affect the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems. The dynamic nature of these surfaces under reaction conditions highlights the importance of considering the specific reaction environment when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在真空条件下，铂终止的双金属表面通常是热力学偏好的，这从用于燃料电池应用的Pt3d合金形成铂皮层可以得到证实。然而，吸附质的存在可以显著改变这种偏好。

表面和亚表面结构的稳定性取决于吸附质的性质和覆盖度。例如，虽然氢气吸附通常会维持Pt-3d系统中亚表面构型的热力学偏好，但原子氧的存在可以逆转这种偏好，导致亚表面3d金属偏析到表面。

吸附质结合强度在决定表面偏析中起着关键作用。像氢这样的弱结合吸附质对构型变化的热力学潜力影响很小。相比之下，像氮或氧这样的强结合吸附质可以显著改变热力学景观，当存在足够数量时可能导致亚表面金属的表面偏析。

这些由吸附质引起的表面成分和结构变化可以深刻影响双金属系统的催化性能。这些表面在反应条件下的动态特性突显了在设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂时考虑特定反应环境的重要性。
