[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."

[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure."

[4] "The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum."

[5] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

[6] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPt(111) surface structures. This preference is maintained in the presence of weak adsorbates like hydrogen.

However, the presence of strong adsorbates, particularly those with high electronegativity like oxygen and nitrogen, can dramatically alter the thermodynamic stability of these structures. When the surface coverage of these adsorbates is sufficiently high, it can overcome the thermodynamic preference for the subsurface configuration, leading to surface segregation of the subsurface 3d metals.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is crucial because it directly affects the catalytic properties. Changes in the surface composition and structure due to segregation can significantly modify the catalytic performance of these materials in various applications, such as fuel cells.

The segregation energy (Eseg) is a key factor in determining whether surface segregation occurs. A sufficiently negative Eseg leads to the admetal segregating to the surface, while a sufficiently positive Eseg results in the formation of a subsurface monolayer structure.

These findings highlight the importance of considering reaction conditions and adsorbates when designing and utilizing bimetallic catalysts. The dynamic nature of these systems under different environments means that the actual active surface during catalysis may differ significantly from the initial structure, impacting the catalyst's performance and longevity.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，特别是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在真空条件下，Pt终端的双金属表面通常在热力学上更受青睐，Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构比3dPt(111)表面结构更稳定。这种偏好在存在弱吸附剂如氢气的情况下仍然保持。

然而，强吸附剂的存在，特别是那些具有高电负性的吸附剂如氧和氮，可以显著改变这些结构的热力学稳定性。当这些吸附剂的表面覆盖率足够高时，它可以克服亚表面构型的热力学偏好，导致亚表面3d金属向表面偏析。

双金属表面结构在反应条件下的稳定性至关重要，因为它直接影响催化性能。由于偏析导致的表面成分和结构变化可以显著改变这些材料在各种应用中的催化性能，如燃料电池。

偏析能（Eseg）是决定是否发生表面偏析的关键因素。足够负的Eseg导致添加金属偏析到表面，而足够正的Eseg导致亚表面单层结构的形成。

这些发现强调了在设计和使用双金属催化剂时考虑反应条件和吸附剂的重要性。这些系统在不同环境下的动态特性意味着催化过程中的实际活性表面可能与初始结构有显著不同，影响催化剂的性能和寿命。
