          [1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."

[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure."

[4] "The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum."

[5] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

[6] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

[7] "An adsorbate with a weak Pauling electronegativity, such as H, S, Se, or C, binds weakly with both surface and subsurface configurations and provides only a small shift in the thermodynamic potential for interchanging the configuration. In contrast, an adsorbate with a strong Pauling electronegativity, such as N or O, produces a large difference in binding energy between the two configurations."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPtPt(111) surface structures. This preference is often observed in fuel cell applications where Pt3d alloys are covered by a Pt skin.

The stability and surface segregation of these bimetallic catalysts are highly dependent on the presence and nature of adsorbates. Weakly binding adsorbates like hydrogen, sulfur, selenium, or carbon have minimal impact on the thermodynamic potential for configuration changes. However, strongly binding adsorbates such as nitrogen or oxygen can significantly alter the stability of surface structures.

The segregation energy (Eseg) plays a crucial role in determining the final structure. A sufficiently negative Eseg leads to admetal segregation to the surface, while a sufficiently positive Eseg results in the formation of a subsurface monolayer structure.

The presence of atomic oxygen can reverse the thermodynamic stability, making the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more stable than the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structure. This oxygen-induced surface segregation demonstrates how reaction conditions can dramatically influence the structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts.

These adsorbate-induced changes in surface composition and structure can profoundly affect the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems. The dynamic nature of these surfaces under reaction conditions highlights the importance of considering the specific reaction environment when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and the effects of reaction conditions is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. It allows for better prediction and control of catalyst behavior under various reaction environments, ultimately leading to improved catalytic performance and efficiency in applications such as fuel cells and other catalytic processes.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，特别是在基于铂的系统（如Pt-3d合金）中。这些因素对其催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在真空条件下，铂终止的双金属表面通常是热力学偏好的，Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构比3dPtPt(111)表面结构更稳定。这种偏好常见于燃料电池应用中，其中Pt3d合金被铂皮层覆盖。

这些双金属催化剂的稳定性和表面偏析高度依赖于吸附物的存在和性质。氢、硫、硒或碳等弱结合吸附物对构型变化的热力学势能影响很小。然而，氮或氧等强结合吸附物可以显著改变表面结构的稳定性。

偏析能（Eseg）在决定最终结构中起着关键作用。足够负的Eseg会导致添加金属向表面偏析，而足够正的Eseg则会导致亚表面单层结构的形成。

原子氧的存在可以逆转热力学稳定性，使3dPtPt(111)表面结构比Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构更稳定。这种氧诱导的表面偏析表明反应条件如何能够显著影响双金属催化剂的结构构型。

这些由吸附质引起的表面成分和结构变化可以深刻影响双金属系统的催化性能。这些表面在反应条件下的动态特性突显了在设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂时考虑特定反应环境的重要性。

理解这些热力学偏好和反应条件的影响对于设计和优化特定应用的双金属催化剂至关重要。它允许更好地预测和控制催化剂在各种反应环境下的行为，最终提高燃料电池和其他催化过程等应用中的催化性能和效率。
