[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."

[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure."

[4] "The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum."

[5] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

[6] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPt(111) surface structures. This preference is maintained in the presence of weakly binding adsorbates like hydrogen.

However, the presence of strongly binding adsorbates, such as oxygen or nitrogen, can dramatically alter the stability of these structures. When the surface coverage of these adsorbates is high enough, it can overcome the thermodynamic preference for the subsurface configuration, leading to segregation of subsurface 3d metals to the surface.

The segregation energy (Eseg) plays a crucial role in determining the final structure. A sufficiently negative Eseg leads to admetal segregation to the surface, while a sufficiently positive Eseg results in the formation of a subsurface monolayer structure.

These structural changes directly impact the catalytic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. The stability of the bimetallic surface structures under specific reaction conditions is critical, as it modifies the catalytic properties. For instance, in fuel cell applications, Pt3d alloys tend to form a Pt skin on the surface, which affects their performance.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and the influence of reaction conditions is essential for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. It allows for better prediction and control of the catalyst's structure and, consequently, its catalytic properties under various reaction environments.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于铂的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在真空条件下，铂终止的双金属表面通常在热力学上更受青睐，Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构比3dPt(111)表面结构更稳定。这种偏好在存在弱结合吸附剂（如氢）的情况下仍然保持。

然而，强结合吸附剂（如氧或氮）的存在可以显著改变这些结构的稳定性。当这些吸附剂的表面覆盖率足够高时，它可以克服亚表面构型的热力学偏好，导致亚表面3d金属向表面偏析。

偏析能（Eseg）在决定最终结构中起着关键作用。足够负的Eseg会导致添加金属向表面偏析，而足够正的Eseg则会导致亚表面单层结构的形成。

这些结构变化直接影响双金属表面的催化性能。双金属表面结构在特定反应条件下的稳定性至关重要，因为它会改变催化性能。例如，在燃料电池应用中，Pt3d合金倾向于在表面形成Pt皮层，这影响了它们的性能。

理解这些热力学偏好和反应条件的影响对于设计和优化特定应用的双金属催化剂至关重要。它使我们能够更好地预测和控制催化剂的结构，从而在各种反应环境下控制其催化性能。
