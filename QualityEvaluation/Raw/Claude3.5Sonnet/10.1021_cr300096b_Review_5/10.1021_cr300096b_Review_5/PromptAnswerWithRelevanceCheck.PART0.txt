[1] "One of the most critical questions in bimetallic catalysis is the stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions, which would in turn modify the catalytic properties."

[2] "Several other investigations of Pt3d alloys in fuel cell applications have suggested that the alloy films used in these studies are covered by a Pt skin, (195-197) again indicating the thermodynamic preference of Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces."

[3] "If Eseg is sufficiently negative, the admetal segregates to the surface to produce the MHH surface monolayer structure. If Eseg is sufficiently positive, the surface layer is the host metal, leading to the formation of the HMH subsurface monolayer structure."

[4] "The values of ΔEseg are positive for all systems under vacuum, predicting that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures are thermodynamically more stable than the 3dPtPt(111) surface in vacuum."

[5] "The DFT results predict that the subsurface configuration remains thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. However, the subsurface structure is no longer stable in the presence of 0.5 ML atomic oxygen, indicating a thermodynamic driving potential for the subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface."

[6] "When the surface coverage of N or O is high enough, this difference outweighs the thermodynamic potential for retaining the subsurface configuration in vacuum."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPt(111) surface structures. This preference is maintained in the presence of weak adsorbates like hydrogen.

However, the presence of strong adsorbates, particularly those with high electronegativity like oxygen and nitrogen, can dramatically alter the thermodynamic stability of these structures. When the surface coverage of these adsorbates is sufficiently high, it can overcome the thermodynamic preference for the subsurface configuration, leading to surface segregation of the subsurface 3d metals.

The stability of bimetallic surface structures under reaction conditions is crucial because it directly affects the catalytic properties. Changes in the surface composition and structure due to segregation can significantly modify the catalytic performance of these materials in various applications, such as fuel cells.

The segregation energy (Eseg) is a key factor in determining whether surface segregation occurs. A sufficiently negative Eseg leads to the admetal segregating to the surface, while a sufficiently positive Eseg results in the formation of a subsurface monolayer structure.

These findings highlight the importance of considering reaction conditions and adsorbates when designing and utilizing bimetallic catalysts. The dynamic nature of these systems under different environments means that the actual active surface during catalysis may differ significantly from the initial structure, impacting the catalyst's performance and longevity.

热力学偏好和反应条件对双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响，特别是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。这些因素对它们的催化性能和在各种应用中的表现有重要影响。

在真空条件下，Pt终端的双金属表面通常在热力学上更受青睐，Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构比3dPt(111)表面结构更稳定。这种偏好在存在弱吸附剂如氢气的情况下仍然保持。

然而，强吸附剂的存在，特别是那些具有高电负性的吸附剂如氧和氮，可以显著改变这些结构的热力学稳定性。当这些吸附剂的表面覆盖率足够高时，它可以克服亚表面构型的热力学偏好，导致亚表面3d金属向表面偏析。

双金属表面结构在反应条件下的稳定性至关重要，因为它直接影响催化性能。由于偏析导致的表面成分和结构变化可以显著改变这些材料在各种应用中的催化性能，如燃料电池。

偏析能（Eseg）是决定是否发生表面偏析的关键因素。足够负的Eseg导致添加金属偏析到表面，而足够正的Eseg导致亚表面单层结构的形成。

这些发现强调了在设计和使用双金属催化剂时考虑反应条件和吸附剂的重要性。这些系统在不同环境下的动态特性意味着催化过程中的实际活性表面可能与初始结构有显著不同，影响催化剂的性能和寿命。

These structural changes directly impact the catalytic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. The stability of the bimetallic surface structures under specific reaction conditions is critical, as it modifies the catalytic properties. For instance, in fuel cell applications, Pt3d alloys tend to form a Pt skin on the surface, which affects their performance.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and the influence of reaction conditions is essential for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. It allows for better prediction and control of the catalyst's structure and, consequently, its catalytic properties under various reaction environments.

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are often thermodynamically preferred, as evidenced by the formation of a Pt skin on Pt3d alloys used in fuel cell applications. However, the presence of adsorbates can dramatically alter this preference.

The stability of surface and subsurface structures depends on the nature and coverage of adsorbates. For instance, while hydrogen adsorption generally maintains the thermodynamic preference for subsurface configurations in Pt-3d systems, the presence of atomic oxygen can reverse this preference, causing subsurface 3d metals to segregate to the surface.

The strength of adsorbate binding plays a crucial role in determining surface segregation. Weakly binding adsorbates like hydrogen have minimal effect on the thermodynamic potential for configuration changes. In contrast, strongly binding adsorbates like nitrogen or oxygen can significantly alter the thermodynamic landscape, potentially causing surface segregation of subsurface metals when present in sufficient quantities.

These adsorbate-induced changes in surface composition and structure can profoundly affect the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems. The dynamic nature of these surfaces under reaction conditions highlights the importance of considering the specific reaction environment when designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications.

在真空条件下，铂终止的双金属表面通常是热力学偏好的，这从用于燃料电池应用的Pt3d合金形成铂皮层可以得到证实。然而，吸附质的存在可以显著改变这种偏好。

表面和亚表面结构的稳定性取决于吸附质的性质和覆盖度。例如，虽然氢气吸附通常会维持Pt-3d系统中亚表面构型的热力学偏好，但原子氧的存在可以逆转这种偏好，导致亚表面3d金属偏析到表面。

吸附质结合强度在决定表面偏析中起着关键作用。像氢这样的弱结合吸附质对构型变化的热力学潜力影响很小。相比之下，像氮或氧这样的强结合吸附质可以显著改变热力学景观，当存在足够数量时可能导致亚表面金属的表面偏析。

这些由吸附质引起的表面成分和结构变化可以深刻影响双金属系统的催化性能。这些表面在反应条件下的动态特性突显了在设计和优化各种应用的双金属催化剂时考虑特定反应环境的重要性。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, particularly in Pt-based systems such as Pt-3d alloys. These factors have important implications for their catalytic properties and performance in various applications.

In vacuum conditions, Pt-terminated bimetallic surfaces are generally thermodynamically preferred, with Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures being more stable than 3dPtPt(111) surface structures. This preference is often observed in fuel cell applications where Pt3d alloys are covered by a Pt skin.

The stability and surface segregation of these bimetallic catalysts are highly dependent on the presence and nature of adsorbates. Weakly binding adsorbates like hydrogen, sulfur, selenium, or carbon have minimal impact on the thermodynamic potential for configuration changes. However, strongly binding adsorbates such as nitrogen or oxygen can significantly alter the stability of surface structures.

For instance, the presence of atomic oxygen can reverse the thermodynamic stability, making the 3dPtPt(111) surface structure more stable than the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structure. This oxygen-induced surface segregation demonstrates how reaction conditions can dramatically influence the structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts.

These changes in surface composition and structure directly affect the catalytic properties of the bimetallic systems. The ability of adsorbates to induce surface segregation or alter surface stability can lead to dynamic changes in the catalyst's active sites during reactions, potentially enhancing or inhibiting catalytic performance.

Understanding these thermodynamic preferences and the effects of reaction conditions is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific applications. It allows for better prediction and control of catalyst behavior under various reaction environments, ultimately leading to improved catalytic performance and efficiency in applications such as fuel cells and other catalytic processes.

例如，原子氧的存在可以逆转热力学稳定性，使3dPtPt(111)表面结构比Pt3dPt(111)亚表面结构更稳定。这种氧诱导的表面偏析表明反应条件如何能够显著影响双金属催化剂的结构构型。
