[1] "Alloying Sn into the Pt(1 1 1) surface reduces the surface reactivity such that the strongly chemisorbed μ-N,O-bonded-nitrito species of NO2 on Pt(1 1 1) is not formed on the alloy."

[2] "Decomposition of NO2 occurs on the 3 alloy between 220 and 300 K to liberate surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO. Surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the 3 alloy at higher temperatures."

[3] "We find that after desorption of all surface-bound NO and oxygen associated with Pt sites, θO=0.2 ML remains at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species. With ΘSn=0.33 ML, this gives an O:Sn ratio of 2:3 corresponding to surface film of Sn1.5O species."

[4] "Our results following NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K is also consistent with previous structural models developed for more heavily oxidized alloys. In our work, oxygen associated with Sn sites after more extensive oxidation reactions corresponds to forming SnO1.5 species."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn alloys are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. Alloying Sn with Pt(111) reduces surface reactivity, changing the adsorption behavior of molecules like NO2. The alloy's structure and composition can be altered by reaction conditions, such as temperature and gas exposure.

At lower temperatures (220-300 K), NO2 decomposition on the Pt-Sn alloy produces surface oxygen and NO. As temperature increases, surface oxygen oxidizes Sn in the alloy. This oxidation process leads to the formation of various tin oxide species, with stoichiometries depending on reaction conditions. For instance, at moderate oxidation levels, a Sn1.5O surface film forms, while more extensive oxidation at higher temperatures (600 K) produces SnO1.5 species.

These structural and compositional changes have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The formation of tin oxide species can modify the surface reactivity, potentially enhancing selectivity for certain reactions or improving resistance to coking. The distribution of Pt and Sn atoms at the surface, as well as the degree of Sn oxidation, can significantly affect the catalyst's electronic properties and adsorption characteristics, thereby influencing its overall catalytic performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件对Pt基双金属催化剂（如Pt-Sn合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。将Sn与Pt(111)合金化会降低表面反应性，改变NO2等分子的吸附行为。合金的结构和成分可以通过温度和气体暴露等反应条件而改变。

在较低温度（220-300 K）下，NO2在Pt-Sn合金上分解产生表面氧和NO。随着温度升高，表面氧会氧化合金中的Sn。这种氧化过程会导致各种氧化锡物种的形成，其化学计量比取决于反应条件。例如，在中等氧化水平下，形成Sn1.5O表面膜，而在更高温度（600 K）下进行更广泛的氧化会产生SnO1.5物种。

这些结构和成分变化对催化性能有重要影响。氧化锡物种的形成可以改变表面反应性，可能增强某些反应的选择性或提高抗积炭能力。Pt和Sn原子在表面的分布以及Sn的氧化程度可以显著影响催化剂的电子性质和吸附特性，从而影响其在各种应用中的整体催化性能。
