[1] "Adsorption of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy has been investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."

[2] "Platinumtin bimetallic catalysts are of interest for selective oxidation and reduction reactions, and are commercially important for petroleum reforming"

[3] "Compared to Pt catalysts, PtSn reforming catalysts have greater resistance to coking and increased selectivity to aromatics."

[4] "Industrial, supported, PtSn catalysts, however, include an oxide support material and are complicated materials systems for which it is difficult to assess the phases present and the catalytic activity of each phase."

[5] "It has been reported that on alumina, tin is partially oxidized to create a mixed catalyst with a supported alloy phase PtSn/Al2O3 and a tin oxide-supported, Pt-phase Pt/SnOx/Al2O3, where the relative concentrations are determined mainly by particle size"

The literature provides insights into how thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts, with implications for their catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface alloy formation: The study investigates a (3×3)R30° Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy, indicating that Sn can form ordered surface structures with Pt under certain conditions.

2. Oxidation effects: Exposure to oxidizing agents like NO2 can lead to partial oxidation of Sn in the alloy, affecting its structure and composition. This oxidation can create mixed phases, including alloy and oxide-supported components.

3. Thermal stability: Heating the alloy causes changes in surface composition and structure, including possible Sn segregation or diffusion into the bulk at high temperatures.

4. Support effects: In supported catalysts, the oxide support material (e.g., alumina) influences the phases present and their relative concentrations, which are also affected by particle size.

5. Catalytic properties: PtSn bimetallic catalysts show improved performance compared to pure Pt catalysts in certain applications, such as increased resistance to coking and higher selectivity to aromatics in petroleum reforming.

These factors demonstrate that the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are sensitive to reaction conditions and can significantly impact their catalytic properties. The complex interplay between alloy composition, oxidation state, support interactions, and thermal treatments determines the final catalyst structure and performance.

文献提供了关于热力学偏好和反应条件如何影响Pt-Sn双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构配置的见解，以及它们对催化性能和各种应用中性能的影响：

1. 表面合金形成：研究调查了(3×3)R30° Sn/Pt(111)表面合金，表明在特定条件下Sn可以与Pt形成有序的表面结构。

2. 氧化效应：暴露于NO2等氧化剂可导致合金中Sn的部分氧化，影响其结构和成分。这种氧化可以创造混合相，包括合金和氧化物支持的组分。

3. 热稳定性：加热合金会导致表面成分和结构的变化，包括在高温下Sn可能的表面偏析或向体相扩散。

4. 载体效应：在负载型催化剂中，氧化物载体材料（如氧化铝）影响存在的相及其相对浓度，这些也受粒子尺寸的影响。

5. 催化性能：在某些应用中，PtSn双金属催化剂比纯Pt催化剂表现出更好的性能，例如在石油重整中具有更高的抗积碳能力和更高的芳烃选择性。

这些因素表明，Pt基双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构配置对反应条件敏感，并且可以显著影响其催化性能。合金成分、氧化态、载体相互作用和热处理之间的复杂相互作用决定了最终催化剂的结构和性能。
