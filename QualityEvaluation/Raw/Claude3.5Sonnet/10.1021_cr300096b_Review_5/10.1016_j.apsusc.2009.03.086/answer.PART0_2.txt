[1] "Compared to monometallic catalysts, the bimetallic catalysts present more structural complexity, where the two components could have various structural configurations. For example, bimetallic nanoparticles could have the structures of alloy, coreshell, and linked monometallic nanoparticles"

[2] "Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface. The surface segregation of Pt has been found in Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtCu [24], PtNi [17,2528], PtFe [29,30], and PtCo [29,31]. The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) [32] contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on Pt M catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]. Moreover, the 3d transition metals may become oxidized in the oxidative environments. Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2) [35 37], the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces (surface energy of Pt: 1.95 J/m2 [38])."

[4] "Based on the discussion, we suggest the following dynamic process at the PtNi nanoparticle surfaces upon the cycled oxidation and reduction treatments (Scheme 1). The treatment in H2 at 300 8C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy. Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 8C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metaloxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in the catalyst structure and composition, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance.

Under vacuum or reducing conditions (e.g., H2 atmosphere), there is a thermodynamic preference for Pt to segregate to the surface of the bimetallic nanoparticles. This is primarily driven by the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to 3d transition metals, which helps minimize strain energy at the surface. This results in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer or "Pt-skin" structure.

However, in oxidizing conditions (e.g., O2 atmosphere), the situation reverses. The 3d transition metals tend to segregate to the surface due to their strong affinity for oxygen. These metals then become oxidized, forming a layer of metal oxide (e.g., NiO, CoO, or CuO) that encapsulates the Pt-rich core. This encapsulation is driven by the lower surface energy of the metal oxides compared to Pt.

These structural changes are reversible and can occur cyclically as the reaction environment alternates between reducing and oxidizing conditions. This dynamic behavior has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition: The active surface of the catalyst can switch between Pt-rich and 3d metal oxide-rich, potentially altering the types of reactions it can catalyze effectively.

2. Active site availability: The encapsulation of Pt by metal oxides in oxidizing conditions may reduce the number of available Pt active sites, potentially affecting reactions that rely on Pt catalysis.

3. Synergistic effects: The formation of core-shell structures or the proximity of Pt to metal oxides can create unique catalytic environments, potentially enhancing activity or selectivity for certain reactions.

4. Stability and longevity: While these structural changes are generally reversible, repeated cycling between different structures could potentially lead to catalyst degradation over time.

5. Reaction-specific optimization: Understanding these dynamics allows for potential tuning of catalyst composition and reaction conditions to maintain optimal catalytic performance for specific applications.

These findings highlight the complex and dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions. They underscore the importance of considering not just the initial catalyst composition, but also how the catalyst structure may evolve under different reaction environments when designing and optimizing catalytic systems for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了基于Pt的双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素导致催化剂结构和成分的动态变化，进而影响其催化性能和表现。

在真空或还原条件下（如H2环境），Pt倾向于偏析到双金属纳米粒子的表面。这主要是由Pt相对于3d过渡金属较大的原子半径驱动的，有助于最小化表面应变能。这导致形成富Pt表面层或"Pt皮层"结构。

然而，在氧化条件下（如O2环境），情况则相反。3d过渡金属由于对氧的强亲和力而倾向于偏析到表面。这些金属随后被氧化，形成金属氧化物层（如NiO、CoO或CuO），包覆富Pt的核心。这种包覆是由金属氧化物相对于Pt较低的表面能驱动的。

这些结构变化是可逆的，并可在还原和氧化条件交替的反应环境中周期性发生。这种动态行为对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 表面组成：催化剂的活性表面可以在富Pt和富3d金属氧化物之间切换，可能改变其有效催化的反应类型。

2. 活性位可用性：氧化条件下金属氧化物对Pt的包覆可能减少可用的Pt活性位，潜在影响依赖Pt催化的反应。

3. 协同效应：核壳结构的形成或Pt与金属氧化物的邻近可创造独特的催化环境，可能增强某些反应的活性或选择性。

4. 稳定性和寿命：虽然这些结构变化通常是可逆的，但长期在不同结构之间反复循环可能导致催化剂随时间降解。

5. 反应特定优化：理解这些动态变化允许通过调整催化剂组成和反应条件，为特定应用维持最佳催化性能。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的复杂和动态性质。它们突出了在设计和优化各种应用的催化系统时，不仅要考虑初始催化剂组成，还要考虑催化剂结构在不同反应环境下如何演变的重要性。
