[1] "Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces. Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface."

[2] "The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) [32] contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on PtM catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]."

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt [8,9,39,40], the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

[5] "The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is driven by atomic size differences, with the larger atom (typically Pt) preferring to segregate to the surface to minimize strain energy. This leads to the formation of Pt-rich surfaces in Pt-3d alloys.

However, reaction conditions can dramatically alter this behavior. In oxidizing environments, the strong affinity between oxygen and 3d transition metals causes these elements to segregate to the surface and form oxides. These oxides then tend to encapsulate the Pt due to their lower surface energy.

In reducing environments like H2, both metals are typically reduced to their metallic state. This allows the size-driven segregation to dominate again, resulting in Pt-rich surfaces or "Pt-skin" structures.

These reversible structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure directly affect the catalyst's active sites and thus its activity and selectivity. The dynamic nature of these catalysts means their performance can vary depending on the reaction environment, potentially allowing for tunable catalytic properties. However, it also implies that maintaining a specific desired surface structure under reaction conditions may be challenging, potentially affecting long-term stability and performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响Pt基双金属催化剂(特别是Pt-3d合金)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。

在真空条件下，表面偏析主要由原子尺寸差异驱动，较大的原子(通常是Pt)倾向于偏析到表面以最小化应变能。这导致Pt-3d合金形成富Pt表面。

然而，反应条件可以显著改变这种行为。在氧化环境中，氧与3d过渡金属之间的强亲和力导致这些元素偏析到表面并形成氧化物。由于这些氧化物的表面能较低，它们倾向于包覆Pt。

在H2等还原环境中，两种金属通常都还原为金属态。这使得尺寸驱动的偏析再次占主导地位，导致富Pt表面或"Pt皮层"结构的形成。

这些可逆的结构变化对催化性能有重大影响。表面组成和结构直接影响催化剂的活性位点，从而影响其活性和选择性。这些催化剂的动态特性意味着它们的性能可能随反应环境而变化，潜在地允许可调的催化性能。然而，这也意味着在反应条件下维持特定所需的表面结构可能具有挑战性，可能影响在各种应用中的长期稳定性和性能。
