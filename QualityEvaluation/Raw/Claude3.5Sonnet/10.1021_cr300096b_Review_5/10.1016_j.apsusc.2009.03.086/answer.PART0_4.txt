[1] "Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces. Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface."

[2] "Since hydrogen bonds weakly to most 3d transition metals, presence of H2 will not change the thermodynamic driving force for the surface segregation process. Therefore, it can be inferred that the segregation of Pt onto surface may take place in the supported PtNi nanoparticles upon annealing in H2 ambience"

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on Pt M catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals"

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt, the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

[5] "The mass transport processes, which are active in the oxidation or reduction reactions, are fully reversible depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is driven by strain relief, favoring the metal with the larger atomic radius (typically Pt) to segregate to the surface. In hydrogen atmospheres, this tendency persists as H2 does not significantly alter the thermodynamic driving forces.

However, in oxidizing environments, the situation changes dramatically. Oxygen adsorption can induce segregation of 3d transition metals to the surface due to their strong bonding with oxygen. Furthermore, when oxidized, these 3d metals (e.g., NiO) tend to encapsulate the Pt surface due to their lower surface energy and strong interaction with Pt.

These structural changes are reversible and depend on the redox potential of the reaction gases. This dynamic behavior has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure of the catalyst can change during reactions, potentially altering active sites and catalytic activity. This adaptability could be beneficial in some applications, allowing the catalyst to optimize its structure for different reaction steps. However, it also introduces complexity in predicting and controlling catalyst behavior under varying conditions.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing and optimizing Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells and catalytic reforming reactions. It suggests that catalyst performance should be evaluated under realistic operating conditions, as the structure observed ex-situ may not reflect the active state of the catalyst.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了基于铂的双金属催化剂，特别是铂-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。

在真空条件下，表面偏析由应变释放驱动，倾向于原子半径较大的金属（通常是铂）偏析到表面。在氢气环境中，这种趋势仍然存在，因为氢气不会显著改变热力学驱动力。

然而，在氧化环境中，情况发生了显著变化。氧气吸附可以诱导3d过渡金属向表面偏析，这是由于它们与氧的强键合作用。此外，当被氧化时，这些3d金属（如NiO）倾向于包覆铂表面，这是由于它们较低的表面能和与铂的强相互作用。

这些结构变化是可逆的，取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。这种动态行为对催化性能和性能有重要影响。催化剂的表面成分和结构可能在反应过程中发生变化，可能改变活性位点和催化活性。这种适应性在某些应用中可能是有益的，允许催化剂为不同的反应步骤优化其结构。然而，这也在预测和控制催化剂在不同条件下的行为方面引入了复杂性。

理解这些动态过程对于设计和优化用于各种应用的基于铂的双金属催化剂至关重要，如燃料电池和催化重整反应。这表明应该在实际操作条件下评估催化剂性能，因为在非原位观察到的结构可能不能反映催化剂的活性状态。
