[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on PtM catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]."

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt [8,9,39,40], the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is driven by atomic size differences, with the larger atom (typically Pt) preferring to segregate to the surface to minimize strain energy. This leads to the formation of Pt-rich surfaces in Pt-3d alloys.

However, reaction conditions can dramatically alter this behavior. In oxidizing environments, the strong affinity between oxygen and 3d transition metals causes these elements to segregate to the surface and form oxides. These oxides then tend to encapsulate the Pt due to their lower surface energy.

In reducing environments like H2, both metals are typically reduced to their metallic state. This allows the size-driven segregation to dominate again, resulting in Pt-rich surfaces or "Pt-skin" structures.

These reversible structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure directly affect the catalyst's active sites and thus its activity and selectivity. The dynamic nature of these catalysts means their performance can vary depending on the reaction environment, potentially allowing for tunable catalytic properties. However, it also implies that maintaining a specific desired surface structure under reaction conditions may be challenging, potentially affecting long-term stability and performance in various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响Pt基双金属催化剂(特别是Pt-3d合金)的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。

在真空条件下，表面偏析主要由原子尺寸差异驱动，较大的原子(通常是Pt)倾向于偏析到表面以最小化应变能。这导致Pt-3d合金形成富Pt表面。

然而，反应条件可以显著改变这种行为。在氧化环境中，氧与3d过渡金属之间的强亲和力导致这些元素偏析到表面并形成氧化物。由于这些氧化物的表面能较低，它们倾向于包覆Pt。

在H2等还原环境中，两种金属通常都还原为金属态。这使得尺寸驱动的偏析再次占主导地位，导致富Pt表面或"Pt皮层"结构的形成。

这些可逆的结构变化对催化性能有重大影响。表面组成和结构直接影响催化剂的活性位点，从而影响其活性和选择性。这些催化剂的动态特性意味着它们的性能可能随反应环境而变化，潜在地允许可调的催化性能。然而，这也意味着在反应条件下维持特定所需的表面结构可能具有挑战性，可能影响在各种应用中的长期稳定性和性能。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation of the metal with the larger atomic radius is preferred to release strain at the bimetallic surface. In Pt-3d alloys, Pt has a much larger atomic radius compared to Co, Ni, and Cu, which drives Pt segregation to the surface.

However, reaction conditions can alter this thermodynamic preference. In reducing atmospheres like H2, Pt still tends to segregate to the outer surfaces of the nanoparticles, forming a Pt-skin structure. This is driven by the minimization of strain energy.

In contrast, oxidizing environments promote different behavior. Oxygen adsorption can induce segregation of 3d transition metals to the surface due to strong bonding between oxygen and these metals. For example, exposure to O2 drives the outward diffusion of Ni in PtNi nanoparticles and oxidizes it to NiO. The lower surface energy of the oxide compared to Pt, combined with strong metal-oxide interactions, leads to encapsulation of Pt surfaces by the NiO layer.

These reversible structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure directly affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. The ability to control surface segregation through reaction conditions allows for tuning of the catalyst surface for specific applications. For instance, a Pt-rich surface may be desirable for certain reactions, while a 3d metal oxide-covered surface might be beneficial for others.

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of these bimetallic systems under reaction conditions highlights the importance of in-situ characterization for understanding true catalytic behavior. The reversible structural changes also suggest potential for regeneration or self-healing mechanisms in these catalysts, which could extend their lifetime and maintain performance over multiple reaction cycles.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响铂基双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。

在真空条件下，原子半径较大的金属倾向于发生表面偏析，以释放双金属表面的应变。在Pt-3d合金中，铂的原子半径远大于钴、镍和铜，这驱使铂向表面偏析。

然而，反应条件可以改变这种热力学偏好。在还原性气氛（如H2）中，铂仍然倾向于偏析到纳米粒子的外表面，形成铂皮层结构。这是由应变能最小化驱动的。

相比之下，氧化环境会促进不同的行为。氧气吸附可以诱导3d过渡金属向表面偏析，这是由于氧与这些金属之间的强键合作用。例如，暴露在O2中会驱使PtNi纳米粒子中的镍向外扩散并氧化成NiO。与铂相比，氧化物的表面能较低，再加上强烈的金属-氧化物相互作用，导致NiO层包覆铂表面。

这些可逆的结构变化对催化性能有重要影响。表面组成和结构直接影响催化活性和选择性。通过反应条件控制表面偏析的能力允许针对特定应用调整催化剂表面。例如，某些反应可能需要富铂表面，而另一些反应可能受益于3d金属氧化物覆盖的表面。

此外，这些双金属系统在反应条件下的动态特性突显了原位表征对理解真实催化行为的重要性。可逆的结构变化还暗示了这些催化剂具有再生或自愈机制的潜力，这可能延长其使用寿命并在多个反应周期中保持性能。

[1] "Compared to monometallic catalysts, the bimetallic catalysts present more structural complexity, where the two components could have various structural configurations. For example, bimetallic nanoparticles could have the structures of alloy, coreshell, and linked monometallic nanoparticles"

[2] "Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface. The surface segregation of Pt has been found in Pt-based bimetallic systems, such as PtCu [24], PtNi [17,2528], PtFe [29,30], and PtCo [29,31]. The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) [32] contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on Pt M catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]. Moreover, the 3d transition metals may become oxidized in the oxidative environments. Due to the low surface energy of most oxides (<1 J/m2) [35 37], the formed 3d transition metal oxides tend to encapsulate Pt surfaces (surface energy of Pt: 1.95 J/m2 [38])."

[4] "Based on the discussion, we suggest the following dynamic process at the PtNi nanoparticle surfaces upon the cycled oxidation and reduction treatments (Scheme 1). The treatment in H2 at 300 8C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy. Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 8C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metaloxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in the catalyst structure and composition, which in turn affect their catalytic properties and performance.

Under vacuum or reducing conditions (e.g., H2 atmosphere), there is a thermodynamic preference for Pt to segregate to the surface of the bimetallic nanoparticles. This is primarily driven by the larger atomic radius of Pt compared to 3d transition metals, which helps minimize strain energy at the surface. This results in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer or "Pt-skin" structure.

However, in oxidizing conditions (e.g., O2 atmosphere), the situation reverses. The 3d transition metals tend to segregate to the surface due to their strong affinity for oxygen. These metals then become oxidized, forming a layer of metal oxide (e.g., NiO, CoO, or CuO) that encapsulates the Pt-rich core. This encapsulation is driven by the lower surface energy of the metal oxides compared to Pt.

These structural changes are reversible and can occur cyclically as the reaction environment alternates between reducing and oxidizing conditions. This dynamic behavior has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition: The active surface of the catalyst can switch between Pt-rich and 3d metal oxide-rich, potentially altering the types of reactions it can catalyze effectively.

2. Active site availability: The encapsulation of Pt by metal oxides in oxidizing conditions may reduce the number of available Pt active sites, potentially affecting reactions that rely on Pt catalysis.

3. Synergistic effects: The formation of core-shell structures or the proximity of Pt to metal oxides can create unique catalytic environments, potentially enhancing activity or selectivity for certain reactions.

4. Stability and longevity: While these structural changes are generally reversible, repeated cycling between different structures could potentially lead to catalyst degradation over time.

5. Reaction-specific optimization: Understanding these dynamics allows for potential tuning of catalyst composition and reaction conditions to maintain optimal catalytic performance for specific applications.

These findings highlight the complex and dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions. They underscore the importance of considering not just the initial catalyst composition, but also how the catalyst structure may evolve under different reaction environments when designing and optimizing catalytic systems for various applications.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了基于Pt的双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素导致催化剂结构和成分的动态变化，进而影响其催化性能和表现。

在真空或还原条件下（如H2环境），Pt倾向于偏析到双金属纳米粒子的表面。这主要是由Pt相对于3d过渡金属较大的原子半径驱动的，有助于最小化表面应变能。这导致形成富Pt表面层或"Pt皮层"结构。

然而，在氧化条件下（如O2环境），情况则相反。3d过渡金属由于对氧的强亲和力而倾向于偏析到表面。这些金属随后被氧化，形成金属氧化物层（如NiO、CoO或CuO），包覆富Pt的核心。这种包覆是由金属氧化物相对于Pt较低的表面能驱动的。

这些结构变化是可逆的，并可在还原和氧化条件交替的反应环境中周期性发生。这种动态行为对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 表面组成：催化剂的活性表面可以在富Pt和富3d金属氧化物之间切换，可能改变其有效催化的反应类型。

2. 活性位可用性：氧化条件下金属氧化物对Pt的包覆可能减少可用的Pt活性位，潜在影响依赖Pt催化的反应。

3. 协同效应：核壳结构的形成或Pt与金属氧化物的邻近可创造独特的催化环境，可能增强某些反应的活性或选择性。

4. 稳定性和寿命：虽然这些结构变化通常是可逆的，但长期在不同结构之间反复循环可能导致催化剂随时间降解。

5. 反应特定优化：理解这些动态变化允许通过调整催化剂组成和反应条件，为特定应用维持最佳催化性能。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的复杂和动态性质。它们突出了在设计和优化各种应用的催化系统时，不仅要考虑初始催化剂组成，还要考虑催化剂结构在不同反应环境下如何演变的重要性。

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation is driven by strain relief, favoring the metal with the larger atomic radius (typically Pt) to segregate to the surface. In hydrogen atmospheres, this tendency persists as H2 does not significantly alter the thermodynamic driving forces.

However, in oxidizing environments, the situation changes dramatically. Oxygen adsorption can induce segregation of 3d transition metals to the surface due to their strong bonding with oxygen. Furthermore, when oxidized, these 3d metals (e.g., NiO) tend to encapsulate the Pt surface due to their lower surface energy and strong interaction with Pt.

These structural changes are reversible and depend on the redox potential of the reaction gases. This dynamic behavior has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure of the catalyst can change during reactions, potentially altering active sites and catalytic activity. This adaptability could be beneficial in some applications, allowing the catalyst to optimize its structure for different reaction steps. However, it also introduces complexity in predicting and controlling catalyst behavior under varying conditions.

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for designing and optimizing Pt-based bimetallic catalysts for various applications, such as fuel cells and catalytic reforming reactions. It suggests that catalyst performance should be evaluated under realistic operating conditions, as the structure observed ex-situ may not reflect the active state of the catalyst.

在真空条件下，表面偏析由应变释放驱动，倾向于原子半径较大的金属（通常是铂）偏析到表面。在氢气环境中，这种趋势仍然存在，因为氢气不会显著改变热力学驱动力。

这些结构变化是可逆的，取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。这种动态行为对催化性能和性能有重要影响。催化剂的表面成分和结构可能在反应过程中发生变化，可能改变活性位点和催化活性。这种适应性在某些应用中可能是有益的，允许催化剂为不同的反应步骤优化其结构。然而，这也在预测和控制催化剂在不同条件下的行为方面引入了复杂性。

理解这些动态过程对于设计和优化用于各种应用的基于铂的双金属催化剂至关重要，如燃料电池和催化重整反应。这表明应该在实际操作条件下评估催化剂性能，因为在非原位观察到的结构可能不能反映催化剂的活性状态。
