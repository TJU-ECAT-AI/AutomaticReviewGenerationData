[1] "Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces. Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface."

[2] "The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on PtM catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals"

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt, the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

[5] "The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy."

[6] "Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 °C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metal–oxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. 

Under vacuum conditions, surface segregation of the metal with the larger atomic radius is preferred to release strain at the bimetallic surface. In Pt-3d alloys, Pt has a much larger atomic radius compared to Co, Ni, and Cu, which drives Pt segregation to the surface.

However, reaction conditions can alter this thermodynamic preference. In reducing atmospheres like H2, Pt still tends to segregate to the outer surfaces of the nanoparticles, forming a Pt-skin structure. This is driven by the minimization of strain energy.

In contrast, oxidizing environments promote different behavior. Oxygen adsorption can induce segregation of 3d transition metals to the surface due to strong bonding between oxygen and these metals. For example, exposure to O2 drives the outward diffusion of Ni in PtNi nanoparticles and oxidizes it to NiO. The lower surface energy of the oxide compared to Pt, combined with strong metal-oxide interactions, leads to encapsulation of Pt surfaces by the NiO layer.

These reversible structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance. The surface composition and structure directly affect the catalytic activity and selectivity. The ability to control surface segregation through reaction conditions allows for tuning of the catalyst surface for specific applications. For instance, a Pt-rich surface may be desirable for certain reactions, while a 3d metal oxide-covered surface might be beneficial for others.

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of these bimetallic systems under reaction conditions highlights the importance of in-situ characterization for understanding true catalytic behavior. The reversible structural changes also suggest potential for regeneration or self-healing mechanisms in these catalysts, which could extend their lifetime and maintain performance over multiple reaction cycles.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响铂基双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。

在真空条件下，原子半径较大的金属倾向于发生表面偏析，以释放双金属表面的应变。在Pt-3d合金中，铂的原子半径远大于钴、镍和铜，这驱使铂向表面偏析。

然而，反应条件可以改变这种热力学偏好。在还原性气氛（如H2）中，铂仍然倾向于偏析到纳米粒子的外表面，形成铂皮层结构。这是由应变能最小化驱动的。

相比之下，氧化环境会促进不同的行为。氧气吸附可以诱导3d过渡金属向表面偏析，这是由于氧与这些金属之间的强键合作用。例如，暴露在O2中会驱使PtNi纳米粒子中的镍向外扩散并氧化成NiO。与铂相比，氧化物的表面能较低，再加上强烈的金属-氧化物相互作用，导致NiO层包覆铂表面。

这些可逆的结构变化对催化性能有重要影响。表面组成和结构直接影响催化活性和选择性。通过反应条件控制表面偏析的能力允许针对特定应用调整催化剂表面。例如，某些反应可能需要富铂表面，而另一些反应可能受益于3d金属氧化物覆盖的表面。

此外，这些双金属系统在反应条件下的动态特性突显了原位表征对理解真实催化行为的重要性。可逆的结构变化还暗示了这些催化剂具有再生或自愈机制的潜力，这可能延长其使用寿命并在多个反应周期中保持性能。
