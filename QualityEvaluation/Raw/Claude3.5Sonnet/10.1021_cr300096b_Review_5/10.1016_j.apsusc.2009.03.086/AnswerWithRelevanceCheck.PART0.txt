          [1] "Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces. Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface."

[2] "The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 A) than those of Co (1.25 A), Ni (1.24 A), and Cu (1.28 A) [32] contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on PtM catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals [16,33,34]."

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt [8,9,39,40], the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

[5] "The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy."

[6] "Exposure of the PtNi nanoparticles to O2 at 300 °C, however, drives the outward diffusion of Ni to the surfaces and oxidizes Ni to NiO. Strong metal–oxide interaction and reduction in surface energy induces encapsulation of Pt with NiO overlayers."

[7] "The mass transport processes, which are active in the oxidation or reduction reactions, are fully reversible depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases."

          Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys. These factors lead to dynamic changes in catalyst structure and composition, affecting their catalytic properties and performance.

Under vacuum or reducing conditions (e.g., H2 atmosphere), there is a thermodynamic preference for Pt to segregate to the surface of bimetallic nanoparticles. This is primarily driven by Pt's larger atomic radius compared to 3d transition metals, which helps minimize strain energy at the surface. This results in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer or "Pt-skin" structure.

In oxidizing conditions (e.g., O2 atmosphere), the situation reverses. The 3d transition metals tend to segregate to the surface due to their strong affinity for oxygen. These metals then become oxidized, forming a layer of metal oxide (e.g., NiO) that encapsulates the Pt-rich core. This encapsulation is driven by the lower surface energy of the metal oxides compared to Pt and strong metal-oxide interactions.

These structural changes are reversible and can occur cyclically as the reaction environment alternates between reducing and oxidizing conditions. The mass transport processes active in oxidation or reduction reactions are fully reversible, depending on the redox potential of the reaction gases.

This dynamic behavior has significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. Surface composition and active sites can change during reactions, potentially altering catalytic activity and selectivity.
2. The formation of Pt-skin structures in reducing environments can enhance certain catalytic reactions that prefer Pt-rich surfaces.
3. In oxidizing conditions, the segregation of 3d metals and oxide formation can create unique catalytic environments, potentially enhancing activity or selectivity for certain reactions.
4. The reversible nature of these changes allows for potential in-situ tuning of catalyst properties by manipulating reaction conditions.
5. Long-term catalyst stability and performance may be affected by repeated structural changes in cyclic oxidation-reduction processes.

Understanding and controlling these dynamic processes is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, such as fuel cells, catalytic reforming, and emission control systems. It also highlights the importance of evaluating catalyst performance under realistic operating conditions, as the structure observed ex-situ may not reflect the active state of the catalyst.

          热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了基于Pt的双金属催化剂，特别是Pt-3d合金的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。这些因素导致催化剂结构和成分的动态变化，进而影响其催化性能和表现。

在真空或还原条件下（如H2环境），Pt倾向于偏析到双金属纳米粒子的表面。这主要是由Pt相对于3d过渡金属较大的原子半径驱动的，有助于最小化表面应变能。这导致形成富Pt表面层或"Pt皮层"结构。

然而，在氧化条件下（如O2环境），情况则相反。3d过渡金属由于对氧的强亲和力而倾向于偏析到表面。这些金属随后被氧化，形成金属氧化物层（如NiO），包覆富Pt的核心。这种包覆是由金属氧化物相对于Pt较低的表面能和强金属-氧化物相互作用驱动的。

这些结构变化是可逆的，并可在还原和氧化条件交替的反应环境中周期性发生。氧化或还原反应中活跃的质量传输过程是完全可逆的，取决于反应气体的氧化还原电位。

这种动态行为对催化性能有重要影响：

1. 表面组成和活性位可能在反应过程中发生变化，潜在地改变催化活性和选择性。
2. 在还原环境中形成的Pt皮层结构可以增强某些需要富Pt表面的催化反应。
3. 在氧化条件下，3d金属的偏析和氧化物形成可以创造独特的催化环境，可能增强某些反应的活性或选择性。
4. 这些变化的可逆性允许通过操纵反应条件来实现催化剂性能的原位调节。
5. 在循环氧化-还原过程中，重复的结构变化可能影响催化剂的长期稳定性和性能。

理解和控制这些动态过程对于优化各种应用中的催化剂性能至关重要，如燃料电池、催化重整和排放控制系统。它也突显了在实际操作条件下评估催化剂性能的重要性，因为在非原位观察到的结构可能不能反映催化剂的活性状态。
