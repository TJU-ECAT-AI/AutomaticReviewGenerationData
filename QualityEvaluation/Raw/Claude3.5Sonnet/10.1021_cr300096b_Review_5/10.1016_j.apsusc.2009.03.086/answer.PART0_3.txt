[1] "Surface segregation has been often observed in many bimetallic surfaces. Under vacuum conditions, the surface segregation of a metal with larger atomic radius is preferred in order to release strain at the bimetallic surface."

[2] "The much larger atomic radius of Pt (1.39 Å) than those of Co (1.25 Å), Ni (1.24 Å), and Cu (1.28 Å) contributes to the surface segregation process."

[3] "Previous theoretical and experimental works have shown that adsorption of oxygen on PtM catalyst surfaces could induce segregation of 3d transition metals onto the top surface owing to strong bonding between oxygen and 3d transition metals."

[4] "Due to the lower surface energy of NiO than Pt and the strong interaction between NiO and Pt, the formed NiO should encapsulate Pt surfaces at this temperature."

[5] "The treatment in H2 at 300 °C reduces Pt and Ni components to metallic state. Pt tends to segregate to outer surfaces of PtNi nanoparticles and Pt-skin structure forms, which is driven by minimization of the strain energy."

Thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions significantly influence the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of bimetallic catalysts, especially in Pt-based systems like Pt-3d alloys.

In vacuum conditions, surface segregation is driven by atomic size differences. Pt, with its larger atomic radius, tends to segregate to the surface of Pt-3d alloys to minimize strain energy. This leads to the formation of Pt-rich surfaces or "Pt-skin" structures in reducing environments like H2.

However, reaction conditions can alter this behavior. In oxidizing environments (O2), 3d transition metals tend to segregate to the surface due to their strong bonding with oxygen. Furthermore, when oxidized, these 3d metals (e.g., NiO) can encapsulate Pt surfaces due to their lower surface energy and strong interaction with Pt.

These dynamic structural changes have significant implications for catalytic properties and performance:

1. The surface composition and structure of the catalyst can change reversibly depending on the reaction environment, affecting active site availability and reactivity.

2. The formation of Pt-skin structures in reducing environments can enhance certain catalytic reactions that prefer Pt-rich surfaces.

3. In oxidizing conditions, the segregation of 3d metals and potential oxide formation can alter catalytic activity and selectivity.

4. The reversible nature of these changes allows for potential in-situ tuning of catalyst properties by manipulating reaction conditions.

5. Long-term catalyst stability and performance may be affected by repeated structural changes in cyclic oxidation-reduction processes.

Understanding and controlling these dynamic processes is crucial for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, such as fuel cells, catalytic reforming, and emission control systems.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响双金属催化剂的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型，尤其是在基于Pt的系统中，如Pt-3d合金。

在真空条件下，表面偏析主要由原子大小差异驱动。由于Pt的原子半径较大，它倾向于在Pt-3d合金表面偏析以最小化应变能。这导致在还原环境（如H2）中形成富Pt表面或"Pt皮层"结构。

然而，反应条件可以改变这种行为。在氧化环境（O2）中，3d过渡金属倾向于偏析到表面，因为它们与氧的强键合。此外，当被氧化时，这些3d金属（如NiO）可以包覆Pt表面，这是由于它们较低的表面能和与Pt的强相互作用。

这些动态结构变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响：

1. 催化剂的表面组成和结构可以根据反应环境可逆地改变，影响活性位的可用性和反应性。

2. 在还原环境中形成的Pt皮层结构可以增强某些需要富Pt表面的催化反应。

3. 在氧化条件下，3d金属的偏析和潜在的氧化物形成可以改变催化活性和选择性。

4. 这些变化的可逆性允许通过操纵反应条件来实现催化剂性能的原位调节。

5. 在循环氧化-还原过程中，重复的结构变化可能影响催化剂的长期稳定性和性能。

理解和控制这些动态过程对于优化各种应用中的催化剂性能至关重要，如燃料电池、催化重整和排放控制系统。
