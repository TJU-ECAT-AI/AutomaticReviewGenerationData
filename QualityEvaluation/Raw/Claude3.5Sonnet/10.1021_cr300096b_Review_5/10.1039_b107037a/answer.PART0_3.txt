[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

[4] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[5] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

The literature provides insights into the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts under electrochemical conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer. This process is influenced by the applied potential, with potential cycling accelerating Fe dissolution and promoting Pt rearrangement at the surface.

The formation of a Pt skin layer through surface segregation has significant implications for catalytic properties. The modified electronic structure of the surface layer exhibits enhanced CO tolerance for H2 oxidation and O2 reduction reactions, which are crucial for fuel cell applications. The Pt skin layer also serves to protect the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, improving the catalyst's stability.

Structural reconfiguration of the surface occurs over time, as evidenced by in situ STM imaging. The initial rough, cauliflower-like surface evolves into a more ordered structure with oriented crystalline steps and terraces. This reorganization leads to the formation of predominantly (111)-oriented facets, which can affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

These observations highlight how reaction conditions, particularly the electrolyte environment and applied potential, influence the thermodynamic preferences of the bimetallic system. The preferential dissolution of Fe and surface segregation of Pt demonstrate the system's tendency to minimize surface energy under these conditions. The resulting Pt-rich surface with specific crystallographic orientations has direct consequences for the catalyst's performance in electrochemical applications, particularly in fuel cells where CO tolerance and stability are critical factors.

文献为我们提供了关于Pt-Fe双金属催化剂在电化学条件下的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型的见解。在酸性电解质溶液中，Fe原子倾向于从PtFe合金中浸出，导致形成富Pt的表面层。这个过程受到所施加电位的影响，电位循环加速了Fe的溶解并促进了Pt在表面的重排。

通过表面偏析形成的Pt皮层对催化性能有重要影响。表面层的改变后的电子结构表现出对H2氧化和O2还原反应增强的CO耐受性，这对燃料电池应用至关重要。Pt皮层还可以保护下层的PtFe合金免受进一步腐蚀，提高催化剂的稳定性。

表面的结构重构随时间发生，这一点通过原位STM成像得到证实。初始的粗糙、花菜状表面逐渐演变为具有定向晶体台阶和平台的更有序结构。这种重组导致了以(111)取向为主的晶面的形成，这可能影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

这些观察结果强调了反应条件，特别是电解质环境和施加电位，如何影响双金属系统的热力学偏好。Fe的优先溶解和Pt的表面偏析表明，该系统在这些条件下倾向于最小化表面能。由此产生的富Pt表面及其特定的晶体学取向对催化剂在电化学应用中的性能有直接影响，特别是在燃料电池中，CO耐受性和稳定性是关键因素。
