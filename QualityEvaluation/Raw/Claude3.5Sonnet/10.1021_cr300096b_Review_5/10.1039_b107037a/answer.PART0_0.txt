[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

[4] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[5] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as PtFe alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with modified electronic structure. This process is driven by the thermodynamic preference for Pt to remain stable in acidic conditions.

Reaction conditions, such as potential cycling, further promote the dissolution of Fe and rearrangement of Pt atoms at the surface. This results in the formation of a protective Pt skin layer over the underlying PtFe alloy, which enhances corrosion resistance. The surface undergoes significant morphological changes during this process, transitioning from a rough, cauliflower-like structure to well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures.

These structural changes have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-rich surface layer exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2 oxidation and O2 reduction, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. The formation of oriented crystalline steps and terraces also likely influences the catalytic activity by providing specific active sites for reactions.

The study demonstrates that the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions leads to dynamic changes in the catalyst surface structure. This understanding is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cells where stability and specific catalytic properties are essential.

Pt基双金属催化剂（如PtFe合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的显著影响。在酸性电解质溶液中，Fe原子倾向于从PtFe合金中浸出，导致形成具有改变电子结构的Pt富集表面层。这个过程是由Pt在酸性条件下保持稳定的热力学偏好驱动的。

反应条件，如电位循环，进一步促进了Fe的溶解和Pt原子在表面的重排。这导致在底层PtFe合金上形成保护性Pt皮层，增强了耐腐蚀性。在这个过程中，表面经历了显著的形态变化，从粗糙的花菜状结构转变为有序的(111)取向面，具有台阶-平台结构。

这些结构变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响。Pt富集表面层对H2氧化和O2还原表现出高CO耐受性，这对燃料电池应用有利。有序晶体台阶和平台的形成也可能通过提供特定的活性位点影响催化活性。

该研究表明，热力学偏好和反应条件之间的相互作用导致催化剂表面结构发生动态变化。这种理解对于设计和优化各种应用中的双金属催化剂至关重要，特别是在燃料电池中，稳定性和特定的催化性能是必不可少的。
