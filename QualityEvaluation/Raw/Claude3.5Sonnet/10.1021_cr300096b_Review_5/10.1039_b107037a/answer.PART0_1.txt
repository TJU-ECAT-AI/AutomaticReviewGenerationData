[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

[4] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[5] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as PtFe alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with modified electronic structure. This process is driven by the higher stability of Pt atoms in acidic environments compared to Fe atoms.

Electrochemical cycling further promotes the dissolution of Fe and rearrangement of Pt atoms at the surface, resulting in the formation of a protective Pt skin layer. This surface segregation process is influenced by the applied potential and the number of potential cycles. The Pt skin layer exhibits a well-ordered structure, with predominantly (111)-oriented facets and terrace-step formations.

The structural changes in the catalyst surface have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-rich surface layer formed after Fe dissolution exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2 oxidation and O2 reduction, which is crucial for fuel cell applications. The formation of oriented crystalline steps and terraces on the surface can also affect the catalytic activity by providing more active sites for reactions.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of understanding surface restructuring processes for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells.

热力学偏好和反应条件显著影响了基于Pt的双金属催化剂（如PtFe合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型。在酸性电解质溶液中，Fe原子倾向于从PtFe合金中溶出，导致形成具有改变了的电子结构的富Pt表面层。这一过程是由Pt原子在酸性环境中比Fe原子具有更高的稳定性驱动的。

电化学循环进一步促进了Fe的溶解和表面Pt原子的重排，形成了保护性的Pt皮层。这种表面偏析过程受施加电位和电位循环次数的影响。Pt皮层呈现出有序结构，主要为(111)取向的晶面和台阶-阶梯结构。

催化剂表面的结构变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响。Fe溶解后形成的富Pt表面层对H2氧化和O2还原表现出高CO耐受性，这对燃料电池应用至关重要。表面形成的有序晶体台阶和阶梯也可能通过提供更多的活性位点来影响催化活性。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性，并强调了理解表面重构过程对优化催化剂在各种应用（尤其是燃料电池）中的性能的重要性。
