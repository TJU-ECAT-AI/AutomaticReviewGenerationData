[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as PtFe alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with modified electronic structure. This process is driven by the thermodynamic preference for Pt to remain stable in acidic conditions.

Reaction conditions, such as potential cycling, further promote the dissolution of Fe and rearrangement of Pt atoms at the surface. This results in the formation of a protective Pt skin layer over the underlying PtFe alloy, which enhances corrosion resistance. The surface undergoes significant morphological changes during this process, transitioning from a rough, cauliflower-like structure to well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures.

These structural changes have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-rich surface layer exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2 oxidation and O2 reduction, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. The formation of oriented crystalline steps and terraces also likely influences the catalytic activity by providing specific active sites for reactions.

The study demonstrates that the interplay between thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions leads to dynamic changes in the catalyst surface structure. This understanding is crucial for designing and optimizing bimetallic catalysts for various applications, particularly in fuel cells where stability and specific catalytic properties are essential.

Pt基双金属催化剂（如PtFe合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型受热力学偏好和反应条件的显著影响。在酸性电解质溶液中，Fe原子倾向于从PtFe合金中浸出，导致形成具有改变电子结构的Pt富集表面层。这个过程是由Pt在酸性条件下保持稳定的热力学偏好驱动的。

反应条件，如电位循环，进一步促进了Fe的溶解和Pt原子在表面的重排。这导致在底层PtFe合金上形成保护性Pt皮层，增强了耐腐蚀性。在这个过程中，表面经历了显著的形态变化，从粗糙的花菜状结构转变为有序的(111)取向面，具有台阶-平台结构。

这些结构变化对催化性能和性能有重要影响。Pt富集表面层对H2氧化和O2还原表现出高CO耐受性，这对燃料电池应用有利。有序晶体台阶和平台的形成也可能通过提供特定的活性位点影响催化活性。

该研究表明，热力学偏好和反应条件之间的相互作用导致催化剂表面结构发生动态变化。这种理解对于设计和优化各种应用中的双金属催化剂至关重要，特别是在燃料电池中，稳定性和特定的催化性能是必不可少的。

In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with modified electronic structure. This process is driven by the higher stability of Pt atoms in acidic environments compared to Fe atoms.

Electrochemical cycling further promotes the dissolution of Fe and rearrangement of Pt atoms at the surface, resulting in the formation of a protective Pt skin layer. This surface segregation process is influenced by the applied potential and the number of potential cycles. The Pt skin layer exhibits a well-ordered structure, with predominantly (111)-oriented facets and terrace-step formations.

The structural changes in the catalyst surface have important implications for catalytic properties and performance. The Pt-rich surface layer formed after Fe dissolution exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2 oxidation and O2 reduction, which is crucial for fuel cell applications. The formation of oriented crystalline steps and terraces on the surface can also affect the catalytic activity by providing more active sites for reactions.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of understanding surface restructuring processes for optimizing catalyst performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells.

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as PtFe alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer. This process is enhanced by potential cycling, which increases Fe dissolution and promotes Pt rearrangement at the surface.

The formation of a Pt skin layer through this selective dissolution process has important implications for catalytic properties. The modified electronic structure of the surface layer exhibits improved CO tolerance for H2 oxidation and O2 reduction reactions, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Additionally, the Pt skin layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst.

The structural reconfiguration of the surface is not limited to compositional changes. Over time, the surface morphology evolves from a rough, cauliflower-like structure to well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures. This reorganization process involves the formation of oriented crystalline steps and the appearance of terraces, which can significantly affect the catalytic properties of the surface.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of understanding surface segregation and restructuring processes for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells.

热力学偏好和反应条件对基于铂的双金属催化剂（如铂铁合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。在电解质溶液中，铁原子倾向于从合金中溶出，导致形成富铂表面层。这个过程通过电位循环而得到增强，电位循环增加了铁的溶解并促进了表面铂的重排。

通过这种选择性溶解过程形成的铂皮层对催化性能有重要影响。表面层的改变后的电子结构表现出对氢氧化和氧还原反应的改进的一氧化碳耐受性，这对燃料电池应用有益。此外，铂皮层保护了下层的铂铁合金免受进一步腐蚀，提高了催化剂的整体稳定性。

表面的结构重构不仅限于成分变化。随着时间的推移，表面形态从粗糙的花菜状结构演变为具有阶梯结构的有序（111）取向面。这个重组过程涉及有序晶体台阶的形成和平台的出现，这可能会显著影响表面的催化性能。

The literature provides insights into the stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-Fe bimetallic catalysts under electrochemical conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer. This process is influenced by the applied potential, with potential cycling accelerating Fe dissolution and promoting Pt rearrangement at the surface.

The formation of a Pt skin layer through surface segregation has significant implications for catalytic properties. The modified electronic structure of the surface layer exhibits enhanced CO tolerance for H2 oxidation and O2 reduction reactions, which are crucial for fuel cell applications. The Pt skin layer also serves to protect the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, improving the catalyst's stability.

Structural reconfiguration of the surface occurs over time, as evidenced by in situ STM imaging. The initial rough, cauliflower-like surface evolves into a more ordered structure with oriented crystalline steps and terraces. This reorganization leads to the formation of predominantly (111)-oriented facets, which can affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity.

These observations highlight how reaction conditions, particularly the electrolyte environment and applied potential, influence the thermodynamic preferences of the bimetallic system. The preferential dissolution of Fe and surface segregation of Pt demonstrate the system's tendency to minimize surface energy under these conditions. The resulting Pt-rich surface with specific crystallographic orientations has direct consequences for the catalyst's performance in electrochemical applications, particularly in fuel cells where CO tolerance and stability are critical factors.

文献为我们提供了关于Pt-Fe双金属催化剂在电化学条件下的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型的见解。在酸性电解质溶液中，Fe原子倾向于从PtFe合金中浸出，导致形成富Pt的表面层。这个过程受到所施加电位的影响，电位循环加速了Fe的溶解并促进了Pt在表面的重排。

通过表面偏析形成的Pt皮层对催化性能有重要影响。表面层的改变后的电子结构表现出对H2氧化和O2还原反应增强的CO耐受性，这对燃料电池应用至关重要。Pt皮层还可以保护下层的PtFe合金免受进一步腐蚀，提高催化剂的稳定性。

表面的结构重构随时间发生，这一点通过原位STM成像得到证实。初始的粗糙、花菜状表面逐渐演变为具有定向晶体台阶和平台的更有序结构。这种重组导致了以(111)取向为主的晶面的形成，这可能影响催化剂的活性和选择性。

这些观察结果强调了反应条件，特别是电解质环境和施加电位，如何影响双金属系统的热力学偏好。Fe的优先溶解和Pt的表面偏析表明，该系统在这些条件下倾向于最小化表面能。由此产生的富Pt表面及其特定的晶体学取向对催化剂在电化学应用中的性能有直接影响，特别是在燃料电池中，CO耐受性和稳定性是关键因素。

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys like PtFe, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, resulting in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer. This process is driven by the electrochemical potential cycling, which promotes the dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface.

The formation of this Pt-rich surface layer, often referred to as a "Pt skin," has important implications for the catalyst's properties and performance. The modified electronic structure of this surface layer exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2 oxidation or O2 reduction, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications.

The structural reconfiguration of the surface is not limited to compositional changes. As revealed by in situ STM imaging, the surface undergoes significant morphological changes over time. Initially rough surfaces with cauliflower-like features evolve into more ordered structures with crystalline steps and terraces. Notably, well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures are observed after prolonged exposure to the electrolyte and potential cycling.

These structural changes have important consequences for the catalyst's performance. The formation of (111)-oriented facets, which are known to be particularly active for certain reactions, can enhance the catalyst's activity. Additionally, the development of a pure Pt skin layer can protect the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, potentially improving the catalyst's long-term stability.

In summary, the thermodynamic driving forces and reaction conditions in acidic environments promote surface segregation in Pt-3d alloys, leading to Pt-rich surfaces with distinct structural features. These changes significantly influence the catalytic properties, potentially enhancing activity and stability for applications such as fuel cells.

这些结构变化对催化剂的性能有重要影响。(111)取向晶面的形成（已知对某些反应特别活跃）可以提高催化剂的活性。此外，纯Pt皮层的形成可以保护下层的PtFe合金免受进一步腐蚀，可能提高催化剂的长期稳定性。

总之，酸性环境中的热力学驱动力和反应条件促进了Pt-3d合金中的表面偏析，导致形成具有独特结构特征的富Pt表面。这些变化显著影响催化性能，可能提高燃料电池等应用中的活性和稳定性。
