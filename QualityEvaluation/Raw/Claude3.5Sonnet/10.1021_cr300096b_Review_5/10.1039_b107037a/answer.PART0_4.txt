[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "Previous electrochemistry, XPS37 and EQCN13 experiments indicated that the Fe atoms leached out from the film in acid solution after a series of potential cycles and finally resulted in a pure Pt skin layer."

[3] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[4] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

[5] "After a further 8 min, Fig. 2D, an expanded image shown in Fig. 2E was acquired in which well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structure are observed."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-3d alloys like PtFe, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In acidic electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the PtFe alloy, resulting in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer. This process is driven by the electrochemical potential cycling, which promotes the dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface.

The formation of this Pt-rich surface layer, often referred to as a "Pt skin," has important implications for the catalyst's properties and performance. The modified electronic structure of this surface layer exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2 oxidation or O2 reduction, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications.

The structural reconfiguration of the surface is not limited to compositional changes. As revealed by in situ STM imaging, the surface undergoes significant morphological changes over time. Initially rough surfaces with cauliflower-like features evolve into more ordered structures with crystalline steps and terraces. Notably, well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures are observed after prolonged exposure to the electrolyte and potential cycling.

These structural changes have important consequences for the catalyst's performance. The formation of (111)-oriented facets, which are known to be particularly active for certain reactions, can enhance the catalyst's activity. Additionally, the development of a pure Pt skin layer can protect the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, potentially improving the catalyst's long-term stability.

In summary, the thermodynamic driving forces and reaction conditions in acidic environments promote surface segregation in Pt-3d alloys, leading to Pt-rich surfaces with distinct structural features. These changes significantly influence the catalytic properties, potentially enhancing activity and stability for applications such as fuel cells.

热力学偏好和反应条件对基于Pt的双金属催化剂（尤其是Pt-3d合金如PtFe）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。在酸性电解质溶液中，Fe原子倾向于从PtFe合金中浸出，导致形成富Pt表面层。这个过程是由电化学电位循环驱动的，促进了Fe的溶解和Pt在表面的重排。

这种富Pt表面层（通常称为"Pt皮层"）的形成对催化剂的性能和表现有重要影响。这种表面层的改变电子结构表现出对H2氧化或O2还原的高CO耐受性，这对燃料电池应用有利。

表面的结构重构不仅限于成分变化。原位STM成像显示，表面随时间发生显著的形态变化。最初粗糙的花菜状表面逐渐演变为更有序的结构，出现晶体台阶和平台。值得注意的是，在长时间暴露于电解质和电位循环后，观察到具有台阶-平台结构的有序(111)取向晶面。

这些结构变化对催化剂的性能有重要影响。(111)取向晶面的形成（已知对某些反应特别活跃）可以提高催化剂的活性。此外，纯Pt皮层的形成可以保护下层的PtFe合金免受进一步腐蚀，可能提高催化剂的长期稳定性。

总之，酸性环境中的热力学驱动力和反应条件促进了Pt-3d合金中的表面偏析，导致形成具有独特结构特征的富Pt表面。这些变化显著影响催化性能，可能提高燃料电池等应用中的活性和稳定性。
