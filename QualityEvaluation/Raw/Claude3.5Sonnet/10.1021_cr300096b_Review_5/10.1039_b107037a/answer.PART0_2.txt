[1] "By using XPS, they found for a PtFe alloy film that Fe atoms leached out into solution and formed a surface layer on the film with a modified electronic structure, which exhibits high CO-tolerance towards H2oxidation or O2reduction."

[2] "From previous results using an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal nanobalance (EQCN), it is known that Fe and Pt atoms dissolve and Pt atoms are re-deposited on the surface when the film is immersed in solution."

[3] "This result shows that the potential cycles lead to increased dissolution of Fe and the rearrangement of Pt at the surface and formation of a Pt skin layer, protecting the underlying PtFe alloy from corrosion."

[4] "After ten potential cycles between 0.05 and 0.95 V, the electrode potential was held at 0.5 V. A set of STM images was acquired at the same manification as in Fig. 2A and B. Fig. 2CE show the change of surface morphologies with time."

[5] "It is clear that the edges which were formed occasionally on the film surface, as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2C, have become oriented crystalline steps. Several terraces also appear."

The stability, surface segregation, and structural configuration of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, such as PtFe alloys, are significantly influenced by thermodynamic preferences and reaction conditions. In electrolyte solutions, Fe atoms tend to leach out from the alloy, leading to the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer. This process is enhanced by potential cycling, which increases Fe dissolution and promotes Pt rearrangement at the surface.

The formation of a Pt skin layer through this selective dissolution process has important implications for catalytic properties. The modified electronic structure of the surface layer exhibits improved CO tolerance for H2 oxidation and O2 reduction reactions, which is beneficial for fuel cell applications. Additionally, the Pt skin layer protects the underlying PtFe alloy from further corrosion, enhancing the overall stability of the catalyst.

The structural reconfiguration of the surface is not limited to compositional changes. Over time, the surface morphology evolves from a rough, cauliflower-like structure to well-ordered (111)-oriented facets with terrace-step structures. This reorganization process involves the formation of oriented crystalline steps and the appearance of terraces, which can significantly affect the catalytic properties of the surface.

These findings highlight the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and emphasize the importance of understanding surface segregation and restructuring processes for optimizing catalytic performance in various applications, particularly in fuel cells.

热力学偏好和反应条件对基于铂的双金属催化剂（如铂铁合金）的稳定性、表面偏析和结构构型有显著影响。在电解质溶液中，铁原子倾向于从合金中溶出，导致形成富铂表面层。这个过程通过电位循环而得到增强，电位循环增加了铁的溶解并促进了表面铂的重排。

通过这种选择性溶解过程形成的铂皮层对催化性能有重要影响。表面层的改变后的电子结构表现出对氢氧化和氧还原反应的改进的一氧化碳耐受性，这对燃料电池应用有益。此外，铂皮层保护了下层的铂铁合金免受进一步腐蚀，提高了催化剂的整体稳定性。

表面的结构重构不仅限于成分变化。随着时间的推移，表面形态从粗糙的花菜状结构演变为具有阶梯结构的有序（111）取向面。这个重组过程涉及有序晶体台阶的形成和平台的出现，这可能会显著影响表面的催化性能。

这些发现强调了双金属催化剂在反应条件下的动态特性，并强调了理解表面偏析和重构过程对于优化各种应用（特别是燃料电池）中的催化性能的重要性。
