1. INTRODUCTION
Catalytic combustion has attracted much attention
due to the high combustion efficiency as well as the low
emission of air pollutants such as CO, NO
 
x
 
, and
unburned hydrocarbons [16]. For a long time, sup-
ported noble metal catalysts have generally been used
for methane combustion [7, 8]. However, supported
noble metal catalysts, although with outstanding activ-
ity, are not fully satisfactory based on the high price and
scarce resources. Therefore, there is a strong demand
for the development of new, thermally stable and low-
cost catalysts for the combustion of methane. Recently,
various transition metal oxide catalysts have been
investigated as a substitute for the noble metal catalysts
in methane combustion [911]. Several types of cata-
lysts have been developed at various stages; particular
attention is being paid to ceria-based catalysts, and spe-
cifically CeO
 
2
 
-containing mixed oxides having a fluo-
rite structure. Ceria has been widely used as a promoter
and an oxidation catalyst because of its unique redox
properties and high oxygen storage capacity [12, 13].
Nowadays, the rapid growth in applications and charac-
terization of CeO
 
2
 
-containing catalysts have been well
documented [14, 15]. The important role of ceria is
reported to be the generation and participation of sur-
face oxygen species and anionic vacancies in the cata-
lytic reactions [16]. Many studies have indicated that
these redox properties can be enhanced considerably if
additional elements are introduced into the CeO
 
2
 
 lattice
by forming solid solutions [17].
The pore sizes of mesoporous materials are usually

The reaction of methane combustion is carried out
in a conventional flow system under atmospheric pres-
sure. For each experiment, 0.1 g of catalyst (60

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

pore size distributions performed on the desorption

 position of the inflection points is related to
the diameter in the mesopore range, and the pore size
distribution plots indicate that the amount of doped Fe

is narrow and centered at 6.3 nm indicating the texture
uniformity of this sample. An increase in the pore size
and a broader size distribution are observed at an
increasing iron content for

catalysts. In addition, the specific surface area of
 
Ce
 
1 
 
 
 
 
x
 
Fe
 
x
 
O2 mixed oxides decreased from 38.4 to
5.1 m2/g with an increase in the Fe content, which indi-
cates that the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide has a higher spe-
cific surface area and narrow pore size distribution
when a small amount of Fe was doped.
3.2. XRD Patterns
The X-ray diffraction patterns of CeO2 and
Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide samples are shown in Fig. 2.
The XRD peaks for pure ceria are observed at 2θ =
28.8, 33.4, 47.7, and 56.7 corresponding to the
(1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), and (3 1 1) planes, respectively.
The diffraction peaks are characteristic of the cubic
ceria phase with fluorite structure (JCPDS card number
34-394). No diffraction peaks of α-Fe2O3 in
Ce1  xFexO2 catalysts are observed when x < 0.2, indi-
cating that α-Fe2O3 are highly dispersed in the catalyst
surface or pure (Fig. 2). It can be seen that the lattice
parameters of ceria decrease with the addition of Fe3+,
suggesting that some Fe3+ ions are incorporated into
ceria lattice to form solid solution of Ce1  xFexO2, as the
radius of Fe ion (0.060 nm) is smaller than that of Ce4+
ion (0.087 nm). Diffraction peaks of α-Fe2O3 in
Ce1  xFexO2 catalysts are observed at 2θ = 24.1, 35.6,
49.5, and 54.1 when x > 0.2, and the intensity of the
α-Fe2O3 diffraction peaks increases with increasing
content of Fe3+.
The average crystal grain size (D) of iron-substi-
tuted ceria powders, calculated by the Scherrer formula
from the XRD data, are listed in the table. As for x 
0.2, D are smaller than those of other catalysts; when
x > 0.2, D are larger, which may be caused by some
α-Fe2O3 aggregate in the surface of the catalysts.
3.3. UV-vis Diffuse Reflectance
The UV spectra of Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides, pure
CeO2 and Fe2O3 are presented in Fig. 3. The UV spectra
of NaO2 prepared by the sol-gel method show two
intense bands at 256 and 296 nm in Fig. 3, curve 1. The
distinct absorption bands are assigned to the O2 
Ce3+ and O2 
 Ce4+ charge transfer transitions [19].
Pure Fe2O3 shows a broad absorption feature around
560 nm in Fig. 3, curve 7. This absorption feature is a
characteristic of the dd transitions of octahedrally
coordinated Fe3+ ions [20].
Adding a small amount Fe3+ (x  0.2) to ceria does
not change the absorption features of the UV spectra of
ceria, which is likely attributed to the fact that Fe3+ has
been incorporated into the lattice of ceria forming
Ce1  xFexO2 solid solutions. The absorption band at
560 nm of α-Fe23 is observed when Fe3+ (x > 0.2) in

Ce1  xFexO2, indicating that some Fe3+ cannot be incor-
porated into the CeO2 lattice; the result is consistent
with the results of XRD.
3.4. Reduction Properties of the Catalysts
The H2-TPR profiles of CeO2, Fe2O3, and
Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides are shown in Fig. 4. The
reduction peak of pure CeO2 observed at the tempera-
ture of 635C is attributed to the reduction of surface
CeO2. The Fe2O3 TPR profile presents two peaks, sug-
gesting a two-step process. The first temperature signal,
at 439C, is attributed to the reduction of α-Fe23 to
Fe34, whereas the second one, at 674C, can be
ascribed to the reduction of Fe34 to Fe, which would
proceed through the following reaction steps [21]: H2 +
3α-Fe2O3 
 2Fe3O4 + H2O and Fe3O4 + 4H2 
3Fe + 4H2O. By contrast, the TPR profiles of the
Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides show a new peak at temper-
atures lower than 320C, which can be ascribed to the
reduction of adsorbed oxygen species. It was gener-
ally accepted that the formation of solid solution of
Ce1  xFexO2 by the incorporation of Fe3+ ions into the
ceria lattice would result in the generation of oxygen
vacancies, leading to adsorbed oxygen in oxygen
vacancies reducible by H2 at low temperature. It also
can be seen that the reduction temperature of ceria in
Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 mixed oxides shifts to a lower tempera-
ture, which indicates a higher mobility of the lattice
oxygen, while for Ce1  xFexO2 (x  0.2), the peak posi-
tion is almost unaffected by increasing the amount of
Fe2O3 from 20 to 50%. An increase in the intensity of
the peak areas is observed, which means that there are
more Ce4+ reduced to Ce3+, and all of these benefit the
combustion of methane. The peak at 749C for
Ce1  xFexO2 (x  0.3) can be ascribed to the reduction
of Fe2O3. The reduction shift to the higher temperature
of Fe2O3 can be ascribed to the strong interactions
between Fe and Ce.

3.5. Catalytic Activity
The catalytic behavior of the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed
oxide catalysts prepared by the sol-gel method have
been tested in the methane combustion reaction. In all
cases, carbon monoxide is not formed and the carbon
dioxide selectivity is almost 100%. Figure 5 showed the
catalytic combustion performance of the Ce1  xFexO2
mixed oxide catalysts. Obviously, the activity of
Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxides is better than that of single
Fe2O3 or CeO2. The temperatures for T10 (10% conver-
sion of methane) and T90 (90% conversion of methane)
for methane combustion over Ce0.9Fe0.12 are 388C
and 550C, respectively, which are 86 and 113C lower
than the corresponding temperatures of T10 or T90 over
CeO2. Although Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 is still a Ce-rich catalyst,
its conversion temperature of methane is far lower than
CeO2, indicating that the presence of a small amount of
Fe3+ can significantly enhance its activity. In conclu-
sion, it seems that what makes doped ceria more active
is the increase of oxygen mobility or more reducible
species, which is the result of introduction of defect
sites. In general, it is commonly accepted that the cata-
lytic activity in light alkane combustion is proportional
to the surface area and the amount of the incorporated
active components [22]. It can be seen that the BET
specific surface area of Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 and Ce0.8Fe0.2O2 is
significantly higher than those of others. Thus, it is
likely that the increased methane combustion activity is
strongly related to the much higher surface area of
Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. One can also see that Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 has a
narrow pore size distribution, which may be beneficial
to methane combustion.
It is reported that the methane combustion process is
according to a redox mechanism, for which several
kinetic models for the reaction rate have been proposed
[2327]. The rate is considered to be first-order in the
CH4 partial pressure, whereas the order with respect to
oxygen might be variable from 0 to 0.5. For a simple
first-order kinetic model, the reaction rate is
where k is the specific rate constant and 
 is the
methane partial pressure. By combining the design
equation for the plug-flow reactor and the Arrhenius
equation, the following relationship can be established
[28]:
ln[ln(1  X)] = lnA  Ea/RT,
where x is the CH4 conversion, A is the preexponential
factor, T is the reaction temperature in K, Ea is the
apparent activation energy, and R is the gas constant. A
plot of ln[ln(1  x)] versus 1/T is shown in Fig. 6. The
results fit the simple first-order model well. Apparent
activation energies of 85.94, 95.75, 109.92, 97.25, and
98.87 kJ/mol were calculated for the Ce0.9Fe0.1O2,
Ce0.8Fe0.2O2, 
Ce0.7Fe0.3O2, 
Ce0.6Fe0.4O2, 
and
Ce0.5Fe0.5O2, respectively. The slightly lower activation
energy measured for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 indicates the higher
activity of this system.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Mesoporous Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide catalysts
were prepared by the citric sol-gel method and micro-
wave technique. The catalysts exhibit remarkably high
catalytic activity in the catalytic methane combustion,
especially for Ce0.9Fe0.1O2. Combined BET, XRD,
DRS, and TPR results demonstrated that the superior
catalytic performance of the Ce1  xFexO2 mixed oxide
catalysts could be attributed to the generation of oxy-
gen vacancies, more reducible species, high surface
area, and moderate pore sizes by the formation of solid
solutions.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
