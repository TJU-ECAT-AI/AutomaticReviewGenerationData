The coprecipitation method is a widely used technique for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts, offering versatility in process variations and dopant selection. This method involves a solution containing salts of both the host cation (cerium) and the desired dopant, which is then treated with a chemical to simultaneously precipitate both cations. The resulting precipitate is subsequently washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature [10.1021/cr300418s_3]. 

Process variations in the coprecipitation method can significantly influence the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. One alternative approach involves precipitating solid salts by evaporating the solvent. Another variation utilizes NH4OH to treat the aqueous solution of precursors, causing precipitation [10.1021/cr300418s_3]. These process variations can lead to differences in the final catalyst's properties and effectiveness.

The selection of dopants plays a crucial role in tailoring the catalytic properties of doped ceria. Various dopants can be incorporated using different precursors:
a) Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, and Pr, using nitrate precursors
b) Nb and Ta, using chloride precursors
c) Zr, using oxynitrate precursor (ZrO(NO3)2)
[10.1021/cr300418s_3]

The impact of preparation techniques on structural properties and catalytic performance is exemplified by the case of Nb-doped ceria catalysts used for n-butane combustion. Two different preparation methods for Nb-doped ceria resulted in varying catalytic performance. The sample prepared using hydroxide coprecipitation exhibited a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate compared to the alternative method. Furthermore, the effective activation energies differed significantly: 85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from coprecipitated hydroxides, and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample [10.1021/cr300418s_3]. These differences underscore the importance of the specific coprecipitation technique employed in determining the final catalyst's properties and effectiveness.
