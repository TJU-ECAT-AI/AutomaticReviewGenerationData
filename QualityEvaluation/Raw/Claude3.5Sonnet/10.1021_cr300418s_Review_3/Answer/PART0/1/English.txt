The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves the following steps and variations:

1. Process: 
   - Start with a solution containing salts of both the host cation (cerium) and the desired dopant.
   - Treat the solution with a chemical to simultaneously precipitate both cations.
   - Wash, dry, and calcine the precipitate at high temperature.

2. Variations:
   - Precipitate solid salts by evaporating the solvent.
   - Use NH4OH to treat the aqueous solution of precursors, causing precipitation.

3. Dopants:
   - Various dopants can be used, including:
     a) Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr (using nitrate precursors)
     b) Nb, Ta (using chloride precursors)
     c) Zr (using oxynitrate precursor)

4. Impact on properties and performance:
   The preparation technique significantly affects the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. This is illustrated by the example of Nb-doped ceria:

   - Two different preparation methods for Nb-doped ceria resulted in different n-butane combustion rates. The sample prepared using hydroxide coprecipitation showed a 5% higher rate compared to the other method.
   
   - The effective activation energies also differed: 85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from coprecipitated hydroxides, and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample.

These differences in catalytic performance and activation energies demonstrate that the specific coprecipitation technique used can have a substantial impact on the final catalyst's properties and effectiveness, particularly in applications such as n-butane combustion.
