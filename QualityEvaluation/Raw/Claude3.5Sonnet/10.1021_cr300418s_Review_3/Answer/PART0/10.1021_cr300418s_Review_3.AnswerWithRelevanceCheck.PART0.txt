          [1] "This method starts with a solution of salts of the host cation and of the dopant, which are treated with a chemical that precipitates simultaneously both cations. The precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature. An alternative is to precipitate the solid salts by evaporating the solvent."

[2] "They prepared a large number of doped ceria catalysts and used them for n-butane combustion. The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."

[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH. The precipitate was washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 C."

[4] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher. The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

          The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves the following steps and variations:

1. Process: 
   - Start with a solution containing salts of both the host cation (cerium) and the desired dopant.
   - Treat the solution with a chemical to simultaneously precipitate both cations.
   - Wash, dry, and calcine the precipitate at high temperature.

2. Variations:
   - Precipitate solid salts by evaporating the solvent.
   - Use NH4OH to treat the aqueous solution of precursors, causing precipitation.

3. Dopants:
   - Various dopants can be used, including:
     a) Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr (using nitrate precursors)
     b) Nb, Ta (using chloride precursors)
     c) Zr (using oxynitrate precursor)

4. Impact on properties and performance:
   The preparation technique significantly affects the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. This is illustrated by the example of Nb-doped ceria:

   - Two different preparation methods for Nb-doped ceria resulted in different n-butane combustion rates. The sample prepared using hydroxide coprecipitation showed a 5% higher rate compared to the other method.
   
   - The effective activation energies also differed: 85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from coprecipitated hydroxides, and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample.

These differences in catalytic performance and activation energies demonstrate that the specific coprecipitation technique used can have a substantial impact on the final catalyst's properties and effectiveness, particularly in applications such as n-butane combustion.

          共沉淀法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂涉及以下步骤和变体：

1. 过程：
   - 从含有宿主阳离子（铈）和所需掺杂剂盐的溶液开始。
   - 用化学物质处理溶液，同时沉淀两种阳离子。
   - 对沉淀物进行洗涤、干燥和高温煅烧。

2. 变体：
   - 通过蒸发溶剂来沉淀固体盐。
   - 使用NH4OH处理前驱体的水溶液，引起沉淀。

3. 掺杂剂：
   - 可以使用各种掺杂剂，包括：
     a) Gd、Y、La、Sm、Yb、Pr（使用硝酸盐前驱体）
     b) Nb、Ta（使用氯化物前驱体）
     c) Zr（使用氧硝酸盐前驱体）

4. 对性能和表现的影响：
   制备技术显著影响所得催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。这通过Nb掺杂氧化铈的例子得到了说明：

   - 两种不同的Nb掺杂氧化铈制备方法导致不同的正丁烷燃烧速率。使用氢氧化物共沉淀法制备的样品显示出比其他方法高5%的速率。
   
   - 有效活化能也不同：从共沉淀氢氧化物得到的样品为85 kJ/mol，而另一个样品为105 kJ/mol。

这些催化性能和活化能的差异表明，所使用的特定共沉淀技术可以对最终催化剂的性能和有效性产生实质性影响，特别是在正丁烷燃烧等应用中。
