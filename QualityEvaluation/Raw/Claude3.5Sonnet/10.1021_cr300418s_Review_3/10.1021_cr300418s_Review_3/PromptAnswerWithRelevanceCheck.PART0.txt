[1] "This method starts with a solution of salts of the host cation and of the dopant, which are treated with a chemical that precipitates simultaneously both cations. The precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature. An alternative is to precipitate the solid salts by evaporating the solvent."

[2] "They prepared a large number of doped ceria catalysts and used them for n-butane combustion. The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."

[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH. The precipitate was washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 C."

[4] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher. The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves dissolving salts of cerium and the desired dopant in a solution, followed by precipitating both cations simultaneously. This can be achieved either by adding a chemical precipitant or by evaporating the solvent. The resulting precipitate is then washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature.

Various dopants can be used in this process, including Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr (using nitrate precursors), Nb, Ta (using chloride precursors), and Zr (using oxynitrate precursor). The choice of dopant and precursor can affect the final properties of the catalyst.

Different preparation techniques within the coprecipitation method can significantly impact the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. This is illustrated by the example of Nb-doped ceria prepared using two different approaches:

1. Evaporation method: Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 were dissolved, and the solvent was evaporated to cause coprecipitation.

2. Hydroxide precipitation method: An aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 was treated with NH4OH to precipitate the hydroxides.

Both samples were subsequently washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600°C. However, the catalysts produced by these two methods showed different performance in n-butane combustion:

1. The sample prepared using the hydroxide precipitation method had a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate.

2. The effective activation energies differed significantly: 85 kJ/mol for the hydroxide precipitation method versus 105 kJ/mol for the evaporation method.

These differences in catalytic performance demonstrate that the specific preparation technique within the coprecipitation method can have a substantial impact on the final catalyst properties, even when using the same dopant and host material. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting and optimizing the synthesis method to achieve desired catalytic characteristics.

共沉淀法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的过程涉及将铈盐和所需掺杂剂的盐溶解在溶液中，然后同时沉淀两种阳离子。这可以通过添加化学沉淀剂或蒸发溶剂来实现。所得沉淀物随后被洗涤、干燥，并在高温下煅烧。

这个过程中可以使用各种掺杂剂，包括Gd、Y、La、Sm、Yb、Pr（使用硝酸盐前驱体），Nb、Ta（使用氯化物前驱体），和Zr（使用氧硝酸盐前驱体）。掺杂剂和前驱体的选择可以影响催化剂的最终性能。

共沉淀法中不同的制备技术可以显著影响所得催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。这一点可以通过Nb掺杂氧化铈的例子来说明，该例子使用了两种不同的方法：

1. 蒸发法：溶解Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5，然后蒸发溶剂以引起共沉淀。

2. 氢氧化物沉淀法：用NH4OH处理Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的水溶液以沉淀氢氧化物。

两种样品随后都在600°C的空气中洗涤、干燥和煅烧。然而，这两种方法产生的催化剂在正丁烷燃烧中表现出不同的性能：

1. 用氢氧化物沉淀法制备的样品的正丁烷燃烧速率高出5%。

2. 有效活化能显著不同：氢氧化物沉淀法为85 kJ/mol，而蒸发法为105 kJ/mol。

这些催化性能的差异表明，即使使用相同的掺杂剂和主体材料，共沉淀法中具体的制备技术也可能对最终催化剂的性能产生实质性影响。这凸显了为实现所需的催化特性，仔细选择和优化合成方法的重要性。

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves preparing a solution containing salts of both the host cation (cerium) and the desired dopant. This solution is then treated with a chemical that causes both cations to precipitate simultaneously. The resulting precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature to form the final catalyst.

There are variations in the coprecipitation process. One approach is to use a chemical like NH4OH to induce precipitation, while another method involves evaporating the solvent to precipitate the solid salts.

Various types of dopants can be used in this process, including:
1. Rare earth elements (Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr) - added as nitrates
2. Transition metals (Nb, Ta) - added as chlorides
3. Zirconium - added as an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2

The preparation technique can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting doped ceria catalysts. This is illustrated by the example of Nb-doped ceria prepared using two different methods:

1. Coprecipitation using NH4OH
2. Solvent evaporation

The sample prepared using NH4OH showed a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate compared to the sample prepared by solvent evaporation. Additionally, the effective activation energies differed between the two samples:

1. NH4OH method: 85 kJ/mol
2. Solvent evaporation method: 105 kJ/mol

These differences in catalytic performance and activation energies demonstrate that the choice of preparation technique can have a significant impact on the final catalyst properties. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting and optimizing the synthesis method to achieve the desired catalytic performance for specific applications.
