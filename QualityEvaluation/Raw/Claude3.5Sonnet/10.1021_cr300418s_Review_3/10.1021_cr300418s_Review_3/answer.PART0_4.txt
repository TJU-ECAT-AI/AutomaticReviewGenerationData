[1] "This method starts with a solution of salts of the host cation and of the dopant, which are treated with a chemical that precipitates simultaneously both cations. The precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature. An alternative is to precipitate the solid salts by evaporating the solvent."

[2] "They prepared a large number of doped ceria catalysts and used them for n-butane combustion. The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."

[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH. The precipitate was washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 C."

[4] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher. The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves starting with a solution containing salts of both the host cation (cerium) and the dopant. This solution is then treated with a chemical that causes both cations to precipitate simultaneously. The resulting precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature to form the final catalyst.

There are variations in the process:
1. One alternative is to evaporate the solvent to precipitate the solid salts.
2. Different dopants can be used, including Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr (as nitrates), Nb, Ta (as chlorides), and Zr (as oxynitrate).
3. For Nb-doped ceria specifically, two methods were described:
   a) Evaporation of a solution containing Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5
   b) Treatment of a Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 solution with NH4OH

The preparation technique can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. This is illustrated by the example of Nb-doped ceria:

1. The sample prepared by coprecipitation with NH4OH showed a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate compared to the sample prepared by evaporation.
2. The effective activation energies differed between the two preparation methods:
   - 85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from coprecipitated hydroxides
   - 105 kJ/mol for the sample obtained by evaporation

These differences in catalytic performance and activation energies demonstrate that the choice of preparation technique can have a substantial impact on the final properties of the doped ceria catalyst.

共沉淀法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的过程涉及从含有宿主阳离子（铈）和掺杂剂盐的溶液开始。然后，将该溶液与一种化学物质处理，使两种阳离子同时沉淀。所得沉淀物经洗涤、干燥和高温煅烧，形成最终的催化剂。

该过程有以下变化：
1. 一种替代方法是蒸发溶剂以沉淀固体盐。
2. 可以使用不同的掺杂剂，包括Gd、Y、La、Sm、Yb、Pr（作为硝酸盐），Nb、Ta（作为氯化物），和Zr（作为氧硝酸盐）。
3. 对于Nb掺杂的氧化铈，描述了两种方法：
   a) 蒸发含有Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的溶液
   b) 用NH4OH处理Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5的溶液

制备技术可以显著影响所得催化剂的结构性质和催化性能。这通过Nb掺杂氧化铈的例子得到了说明：

1. 用NH4OH共沉淀制备的样品比蒸发法制备的样品表现出5%更高的正丁烷燃烧速率。
2. 两种制备方法得到的样品的有效活化能不同：
   - 从共沉淀氢氧化物获得的样品为85 kJ/mol
   - 通过蒸发获得的样品为105 kJ/mol

这些催化性能和活化能的差异表明，制备技术的选择可以对掺杂氧化铈催化剂的最终性质产生重大影响。
