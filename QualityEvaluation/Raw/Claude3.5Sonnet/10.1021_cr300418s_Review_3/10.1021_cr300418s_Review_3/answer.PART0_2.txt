[1] "This method starts with a solution of salts of the host cation and of the dopant, which are treated with a chemical that precipitates simultaneously both cations. The precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature. An alternative is to precipitate the solid salts by evaporating the solvent."

[2] "They prepared a large number of doped ceria catalysts and used them for n-butane combustion. The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."

[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH. The precipitate was washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 C."

[4] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher. The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves several steps:

1. Starting with a solution containing salts of both the host cation (cerium) and the desired dopant.

2. Treating the solution with a chemical to simultaneously precipitate both cations, or alternatively, evaporating the solvent to precipitate the solid salts.

3. Washing, drying, and calcining the precipitate at high temperature.

Various dopants can be used in this process, including Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr (using nitrate precursors), Nb, Ta (using chloride precursors), and Zr (using oxynitrate precursor).

The preparation technique can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting catalysts. This is illustrated by the example of Nb-doped ceria prepared using two different methods:

1. Coprecipitation of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by solvent evaporation.
2. Coprecipitation of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 using NH4OH treatment.

The sample prepared using NH4OH treatment showed a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate compared to the sample prepared by solvent evaporation. Additionally, the effective activation energies differed significantly between the two samples: 85 kJ/mol for the NH4OH-treated sample and 105 kJ/mol for the solvent evaporation sample.

These differences in catalytic performance and activation energies demonstrate that the specific preparation technique used in the coprecipitation method can have a substantial impact on the properties of the resulting doped ceria catalysts.

共沉淀法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的过程包括以下几个步骤：

1. 从含有宿主阳离子（铈）和所需掺杂剂盐的溶液开始。

2. 用化学物质处理溶液以同时沉淀两种阳离子，或者通过蒸发溶剂来沉淀固体盐。

3. 对沉淀物进行洗涤、干燥和高温煅烧。

这个过程中可以使用各种掺杂剂，包括Gd、Y、La、Sm、Yb、Pr（使用硝酸盐前驱体），Nb、Ta（使用氯化物前驱体），以及Zr（使用氧硝酸盐前驱体）。

制备技术可以显著影响所得催化剂的结构性质和催化性能。这一点可以通过Nb掺杂氧化铈的例子来说明，该催化剂使用两种不同方法制备：

1. 通过溶剂蒸发法共沉淀Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5。
2. 使用NH4OH处理法共沉淀Ce(NO3)4和NbCl5。

使用NH4OH处理法制备的样品显示出比溶剂蒸发法制备的样品高5%的正丁烷燃烧率。此外，两个样品的有效活化能也有显著差异：NH4OH处理法样品为85 kJ/mol，溶剂蒸发法样品为105 kJ/mol。

这些催化性能和活化能的差异表明，共沉淀法中使用的具体制备技术可以对所得掺杂氧化铈催化剂的性能产生实质性影响。
