[1] "This method starts with a solution of salts of the host cation and of the dopant, which are treated with a chemical that precipitates simultaneously both cations. The precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature. An alternative is to precipitate the solid salts by evaporating the solvent."

[2] "They prepared a large number of doped ceria catalysts and used them for n-butane combustion. The coprecipitation was carried out by dissolving Ce(NO3)4 together with a precursor for the dopant, which was either a nitrate (for Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr dopants), or a chloride (for Nb, Ta dopants), or an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2 (for Zr dopant)."

[3] "The Nb-doped ceria was also prepared by the coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of Ce(NO3)4 and NbCl5 by treatment with NH4OH. The precipitate was washed, dried, and calcined in air at 600 C."

[4] "The two Nb-doped ceria samples have different n-butane combustion rates: the rate for the sample made from hydroxide was 5% higher. The effective activation energies were also different (85 kJ/mol for the sample obtained from the coprecipitated hydroxides and 105 kJ/mol for the other sample)."

The coprecipitation method for synthesizing doped ceria catalysts involves preparing a solution containing salts of both the host cation (cerium) and the desired dopant. This solution is then treated with a chemical that causes both cations to precipitate simultaneously. The resulting precipitate is washed, dried, and calcined at high temperature to form the final catalyst.

There are variations in the coprecipitation process. One approach is to use a chemical like NH4OH to induce precipitation, while another method involves evaporating the solvent to precipitate the solid salts.

Various types of dopants can be used in this process, including:
1. Rare earth elements (Gd, Y, La, Sm, Yb, Pr) - added as nitrates
2. Transition metals (Nb, Ta) - added as chlorides
3. Zirconium - added as an oxynitrate ZrO(NO3)2

The preparation technique can significantly affect the structural properties and catalytic performance of the resulting doped ceria catalysts. This is illustrated by the example of Nb-doped ceria prepared using two different methods:

1. Coprecipitation using NH4OH
2. Solvent evaporation

The sample prepared using NH4OH showed a 5% higher n-butane combustion rate compared to the sample prepared by solvent evaporation. Additionally, the effective activation energies differed between the two samples:

1. NH4OH method: 85 kJ/mol
2. Solvent evaporation method: 105 kJ/mol

These differences in catalytic performance and activation energies demonstrate that the choice of preparation technique can have a significant impact on the final catalyst properties. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting and optimizing the synthesis method to achieve the desired catalytic performance for specific applications.

合沉淀法合成掺杂氧化铈催化剂的过程涉及制备含有宿主阳离子（铈）和所需掺杂剂盐的溶液。然后用化学药品处理这种溶液，使两种阳离子同时沉淀。将得到的沉淀物洗涤、干燥，并在高温下煅烧，形成最终的催化剂。

合沉淀过程有多种变体。一种方法是使用NH4OH等化学品诱导沉淀，另一种方法是蒸发溶剂使固体盐沉淀。

这个过程可以使用各种类型的掺杂剂，包括：
1. 稀土元素（Gd、Y、La、Sm、Yb、Pr）- 以硝酸盐形式添加
2. 过渡金属（Nb、Ta）- 以氯化物形式添加
3. 锆 - 以氧硝酸盐ZrO(NO3)2形式添加

制备技术可以显著影响所得掺杂氧化铈催化剂的结构特性和催化性能。这一点可以通过使用两种不同方法制备的Nb掺杂氧化铈的例子来说明：

1. 使用NH4OH的合沉淀法
2. 溶剂蒸发法

使用NH4OH制备的样品显示出比溶剂蒸发法制备的样品高5%的正丁烷燃烧率。此外，两个样品的有效活化能也不同：

1. NH4OH方法：85 kJ/mol
2. 溶剂蒸发方法：105 kJ/mol

这些催化性能和活化能的差异表明，制备技术的选择可以对最终催化剂的性能产生重大影响。这突出了仔细选择和优化合成方法的重要性，以便在特定应用中实现所需的催化性能。
