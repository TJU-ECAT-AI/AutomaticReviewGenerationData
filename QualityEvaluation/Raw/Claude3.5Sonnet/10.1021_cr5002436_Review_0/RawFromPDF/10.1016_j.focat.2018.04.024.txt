new 625,000 tonnes/y (1.35 bn lbs) Borstar
polyethylene unit at Total’s Bayport, TX, site,
following a decision on the outcome of an
acceptable EPC contract. As announced in
Mar 2017, the new $1.7 bn ethane steam
cracker is being built alongside Total’s Port
Arthur reﬁnery and Total/BASF existing
steam cracker. The project, which is
scheduled to start up in 2020, will create
around 1500 jobs during peak engineering
and construction activity.

Eni licenses EST slurry reﬁning
technology to Zhejiang
Petrochemicals.
Eni has been awarded a contract by
Zhejiang Petrochemicals for the licence for
the construction of two reﬁning lines based
on Eni Slurry Technology (EST). The two
production lines are located on the island of
Zhoushan (Zejiang Province, China), and will
have a reﬁning capacity of 3 M tonnes/y
each. They will be built as part of a project
for the construction of a new reﬁnery with a
capacity of 40 M tonnes/y. Start-up is
planned for 2020. The agreement represents
an important step to enhance the value of
EST technology. Following the decision by
Sinopec to adopt this technology for its
Maoming reﬁnery in China, EST can be
viewed in the country as the best worldwide
technological solution for operators who wish
to completely convert the bottom of the
barrel. The choice by Zhejiang
Petrochemicals has great value from an
environmental point, considering that the
new EST plant replaces an originally
planned petroleum coke line. The full
agreement includes: licence to use the EST
technology, process design package,
training, technical services, proprietary
equipment and the sale of the catalyst.

Singapore carbon tax welcomed by
energy ﬁrms.
Global energy majors ExxonMobil and Shell
positively accept, with some reservations,
the Singaporean government’s carbon tax
introduction in an effort to address climate
change. Starting 2019, a $5/tonne carbon
tax will be imposed on all plants with
25,000 tonnes/y of greenhouse gas
emissions or more. The tax will apply to all
major emitters, which represent around
80% of the country’s emissions. The
decision is anticipated to generate almost
$1 bn in government revenue in the ﬁrst
ﬁve years of execution. The government
plans to review the S$5/tonne rate in 2023,
with intentions to increase it to S$10-15/
tonne in 2030.
