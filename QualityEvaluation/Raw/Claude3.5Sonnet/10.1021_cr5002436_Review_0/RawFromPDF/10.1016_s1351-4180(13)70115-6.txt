Oxford Catalysts: Calumet project
update
Oxford Catalysts Group has provided
an update on the Calumet Gas-to-
Liquids project announced on 7 Sep
2012. Ventech Engineers International
LLC has now completed the plant
design and provided a fixed price
quote for the modules. Calumet has
confirmed that the project economics
look strong. At the same time,
Calumet’s appointed third-party
owner’s engineer finished a thorough
review of the Oxford Catalysts’
technology, as well as Ventech’s GTL
design and other intended technology
components. Calumet has described
the technology as fantastic. Calumet
now plans to progress with the more
detailed engineering and market
analysis for a plant of approximately
1400 barrel/d. At the conclusion of
this study, which is expected to last 6
months, Calumet will be in a position
to decide on proceeding with
fabrication. Roy Lipski (CEO of Oxford
Catalysts Group) said that this is an
exciting development for Oxford
Catalysts. The project with Calumet
will be the only commercial GTL plant
in N America to move in to front end
engineering, other than Sasol’s
project in Louisiana. If it continues on
its current schedule, it will be the first
GTL plant to be operational in N
America, and the only commercial
smaller scale GTL anywhere in the
world.

Solazyme and Mitsui collaborate to
develop triglyceride oils for
oleochemical industry
Solazyme Inc, a renewable oil and
bioproducts company, and Mitsui &
Co Ltd announced that they have
entered into a $20 M multi-year
agreement to jointly develop a suite of
triglyceride oils for use primarily in the
oleochemical industry. The agreement
includes further development of
Solazyme’s high myristic algal oil, a
valuable raw material in the
oleochemical industry, as well as
additional oils that Solazyme is
developing for the oleochemical and
industrial sectors. Product
development is expected to span a
multi-year period, with periodic
product introductions throughout the
term of the joint development alliance.
End use applications may include
renewable, high-performance polymer
additives for plastic applications,
aviation lubricants, and toiletry and
household products. According to a
Mitsui official, Mitsui is strengthening
its position in the oleochemicals
industry through development and
commercialization of novel products
as a potential source of new
sustainable materials to oleochemical
companies including Mitsui’s
subsidiary, Palm-Oleo Sdn Bhd.

UOP technology selected for
petrochemical production in China
UOP LLC announced on 30 Jan 2013
that its Oleflex process technology
has been selected by China’s
Longgang Chemical Co to produce
key ingredients for fuels and synthetic
rubber. This process will be used to
convert refinery-derived iso-butane to
iso-butylene, a valuable petrochemical
used in the production of fuels and
synthetic rubber. This is UOP’s
second C Oleflex process license in
China. In addition to technology
licensing, UOP will provide basic
engineering, catalysts, adsorbents,
specialty equipment, and engineering
for the project. Longgang Chemical
Co will use the UOP technology to
process 175,000 tonne/y of mixed
butane feedstock at its plant in
Dongying City, Shandong Province,
China. The plant is expected to start-
up in 2015. The C Oleflex process
uses catalytic dehydrogenation to
convert iso-butane to iso-butylene.

WR Grace 4Q and FY2012: Catalyst
Technologies results
WR Grace’s 4Q 2012 sales for its
Catalysts Technologies operating
segment, which includes specialty
catalysts and additives for refinery,
plastics and other chemical process
applications, were $328.3 M, a
decrease of 10.7% compared with 4Q
2011. The decrease was due to lower
rare earth surcharges (-20.6%) and
unfavourable currency conversion 
(-1.8%), which more than offset
increased sales volumes (+8.0%) and
improved base pricing (+3.7%). Sales
volumes and base pricing of FCC
catalysts increased approximately
