spokesperson, Total will pay $40 M to Corbion
to acquire part of the joint venture (a sum
included in the $140 M). Corbion's lactic acid
unit in Thailand will remain under the Dutch
group's sole control. Corbion claims to be the
world's leading producer of lactic acid, lactic
acid compounds and lactides. It is also a
leading producer of functional mixtures
containing enzymes, emulsiﬁers, inorganic
chemicals and vitamins. It employs 1673
people and in 2015 generated sales of
$918.3 M. The new unit will be its ﬁrst making
polylactic acid. It will also be one of a very few
commercial polylactic acid units worldwide. At
present, the only others belong to
NatureWorks (140,000 tonnes) in Nebraska.
For Total, the new unit represents a foothold
on the bioplastics market. The group wants to
develop bioplastics and biofuels operations to
complement its tradition hydrocarbon-based
businesses. In 2007 Total opened a 15000
tonnes/y demonstration unit in partnership with
Galactic in Escanafﬂes, Belgium but sold its
stake in the joint venture (Futerro) to Galactic
in Jan 2016 because the technology did not
meet its expectations.

Loop Energy introduces fuel cell
range extender for electric
transport
Loop Energy introduced on 24 Nov 2016 a
new range-extender (REX) power module for
heavy-duty electric transport vehicles. At the
core of the module is Loop's unique fuel cell
design which substantially improves
performance, durability and cost. Following a
three-year development period, the Loop power
module is now being integrated by an original
equipment manufacturer and will begin in-
service operation in 2017. Fuel cell range
extenders, or auxiliary power units, are critical
to zero-emission trucks and buses as they
extend the range of battery-electric systems
using on-board hydrogen fuel. The Loop
module provides a breakthrough in terms of
cost and power density, making range
extension economically viable for a broad array
of applications. Loop's patented eFlow fuel cell
features a radically improved design, and is the
competitive advantage within all Loop fuel cell
stacks and power modules. By optimizing air
ﬂow inside the fuel cell, Loop's eFlow design
produces far greater power density than
industry-standard fuel cells. This higher power
density allows Loop to simplify and signiﬁcantly
increase the efﬁciency of the fuel cell stack and
system. The Loop 56 kW fuel cell power
module offers a power density of 213 W/L to
boost the range of battery electric vehicles by
more than three times. The module is turn-key,
containing the air compressor and controls,
enabling a drop-in solution for manufacturers of
heavy-duty trucks and transit buses who want
increased power and range for a reduced cost.

Ashland butanediol plant back up
Ashland Chemical's butanediol (BDO) facility
in Lima, OH, US, has changed out its catalyst
and has resumed operations. Every four to
ﬁve years, the 65,000 tonnes/y unit undergoes
a complex catalyst change. There have been
comments centred on the company's decision
to further evaluate its BDO unit and other
facilities in its intermediates and solvents (I&S)
business. The company recorded a $276 M
loss in the quarter ended 30 Sep 2016, versus
the $55 M loss in 2015. The loss was mainly
due to a $181 M impairment charge to detail
the value of several I&S assets. Company
ofﬁcials have restated that the ﬁrm is at the
bottom of the BDO cycle, which has
experienced mostly declining prices in the two
prior years due to global oversupply,
particularly in Asia. Ashland also sustains a
$4 M charge due to an unscheduled outage at
its Ohio BDO facility in Aug 2016.

Global Bioenergies ﬁnishes
construction on new Leuna demo
isobutene plant
Global Bioenergies has completed construction
on its demo facility in Leuna, Germany,
dedicated to the production of high-purity
isobutene from renewable resources. The
demo plant, with a nameplate capacity of 100
tonnes/y, is the "only facility in the world''
dedicated to the direct fermentation of gaseous
hydrocarbons. It combines two 5000 L
fermenters and a complete puriﬁcation system,
mimicking all aspects of a commercial-scale
isobutene facility. The project was supported
by a €5.7 M grant from the German Federal
Ministry for Research, along with a €4.4 M loan
from a consortium of French banks, including
Societe Generale, BNP-Paribas, CM-CIC and
BPI.

Jacobs wins contract from Borealis
to study feasibility of new propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) unit at Kallo
site
Jacobs Engineering has been awarded a
contract from Borealis to perform a feasibility
study for a proposed propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) unit at Borealis'
existing production site in Kallo, Belgium. The
new world-scale PDH, which would be based
on Honeywell UOP's Oleﬂex technology,
would have a targeted production of 740,000
tonnes/y, making it "one of the largest and
most efﬁcient facilities in the world''. The study
is scheduled for completion by mid-2017. A
ﬁnal investment decision is planned in 3Q
2018 and potential start-up of the plant is
scheduled for 2H 2021. Original Source:

customer and engineering deals for its
butene-1 plant in Baytown, TX, US. The
100,000 tonnes/y plant, which will open in
2018, will cost around $200 M. It will employ
Axen's AlphaButol technology to produce
butane-1 by dimerizing ethylene. The site is a
former carbon black facility of Evonik.
