3. Kinetic analysis 
To indicate the kinetically favorable pathway for the main PDH in this study, we have 
compared the reaction rates of ISTSA1 and ISTSB1, the rate determining steps for C-H 
activation of pathways A and B.  
Based on the transition-state theory (TST), a rate constant of an elementary reaction can be 
calculated from Eq. S1. [1]  
𝑘= 𝐴 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−
𝐸𝑎
𝑘𝐵𝑇) 
 
 
 
 
(S1) 
 
where A is the pre-exponential/frequency factor. Ea is an activation energy of the elementary 
step, kb is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is temperature. The pre-exponential factor can be 
obtained from Eq. S2. 
 
𝐴=
𝑘𝐵𝑇
ℎ𝑒𝑥𝑝(
∆𝑆‡
𝑘𝐵) 
 
 
 
(S2) 
where the entropy barrier, ΔS‡, can be calculated from STS- Sreactant. Ea can be obtained from 
Eq. S3.  
𝐸𝑎= ∆‡𝐸𝐷𝐹𝑇+ ∆‡𝑍𝑃𝐸 
 
 
 
(S3) 
 
𝑍𝑃𝐸= ∑

Δ‡EDFT and Δ‡ZPE denote the energy barrier from DFT calculation and the zero point energy 
barrier, respectively. h and νi are Plank’s constant and the vibrational frequency of i mode.  
In this study, the reactions rates of ISTSA1 and ISTSB1, which are the rate 
determining steps for C-H activation of pathways 1A and 2A, are defined as kTSA1 and kTSB1 , 
respectively. It is to be noted that these two elementary steps have the same initial state (IS), 
therefore the ratio of kTSA1 and kTSB1 can be obtained by Eq. S5 or S6. 
𝑘𝑇𝑆𝐴1
𝑘𝑇𝑆𝐵1 =
𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐴1
𝐴𝑇𝑆𝐵1 𝑒𝑥𝑝(−

𝑘𝑇𝑆𝐴1
𝑘𝑇𝑆𝐵1 = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(
𝑆𝑇𝑆𝐴1−𝑆𝑇𝑆𝐵1
𝑘𝐵

(𝐸𝐷𝐹𝑇
𝑇𝑆𝐴1+𝑍𝑃𝐸𝑇𝑆𝐴1−𝐸𝐷𝐹𝑇
𝑇𝑆𝐴1−𝑍𝑃𝐸𝑇𝑆𝐴1)
𝑘𝐵𝑇
)  
(S6) 
 
By neglecting entropy contributions from the translational and rotational degree of freedom, 
the entropy of the adsorbed intermediate can be estimated from vibrational contribution, Svib, 
in Eq. S7 and S8.

(S8)

As a result, the calculated kTSA1/kTSB1 values in range of 298K to 900K signify that pathway 
A is more kinetically preferable than another pathway (see Table S4).
