The literature does not directly address the specific applications, market trends, production methods, and thermodynamic challenges of light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does discuss some aspects of olefin production:

1. The document mentions studying oxidative transformations of alkanes and alkenes using carbon dioxide as an oxidant on oxide catalysts. This suggests a potential alternative production method for olefins.

2. The research focuses on reactions of C1-C7 alkane reduction with CO2 to produce olefins and synthesis gas. This indicates a novel approach to olefin production using CO2 as a reactant.

3. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted for not forming carbon layers during reactions, which could be an advantage in olefin production processes.

4. The document mentions a new scheme for producing ethylene from natural gas and then converting it to butadiene, without using crude petroleum. This suggests potential new production pathways for light olefins.

5. While the document doesn't explicitly discuss thermodynamic challenges, the focus on different catalysts and reaction conditions implies that temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects are important considerations in these processes.

Overall, while the document doesn't provide comprehensive information on light olefin applications and market trends, it does suggest ongoing research into alternative production methods that could potentially impact the industry.

该文献并未直接讨论轻烯烃（如丙烯和乙烯）的具体应用、市场趋势、生产方法和热力学挑战。但是，它确实讨论了一些烯烃生产的方面：

1. 文档提到研究使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂在氧化物催化剂上对烷烃和烯烃进行氧化转化。这表明了一种潜在的烯烃替代生产方法。

2. 研究重点是C1-C7烷烃与CO2反应生产烯烃和合成气。这表明了一种使用CO2作为反应物生产烯烃的新方法。

3. 强调了锰氧化物基催化剂在反应过程中不形成碳层，这可能是烯烃生产过程中的一个优势。

4. 文档提到了一种从天然气生产乙烯然后转化为丁二烯的新方案，无需使用原油。这表明了轻烯烃生产的潜在新途径。

5. 虽然文档没有明确讨论热力学挑战，但对不同催化剂和反应条件的关注暗示了温度、压力和烷烃链长效应在这些过程中是重要的考虑因素。

总的来说，虽然文档没有提供关于轻烯烃应用和市场趋势的全面信息，但它确实表明正在进行替代生产方法的研究，这可能会影响该行业。
