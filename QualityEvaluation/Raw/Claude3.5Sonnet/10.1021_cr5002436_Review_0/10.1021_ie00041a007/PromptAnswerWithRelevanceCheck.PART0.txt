[1] "Reactions of oxidative transformation of organic compounds of different classes (alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols) with a nontraditional oxidant, carbon dioxide, were studied on oxide catalysts"

The literature does not directly address the specific applications, market trends, production methods, and thermodynamic challenges of light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does provide some relevant information about the production of these compounds through oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking reactions using carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

The document suggests that carbon dioxide can be used as a nontraditional oxidant for the transformation of organic compounds, including alkanes and alkenes. This indicates a potential production method for light olefins using CO2, which could be significant for the chemical industry in the future.

The literature mentions that oxidative cracking reactions are more prevalent than oxidative dehydrogenation when using CO2 as an oxidant with higher alkanes like butane. This suggests that the production of light olefins like propylene and ethylene from longer-chain alkanes may face challenges in terms of selectivity.

The document provides reaction equations showing the formation of propylene (C3H6) and ethylene (C2H4) from butane (C4H10) using CO2. These reactions indicate that light olefins can be produced as part of a complex reaction network involving CO2 and longer-chain alkanes.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss thermodynamic challenges, the presence of multiple reaction products (CO, H2O, CH4) in addition to the desired olefins suggests that controlling selectivity and managing side reactions could be significant challenges in these processes.

The document does not provide specific information on temperature and pressure effects or the influence of alkane chain length on these reactions beyond the examples given for butane conversion.

该文献并未直接讨论轻质烯烃（如丙烯和乙烯）的具体应用、市场趋势、生产方法和热力学挑战。但是，它确实提供了一些相关信息，涉及使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂通过氧化脱氢和裂解反应生产这些化合物。

文件表明，二氧化碳可以作为非传统氧化剂用于有机化合物的转化，包括烷烃和烯烃。这表明使用CO2生产轻质烯烃的潜在方法，这对未来的化学工业可能具有重要意义。

文献提到，在使用CO2作为氧化剂与较高级烷烃（如丁烷）反应时，氧化裂解反应比氧化脱氢反应更为普遍。这表明从较长链烷烃生产轻质烯烃（如丙烯和乙烯）在选择性方面可能面临挑战。

文件提供了使用CO2从丁烷（C4H10）生成丙烯（C3H6）和乙烯（C2H4）的反应方程。这些反应表明，轻质烯烃可以作为涉及CO2和较长链烷烃的复杂反应网络的一部分被生产出来。

虽然文献没有明确讨论热力学挑战，但除了所需的烯烃外，还存在多种反应产物（CO、H2O、CH4），这表明在这些过程中控制选择性和管理副反应可能是重大挑战。

除了给出的丁烷转化例子外，该文件没有提供关于温度和压力效应或烷烃链长对这些反应影响的具体信息。

[4] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs. This catalyst is also effective for ethane transformation. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 "C 3600 h-l and COz/ C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion"

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important raw materials for the chemical industry. The literature does not provide specific details on their applications or market trends. However, it discusses using carbon dioxide as an oxidant to produce these olefins from alkanes through oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The key production method discussed is the oxidative transformation of alkanes using carbon dioxide as an oxidant over oxide catalysts, particularly manganese-containing catalysts. This approach provides high conversions and stable activity without coke accumulation.

The main thermodynamic challenge appears to be the need for high temperatures. For example, propane conversion to C2-C3 olefins is carried out at 830°C. The literature mentions using a catalyst composition of 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 to achieve 73% yield of C2-C3 olefins at 96% propane conversion.

The document does not provide detailed information on pressure effects or how alkane chain length impacts the synthesis. However, it does discuss reactions with various alkanes from C1 to C7, suggesting the method can be applied across different chain lengths.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料。文献没有提供它们的具体应用或市场趋势的详细信息。但是,它讨论了使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂,通过氧化脱氢反应从烷烃生产这些烯烃。

讨论的主要生产方法是使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂,在氧化物催化剂(特别是含锰催化剂)上对烷烃进行氧化转化。这种方法提供了高转化率和稳定的活性,且不积碳。

主要的热力学挑战似乎是需要高温。例如,丙烷转化为C2-C3烯烃是在830°C下进行的。文献提到使用1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2的催化剂组成,在96%的丙烷转化率下实现73%的C2-C3烯烃产率。

该文件没有提供关于压力效应或烷烃链长如何影响合成的详细信息。然而,它确实讨论了从C1到C7的各种烷烃的反应,表明该方法可以应用于不同的链长。

The literature does not directly address the market trends and applications of light olefins in the chemical industry. However, it does discuss some production methods and challenges associated with their synthesis:

1. The document mentions oxidative transformation of alkanes and alkenes using carbon dioxide as an oxidant over oxide catalysts. This represents a novel approach to olefin production.

2. Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted as being advantageous for not forming carbon deposits during reactions, unlike metal catalysts.

3. The conversion of ethylene to butadiene is discussed as a potential new production route starting from natural gas, avoiding the use of crude oil. This suggests efforts to develop more economical or sustainable production methods.

4. Some thermodynamic challenges are implied by the reported conversion rates and product selectivities. For example, at 820°C, ethylene conversion was 30.5% with 50.2% selectivity to butadiene and 30.6% to propylene.

5. The high temperatures used (820°C in the example) indicate significant energy requirements for these reactions, which is a common challenge in olefin production.

6. The formation of multiple products (butadiene, propylene, butenes, ethane, CO, methane) during ethylene conversion demonstrates the challenge of achieving high selectivity to desired products.

While the document focuses on specific catalytic reactions rather than broader industry trends, it demonstrates ongoing research into alternative production methods for light olefins, likely driven by economic and environmental factors.

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry. The literature does not provide specific information on their applications or market trends. However, it does mention some production methods and challenges:

1. Light olefins can be produced through oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes using CO2 as an oxidant. For example, ethane can be converted to ethylene.

2. Catalysts containing manganese, chromium, lanthanum and vanadium oxides show high activity and selectivity for producing C2-C4 olefins from butane at 630-650°C. 

3. The process can be directed to form light olefins without coke accumulation on the catalyst surface, which is a common challenge in olefin production.

4. High temperatures (>600°C) are generally required for the dehydrogenation reactions to proceed.

5. The CO2 to alkane ratio affects the product distribution, with ratios around 1-1.2 mentioned for butane conversion.

6. Longer chain alkanes like heptane tend to undergo oxidative cracking to form lighter olefins rather than simple dehydrogenation.

The literature does not provide detailed information on pressure effects or comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of these reactions. More specific data on industrial applications and market trends for light olefins is also not included in the given text.
