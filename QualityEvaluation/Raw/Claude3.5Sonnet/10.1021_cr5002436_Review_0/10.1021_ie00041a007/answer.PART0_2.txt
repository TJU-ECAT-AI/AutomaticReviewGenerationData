[1] "Reactions of oxidative transformation of organic compounds of different classes (alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols) with a nontraditional oxidant, carbon dioxide, were studied on oxide catalysts"

[2] "Independently of the greenhouse effect C02 can be considered as a very important raw material for the chemical industry in the future."

[3] "The use of manganese-containing catalysts in these reactions provides high conversions both of the oxidized substance and of C02 with a stable activity level during a long period without coke accumulation."

[4] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs. This catalyst is also effective for ethane transformation. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 "C 3600 h-l and COz/ C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion"

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important raw materials for the chemical industry. The literature does not provide specific details on their applications or market trends. However, it discusses using carbon dioxide as an oxidant to produce these olefins from alkanes through oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The key production method discussed is the oxidative transformation of alkanes using carbon dioxide as an oxidant over oxide catalysts, particularly manganese-containing catalysts. This approach provides high conversions and stable activity without coke accumulation.

The main thermodynamic challenge appears to be the need for high temperatures. For example, propane conversion to C2-C3 olefins is carried out at 830°C. The literature mentions using a catalyst composition of 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2 to achieve 73% yield of C2-C3 olefins at 96% propane conversion.

The document does not provide detailed information on pressure effects or how alkane chain length impacts the synthesis. However, it does discuss reactions with various alkanes from C1 to C7, suggesting the method can be applied across different chain lengths.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料。文献没有提供它们的具体应用或市场趋势的详细信息。但是,它讨论了使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂,通过氧化脱氢反应从烷烃生产这些烯烃。

讨论的主要生产方法是使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂,在氧化物催化剂(特别是含锰催化剂)上对烷烃进行氧化转化。这种方法提供了高转化率和稳定的活性,且不积碳。

主要的热力学挑战似乎是需要高温。例如,丙烷转化为C2-C3烯烃是在830°C下进行的。文献提到使用1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2的催化剂组成,在96%的丙烷转化率下实现73%的C2-C3烯烃产率。

该文件没有提供关于压力效应或烷烃链长如何影响合成的详细信息。然而,它确实讨论了从C1到C7的各种烷烃的反应,表明该方法可以应用于不同的链长。
