[1] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."

[2] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."

[3] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins."

[4] "For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

[5] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are the largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally, with significant demand growth from 1990 to 2010. They have widespread applications in the chemical industry.

The main production methods for ethylene and propylene are:
1. Thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks (primary route for ethylene, also produces propylene as byproduct)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries (produces propylene as byproduct)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (for propylene)

Key thermodynamic challenges in synthesizing light olefins through dehydrogenation include:

1. Higher temperatures required compared to heavier paraffins (e.g. 580°C for propane vs 450°C for dodecane at 40% conversion)
2. Endothermic reaction limited by chemical equilibrium 
3. Higher conversion requires either higher temperatures or lower pressures
4. Equilibrium constant increases with increasing carbon number

These factors make light olefin production more challenging than heavier olefins, requiring careful reactor and process design to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are the top two highest volume petrochemical intermediates globally. Their demand and production have grown significantly from 1990 to 2010. 

Ethylene is primarily produced through thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene is obtained as a byproduct from thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks, as well as from fluid catalytic cracking in refineries. However, due to propylene's growth rate outpacing these conventional supply routes, selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has become an important commercial production method.

The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges. Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction. Higher conversions require either higher temperatures or lower pressures. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires much higher temperatures compared to heavy paraffins, as the equilibrium constant increases with increasing carbon number.

These factors make the production of light olefins, especially through dehydrogenation, a complex process that requires careful consideration of reaction conditions and catalyst selection to overcome thermodynamic limitations and achieve economically viable yields.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是全球产量最大的两种石油化工中间体。从1990年到2010年,它们的需求和产量显著增长。

乙烯主要通过乙烷、液化石油气和较重馏分的热裂解生产。丙烯作为副产品从液化石油气或较重馏分的热裂解以及炼油厂的流化催化裂化中获得。然而,由于丙烯的增长率超过了这些传统供应途径,丙烷选择性催化脱氢已成为一种重要的商业化生产方法。

轻质烯烃的合成面临热力学挑战。烷烃脱氢是一个吸热的、受平衡限制的反应。更高的转化率需要更高的温度或更低的压力。与重质烷烃相比,轻质烷烃的脱氢需要更高的温度,因为平衡常数随着碳数的增加而增加。

这些因素使得轻质烯烃的生产,尤其是通过脱氢方式,成为一个复杂的过程,需要仔细考虑反应条件和催化剂的选择,以克服热力学限制并实现经济可行的产率。

4. For example, propane dehydrogenation needs at least 580°C for 40% conversion at 1 atm, while dodecane only needs 450°C

These challenges arise from the thermodynamic properties related to alkane chain length, with shorter chains requiring more severe conditions for dehydrogenation.

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, are the two largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally. Their demand has grown significantly from 1990 to 2010. 

The main production method for ethylene remains thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. This process also yields significant amounts of propylene as a byproduct. For propylene specifically, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has become an important production route.

The synthesis of light olefins faces several thermodynamic challenges:

1. Dehydrogenation is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction.
2. Higher conversions require either higher temperatures or lower pressures.
3. Light paraffins (like propane) require much higher temperatures for dehydrogenation compared to heavier paraffins.

For example, at 1 atm pressure and 40% conversion, propane dehydrogenation needs at least 580°C, while dodecane can achieve the same conversion at only 450°C. This temperature difference is due to the equilibrium constant increasing with carbon number.

These challenges necessitate careful process design and catalyst selection to achieve economically viable production of light olefins through dehydrogenation.

轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，是全球产量最大的两种石油化工中间体。从1990年到2010年，它们的需求量显著增长。

乙烯的主要生产方法仍然是乙烷、液化石油气和重质原料的热裂解。这个过程也会产生大量的丙烯副产品。对于丙烯来说，丙烷的催化脱氢已成为一种重要的生产途径。

轻质烯烃的合成面临几个热力学挑战：

1. 脱氢是一个吸热的、受平衡限制的反应。
2. 更高的转化率需要更高的温度或更低的压力。
3. 与重质烷烃相比，轻质烷烃（如丙烷）的脱氢需要更高的温度。

例如，在1个大气压和40%转化率的条件下，丙烷脱氢需要至少580°C，而十二烷在450°C就可以达到相同的转化率。这种温度差异是由于平衡常数随碳原子数增加而增大。

这些挑战需要仔细的工艺设计和催化剂选择，以实现经济可行的轻质烯烃脱氢生产。
