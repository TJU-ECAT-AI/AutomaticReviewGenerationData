Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, are the two largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally. Their demand has grown significantly from 1990 to 2010. 

The main production method for ethylene remains thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. This process also yields significant amounts of propylene as a byproduct. For propylene specifically, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has become an important production route.

The synthesis of light olefins faces several thermodynamic challenges:

1. Dehydrogenation is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction.
2. Higher conversions require either higher temperatures or lower pressures.
3. Light paraffins (like propane) require much higher temperatures for dehydrogenation compared to heavier paraffins.

For example, at 1 atm pressure and 40% conversion, propane dehydrogenation needs at least 580°C, while dodecane can achieve the same conversion at only 450°C. This temperature difference is due to the equilibrium constant increasing with carbon number.

These challenges necessitate careful process design and catalyst selection to achieve economically viable production of light olefins through dehydrogenation.

轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，是全球产量最大的两种石油化工中间体。从1990年到2010年，它们的需求量显著增长。

乙烯的主要生产方法仍然是乙烷、液化石油气和重质原料的热裂解。这个过程也会产生大量的丙烯副产品。对于丙烯来说，丙烷的催化脱氢已成为一种重要的生产途径。

轻质烯烃的合成面临几个热力学挑战：

1. 脱氢是一个吸热的、受平衡限制的反应。
2. 更高的转化率需要更高的温度或更低的压力。
3. 与重质烷烃相比，轻质烷烃（如丙烷）的脱氢需要更高的温度。

例如，在1个大气压和40%转化率的条件下，丙烷脱氢需要至少580°C，而十二烷在450°C就可以达到相同的转化率。这种温度差异是由于平衡常数随碳原子数增加而增大。

这些挑战需要仔细的工艺设计和催化剂选择，以实现经济可行的轻质烯烃脱氢生产。
