Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are the top two highest volume petrochemical intermediates globally. Their demand and production have grown significantly from 1990 to 2010. 

Ethylene is primarily produced through thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks. Propylene is obtained as a byproduct from thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks, as well as from fluid catalytic cracking in refineries. However, due to propylene's growth rate outpacing these conventional supply routes, selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has become an important commercial production method.

The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges. Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction. Higher conversions require either higher temperatures or lower pressures. The dehydrogenation of light paraffins requires much higher temperatures compared to heavy paraffins, as the equilibrium constant increases with increasing carbon number.

These factors make the production of light olefins, especially through dehydrogenation, a complex process that requires careful consideration of reaction conditions and catalyst selection to overcome thermodynamic limitations and achieve economically viable yields.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是全球产量最大的两种石油化工中间体。从1990年到2010年,它们的需求和产量显著增长。

乙烯主要通过乙烷、液化石油气和较重馏分的热裂解生产。丙烯作为副产品从液化石油气或较重馏分的热裂解以及炼油厂的流化催化裂化中获得。然而,由于丙烯的增长率超过了这些传统供应途径,丙烷选择性催化脱氢已成为一种重要的商业化生产方法。

轻质烯烃的合成面临热力学挑战。烷烃脱氢是一个吸热的、受平衡限制的反应。更高的转化率需要更高的温度或更低的压力。与重质烷烃相比,轻质烷烃的脱氢需要更高的温度,因为平衡常数随着碳数的增加而增加。

这些因素使得轻质烯烃的生产,尤其是通过脱氢方式,成为一个复杂的过程,需要仔细考虑反应条件和催化剂的选择,以克服热力学限制并实现经济可行的产率。
