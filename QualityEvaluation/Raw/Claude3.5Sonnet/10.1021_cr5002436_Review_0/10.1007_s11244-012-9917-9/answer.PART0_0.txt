[1] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."

[2] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."

[3] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins."

[4] "For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

[5] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are the largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally, with significant demand growth from 1990 to 2010. They have widespread applications in the chemical industry.

The main production methods for ethylene and propylene are:
1. Thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks (primary route for ethylene, also produces propylene as byproduct)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries (produces propylene as byproduct)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (for propylene)

Key thermodynamic challenges in synthesizing light olefins through dehydrogenation include:

1. Higher temperatures required compared to heavier paraffins (e.g. 580°C for propane vs 450°C for dodecane at 40% conversion)
2. Endothermic reaction limited by chemical equilibrium 
3. Higher conversion requires either higher temperatures or lower pressures
4. Equilibrium constant increases with increasing carbon number

These factors make light olefin production more challenging than heavier olefins, requiring careful reactor and process design to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是全球最大产量的石油化工中间体,从1990年到2010年需求增长显著。它们在化工行业有广泛应用。

乙烯和丙烯的主要生产方法包括:
1. 乙烷、液化石油气和重质原料的热裂解(乙烯的主要途径,同时也生产丙烯副产品)
2. 炼油厂的流化催化裂化(生产丙烯副产品)
3. 丙烷的催化脱氢(生产丙烯)

通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃的主要热力学挑战包括:

1. 与重质烷烃相比需要更高的温度(例如,40%转化率时丙烷需要580°C,而十二烷只需450°C)
2. 吸热反应受化学平衡限制
3. 更高的转化率需要更高的温度或更低的压力
4. 平衡常数随碳数增加而增加

这些因素使得轻质烯烃的生产比重质烯烃更具挑战性,需要精心设计反应器和工艺来克服热力学限制。
