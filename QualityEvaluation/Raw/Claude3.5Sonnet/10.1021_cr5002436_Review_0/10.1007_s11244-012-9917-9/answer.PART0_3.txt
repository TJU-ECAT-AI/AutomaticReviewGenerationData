[1] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."

[2] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."

[3] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

[4] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins."

[5] "For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are the largest volume petrochemical intermediates, with worldwide demand growing significantly from 1990 to 2010. They have extensive applications in the chemical industry.

The main production methods for light olefins are:
1. Thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks (for ethylene)
2. Byproduct from thermal cracking of LPG/heavier feedstocks and fluid catalytic cracking (for propylene) 
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (for propylene)

Key thermodynamic challenges in synthesizing light olefins via dehydrogenation include:

1. Endothermic reaction limited by chemical equilibrium
2. Higher temperatures or lower pressures required for higher conversion
3. Light paraffins require much higher temperatures than heavy paraffins for dehydrogenation
4. For example, propane dehydrogenation needs at least 580°C for 40% conversion at 1 atm, while dodecane only needs 450°C

These challenges arise from the thermodynamic properties related to alkane chain length, with shorter chains requiring more severe conditions for dehydrogenation.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是体量最大的石油化工中间体,从1990年到2010年,其全球需求显著增长。它们在化工行业有广泛的应用。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法有:
1. 乙烷、液化石油气和重质原料的热裂解(生产乙烯)
2. 液化石油气/重质原料热裂解和流化催化裂化的副产品(生产丙烯)
3. 丙烷的催化脱氢(生产丙烯)

通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃的主要热力学挑战包括:

1. 吸热反应受化学平衡限制
2. 需要更高的温度或更低的压力才能获得更高的转化率
3. 轻质烷烃的脱氢需要比重质烷烃高得多的温度
4. 例如,在1个大气压下,丙烷脱氢需要至少580°C才能达到40%的转化率,而十二烷只需450°C

这些挑战源于与烷烃链长相关的热力学性质,链越短,脱氢所需的条件就越苛刻。
