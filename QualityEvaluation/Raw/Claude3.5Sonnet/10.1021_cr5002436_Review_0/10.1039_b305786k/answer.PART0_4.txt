[1] "Per year, close to 10 million metric tons of olefins are produced using catalytic dehydrogenation processes."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane is an industrially very important reaction with a relatively short catalyst lifetime."

[3] "In the propane dehydrogenation the catalyst deactivates fast. Commonly, a regenerative procedure in air is, therefore, used for the catalyst once every 2030 min."

[4] "Having a pure alkane feed will drastically decrease the timescale in which changes on the catalyst are taking place (oxidation state and coke formation) compared to our observations."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contributions to the chemical industry, their applications, market trends, and production methods. However, it does offer some relevant insights:

Light olefins, particularly propylene, are produced in large quantities through catalytic dehydrogenation processes. The industrial significance of propane dehydrogenation is highlighted, with annual production of olefins reaching nearly 10 million metric tons using these processes.

The main production method discussed is catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, specifically propane. This process faces challenges related to catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration cycles (every 20-30 minutes) to maintain efficiency.

Thermodynamic challenges are indirectly addressed through the discussion of high temperatures (823 K or 550°C) used in the process and the need for regeneration cycles. The endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction is implied by the mention of using heat from coke combustion during regeneration to support the next dehydrogenation cycle.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss pressure effects or impacts of alkane chain length, it does mention that using pure alkane feeds (as opposed to diluted feeds) significantly accelerates catalyst changes and deactivation.

The literature focuses primarily on the production process rather than applications or market trends of light olefins. To fully address the question, additional information from other sources would be needed.

该文献并未提供全面的信息来完整回答关于轻质烯烃对化学工业的贡献、应用、市场趋势和生产方法的问题。然而，它确实提供了一些相关的见解：

轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯，通过催化脱氢工艺大量生产。文献强调了丙烷脱氢的工业重要性，使用这些工艺每年生产的烯烃接近1000万公吨。

讨论的主要生产方法是烷烃的催化脱氢，特别是丙烷。这个过程面临着与催化剂失活相关的挑战，需要频繁的再生循环（每20-30分钟）以保持效率。

热力学挑战通过讨论过程中使用的高温（823 K或550°C）以及再生循环的需求间接提到。脱氢反应的吸热性质从再生过程中焦炭燃烧产生的热量用于支持下一个脱氢循环的描述中可以推断出来。

虽然文献没有明确讨论压力效应或烷烃链长的影响，但确实提到使用纯烷烃原料（相对于稀释原料）会显著加速催化剂的变化和失活。

该文献主要关注生产过程，而不是轻质烯烃的应用或市场趋势。要全面回答这个问题，需要其他来源的额外信息。
