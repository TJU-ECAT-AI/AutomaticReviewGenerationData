The literature provides limited information directly relevant to the question. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene is an industrially important process, with close to 10 million metric tons of olefins produced annually using catalytic dehydrogenation. 

The main production method discussed is catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, specifically propane dehydrogenation to propylene. This process faces challenges related to rapid catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration cycles (every 20-30 minutes) to maintain activity.

The document does not provide information on other production methods, applications of light olefins, market trends, or detailed thermodynamic challenges. It also doesn't discuss effects of temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length beyond mentioning the reaction temperature of 823 K for propane dehydrogenation.

文献提供的信息与问题直接相关的有限。然而，它确实提到丙烷脱氢生产丙烯是一个工业上非常重要的过程，每年使用催化脱氢法生产近1000万吨烯烃。

讨论的主要生产方法是烷烃的催化脱氢，特别是丙烷脱氢生产丙烯。这个过程面临的挑战与催化剂快速失活有关，需要频繁的再生循环（每20-30分钟）来维持活性。

文档没有提供关于其他生产方法、轻质烯烃应用、市场趋势或详细的热力学挑战的信息。除了提到丙烷脱氢的反应温度为823 K外，它也没有讨论温度、压力或烷烃链长的影响。
