[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry, with demand expected to grow significantly. They are primarily used to produce various polymers and chemical intermediates. 

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking favors ethylene production, but propylene demand is growing faster, especially in Western Europe. This mismatch between supply and demand is driving research into alternative production methods.

Catalytic dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic limitations that restrict alkane conversion, particularly for longer chain alkanes. Higher temperatures are needed to overcome these constraints, but this leads to rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. Pressure also affects the equilibrium, with lower pressures favoring olefin formation.

The development of more effective catalysts, with high activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired olefins, is critical for improving the economic viability of alkane-based olefin production processes. Researchers are exploring various catalyst compositions and reactor configurations to overcome these challenges.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料,预计需求将显著增长。它们主要用于生产各种聚合物和化学中间体。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢。蒸汽裂解有利于乙烯生产,但丙烯需求增长更快,尤其是在西欧。这种供需不匹配正在推动替代生产方法的研究。

催化脱氢面临热力学限制,限制了烷烃转化,特别是对于较长链的烷烃。需要更高的温度来克服这些限制,但这会导致催化剂因结焦而快速失活。压力也会影响平衡,较低的压力有利于烯烃的形成。

开发更有效的催化剂,具有高活性的烷烃转化和对所需烯烃的选择性,对于提高基于烷烃的烯烃生产过程的经济可行性至关重要。研究人员正在探索各种催化剂组成和反应器配置以克服这些挑战。

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry. Their demand is expected to grow significantly, with propylene demand increasing faster than ethylene, especially in Western Europe. These olefins have wide-ranging applications as building blocks for many chemical products.

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation. However, these methods face challenges:

1. Steam cracking favors ethylene production over propylene.
2. FCC produces smaller amounts of propylene.
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamic constraints and catalyst coking issues.

The thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis relate to the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions, which become more favorable at higher temperatures. However, higher temperatures can lead to undesired side reactions and coke formation. Pressure also affects the equilibrium, with lower pressures generally favoring olefin formation. As alkane chain length increases, the dehydrogenation becomes more thermodynamically favorable but also more complex due to increased side reactions.

These challenges have led to research into alternative production methods like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which aims to overcome thermodynamic limitations and improve energy efficiency.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的关键原料。预计它们的需求将显著增长，其中丙烯的需求增长速度快于乙烯，尤其是在西欧地区。这些烯烃作为许多化学产品的基础原料，有着广泛的应用。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和催化脱氢。然而，这些方法面临着一些挑战：

1. 蒸汽裂解更倾向于生产乙烯而非丙烯。
2. FCC产生的丙烯量较少。
3. 催化脱氢受到热力学限制和催化剂结焦问题的影响。

烯烃合成中的热力学挑战与脱氢反应的吸热性质有关，这些反应在较高温度下更有利。但是，较高的温度可能导致不希望的副反应和焦炭形成。压力也会影响平衡，通常较低的压力有利于烯烃的形成。随着烷烃链长的增加，脱氢在热力学上变得更有利，但由于副反应增加，过程也变得更复杂。

这些挑战导致了对替代生产方法的研究，如氧化脱氢（ODH），旨在克服热力学限制并提高能源效率。

Their demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future, with propylene demand growing faster than ethylene, especially in Western Europe. The main production methods for these olefins are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. 

Each production method has its challenges. Steam cracking favors ethylene production over propylene. Catalytic dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic constraints that limit alkane conversion and suffers from coking issues leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. These challenges are related to temperature and pressure conditions, as well as the alkane chain length being processed.

The growing demand for propylene in particular has created a mismatch with current production capabilities, driving research into alternative production methods like oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This illustrates how market trends for specific olefins can influence research directions in chemical engineering and catalysis.

The production of light olefins faces several thermodynamic challenges:

1. Dehydrogenation reactions are limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, restricting alkane conversion.

2. Higher temperatures are generally needed for shorter alkane chains (e.g. ethane vs propane).

3. Coking is a major issue in catalytic dehydrogenation, causing rapid catalyst deactivation.

4. Pressure effects can impact equilibrium conversion, with lower pressures generally favoring dehydrogenation.

These challenges have driven research into alternative production methods like oxidative dehydrogenation, which can overcome some thermodynamic limitations but introduces new complexities.
