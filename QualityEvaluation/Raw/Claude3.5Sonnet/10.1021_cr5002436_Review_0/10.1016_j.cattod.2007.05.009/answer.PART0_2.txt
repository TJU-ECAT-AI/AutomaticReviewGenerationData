Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry. Their demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future, with propylene demand growing faster than ethylene, especially in Western Europe. The main production methods for these olefins are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. 

Each production method has its challenges. Steam cracking favors ethylene production over propylene. Catalytic dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic constraints that limit alkane conversion and suffers from coking issues leading to rapid catalyst deactivation. These challenges are related to temperature and pressure conditions, as well as the alkane chain length being processed.

The growing demand for propylene in particular has created a mismatch with current production capabilities, driving research into alternative production methods like oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. This illustrates how market trends for specific olefins can influence research directions in chemical engineering and catalysis.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料。预计它们的需求在不久的将来会显著增加，其中丙烯的需求增长速度快于乙烯，尤其是在西欧地区。这些烯烃的主要生产方法包括蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢。

每种生产方法都面临着挑战。蒸汽裂解更倾向于生产乙烯而非丙烯。催化脱氢面临着热力学限制，限制了烷烃的转化，并且存在积碳问题导致催化剂快速失活。这些挑战与温度、压力条件以及所处理的烷烃链长有关。

特别是丙烯需求的增长与当前的生产能力不匹配，推动了对烷烃氧化脱氢等替代生产方法的研究。这说明了特定烯烃的市场趋势如何影响化学工程和催化领域的研究方向。
