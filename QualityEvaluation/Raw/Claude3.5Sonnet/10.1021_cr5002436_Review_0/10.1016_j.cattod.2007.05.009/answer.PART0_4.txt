[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry, with demand expected to grow significantly. They are used to produce a wide range of chemicals and materials. The main production methods are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. 

Steam cracking primarily produces ethylene, but propylene demand is growing faster, especially in Western Europe. This mismatch between supply and demand is driving research into alternative production methods.

Catalytic dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic limitations on alkane conversion and issues with catalyst coking and deactivation. These challenges increase with longer alkane chain lengths and lower temperatures/pressures. 

The thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in olefin production, particularly for propylene, are spurring research into new technologies like oxidative dehydrogenation to overcome these limitations and meet growing market demand more efficiently.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料,预计需求将大幅增长。它们被用于生产广泛的化学品和材料。主要的生产方法包括蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化和催化脱氢。

蒸汽裂解主要生产乙烯,但丙烯的需求增长更快,尤其是在西欧。这种供需不匹配推动了对替代生产方法的研究。

催化脱氢面临烷烃转化的热力学限制以及催化剂结焦和失活的问题。这些挑战随着烷烃链长的增加和温度/压力的降低而增加。

烯烃生产中的热力学和动力学挑战,特别是对于丙烯,正在推动对新技术如氧化脱氢的研究,以克服这些限制并更有效地满足不断增长的市场需求。
