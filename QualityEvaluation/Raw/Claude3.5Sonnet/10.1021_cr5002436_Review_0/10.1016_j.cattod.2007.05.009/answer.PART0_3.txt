Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry, with demand expected to grow significantly. They are used to produce a wide range of petrochemicals and plastics. Currently, the main production methods are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation. 

Steam cracking primarily produces ethylene, but propylene demand is growing faster, especially in Western Europe. This mismatch between supply and demand is a key challenge for the industry.

The production of light olefins faces several thermodynamic challenges:

1. Dehydrogenation reactions are limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, restricting alkane conversion.

2. Higher temperatures are generally needed for shorter alkane chains (e.g. ethane vs propane).

3. Coking is a major issue in catalytic dehydrogenation, causing rapid catalyst deactivation.

4. Pressure effects can impact equilibrium conversion, with lower pressures generally favoring dehydrogenation.

These challenges have driven research into alternative production methods like oxidative dehydrogenation, which can overcome some thermodynamic limitations but introduces new complexities.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的关键原料,预计需求将大幅增长。它们被用于生产多种石油化学品和塑料。目前,主要的生产方法是蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解(FCC)和催化脱氢。

蒸汽裂解主要生产乙烯,但丙烯的需求增长更快,尤其是在西欧。这种供需不匹配是行业面临的一个关键挑战。

轻质烯烃的生产面临几个热力学挑战:

1. 脱氢反应受热力学平衡限制,限制了烷烃转化率。

2. 较短的烷烃链(如乙烷vs丙烷)通常需要更高的温度。

3. 结焦是催化脱氢的一个主要问题,导致催化剂快速失活。

4. 压力效应可以影响平衡转化率,较低的压力通常有利于脱氢。

这些挑战推动了对替代生产方法的研究,如氧化脱氢,它可以克服一些热力学限制,但也带来了新的复杂性。
