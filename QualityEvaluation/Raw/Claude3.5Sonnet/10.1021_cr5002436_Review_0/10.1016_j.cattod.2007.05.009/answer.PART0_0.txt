[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry, with demand expected to grow significantly. They are primarily used to produce various polymers and chemical intermediates. 

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. Steam cracking favors ethylene production, but propylene demand is growing faster, especially in Western Europe. This mismatch between supply and demand is driving research into alternative production methods.

Catalytic dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic limitations that restrict alkane conversion, particularly for longer chain alkanes. Higher temperatures are needed to overcome these constraints, but this leads to rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. Pressure also affects the equilibrium, with lower pressures favoring olefin formation.

The development of more effective catalysts, with high activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired olefins, is critical for improving the economic viability of alkane-based olefin production processes. Researchers are exploring various catalyst compositions and reactor configurations to overcome these challenges.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料,预计需求将显著增长。它们主要用于生产各种聚合物和化学中间体。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢。蒸汽裂解有利于乙烯生产,但丙烯需求增长更快,尤其是在西欧。这种供需不匹配正在推动替代生产方法的研究。

催化脱氢面临热力学限制,限制了烷烃转化,特别是对于较长链的烷烃。需要更高的温度来克服这些限制,但这会导致催化剂因结焦而快速失活。压力也会影响平衡,较低的压力有利于烯烃的形成。

开发更有效的催化剂,具有高活性的烷烃转化和对所需烯烃的选择性,对于提高基于烷烃的烯烃生产过程的经济可行性至关重要。研究人员正在探索各种催化剂组成和反应器配置以克服这些挑战。
