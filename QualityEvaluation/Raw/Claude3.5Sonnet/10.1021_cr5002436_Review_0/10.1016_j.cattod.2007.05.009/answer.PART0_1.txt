Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry. Their demand is expected to grow significantly, with propylene demand increasing faster than ethylene, especially in Western Europe. These olefins have wide-ranging applications as building blocks for many chemical products.

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation. However, these methods face challenges:

1. Steam cracking favors ethylene production over propylene.
2. FCC produces smaller amounts of propylene.
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamic constraints and catalyst coking issues.

The thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis relate to the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions, which become more favorable at higher temperatures. However, higher temperatures can lead to undesired side reactions and coke formation. Pressure also affects the equilibrium, with lower pressures generally favoring olefin formation. As alkane chain length increases, the dehydrogenation becomes more thermodynamically favorable but also more complex due to increased side reactions.

These challenges have led to research into alternative production methods like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), which aims to overcome thermodynamic limitations and improve energy efficiency.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的关键原料。预计它们的需求将显著增长，其中丙烯的需求增长速度快于乙烯，尤其是在西欧地区。这些烯烃作为许多化学产品的基础原料，有着广泛的应用。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和催化脱氢。然而，这些方法面临着一些挑战：

1. 蒸汽裂解更倾向于生产乙烯而非丙烯。
2. FCC产生的丙烯量较少。
3. 催化脱氢受到热力学限制和催化剂结焦问题的影响。

烯烃合成中的热力学挑战与脱氢反应的吸热性质有关，这些反应在较高温度下更有利。但是，较高的温度可能导致不希望的副反应和焦炭形成。压力也会影响平衡，通常较低的压力有利于烯烃的形成。随着烷烃链长的增加，脱氢在热力学上变得更有利，但由于副反应增加，过程也变得更复杂。

这些挑战导致了对替代生产方法的研究，如氧化脱氢（ODH），旨在克服热力学限制并提高能源效率。
