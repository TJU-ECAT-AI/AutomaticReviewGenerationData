[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene has become a critical technology to fill the propylene shortage, which is increasing due to the portion of steam crackers now using inexpensive ethane feedstock"

[2] "Briefly, the main considerations in the catalytic dehydrogenation are the high reaction enthalpy, 30 kcal/mol, and the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. These two factors require the process to operate at high temperatures (>600 C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels."

[3] "As evidence, over 5 million tons of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation capacity is expected in the next 5 years."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. Propylene, in particular, is facing increasing demand due to shortages caused by steam crackers switching to cheaper ethane feedstock. This has led to the development of on-purpose production methods, with over 5 million tons of propane dehydrogenation capacity expected in the near future.

The main production method discussed is catalytic dehydrogenation, which faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The process is highly endothermic, with a reaction enthalpy of 30 kcal/mol, and is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. To achieve economically viable conversion levels, the process must operate at high temperatures (above 600°C) and low pressures (below 30 psig).

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss ethylene production or the effects of alkane chain length, it's clear that thermodynamic considerations play a crucial role in olefin synthesis. The high temperatures and low pressures required for propane dehydrogenation suggest that similar challenges would apply to other light olefins, with specific conditions likely varying based on the alkane chain length of the feedstock.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的关键原料。特别是丙烯，由于蒸汽裂解装置转向使用更便宜的乙烷原料而导致短缺，因此面临着日益增长的需求。这导致了定向生产方法的发展，预计在不久的将来将有超过500万吨的丙烷脱氢产能。

讨论的主要生产方法是催化脱氢，它面临着重大的热力学挑战。该过程高度吸热，反应焓为30千卡/摩尔，并受热力学平衡的限制。为了达到经济可行的转化水平，该过程必须在高温（600°C以上）和低压（30 psig以下）下运行。

虽然文档没有明确讨论乙烯生产或烷烃链长的影响，但很明显热力学考虑在烯烃合成中起着关键作用。丙烷脱氢所需的高温和低压表明，类似的挑战也适用于其他轻质烯烃，具体条件可能会根据原料的烷烃链长而有所不同。
