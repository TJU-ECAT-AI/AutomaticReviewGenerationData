[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene has become a critical technology to fill the propylene shortage, which is increasing due to the portion of steam crackers now using inexpensive ethane feedstock"

[2] "Briefly, the main considerations in the catalytic dehydrogenation are the high reaction enthalpy, 30 kcal/mol, and the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. These two factors require the process to operate at high temperatures (>600 C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels."

[3] "As evidence, over 5 million tons of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation capacity is expected in the next 5 years."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are critical feedstocks for the chemical industry. Propylene in particular is facing increasing demand and shortage due to steam crackers shifting to ethane feedstock. The main production method discussed is catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes like propane.

Key thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis include:
1. High reaction enthalpy (30 kcal/mol for propane dehydrogenation)
2. Thermodynamic equilibrium limitations

These challenges necessitate high temperatures (>600°C) and low pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economically viable conversion levels. The process conditions are affected by the alkane chain length, with lighter alkanes generally requiring more severe conditions.

The market trend shows increasing on-purpose propylene production, with over 5 million tons of new propane dehydrogenation capacity expected in the near future to address the propylene shortage. This highlights the growing importance of catalytic dehydrogenation technologies in light olefin production.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的关键原料。特别是丙烯面临着需求增加和短缺的问题,这是由于蒸汽裂解装置转向使用乙烷作为原料。讨论的主要生产方法是烷烃(如丙烷)的催化脱氢。

烯烃合成的主要热力学挑战包括:
1. 高反应焓(丙烷脱氢为30千卡/摩尔)
2. 热力学平衡限制

这些挑战需要高温(>600°C)和低压(<30 psig)才能达到经济可行的转化水平。工艺条件受烷烃链长的影响,较轻的烷烃通常需要更严苛的条件。

市场趋势显示,定向丙烯生产正在增加,预计在不久的将来将新增超过500万吨的丙烷脱氢产能,以解决丙烯短缺问题。这凸显了催化脱氢技术在轻质烯烃生产中日益增长的重要性。
