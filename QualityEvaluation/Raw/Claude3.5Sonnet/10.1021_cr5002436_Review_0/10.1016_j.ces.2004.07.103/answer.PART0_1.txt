[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

[3] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry. The literature indicates that demand for propylene has grown significantly in recent years, outpacing supply from conventional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This has led to increased interest in on-purpose propylene production via propane dehydrogenation.

The dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene faces thermodynamic challenges. It requires high temperatures (around 850 K) and low pressures (0.2-0.5 bar) to drive the equilibrium towards propylene formation. These conditions are necessary because dehydrogenation reactions become more thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures and lower pressures.

The literature does not provide specific information on ethylene production methods or the effects of alkane chain length. However, similar thermodynamic principles likely apply to other light olefin production processes, with higher temperatures and lower pressures generally favoring dehydrogenation reactions for longer chain alkanes.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料。文献表明,近年来丙烯需求显著增长,超过了传统生产方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化)的供应能力。这导致了通过丙烷脱氢生产丙烯的兴趣增加。

丙烷脱氢生产丙烯面临热力学挑战。它需要高温(约850 K)和低压(0.2-0.5巴)来推动平衡向丙烯形成方向发展。这些条件是必要的,因为脱氢反应在更高的温度和更低的压力下变得更有利于热力学。

文献没有提供关于乙烯生产方法或烷烃链长效应的具体信息。然而,类似的热力学原理可能适用于其他轻质烯烃的生产过程,对于较长链的烷烃,较高的温度和较低的压力通常有利于脱氢反应。
