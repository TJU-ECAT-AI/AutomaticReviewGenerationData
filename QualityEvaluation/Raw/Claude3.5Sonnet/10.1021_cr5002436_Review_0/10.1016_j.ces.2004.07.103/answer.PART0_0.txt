Light olefins like propylene have seen significantly increased demand over the past decade, outpacing supply from conventional sources like steam crackers and FCCs. This has made propane dehydrogenation an increasingly attractive production method. 

The propane dehydrogenation process faces thermodynamic challenges, operating at high temperatures around 850 K and low pressures of 0.2-0.5 bar to drive the reaction forward. The reaction is endothermic, requiring heat input.

Catalyst deactivation through coking and reduction of the active chromium species presents another key challenge. The process requires periodic regeneration cycles to burn off coke and re-oxidize the catalyst.

While not explicitly stated, shorter alkane chain length generally favors dehydrogenation thermodynamically. However, the document focuses specifically on propane dehydrogenation rather than comparing different alkanes.

The literature does not provide information on specific applications or detailed market trends for light olefins beyond noting the increased demand for propylene. It also does not discuss production methods besides propane dehydrogenation in detail.

轻质烯烃如丙烯在过去十年中需求显著增加,超过了蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化等传统来源的供应能力。这使得丙烷脱氢成为一种越来越具有吸引力的生产方法。

丙烷脱氢工艺面临热力学挑战,需要在约850 K的高温和0.2-0.5巴的低压下运行,以推动反应向前进行。该反应是吸热的,需要输入热量。

通过结焦和活性铬物种的还原导致的催化剂失活是另一个关键挑战。该工艺需要定期进行再生循环,以燃烧掉积碳并重新氧化催化剂。

虽然没有明确说明,但较短的烷烃链长通常在热力学上更有利于脱氢。然而,该文献主要集中讨论丙烷脱氢,而没有比较不同的烷烃。

该文献没有提供轻质烯烃的具体应用或详细市场趋势信息,除了提到丙烯需求增加外。它也没有详细讨论除丙烷脱氢以外的其他生产方法。
