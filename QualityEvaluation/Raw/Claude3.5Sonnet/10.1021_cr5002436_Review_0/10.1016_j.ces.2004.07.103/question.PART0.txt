Abstract
UVVis and Raman spectroscopy are applied under realistic reaction conditions to investigate the changes occurring to an industrial-like
supported chromium oxide catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane. Linking the catalytic activity to the simultaneously collected
spectroscopic data has shown that coke is a key parameter to the activity of the catalyst. A small amount of coke improves its activity,
most likely by an improved adsorption of propane on the catalyst, but the activity of the catalyst drops when the amount of coke exceeds
a certain value. This point is visualized by a sharp increase in the overall absorbance of the sample as can be observed by UVVis
spectroscopy and this information can be used as a signal for starting a regeneration cycle.

1. Introduction
In chemical industry, catalytic processes are often con-
trolled using an end-of-pipe approach, i.e. by analyzing the
products leaving the reactor and using that as a feedback for
controlling the reactor temperature and feed rates. However,
using new fiber optic spectroscopic techniques, it is now
possible to directly gather information on the active catalyst
in the reactor. By using techniques, like UVVis and Ra-
man spectroscopy, information can be collected on for ex-
ample the oxidation state of the catalyst, the formation of
coke, the amount of active sites available, and adsorbates
(Nijhuis et al., 2003; Weckhuysen, 2003). All this informa-
tion is gathered in real-time directly at the site where the
reaction occurs. Therefore it can be used as the most direct
method to control a chemical process. As a result the control
system can intervene faster to maintain the desired conver-
sion levels and selectivities in the reactor. In this paper, a

first step towards the development of such a process control
system for the dehydrogenation of propane over supported
chromium oxide catalysts is being presented. Both UVVis
and Raman spectroscopy are used simultaneously under re-
alistic reaction conditions to track changes to the catalyst,
primarily the coke content.
Over the past decade the demand for propene has in-
creased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be
supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers
and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers) (Tullo, 2003). Con-
sequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more
attractive. One of the propane dehydrogenation processes
available is the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) (Bhasin
et al., 2001). A Catofin plant usually contains 5 cyclically
operated reactors containing a chromium oxide on alumina
catalyst. The process is run at a temperature of around
850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar. Each
reactor undergoes a cycle of typically 12 min of propane de-
hydrogenation, 3 min purge/evacuation, 12 min of catalyst
regeneration using air, 3 min of purge/evacuation optionally
followed by a catalyst reduction. The 5 reactors are switched
in such a manner that the overall plant operates in a

continuous manner, with always 2 reactors dehydrogenating,
2 regenerating and 1 under purge.
During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity
changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke
on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). In the
regeneration cycle the coke is combusted and the chromium
is reoxidized. The catalyst is reheated by the heat of com-
bustion of the coke and usually the combustion of a small
amount of natural gas added to the regeneration air, in this
way providing the heat required for the endothermal dehy-
drogenation reaction.
Currently the cycle times for the Catofin process are fixed
and based on past experience. During the lifetime of the cat-
alyst (typically 2 years), the reaction temperature is grad-
ually increased to maintain the desired conversion level.
Spectroscopy is an excellent manner to track the state of
the catalyst during the process. A combination of UVVis
and Raman spectroscopy to monitor the state of the cata-
lyst during its lifetime would provide a much better insight
in the catalyst health and allow making other choices based
on this information to keep the process running most effi-
ciently. Adjustments to the cycle times, pressure, tempera-
ture and feedrates can be made. UVVis spectroscopy is a
good method to track the oxidation state of the catalyst and
thereby see the chromium go through its redox cycle. It is
assumed that the amount of the so called redox-chromium
is linked directly to the activity of the catalyst (Puurunen
and Weckhuysen, 2002). Chromium oxide is slowly lost
during the catalyst life as a result of migration of chromium
into the alumina support, which can also be monitored ex-
cellently using UVVis spectroscopy as this results in the
absorption bands shifting to shorter wavelengths (Fig. 1).
Especially, if the catalyst reaches a high temperature during
coke combustion, this migration occurs more rapidly. Ra-
man spectroscopy is an excellent method to track the differ-
ent types of coke as they are being deposited on the catalyst
(Chua and Stair, 2003). The advantage of using both UVVis
and Raman spectroscopy simultaneously is that they pro-
vide complimentary information: electronic for UVVis and
vibrational for Raman. Both techniques can be applied eas-
ily in Operando (under realistic reaction conditions), since
they both are non-contact techniques and can be done us-
ing optical fibers with the measuring electronics a safe dis-
tance away from the reactor. In this study it will be shown
how information gathered using UVVis and Raman spec-
troscopy can be linked to the observed catalytic activity for
the propane dehydrogenation. This is done for a chromium
on alumina catalyst similar to that being used commercially,
the primary focus being on the role of coke as a function of
the bed height. For this purpose, a new operando set-up has
been constructed.
2. Experimental
A reactor system has been developed containing a square
5 mm inner diameter quartz reactor tube with optical grade
quartz windows. Typically, 1 g of catalyst (total bed height
45 mm) is placed in the reactor as a packed bed supported
on quartz wool. The reactor is placed vertically in the cen-
ter of a 15-cm long tubular oven block; a thermocouple is
inserted in the catalyst bed to monitor the catalyst temper-
ature. The metal oven block has on one side a horizontal
8-mm hole directed at the center of the catalyst bed for Ra-
man measurements, on the opposite side is a vertical slit of
50-mm high and 5-mm wide for UVVis analysis. The slit is
used to focus 4 Ocean Optics Bi-FL600 optical fiber probes
(each containing two 600 m fibers, usable up to 973 K) at
the catalyst bed at a vertical spacing of 10 mm to be able to
determine spatial profiles over the bed. Of each probe, one
fiber is connected to one of the four channels of an Avantes
Avaspec-2048-4 spectrometer and another fiber is connected
to an Ocean Optics DH-2000 BAL halogen-deuterium light
source. A Halon disk was used for white reference measure-
ments for the spectrophotometer. The UVVis spectrometers
were used with an integration time of 40 ms and 30 spec-
tra were averaged for signal noise reduction. The measuring
range of the spectrophotometers is 2001100 nm.
Raman spectra were obtained using a Kaiser RXN spec-
trometer equipped with a 532 nm laser (1064 nm frequency
doubled Nb-YAG. laser) The Raman laser was focused at the
catalyst using a 5.5 non-contact objective. The same ob-
jective is also collecting the Raman scattered light. Twenty
spectra were accumulated with a 2 s exposure time. The laser
output power of 70 mW is unlikely to cause any changes to
the catalyst, since this energy input is negligible compared
to the heat input by the oven. In Fig. 2 the reactor system
is shown. The gas leaving the reactor is analyzed by an In-
terscience Compact GC system equipped with Porabond-Q
(analysis of organics) and Molsieve 5A (analysis of perma-
nent gases) columns. This GC system is capable of perform-
ing analyses within less than 60 s.
The reactor system has been used to monitor the
changes in a catalyst during a number of propane

dehydrogenationregeneration cycles using a 13 wt% Cr-
on-alumina catalyst (150 m particles). In these experiments
the reactor was heated at 10 K/min to a catalyst temperature
of 823 K in a gas stream of 10 ml/min of O2 in 40 ml/min of
He. After heating, the reactor was operated isothermally in
cycles of alternating dehydrogenation for about 50 min with
10 ml/min of propane in 40 ml/min of He and regenerating
for about 50 min with 10 ml/min of O2 in 40 ml/min of
He. During the first 120 s of each cycle UVVis measure-
ments were performed with a 1 s interval to track the rapid
changes on the catalyst. After this time measurements were
carried out at a 60 s interval. Raman measurements were
performed at 300 s intervals. During the entire experiment
the product gas composition was monitored using the GC.
The temperature of the catalyst was monitored by a small
thermocouple in the middle of the bed. The heat capacity
of the reactor/oven assembly and the heating power of the
oven was sufficient to keep the whole reactor isothermal
within 1 K during the endothermal dehydrogenation reac-
tion, in the regeneration phase, typically short temperature
increases of 1020 K were observed due to the combustion
of coke on the catalyst. After the experiments, the coke con-
tents at different vertical positions in the catalyst bed were
determined using thermogravimetrical analysis in artificial
air using a PerkinElmer Pyris 1 TGA.
3. Results
The experiments with the chromium oxide on alumina
catalyst could be performed reproducibly with no observ-
able changes in activity, selectivity, and spectra (UVVis
and Raman) in the regenerated state after up to 10 consec-
utive dehydrogenationregeneration cycles. Therefore, only
the behavior of the catalyst during a single cycle will be
discussed. The length of this cycle was extended to 4 h to
gain more insight in the changes occurring to the catalyst
over time. In Fig. 3 the conversion and selectivity during
this cycle are given. As can be seen, there is a clear trend
in the conversion over time. During the first 2 h it increases
and then goes down slowly. The initially high conversion at
t = 0 is caused by the combustion of some propane as it
reduced the catalyst. This also explains the initially lower
selectivity. Except for water and carbon dioxide from the
propane combustion, the only co-products that are observed
in a significant amount (approximately 0.2 vol%) are ethene
and methane. The remainder of the 20% non-selectively con-
verted propane therefore must end up largely as coke on the
catalyst. This coke formation is confirmed by the fact that
the hydrogen produced exceeds the amount of propene by
15%.
Some of the typical UVVis and Raman spectra that are
obtained during the dehydrogenation cycle are shown in
Fig. 4. Using UVVis it can be seen that the catalyst is
rapidly reduced at the start of the dehydrogenation cycle
(decrease in Cr(VI) band at 460 nm and increase in Cr(III)
band at 630 nm), after which the spectrum slowly becomes
less distinct as a result of darkening of the sample by coke

lyst as a result of the reduction during dehydrogenation, but
do show bands characteristics of coke deposits appearing in
the range 12001700 cm1.
After cooling down the reactor in helium at the end of
the dehydrogenation cycle, the reactor was removed from
the oven. A clear coke gradient could be observed visually
over the reactor. The top of the catalyst bed was light green
colored, slowly changing into dark gray towards the bottom
of the bed. In Fig. 5 Raman spectra are given recorded at
the top, middle and bottom of the reactor, again showing
that the top of the catalyst bed contains significantly less
coke than the lower part. Thermogravimetric analysis (coke
combustion in air) showed a coke content on the catalyst
increasing from 0.1 wt% at the top of the catalyst bed to
1.0 wt% at the bottom of the bed.

at
860920 K, 3350 kPa, 0.42 h1 LHSV, Buonomo et al.,
1997) shows that the conversion obtained here is signifi-
cantly different. This can be explained by the somewhat
lower temperature and lower propane partial pressure used
in this study (feed rate is similar). The most remarkable
in the behavior of the catalyst is that the activity passes
through a maximum. Since the catalyst performance is per-
fectly reproducible when consecutive cycles are measured,
both the increase and decrease in activity must be caused
by reversible/regenerable changes to the catalyst, i.e. the
result of changes to either the oxidation state of the catalyst
or the coverage of coke on the catalyst. The change in ox-
idation state, can be monitored excellently using UVVis.
It is seen, however, that the catalyst reduction takes place
instantaneously as propane is fed to the reactor. Within
10 s the intensity of the Cr(VI) charge transfer band at
450 nm has decreased and the 630 nm dd transition band
of Cr(III) has increased in intensity. After this short time no
more changes in intensity of these bands can be observed.
Furthermore, De Rossi et al. (1993) examined different re-
duction treatments and showed these had no effect on the
catalytic performance.
For coke on the catalyst on the other hand, changes to
both the type and quantity of coke are spectroscopically
visible during the dehydrogenation cycle. This is visible in
Fig. 6, showing the trends with respect to coke on the cat-
alyst over time. Fig. 6A shows the UVVis absorbance at
1000 nm, where no specific absorption bands are present.
The absorbance at this wavelength was used to characterize
the darkening of the sample. For Raman the intensities of the
bands of the two main coke species at 1577 and 1320 cm1
are shown in Fig. 6B.

ing the coke formation at different bed heights in the reactor (1 = top,
4 = bottom). (B) Raman intensities of bands of two predominant coke
species.
The different coke formation rates at the different bed
heights in Fig. 6A clearly shows that the coke on the cat-
alyst is primarily produced at the end of the reactor bed,
indicating that coke is formed primarily out of a secondary
reaction from the product propene, agreeing with the visual
observation after removing the reactor from the setup at the
end of the experiment. This observation is in contradiction
to the modeling work presented by Jackson and Stitt (2002),
who calculated that for an isothermal propane dehydrogena-
tion reactor the largest amount of coke deposits are present
at the inlet. To verify our assumption of coke formation pri-
marily out of propene, a separate experiment was carried
out, in which a flow of propene in helium was fed over the
reactor at the same conditions. In this case the four UVVis
probes all showed a rapid increase in overall adsorbance of
the catalyst in 10 min time.
When the coke profiles over time measured between Ra-
man and UVVis are compared, it can be seen that they do
not show the same trend. While after 2 h the UVVis mea-
surements indicate an increase in the rate at which coke is be-
ing built up on the catalyst, the Raman measurements show
one coke band (1577 cm1) remaining at the same level,
while the other main coke species (1320 cm1) decreases in
intensity. This might seem contradicting. However, a com-
plexing factor is that as the sample gets darker as a result
of coke deposition, self-absorption increases, resulting in a
reduction of Raman scattered light at the detector. Since the
catalyst itself has no observable Raman bands (the bands at
800, 1020, and 1150 cm1 are from the quartz reactor), it
is not possible to scale the coke bands to correct for this
effect and Raman should mostly be used to identify which
types of coke are present. The assumption that darkening of
the sample would be the cause of less intense coke bands
was confirmed by the experiment in which propene was fed
over the catalyst. Both UVVis and a carbon mass-balance
showed a continuous coke formation, while the intensity of
the coke bands observed by Raman decreases after 5 min. It
should therefore be concluded that it is best to use the dark-
ness of the sample as measured by UVVis spectroscopy as
a means to quantify the amount of coke, while relative peak
intensities measured using Raman provide only information
on the type of coke present.
Based on Raman characteristics of different coke species
reported by Chua and Stair (2003) assignments for the two
most dominant types of coke observed can be made. Since
the position and shape of bands shift as a function of tem-
perature, it is most convenient to use the Raman spectra
shown in Fig. 5 for identifying the different classes of coke
species. The spectrum in this figure can roughly be described
two broad bands at 1600 and 1320 cm1. These bands are
generally assigned to the sum vibration of ring stretching
of polyaromatic species. According to Chua and Stair for
larger sheet like polyaromatics the intensity of the band near
1600 cm1 is more intense than the intensity of the bands in
the 13001450 region, when comparing these molecules to
smaller chain like polyaromatics. In Fig. 6B it can be seen
that initially the band at 1320 cm1 is more intense. As the
experiment proceeds, this band becomes less intense com-
pared to the band at 1577 cm1. This relative shift is consis-
tent with the gradual growth of a graphitic-type coke layer
on the catalyst over time. Lespade et al. (1984) report a sim-
ilar decrease in the relative ratio of Raman intensities of the
bands at 1350/1581 cm1 as the coke becomes increasingly
graphitic in nature.
Combining the information from Figs. 3 and 6, one can
see that during the first 2 h of dehydrogenation there is a
slow formation of coke on the catalyst, while at the same
time the catalytic activity increases. Considering that the
catalyst was already reduced in a very short time and that
the catalyst is not being reduced further than to Cr(III), the
most probable explanation for the increase in activity is that
coke in some way is beneficial for the catalytic activity. This
is supported by the observation that for other low-loaded
chromia and vanadia catalysts on different supports, an
5492
T.A. Nijhuis et al. / Chemical Engineering Science 59 (2004) 54875492
increasing catalytic activity is only observed for catalysts
producing coke (Tinnemans et al., 2004). The most likely
explanation is that the coke layer facilitates the adsorption
of propane on the catalyst. Propane adsorbs on the coke and
migrates over the coke surface to the active chromium sites.
In a paper on the effect of coke on catalysts by Menon
(1990) such an adsorption effect is mentioned as one of
the manners in which coke can be beneficial for the perfor-
mance of a catalyst. For the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation
it is actually seen as part of the active site, a possibility
that cannot be completely ruled out for this case, but is less
likely since also non-coking catalysts can have a similarly
high activity.
After 2 h of reaction time the visible amount of coke on the
catalyst increases, while at the same time also the conversion
of the catalyst begins to drop. It should be noted that although
after 2 h in Fig. 6A the rate at which the absorbance of
the sample increases becomes higher, this does not mean
that the actual coke formation rate also increases. Since the
selectivity of the dehydrogenation reaction does not change,
this implies that neither more propane nor more propene
is converted into coke. The increase in absorbance can be
best explained by the coke patches on the catalyst surface
increasing in size and starting to connect and cover the entire
surface of the catalyst, effectively blocking the scattering
and reflection of light. At the same time as it starts covering
the chromium oxide, this becomes less accessible and the
activity of the catalysts drops. Since this front of complete
coke coverage of the catalyst starts at the exit of the reactor
and then moves forward only slowly towards the entrance,
the overall conversion only drops slowly.
The possibility to track the coke content at the catalyst in
a chemical reactor is highly attractive for the chemical in-
dustry. Using cheap and robust spectroscopic probes linked
via optical fibers to a spectrometer, one can gain informa-
tion on how changes or disturbances to a process affect the
amount of coke produced. This is a more direct approach
than by monitoring the reactor performance. Especially, in
the case of the propane dehydrogenation, in which a small
amount of coke is beneficial and only larger quantities are
deactivating, this can help to make process control decisions
to keep the catalyst in its most active state. Having knowl-
edge on coke quantities on the catalyst can help to adjust
cycle times for a process like Catofin. Cycle times can be
extended if one observes that a larger amount of coke will
utilize the catalyst longer in a more active state, or cycle
times can be reduced if the amount of coke accumulating
on the catalyst will be resulting in too much heat liberated
during the regeneration phase.
5. Conclusions
Operando spectroscopic analysis is an effective method
to study the dynamics of a chromium oxide catalyst in the
dehydrogenation of propane. UVVis shows the oxidation
state of the catalyst and Raman and UVVis together pro-
vide information on the coke content on the catalyst. The
coke profiles prove that coke is formed out of propene rather
than propane. Raman shows that the coke is polyaromatic,
becoming more graphitic over time. Coke is a crucial param-
eter for the activity of the catalyst. A small amount of coke
increases the activity, while it becomes a deactivating agent
as the coke content increases. Using UVVis measurements
to determine the coke content by determining its darkness
shows that there is a link between the moment the catalyst
loses activity and the moment the catalyst becomes fully
covered by coke. These affordable and robust UV-Vis probes
can give valuable insight in industrial processes where coke
formation is an important parameter in the process.
