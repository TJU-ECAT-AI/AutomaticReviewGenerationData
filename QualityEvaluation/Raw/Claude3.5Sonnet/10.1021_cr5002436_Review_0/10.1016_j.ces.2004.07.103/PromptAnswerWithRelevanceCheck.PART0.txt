[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

[3] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."

[4] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Light olefins like propylene have seen significantly increased demand over the past decade, outpacing supply from conventional sources like steam crackers and FCCs. This has made propane dehydrogenation an increasingly attractive production method. 

The propane dehydrogenation process faces thermodynamic challenges, operating at high temperatures around 850 K and low pressures of 0.2-0.5 bar to drive the reaction forward. The reaction is endothermic, requiring heat input.

Catalyst deactivation through coking and reduction of the active chromium species presents another key challenge. The process requires periodic regeneration cycles to burn off coke and re-oxidize the catalyst.

While not explicitly stated, shorter alkane chain length generally favors dehydrogenation thermodynamically. However, the document focuses specifically on propane dehydrogenation rather than comparing different alkanes.

The literature does not provide information on specific applications or detailed market trends for light olefins beyond noting the increased demand for propylene. It also does not discuss production methods besides propane dehydrogenation in detail.

轻质烯烃如丙烯在过去十年中需求显著增加,超过了蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化等传统来源的供应能力。这使得丙烷脱氢成为一种越来越具有吸引力的生产方法。

丙烷脱氢工艺面临热力学挑战,需要在约850 K的高温和0.2-0.5巴的低压下运行,以推动反应向前进行。该反应是吸热的,需要输入热量。

通过结焦和活性铬物种的还原导致的催化剂失活是另一个关键挑战。该工艺需要定期进行再生循环,以燃烧掉积碳并重新氧化催化剂。

虽然没有明确说明,但较短的烷烃链长通常在热力学上更有利于脱氢。然而,该文献主要集中讨论丙烷脱氢,而没有比较不同的烷烃。

该文献没有提供轻质烯烃的具体应用或详细市场趋势信息,除了提到丙烯需求增加外。它也没有详细讨论除丙烷脱氢以外的其他生产方法。

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry. The literature indicates that demand for propylene has grown significantly in recent years, outpacing supply from conventional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This has led to increased interest in on-purpose propylene production via propane dehydrogenation.

The dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene faces thermodynamic challenges. It requires high temperatures (around 850 K) and low pressures (0.2-0.5 bar) to drive the equilibrium towards propylene formation. These conditions are necessary because dehydrogenation reactions become more thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures and lower pressures.

The literature does not provide specific information on ethylene production methods or the effects of alkane chain length. However, similar thermodynamic principles likely apply to other light olefin production processes, with higher temperatures and lower pressures generally favoring dehydrogenation reactions for longer chain alkanes.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料。文献表明,近年来丙烯需求显著增长,超过了传统生产方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化)的供应能力。这导致了通过丙烷脱氢生产丙烯的兴趣增加。

丙烷脱氢生产丙烯面临热力学挑战。它需要高温(约850 K)和低压(0.2-0.5巴)来推动平衡向丙烯形成方向发展。这些条件是必要的,因为脱氢反应在更高的温度和更低的压力下变得更有利于热力学。

文献没有提供关于乙烯生产方法或烷烃链长效应的具体信息。然而,类似的热力学原理可能适用于其他轻质烯烃的生产过程,对于较长链的烷烃,较高的温度和较低的压力通常有利于脱氢反应。

The literature provides limited information on light olefins in general, focusing mainly on propylene production via propane dehydrogenation. However, we can infer some key points:

1. Light olefins like propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry, with demand outpacing supply from conventional sources.

2. Key production methods include steam cracking of ethane, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and propane dehydrogenation.

3. Propane dehydrogenation is becoming more attractive as a production method for propylene.

4. Thermodynamic challenges in propane dehydrogenation include:
   - High temperatures (around 850 K)
   - Low pressures (subatmospheric, 0.2-0.5 bar)
   - Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation
   - Reduction of the catalyst from Cr(VI) to Cr(III)

Light olefins like propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry, with demand outpacing supply from conventional production methods. Propylene is a key chemical building block with many applications.

The main production methods for propylene include steam cracking of ethane, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of petroleum, and increasingly, propane dehydrogenation. 

Propane dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges, requiring high temperatures (around 850 K) and low pressures (0.2-0.5 bar) to drive the reaction. In general, higher temperatures and lower pressures favor dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins. Longer alkane chain lengths tend to dehydrogenate more easily.

The document does not provide specific information on ethylene production or applications of light olefins. More details on market trends are also not included beyond noting increased demand for propylene.

Light olefins like propylene have seen significantly increased demand over the past decade, outpacing supply from conventional sources like steam crackers and FCCs. This has made propane dehydrogenation an increasingly attractive production method. 

The key thermodynamic challenge for propane dehydrogenation is that it is an endothermic reaction, requiring high temperatures (around 850 K) to achieve favorable equilibrium. It is also typically run at sub-atmospheric pressures (0.2-0.5 bar) to shift the equilibrium towards propylene formation.

The literature does not provide specific information on applications of light olefins or effects of alkane chain length. More broadly, the high demand for propylene suggests it has important industrial applications, but details are not given in this text focused on the dehydrogenation process.
