Light olefins like propylene have seen significantly increased demand over the past decade, outpacing supply from conventional sources like steam crackers and FCCs. This has made propane dehydrogenation an increasingly attractive production method. 

The key thermodynamic challenge for propane dehydrogenation is that it is an endothermic reaction, requiring high temperatures (around 850 K) to achieve favorable equilibrium. It is also typically run at sub-atmospheric pressures (0.2-0.5 bar) to shift the equilibrium towards propylene formation.

The literature does not provide specific information on applications of light olefins or effects of alkane chain length. More broadly, the high demand for propylene suggests it has important industrial applications, but details are not given in this text focused on the dehydrogenation process.

轻质烯烃如丙烯在过去十年中需求显著增长，超过了蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化等传统来源的供应量。这使得丙烷脱氢成为一种越来越具吸引力的生产方法。

丙烷脱氢的主要热力学挑战在于它是一个吸热反应，需要高温(约850 K)才能达到有利的平衡。它通常在亚大气压(0.2-0.5巴)下运行，以将平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。

文献没有提供关于轻质烯烃应用或烷烃链长效应的具体信息。从更广泛的角度来看，丙烯的高需求表明它有重要的工业应用，但这篇专注于脱氢过程的文本没有给出详细信息。
