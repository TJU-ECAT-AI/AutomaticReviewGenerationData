[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

[3] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."

Light olefins like propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry, with demand outpacing supply from conventional production methods. Propylene is a key chemical building block with many applications.

The main production methods for propylene include steam cracking of ethane, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of petroleum, and increasingly, propane dehydrogenation. 

Propane dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges, requiring high temperatures (around 850 K) and low pressures (0.2-0.5 bar) to drive the reaction. In general, higher temperatures and lower pressures favor dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins. Longer alkane chain lengths tend to dehydrogenate more easily.

The document does not provide specific information on ethylene production or applications of light olefins. More details on market trends are also not included beyond noting increased demand for propylene.

轻质烯烃如丙烯在化工行业需求量很大，需求超过了传统生产方法的供应量。丙烯是一种关键的化学原料，有很多应用。

丙烯的主要生产方法包括乙烷蒸汽裂解、石油流化催化裂解(FCC)，以及日益增长的丙烷脱氢法。

丙烷脱氢面临热力学挑战，需要高温(约850 K)和低压(0.2-0.5巴)来推动反应。一般来说，更高的温度和更低的压力有利于烷烃脱氢生成烯烃。较长的烷烃链更容易脱氢。

该文献并未提供关于乙烯生产或轻质烯烃应用的具体信息。除了提到丙烯需求增加外，也没有包含更多关于市场趋势的详细信息。
