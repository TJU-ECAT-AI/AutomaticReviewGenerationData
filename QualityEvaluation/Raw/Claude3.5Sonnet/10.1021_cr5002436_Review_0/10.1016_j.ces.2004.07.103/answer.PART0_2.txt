[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

[2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

[3] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."

[4] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."

The literature provides limited information on light olefins in general, focusing mainly on propylene production via propane dehydrogenation. However, we can infer some key points:

1. Light olefins like propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry, with demand outpacing supply from conventional sources.

2. Key production methods include steam cracking of ethane, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and propane dehydrogenation.

3. Propane dehydrogenation is becoming more attractive as a production method for propylene.

4. Thermodynamic challenges in propane dehydrogenation include:
   - High temperatures (around 850 K)
   - Low pressures (subatmospheric, 0.2-0.5 bar)
   - Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation
   - Reduction of the catalyst from Cr(VI) to Cr(III)

The document does not provide specific information on ethylene production, applications of light olefins, or effects of alkane chain length. It also lacks detailed market trend data beyond mentioning increased demand for propylene.

该文献对轻质烯烃的信息有限，主要集中在通过丙烷脱氢生产丙烯。但是，我们可以推断出以下几个要点：

1. 像丙烯这样的轻质烯烃在化工行业需求很大，需求量超过了传统来源的供应量。

2. 主要生产方法包括乙烷蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和丙烷脱氢。

3. 丙烷脱氢作为丙烯的生产方法正变得越来越具有吸引力。

4. 丙烷脱氢的热力学挑战包括：
   - 高温（约850 K）
   - 低压（亚大气压，0.2-0.5巴）
   - 因积碳导致的催化剂失活
   - 催化剂从Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)

该文档没有提供关于乙烯生产、轻质烯烃应用或烷烃链长效应的具体信息。除了提到丙烯需求增加外，也缺乏详细的市场趋势数据。
