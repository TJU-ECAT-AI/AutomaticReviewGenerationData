The literature provides limited information on light olefins and their production methods. It mentions a propylene facility being built in China with a 200,000 tonne/year capacity using fluidized catalytic cracking technology. It also briefly notes that Dow Chemical is developing a process to produce olefins from methane. However, the document does not provide comprehensive details on light olefin applications, market trends, or the thermodynamic challenges in their synthesis. There is insufficient information to fully address the question about temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects on olefin production.

文献对轻质烯烃及其生产方法提供了有限的信息。它提到在中国建设一个年产能20万吨的丙烯设施，使用流化催化裂解技术。它还简要提到陶氏化学正在开发一种从甲烷生产烯烃的工艺。然而，该文件并未提供关于轻质烯烃应用、市场趋势或其合成中热力学挑战的全面详细信息。没有足够的信息来全面回答关于温度、压力和烷烃链长对烯烃生产影响的问题。
