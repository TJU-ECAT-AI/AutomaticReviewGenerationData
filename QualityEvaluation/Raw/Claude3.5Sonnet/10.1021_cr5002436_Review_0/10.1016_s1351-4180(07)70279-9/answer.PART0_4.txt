The literature provides limited information specifically addressing the question about light olefins. However, we can infer some insights:

1. Propylene is an important light olefin in the chemical industry, as evidenced by the planned 200,000 tonne/year propylene facility in China.

2. Fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) is a key production method for propylene, as mentioned in the KBR project.

3. There is ongoing research and development in olefin production, as shown by Dow Chemical's work on producing olefins from methane.

4. The industry is exploring alternative feedstocks for olefin production, moving beyond traditional petroleum sources to natural gas (methane).

The literature does not provide specific information on applications, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges related to light olefin synthesis. More comprehensive sources would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

该文献对轻质烯烃的问题提供了有限的信息。但是，我们可以推断出一些见解：

1. 丙烯是化工行业中一种重要的轻质烯烃，这从中国计划建设年产20万吨的丙烯设施可以看出。

2. 流化催化裂化(FCC)是丙烯的一种关键生产方法，正如KBR项目中提到的。

3. 烯烃生产领域正在进行持续的研究和开发，这从陶氏化学公司在甲烷制烯烃方面的工作可以看出。

4. 该行业正在探索烯烃生产的替代原料，从传统的石油源转向天然气（甲烷）。

文献没有提供有关轻质烯烃合成的应用、市场趋势或热力学挑战的具体信息。要全面回答这些问题的方方面面，需要更加全面的资料来源。
