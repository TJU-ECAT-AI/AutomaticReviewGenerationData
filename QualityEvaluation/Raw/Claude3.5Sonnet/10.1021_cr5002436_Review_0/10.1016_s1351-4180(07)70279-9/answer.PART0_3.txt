[1] "Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) will provide basic design and engineering services for a propylene facility in Jilin City owned by Jilin Chemical (JiHua) Group Corp. The facility will have a 200,000 tonne/y nominal capacity and will utilize KBRs Superflex fluidized catalytic cracking process technology."

The literature provides limited information about light olefins and their production methods. It mentions a propylene facility being built in China with a 200,000 tonne/year capacity, using fluidized catalytic cracking technology. This suggests propylene is an important chemical product with significant demand. 

The document also briefly mentions Dow Chemical developing a process to produce olefins from methane, which indicates ongoing research into new production methods for light olefins. However, the literature does not provide details on applications, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges related to light olefin synthesis.

The document lacks specific information about ethylene production, temperature and pressure effects, or impacts of alkane chain length on olefin synthesis. Overall, while the text confirms the industrial importance of light olefins like propylene, it does not contain enough information to fully address the question's scope regarding applications, production methods, and synthesis challenges.

这份文献对轻质烯烃及其生产方法提供了有限的信息。它提到在中国建设一座年产能为20万吨的丙烯设施，使用流化催化裂化技术。这表明丙烯是一种重要的化学产品，需求量很大。

文献还简要提到陶氏化学正在开发一种从甲烷生产烯烃的工艺，这表明正在对轻质烯烃的新生产方法进行持续研究。然而，文献没有提供有关轻质烯烃合成的应用、市场趋势或热力学挑战的详细信息。

文献缺乏关于乙烯生产、温度和压力效应，或烷烃链长对烯烃合成影响的具体信息。总的来说，虽然文本确认了丙烯等轻质烯烃的工业重要性，但它并没有包含足够的信息来全面回答问题中涉及的应用、生产方法和合成挑战等方面。
