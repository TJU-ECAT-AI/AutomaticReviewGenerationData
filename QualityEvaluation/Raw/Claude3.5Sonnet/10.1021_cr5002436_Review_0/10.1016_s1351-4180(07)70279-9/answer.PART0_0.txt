The literature provides limited information on light olefins and their role in the chemical industry. However, it does mention propylene production and a new process for making olefins from methane.

Propylene is an important light olefin, as evidenced by the construction of a 200,000 tonne/year facility in China. This suggests there is significant demand for propylene in the chemical industry.

The literature mentions that Dow Chemical is developing a process to produce olefins from methane. This indicates ongoing research and development efforts to find new and potentially more efficient ways to synthesize light olefins.

The use of fluidized catalytic cracking technology for propylene production suggests that high temperatures and catalysts are involved in the synthesis process. However, the literature does not provide specific details on temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects in olefin production.

The document does not provide information on the applications of light olefins, market trends, or detailed thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis.
