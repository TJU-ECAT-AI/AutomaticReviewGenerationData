Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. While the document does not provide specific details on their applications and market trends, it emphasizes their importance by mentioning that steam cracking has been the major production method for over 50 years.

The key production methods for light olefins include:

1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (traditional method)
2. Catalytic cracking over modified ZSM-5 zeolites (emerging method)

The document highlights that recent studies have shown ethylene and propylene can be produced in considerable amounts through catalytic cracking of hydrocarbons over modified ZSM-5 zeolites. This method can use various industrial feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane.

Regarding thermodynamic challenges, the paper mentions that temperature is an important factor influencing light olefin production. However, specific details about pressure effects are not provided. The document also notes that zeolite acidity and Si/Al ratio impact the production process and reaction scheme.

While the paper doesn't explicitly discuss the effects of alkane chain length, it does mention that feedstocks ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane can be used, suggesting that chain length is a relevant factor in the production process.

In summary, the document focuses on catalytic cracking over modified ZSM-5 zeolites as an alternative to traditional steam cracking for light olefin production, highlighting the importance of factors such as temperature, zeolite properties, and feedstock variety in the process.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业中的关键原料。虽然文献没有提供它们的具体应用和市场趋势，但通过提到蒸汽裂解已经成为50多年来的主要生产方法，强调了它们的重要性。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括：

1. 碳氢化合物的蒸汽裂解（传统方法）
2. 改性ZSM-5分子筛上的催化裂解（新兴方法）

文献强调，最近的研究表明，通过改性ZSM-5分子筛上的碳氢化合物催化裂解，可以生产大量的乙烯和丙烯。这种方法可以使用各种工业原料，从重质碳氢化合物到乙烷不等。

关于热力学挑战，文章提到温度是影响轻质烯烃生产的重要因素。然而，文献并未提供关于压力影响的具体细节。文献还指出，分子筛的酸度和Si/Al比对生产过程和反应机理有影响。

虽然文章没有明确讨论烷烃链长的影响，但它提到可以使用从重质碳氢化合物到乙烷的原料，这表明链长是生产过程中的一个相关因素。

总之，该文献主要关注改性ZSM-5分子筛上的催化裂解作为传统蒸汽裂解的替代方法来生产轻质烯烃，强调了温度、分子筛性质和原料多样性等因素在这个过程中的重要性。
