Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry. While the document does not directly discuss their applications or market trends, it emphasizes their importance by mentioning that steam cracking has been the primary production method for over 50 years.

The key production methods mentioned are:
1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (traditional method)
2. Catalytic cracking over modified ZSM-5 zeolites (emerging method)

The document highlights that catalytic cracking can produce ethylene and propylene in considerable amounts from various feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane.

Regarding thermodynamic challenges, the paper mentions that temperature is a significant factor influencing light olefin production. Additionally, zeolite acidity and Si/Al ratio are noted as important parameters affecting the reaction scheme and olefin yield.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss pressure effects or alkane chain length impacts, it implies that these factors may be relevant by mentioning the use of various feedstocks from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane.

The paper focuses on the use of modified ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts for improving light olefin production, suggesting that optimizing catalyst properties is a key approach to addressing the thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis.
