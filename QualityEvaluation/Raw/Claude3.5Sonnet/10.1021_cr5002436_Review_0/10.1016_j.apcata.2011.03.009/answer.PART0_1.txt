Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. While the document does not explicitly discuss their applications or market trends, it emphasizes their importance by stating that steam cracking has been the major production method for over 50 years.

The key production methods mentioned are:
1. Traditional steam cracking of hydrocarbons
2. Catalytic cracking over modified ZSM-5 zeolites

The paper focuses on the second method, highlighting recent studies showing that modified ZSM-5 zeolites can produce considerable amounts of ethylene and propylene through hydrocarbon cracking.

Regarding thermodynamic challenges, the document mentions that temperature, zeolite acidity, and Si/Al ratio influence light olefin production and reaction schemes. However, specific details about pressure effects or alkane chain length are not provided in the given excerpts.

The paper reviews light olefin production via catalytic cracking of various feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane, indicating that the process can be applied to different hydrocarbon chain lengths. This suggests that the choice of feedstock and its chain length may affect the production process and yields, though specific thermodynamic challenges are not elaborated upon in the provided text.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化工行业的重要原料。虽然文档没有明确讨论它们的应用或市场趋势，但通过指出蒸汽裂解已经成为50多年来的主要生产方法来强调它们的重要性。

提到的主要生产方法有：
1. 传统的碳氢化合物蒸汽裂解
2. 改性ZSM-5沸石上的催化裂解

文章重点关注第二种方法，强调最近的研究表明，改性ZSM-5沸石可以通过碳氢化合物裂解生产大量的乙烯和丙烯。

关于热力学挑战，文档提到温度、沸石酸度和Si/Al比例影响轻质烯烃的生产和反应机制。然而，在给出的摘录中没有提供关于压力效应或烷烃链长的具体细节。

该文章回顾了通过催化裂解各种原料（从重质碳氢化合物到乙烷）生产轻质烯烃的过程，表明该过程可应用于不同链长的碳氢化合物。这表明原料的选择及其链长可能会影响生产过程和产量，尽管在提供的文本中并未详细阐述具体的热力学挑战。
