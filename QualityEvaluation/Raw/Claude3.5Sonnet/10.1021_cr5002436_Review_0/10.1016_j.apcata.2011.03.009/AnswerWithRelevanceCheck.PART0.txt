          Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. While the document does not provide specific details on their applications and market trends, it emphasizes their importance by mentioning that steam cracking has been the primary production method for over 50 years.

          The key production methods for light olefins include:
          1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (traditional method)
          2. Catalytic cracking over modified ZSM-5 zeolites (emerging method)

          The document focuses on the catalytic cracking method using modified ZSM-5 zeolites, which can produce ethylene and propylene in considerable amounts from various feedstocks ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane.

          Regarding thermodynamic challenges, the paper mentions that temperature is a significant factor influencing light olefin production. The zeolite acidity and Si/Al ratio also affect the reaction scheme and olefin yield. However, the document does not provide specific details on pressure effects or how alkane chain length impacts the synthesis.

          While the document doesn't explicitly discuss pressure effects or alkane chain length impacts, it implies that these factors may be relevant by mentioning the use of various feedstocks from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane.

          The use of modified ZSM-5 zeolites for catalytic cracking appears to be a promising area of research for enhancing light olefin production. Various modifications to the zeolites, including the incorporation of different elements, are being studied to improve selectivity and yield of light olefins.

          轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化工行业的重要原料。虽然文献没有提供它们的具体应用和市场趋势的详细信息，但通过提到烃类蒸汽裂解已经作为主要生产方法超过50年来强调了它们的重要性。

          轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括：
          1. 烃类蒸汽裂解（传统方法）
          2. 改性ZSM-5分子筛上的催化裂解（新兴方法）

          文献主要关注使用改性ZSM-5分子筛的催化裂解方法，该方法可以从重质烃到乙烷等各种原料中生产出大量的乙烯和丙烯。

          关于热力学挑战，文献提到温度是影响轻质烯烃生产的重要因素。分子筛的酸性和Si/Al比也会影响反应机理和烯烃产率。然而，文献并未提供压力效应或烷烃链长如何影响合成的具体细节。

          虽然文档没有明确讨论压力效应或烷烃链长的影响，但通过提到使用从重质烃到乙烷的各种原料，暗示这些因素可能是相关的。

          使用改性ZSM-5分子筛进行催化裂解似乎是提高轻质烯烃产量的一个有前景的研究领域。正在研究对分子筛进行各种改性，包括不同元素的掺入，以提高轻质烯烃的选择性和产率。
