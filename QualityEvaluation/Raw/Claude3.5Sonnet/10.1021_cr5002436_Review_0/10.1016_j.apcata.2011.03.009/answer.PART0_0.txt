The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the applications, market trends, and thermodynamic challenges of light olefins production. However, it does mention that light olefins, specifically ethylene and propylene, have been primarily produced through steam cracking of hydrocarbons for over 50 years. More recently, studies have shown that these light olefins can also be produced in significant quantities through the cracking of hydrocarbons over modified ZSM-5 zeolites. The paper focuses on acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon cracking as a method to achieve high yields of ethylene and propylene. The document does not provide specific details on thermodynamic challenges, temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects in relation to light olefin synthesis.

该文献并未提供关于轻质烯烃生产的应用、市场趋势和热力学挑战的全面信息。然而，它确实提到轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，在过去50多年里主要通过碳氢化合物的蒸汽裂解生产。最近的研究表明，这些轻质烯烃也可以通过改性ZSM-5分子筛催化裂解碳氢化合物来大量生产。该论文主要关注酸催化碳氢化合物裂解作为获得高产率乙烯和丙烯的方法。文档没有提供关于轻质烯烃合成中热力学挑战、温度、压力或烷烃链长效应的具体细节。
