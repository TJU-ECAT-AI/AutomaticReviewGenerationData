[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking. To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."

[8] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry. They are essential intermediate products with significant market demand. In 2003, global production reached 100 million tons for ethylene and 56 million tons for propylene.

These olefins have diverse applications, primarily in polymer production. Ethylene is used to produce various polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) and precursors for other polymers like PVC, polystyrene, and polyethoxylates. Propylene is mainly used for polypropylene production and in the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide.

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking of hydrocarbons and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In 2002, steam cracking accounted for 61% of propylene production, while FCC contributed 34%. To meet growing demand, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane provided an additional 3% of propylene production.

The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly in relation to temperature and alkane chain length. Higher temperatures are required for shorter chain alkanes to achieve technically relevant conversions. For instance, propane dehydrogenation requires temperatures of 825-975 K for 30-50% conversion, while isobutane needs 775-825 K. As the carbon number of the alkane increases, the required reaction temperature decreases.

The market trend indicates an expected increase in the share of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane for overall propylene production. This is due to limitations in increasing propylene production from existing naphtha crackers and the construction of ethane-based steam crackers that produce minimal propylene.

轻质烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色。它们是重要的中间产品，市场需求巨大。2003年，全球乙烯产量达到1亿吨，丙烯产量约为5600万吨。

这些烯烃有多种应用，主要用于聚合物生产。乙烯用于生产各种聚乙烯（HDPE、LDPE、LLDPE）以及其他聚合物的前体，如PVC、聚苯乙烯和聚乙氧基化物的前体。丙烯主要用于生产聚丙烯，以及合成异丙苯、丙烯腈、丙烯酸和环氧丙烷。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是烃类蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）。2002年，蒸汽裂解占丙烯生产的61%，而FCC贡献了34%。为满足不断增长的需求，丙烷催化脱氢提供了额外3%的丙烯产量。

烷烃催化脱氢面临热力学挑战，特别是在温度和烷烃链长方面。较短链的烷烃需要更高的温度才能达到技术上有意义的转化率。例如，丙烷脱氢需要825-975 K的温度才能实现30-50%的转化率，而异丁烷需要775-825 K。随着烷烃碳数的增加，所需的反应温度降低。

市场趋势表明，丙烷催化脱氢在整体丙烯生产中的份额预计会增加。这是由于现有石脑油裂解装置增加丙烯产量的限制，以及建设仅生产少量丙烯的乙烷基蒸汽裂解装置所致。

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry. They are key intermediate products used primarily in the production of various polymers and other important chemical compounds.

Ethylene is mainly used to produce polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) and precursors for other polymers like PVC, polystyrene, and polyethoxylates. Propylene is used for producing polypropylene (PP) and in the manufacture of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide.

The market for these light olefins is substantial, with worldwide production in 2003 reaching 100 million tonnes for ethylene and 56 million tonnes for propylene. The demand for propylene is growing faster than that of ethylene, leading to increased interest in propylene production methods.

The main production methods for light olefins are:

1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (the primary method)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes (emerging method, especially for propylene)

In 2002, about 61% of propylene was produced via steam cracking, 34% by catalytic cracking, and 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of light olefins, particularly through dehydrogenation, faces thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is endothermic and requires high temperatures to achieve technically relevant conversions. For propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 825-975 K are needed to achieve 30-50% conversion. The required temperature decreases as the carbon number of the alkane increases.

These high temperature requirements, combined with the endothermic nature of the reaction, make the process energy-intensive and challenging to implement on an industrial scale. However, the growing demand for propylene is driving continued development and implementation of dehydrogenation processes.

这些高温要求，加上反应的吸热性质，使得该过程能源密集且难以在工业规模上实施。然而，丙烯需求的不断增长正推动着脱氢工艺的持续发展和实施。

The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking of hydrocarbons. However, to meet the growing demand for propylene, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is becoming increasingly important, accounting for about 3% of propylene production.

The synthesis of light olefins through dehydrogenation faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is strongly endothermic and limited by equilibrium conversion. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30-50%, high temperatures are required. For propane, temperatures of 825-975 K are needed, while isobutane requires 775-825 K. The required temperature generally decreases as the carbon number of the alkane increases.

These thermodynamic limitations and the need for high temperatures pose significant challenges in the industrial production of light olefins, particularly as demand continues to grow.

Ethylene is primarily used to produce polyethylenes and precursors for PVC, polystyrene, and ethylene glycols. Propylene is mainly used for polypropylene production, as well as in the manufacture of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide.

The market trends show a continuous increase in demand for these light olefins, especially propylene. In 2003, the global production of ethylene was 100 million tonnes, while propylene production was approximately 56 million tonnes.

The key production methods for light olefins include:

1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (the most important process)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes (particularly for propylene)

The main thermodynamic challenge in light olefin synthesis is the high energy requirement due to the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. This necessitates high reaction temperatures to achieve technically relevant conversions. For example, propane dehydrogenation requires temperatures of 825-975 K to achieve 30-50% conversion.

The temperature requirements vary with the length of the alkane chain. Longer-chain alkanes generally require lower temperatures for dehydrogenation compared to shorter-chain alkanes. For instance, isobutane dehydrogenation requires temperatures of 775-825 K for similar conversion rates as propane.

Pressure also plays a role in the equilibrium of these reactions, though it is not explicitly discussed in the given text. Generally, lower pressures favor dehydrogenation reactions due to the increase in the number of moles during the reaction.

These thermodynamic challenges drive ongoing research and development in catalysis and process engineering to improve the efficiency and economics of light olefin production.

温度要求随烷烃链长的变化而变化。相比于短链烷烃，长链烷烃通常需要较低的脱氢温度。例如，异丁烷脱氢需要775-825 K的温度才能达到与丙烷相似的转化率。

压力也在这些反应的平衡中起作用，尽管在给定的文本中没有明确讨论。通常，由于反应过程中分子数量的增加，较低的压力有利于脱氢反应。

这些热力学挑战推动了催化和工艺工程领域的持续研究和开发，以提高轻质烯烃生产的效率和经济性。
