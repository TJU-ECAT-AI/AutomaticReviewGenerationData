[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane."

Light olefins, particularly propylene and ethylene, are crucial intermediate products in the chemical industry. Ethylene is primarily used to produce various types of polyethylene and precursors for other polymers like PVC and polystyrene. Propylene is mainly used to produce polypropylene and other chemicals such as cumene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide.

The market for these olefins is growing, with a particularly high demand for propylene. In 2003, global production of ethylene was around 100 million tonnes, while propylene production was about 56 million tonnes.

The main production methods for light olefins are:

1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (the most important process)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes (particularly for propylene)

The key thermodynamic challenge in olefin synthesis, especially for propylene production through catalytic dehydrogenation, is the high temperature required to achieve technically relevant conversions. For propane, temperatures of 825-975 K are needed to reach 30-50% conversion. The reaction temperature decreases as the carbon number of the alkane increases.

These high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamic limitations of alkane conversion and the strongly endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. This presents significant challenges in the technical realization of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation processes.

轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和乙烯，是化学工业中至关重要的中间产品。乙烯主要用于生产各种类型的聚乙烯和其他聚合物的前体，如PVC和聚苯乙烯。丙烯主要用于生产聚丙烯和其他化学品，如异丙苯、丙烯腈和环氧丙烷。

这些烯烃的市场正在增长，尤其是对丙烯的需求很高。2003年，全球乙烯产量约为1亿吨，而丙烯产量约为5600万吨。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法有：

1. 烃类蒸汽裂解（最重要的工艺）
2. 流化催化裂化（FCC）
3. 烷烃催化脱氢（特别是用于丙烯生产）

烯烃合成中的主要热力学挑战，尤其是通过催化脱氢生产丙烯，是需要高温才能达到技术上有意义的转化率。对于丙烷，需要825-975 K的温度才能达到30-50%的转化率。随着烷烃碳数的增加，反应温度会降低。

这些高温是必要的，因为烷烃转化存在热力学限制，而且脱氢反应强烈吸热。这给催化烷烃脱氢过程的技术实现带来了重大挑战。
