          [1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking. To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."

[8] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

          Light olefins, particularly propylene and ethylene, are crucial intermediate products in the chemical industry with significant market demand. In 2003, global production reached 100 million tonnes for ethylene and 56 million tonnes for propylene.

Applications:
1. Ethylene is primarily used for producing various polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) and precursors for other polymers like PVC, polystyrene, and polyethoxylates.
2. Propylene is mainly used for polypropylene production and in the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide.

Market trends:
The demand for propylene is growing faster than that of ethylene, leading to increased interest in propylene production methods.

Key production methods:
1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (primary method)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes (emerging method, especially for propylene)

In 2002, propylene production was distributed as follows:
- 61% via steam cracking
- 34% by catalytic cracking
- 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane

Thermodynamic challenges:
1. The dehydrogenation reaction is endothermic and requires high temperatures.
2. For propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 825-975 K are needed to achieve 30-50% conversion.
3. The required temperature decreases as the carbon number of the alkane increases.
4. These high temperature requirements make the process energy-intensive and challenging to implement on an industrial scale.

The growing demand for propylene is driving continued development and implementation of dehydrogenation processes, with an expected increase in the share of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane for overall propylene production.

          轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和乙烯，是化学工业中至关重要的中间产品，市场需求巨大。2003年，全球乙烯产量达到1亿吨，丙烯产量约为5600万吨。

应用：
1. 乙烯主要用于生产各种聚乙烯（HDPE、LDPE、LLDPE）以及其他聚合物的前体，如PVC、聚苯乙烯和聚乙氧基化物。
2. 丙烯主要用于生产聚丙烯，以及合成异丙苯、丙烯腈、丙烯酸和环氧丙烷。

市场趋势：
丙烯的需求增长速度快于乙烯，导致人们对丙烯生产方法的兴趣日益增加。

主要生产方法：
1. 烃类蒸汽裂解（主要方法）
2. 流化催化裂解（FCC）
3. 烷烃催化脱氢（新兴方法，特别是用于丙烯生产）

2002年丙烯生产分布如下：
- 61%通过蒸汽裂解
- 34%通过催化裂解
- 3%通过丙烷催化脱氢

热力学挑战：
1. 脱氢反应是吸热的，需要高温。
2. 对于丙烷脱氢，需要825-975 K的温度才能达到30-50%的转化率。
3. 随着烷烃碳数的增加，所需温度降低。
4. 这些高温要求使得该过程能源密集且难以在工业规模上实施。

丙烯需求的不断增长正推动着脱氢工艺的持续发展和实施，预计丙烷催化脱氢在整体丙烯生产中的份额将会增加。
