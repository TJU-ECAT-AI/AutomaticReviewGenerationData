[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking. To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and 775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry. They are key intermediate products used primarily in the production of various polymers and other important chemical compounds.

Ethylene is mainly used to produce polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) and precursors for other polymers like PVC, polystyrene, and polyethoxylates. Propylene is used for producing polypropylene (PP) and in the manufacture of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide.

The market for these light olefins is substantial, with worldwide production in 2003 reaching 100 million tonnes for ethylene and 56 million tonnes for propylene. The demand for propylene is growing faster than that of ethylene, leading to increased interest in propylene production methods.

The main production methods for light olefins are:

1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (the primary method)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes (emerging method, especially for propylene)

In 2002, about 61% of propylene was produced via steam cracking, 34% by catalytic cracking, and 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.

The synthesis of light olefins, particularly through dehydrogenation, faces thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is endothermic and requires high temperatures to achieve technically relevant conversions. For propane dehydrogenation, temperatures of 825-975 K are needed to achieve 30-50% conversion. The required temperature decreases as the carbon number of the alkane increases.

These high temperature requirements, combined with the endothermic nature of the reaction, make the process energy-intensive and challenging to implement on an industrial scale. However, the growing demand for propylene is driving continued development and implementation of dehydrogenation processes.

轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色。它们是主要用于生产各种聚合物和其他重要化学化合物的关键中间产品。

乙烯主要用于生产聚乙烯（HDPE、LDPE、LLDPE）以及其他聚合物的前体，如PVC、聚苯乙烯和聚乙氧基化物的前体。丙烯用于生产聚丙烯（PP）以及在生产异丙苯、丙烯腈、丙烯酸和环氧丙烷的制造中。

这些轻质烯烃的市场规模庞大，2003年全球乙烯产量达到1亿吨，丙烯产量达到5600万吨。丙烯的需求增长速度快于乙烯，导致人们对丙烯生产方法的兴趣日益增加。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括：

1. 烃类蒸汽裂解（主要方法）
2. 流化催化裂解（FCC）
3. 烷烃催化脱氢（新兴方法，特别是用于丙烯生产）

2002年，约61%的丙烯通过蒸汽裂解生产，34%通过催化裂解生产，3%通过丙烷催化脱氢生产。

轻质烯烃的合成，特别是通过脱氢反应，面临着热力学挑战。该反应是吸热的，需要高温才能达到技术上有意义的转化率。对于丙烷脱氢，需要825-975 K的温度才能达到30-50%的转化率。随着烷烃碳数的增加，所需温度降低。

这些高温要求，加上反应的吸热性质，使得该过程能源密集且难以在工业规模上实施。然而，丙烯需求的不断增长正推动着脱氢工艺的持续发展和实施。
