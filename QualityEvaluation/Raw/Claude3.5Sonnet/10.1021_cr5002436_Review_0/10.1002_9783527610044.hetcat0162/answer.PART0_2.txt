[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."

[5] "To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[6] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."

[7] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and 775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane."

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, are crucial intermediate products in the chemical industry. They are primarily used in polymer production, with ethylene being used for various types of polyethylenes and precursors for other polymers like PVC and polystyrene. Propylene is mainly used for polypropylene production and in the synthesis of other chemicals like cumene and acrylonitrile.

The market for these olefins is substantial and growing. In 2003, global production of ethylene was 100 million tons, while propylene production was about 56 million tons. The demand for propylene, in particular, is continuously increasing.

The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking of hydrocarbons. However, to meet the growing demand for propylene, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is becoming increasingly important, accounting for about 3% of propylene production.

The synthesis of light olefins through dehydrogenation faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is strongly endothermic and limited by equilibrium conversion. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30-50%, high temperatures are required. For propane, temperatures of 825-975 K are needed, while isobutane requires 775-825 K. The required temperature generally decreases as the carbon number of the alkane increases.

These thermodynamic limitations and the need for high temperatures pose significant challenges in the industrial production of light olefins, particularly as demand continues to grow.

轻质烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，是化学工业中至关重要的中间产品。它们主要用于聚合物生产，乙烯用于生产各种类型的聚乙烯和其他聚合物的前体，如PVC和聚苯乙烯。丙烯主要用于聚丙烯生产和合成其他化学品，如异丙苯和丙烯腈。

这些烯烃的市场规模庞大且持续增长。2003年，全球乙烯产量为1亿吨，丙烯产量约为5600万吨。特别是丙烯的需求持续增加。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是碳氢化合物的蒸汽裂解。然而，为了满足不断增长的丙烯需求，丙烷的催化脱氢变得越来越重要，占丙烯产量的约3%。

通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃面临着重大的热力学挑战。这个反应强烈吸热，并受到平衡转化率的限制。为了达到30-50%的技术相关转化率，需要高温条件。对于丙烷，需要825-975 K的温度，而异丁烷需要775-825 K。随着烷烃碳数的增加，所需温度通常会降低。

这些热力学限制和对高温的需求在轻质烯烃的工业生产中构成了重大挑战，特别是在需求持续增长的情况下。
