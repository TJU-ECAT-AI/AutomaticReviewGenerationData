[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 3050%, reaction temperatures of 825975 K are required for propane and 775825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane."

Light olefins, particularly propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry. They are used extensively in the production of various polymers and other important chemical compounds. Ethylene is primarily used to produce polyethylenes and precursors for PVC, polystyrene, and ethylene glycols. Propylene is mainly used for polypropylene production, as well as in the manufacture of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide.

The market trends show a continuous increase in demand for these light olefins, especially propylene. In 2003, the global production of ethylene was 100 million tonnes, while propylene production was approximately 56 million tonnes.

The key production methods for light olefins include:

1. Steam cracking of hydrocarbons (the most important process)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes (particularly for propylene)

The main thermodynamic challenge in light olefin synthesis is the high energy requirement due to the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. This necessitates high reaction temperatures to achieve technically relevant conversions. For example, propane dehydrogenation requires temperatures of 825-975 K to achieve 30-50% conversion.

The temperature requirements vary with the length of the alkane chain. Longer-chain alkanes generally require lower temperatures for dehydrogenation compared to shorter-chain alkanes. For instance, isobutane dehydrogenation requires temperatures of 775-825 K for similar conversion rates as propane.

Pressure also plays a role in the equilibrium of these reactions, though it is not explicitly discussed in the given text. Generally, lower pressures favor dehydrogenation reactions due to the increase in the number of moles during the reaction.

These thermodynamic challenges drive ongoing research and development in catalysis and process engineering to improve the efficiency and economics of light olefin production.

轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和乙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色。它们被广泛用于生产各种聚合物和其他重要的化学化合物。乙烯主要用于生产聚乙烯和PVC、聚苯乙烯以及乙二醇的前体。丙烯主要用于生产聚丙烯，也用于生产异丙苯、丙烯腈、丙烯酸和环氧丙烷。

市场趋势显示，这些轻质烯烃的需求持续增长，特别是丙烯。2003年，全球乙烯产量为1亿吨，而丙烯产量约为5600万吨。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括：

1. 碳氢化合物蒸汽裂解（最重要的工艺）
2. 流化催化裂化（FCC）
3. 烷烃催化脱氢（特别是用于丙烯生产）

轻质烯烃合成的主要热力学挑战是由于脱氢反应的吸热性质而导致的高能量需求。这就需要高反应温度来达到技术上有意义的转化率。例如，丙烷脱氢需要825-975 K的温度才能达到30-50%的转化率。

温度要求随烷烃链长的变化而变化。相比于短链烷烃，长链烷烃通常需要较低的脱氢温度。例如，异丁烷脱氢需要775-825 K的温度才能达到与丙烷相似的转化率。

压力也在这些反应的平衡中起作用，尽管在给定的文本中没有明确讨论。通常，由于反应过程中分子数量的增加，较低的压力有利于脱氢反应。

这些热力学挑战推动了催化和工艺工程领域的持续研究和开发，以提高轻质烯烃生产的效率和经济性。
