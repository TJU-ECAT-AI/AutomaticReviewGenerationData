[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking. To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."

[8] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry. They are essential intermediate products with significant market demand. In 2003, global production reached 100 million tons for ethylene and 56 million tons for propylene.

These olefins have diverse applications, primarily in polymer production. Ethylene is used to produce various polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) and precursors for other polymers like PVC, polystyrene, and polyethoxylates. Propylene is mainly used for polypropylene production and in the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide.

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking of hydrocarbons and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). In 2002, steam cracking accounted for 61% of propylene production, while FCC contributed 34%. To meet growing demand, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane provided an additional 3% of propylene production.

The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly in relation to temperature and alkane chain length. Higher temperatures are required for shorter chain alkanes to achieve technically relevant conversions. For instance, propane dehydrogenation requires temperatures of 825-975 K for 30-50% conversion, while isobutane needs 775-825 K. As the carbon number of the alkane increases, the required reaction temperature decreases.

The market trend indicates an expected increase in the share of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane for overall propylene production. This is due to limitations in increasing propylene production from existing naphtha crackers and the construction of ethane-based steam crackers that produce minimal propylene.

轻质烯烃，尤其是乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色。它们是重要的中间产品，市场需求巨大。2003年，全球乙烯产量达到1亿吨，丙烯产量约为5600万吨。

这些烯烃有多种应用，主要用于聚合物生产。乙烯用于生产各种聚乙烯（HDPE、LDPE、LLDPE）以及其他聚合物的前体，如PVC、聚苯乙烯和聚乙氧基化物的前体。丙烯主要用于生产聚丙烯，以及合成异丙苯、丙烯腈、丙烯酸和环氧丙烷。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是烃类蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）。2002年，蒸汽裂解占丙烯生产的61%，而FCC贡献了34%。为满足不断增长的需求，丙烷催化脱氢提供了额外3%的丙烯产量。

烷烃催化脱氢面临热力学挑战，特别是在温度和烷烃链长方面。较短链的烷烃需要更高的温度才能达到技术上有意义的转化率。例如，丙烷脱氢需要825-975 K的温度才能实现30-50%的转化率，而异丁烷需要775-825 K。随着烷烃碳数的增加，所需的反应温度降低。

市场趋势表明，丙烷催化脱氢在整体丙烯生产中的份额预计会增加。这是由于现有石脑油裂解装置增加丙烯产量的限制，以及建设仅生产少量丙烯的乙烷基蒸汽裂解装置所致。
