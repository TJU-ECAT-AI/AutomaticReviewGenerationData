[1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

[2] "An important step in the manufacture of olefins is large-scale separation of the olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]."

[3] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of important chemicals and materials, including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. These products have extensive applications across many industries.

The key production method for light olefins involves separating them from the corresponding paraffins on a large scale. Currently, this separation is primarily achieved through cryogenic distillation. However, this process faces significant thermodynamic challenges:

1. It requires extremely low (cryogenic) temperatures.
2. The relative volatilities of the components are low, making separation difficult.
3. The process is highly energy-intensive.
4. Distillation columns are massive, often 300 feet tall with over 200 trays.
5. High reflux ratios (>10) are needed, further increasing energy consumption.

These challenges become more pronounced as the alkane chain length increases, making separation progressively more difficult for heavier olefins. The high energy requirements and capital costs associated with the current production methods have driven research into alternative separation technologies, such as membrane-based processes.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的关键原料。它们被用于生产多种重要的化学品和材料,包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯、乙苯、二氯乙烷、丙烯腈和异丙醇。这些产品在许多行业中有广泛的应用。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法涉及将它们从相应的烷烃中大规模分离出来。目前,这种分离主要通过低温蒸馏实现。然而,这个过程面临着重大的热力学挑战:

1. 需要极低(低温)的温度。
2. 组分的相对挥发度低,使分离变得困难。
3. 该过程能耗很高。
4. 蒸馏塔体积庞大,通常高300英尺,有200多个塔板。
5. 需要高回流比(>10),进一步增加了能源消耗。

随着烷烃链长的增加,这些挑战变得更加突出,使得更重的烯烃的分离变得越来越困难。当前生产方法所需的高能耗和资本成本推动了对替代分离技术(如基于膜的工艺)的研究。
