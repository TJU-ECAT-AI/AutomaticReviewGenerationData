[1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

[2] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry, used to produce a wide range of important polymers and chemicals including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, and acrylonitrile. Their production and separation from corresponding paraffins is a major industrial process.

The key production method for light olefins is steam cracking, followed by separation from paraffins via cryogenic distillation. This separation process faces significant thermodynamic challenges due to the similar boiling points of olefins and paraffins. It requires extremely low temperatures and very tall distillation columns with many trays and high reflux ratios, making it highly energy-intensive.

The difficulty of olefin/paraffin separation increases for longer carbon chain lengths, as the relative volatility decreases. This makes propylene/propane separation more challenging than ethylene/ethane. High pressures are generally avoided as they reduce the relative volatility further. Overall, the process requires a careful balance of low temperatures and moderate pressures to achieve effective separation despite the thermodynamic limitations.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的关键原料,用于生产多种重要的聚合物和化学品,包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯和丙烯腈。它们的生产及与相应烷烃的分离是一个主要的工业过程。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是蒸汽裂解,随后通过低温蒸馏与烷烃分离。这个分离过程由于烯烃和烷烃沸点相近而面临重大的热力学挑战。它需要极低的温度和非常高的蒸馏塔,塔内有许多塔板和高回流比,因此能耗非常高。

随着碳链长度的增加,烯烃/烷烃分离的难度也会增加,因为相对挥发度降低。这使得丙烯/丙烷的分离比乙烯/乙烷更具挑战性。通常避免使用高压,因为它会进一步降低相对挥发度。总的来说,尽管存在热力学限制,该过程需要谨慎平衡低温和适度压力,以实现有效分离。
