[1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

[2] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of important chemicals and materials including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, and more. 

The primary production method for light olefins is steam cracking, followed by cryogenic distillation to separate the olefins from paraffins. This separation process faces significant thermodynamic challenges due to the similar boiling points of olefins and paraffins. It requires extremely low temperatures and very tall distillation columns (up to 300 ft) with over 200 trays. The process is highly energy-intensive, with high reflux ratios exceeding 10.

The difficulty of separation increases with increasing carbon chain length, as the boiling points become even closer. This makes propylene/propane separation more challenging than ethylene/ethane. The high energy requirements and capital costs of the current cryogenic distillation process have driven research into alternative separation methods like membrane technology.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的关键原料。它们被用于生产多种重要的化学品和材料，包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯、乙苯等。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解，随后通过低温蒸馏将烯烃从烷烃中分离出来。由于烯烃和烷烃的沸点相近，这一分离过程面临着重大的热力学挑战。它需要极低的温度和非常高的蒸馏塔（高达300英尺），塔内有超过200个塔板。这个过程非常耗能，回流比高达10以上。

随着碳链长度的增加，分离难度也会增加，因为沸点会变得更加接近。这使得丙烯/丙烷的分离比乙烯/乙烷更具挑战性。目前低温蒸馏工艺的高能耗和高资本成本推动了对膜技术等替代分离方法的研究。

[2] "An important step in the manufacture of olefins is large-scale separation of the olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]."

[3] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components.

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of important chemicals and materials, including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. These products have extensive applications across many industries.

The key production method for light olefins involves separating them from the corresponding paraffins on a large scale. Currently, this separation is primarily achieved through cryogenic distillation. However, this process faces significant thermodynamic challenges:

1. It requires extremely low (cryogenic) temperatures.
2. The relative volatilities of the components are low, making separation difficult.
3. The process is highly energy-intensive.
4. Distillation columns are massive, often 300 feet tall with over 200 trays.
5. High reflux ratios (>10) are needed, further increasing energy consumption.

These challenges become more pronounced as the alkane chain length increases, making separation progressively more difficult for heavier olefins. The high energy requirements and capital costs associated with the current production methods have driven research into alternative separation technologies, such as membrane-based processes.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的关键原料。它们被用于生产多种重要的化学品和材料,包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯、乙苯、二氯乙烷、丙烯腈和异丙醇。这些产品在许多行业中有广泛的应用。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法涉及将它们从相应的烷烃中大规模分离出来。目前,这种分离主要通过低温蒸馏实现。然而,这个过程面临着重大的热力学挑战:

1. 需要极低(低温)的温度。
2. 组分的相对挥发度低,使分离变得困难。
3. 该过程能耗很高。
4. 蒸馏塔体积庞大,通常高300英尺,有200多个塔板。
5. 需要高回流比(>10),进一步增加了能源消耗。

随着烷烃链长的增加,这些挑战变得更加突出,使得更重的烯烃的分离变得越来越困难。当前生产方法所需的高能耗和资本成本推动了对替代分离技术(如基于膜的工艺)的研究。

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial chemicals in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce important polyolefins and other chemicals including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. 

The main production method for light olefins is currently cryogenic distillation. However, this process faces significant thermodynamic challenges, requiring very low temperatures and high energy inputs due to the low relative volatilities of the components being separated. The distillation columns are extremely large, often up to 300 feet tall with over 200 trays, and operate at high reflux ratios above 10. This makes the process highly energy-intensive and costly.

The document does not provide specific information on market trends or the effects of pressure and alkane chain length. However, given the described challenges and high costs of current production methods, there is likely strong interest in developing more efficient separation technologies for these important chemical feedstocks.

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce important products such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, and other chemicals. The market for these olefins is significant, given their wide range of applications.

The main production method for light olefins involves separating them from their corresponding paraffins on a large scale. This is typically done through cryogenic distillation, which poses significant thermodynamic challenges. The process requires extremely low temperatures and is highly energy-intensive due to the low relative volatilities of the components being separated.

The distillation process involves massive infrastructure, with columns up to 300 feet tall containing over 200 trays. The high reflux ratios (greater than 10) necessary for effective separation result in very high energy requirements. This presents both economic and environmental challenges in olefin production.

While the document does not specifically mention the effects of pressure or alkane chain length, it's clear that temperature is a critical factor in the separation process. The need for cryogenic temperatures indicates that lowering the temperature is key to achieving the desired separation, likely due to differences in boiling points between olefins and paraffins becoming more pronounced at very low temperatures.

蒸馏过程需要庞大的基础设施，塔高可达300英尺，包含200多个塔板。高回流比（大于10）对于有效分离是必要的，但这导致了极高的能源需求。这在烯烃生产中带来了经济和环境方面的挑战。

虽然文档没有具体提到压力或烷烃链长的影响，但很明显温度是分离过程中的关键因素。需要低温条件表明，降低温度是实现所需分离的关键，这可能是因为在非常低的温度下，烯烃和烷烃之间的沸点差异变得更加明显。

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry, used to produce a wide range of important polymers and chemicals including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, and acrylonitrile. Their production and separation from corresponding paraffins is a major industrial process.

The key production method for light olefins is steam cracking, followed by separation from paraffins via cryogenic distillation. This separation process faces significant thermodynamic challenges due to the similar boiling points of olefins and paraffins. It requires extremely low temperatures and very tall distillation columns with many trays and high reflux ratios, making it highly energy-intensive.

The difficulty of olefin/paraffin separation increases for longer carbon chain lengths, as the relative volatility decreases. This makes propylene/propane separation more challenging than ethylene/ethane. High pressures are generally avoided as they reduce the relative volatility further. Overall, the process requires a careful balance of low temperatures and moderate pressures to achieve effective separation despite the thermodynamic limitations.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的关键原料,用于生产多种重要的聚合物和化学品,包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯和丙烯腈。它们的生产及与相应烷烃的分离是一个主要的工业过程。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是蒸汽裂解,随后通过低温蒸馏与烷烃分离。这个分离过程由于烯烃和烷烃沸点相近而面临重大的热力学挑战。它需要极低的温度和非常高的蒸馏塔,塔内有许多塔板和高回流比,因此能耗非常高。

随着碳链长度的增加,烯烃/烷烃分离的难度也会增加,因为相对挥发度降低。这使得丙烯/丙烷的分离比乙烯/乙烷更具挑战性。通常避免使用高压,因为它会进一步降低相对挥发度。总的来说,尽管存在热力学限制,该过程需要谨慎平衡低温和适度压力,以实现有效分离。
