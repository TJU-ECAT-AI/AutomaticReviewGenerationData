[1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

[2] "An important step in the manufacture of olefins is large-scale separation of the olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]."

[3] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce important products such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, and other chemicals. The market for these olefins is significant, given their wide range of applications.

The main production method for light olefins involves separating them from their corresponding paraffins on a large scale. This is typically done through cryogenic distillation, which poses significant thermodynamic challenges. The process requires extremely low temperatures and is highly energy-intensive due to the low relative volatilities of the components being separated.

The distillation process involves massive infrastructure, with columns up to 300 feet tall containing over 200 trays. The high reflux ratios (greater than 10) necessary for effective separation result in very high energy requirements. This presents both economic and environmental challenges in olefin production.

While the document does not specifically mention the effects of pressure or alkane chain length, it's clear that temperature is a critical factor in the separation process. The need for cryogenic temperatures indicates that lowering the temperature is key to achieving the desired separation, likely due to differences in boiling points between olefins and paraffins becoming more pronounced at very low temperatures.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的重要原料。它们用于生产聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯等重要产品和其他化学品。考虑到这些烯烃的广泛应用，它们的市场需求很大。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法涉及将它们从相应的烷烃中大规模分离出来。这通常通过低温蒸馏来完成，这种方法在热力学上存在重大挑战。由于被分离组分的相对挥发度较低，该过程需要极低的温度，并且能源消耗很高。

蒸馏过程需要庞大的基础设施，塔高可达300英尺，包含200多个塔板。高回流比（大于10）对于有效分离是必要的，但这导致了极高的能源需求。这在烯烃生产中带来了经济和环境方面的挑战。

虽然文档没有具体提到压力或烷烃链长的影响，但很明显温度是分离过程中的关键因素。需要低温条件表明，降低温度是实现所需分离的关键，这可能是因为在非常低的温度下，烯烃和烷烃之间的沸点差异变得更加明显。
