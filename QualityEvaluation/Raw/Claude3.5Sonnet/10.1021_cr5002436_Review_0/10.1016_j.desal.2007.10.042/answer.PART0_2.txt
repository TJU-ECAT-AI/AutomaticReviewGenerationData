[1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

[2] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial chemicals in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce important polyolefins and other chemicals including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. 

The main production method for light olefins is currently cryogenic distillation. However, this process faces significant thermodynamic challenges, requiring very low temperatures and high energy inputs due to the low relative volatilities of the components being separated. The distillation columns are extremely large, often up to 300 feet tall with over 200 trays, and operate at high reflux ratios above 10. This makes the process highly energy-intensive and costly.

The document does not provide specific information on market trends or the effects of pressure and alkane chain length. However, given the described challenges and high costs of current production methods, there is likely strong interest in developing more efficient separation technologies for these important chemical feedstocks.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的关键化学品。它们用于生产重要的聚烯烃和其他化学品,包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯、乙苯、二氯乙烷、丙烯腈和异丙醇。

目前,轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是低温蒸馏。然而,这个过程面临着重大的热力学挑战,由于所分离组分的相对挥发度低,需要非常低的温度和高能量输入。蒸馏塔非常大,通常高达300英尺,有超过200个塔板,并以高于10的回流比运行。这使得该过程高度耗能且成本高昂。

文件没有提供关于市场趋势或压力和烷烃链长影响的具体信息。但是,考虑到所描述的挑战和当前生产方法的高成本,可能会对开发更高效的分离技术来生产这些重要的化工原料有强烈兴趣。
