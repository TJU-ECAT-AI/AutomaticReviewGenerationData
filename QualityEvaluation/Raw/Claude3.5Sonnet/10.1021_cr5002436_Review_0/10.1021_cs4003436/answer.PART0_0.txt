[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

[2] "The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."

[3] "The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

[4] "Although it could be expected that the stability of the zeolite would be compromised by the presence of water during reaction, Lee et al. (42) pointed out that ZSM-5 maintained its hydrothermal stability and activity at least during 100 h time on stream."

[5] "Figure 13 displays lower olefins selectivity as a function of temperature for supported catalysts. This graph shows that high CO conversions can be achieved using high reaction temperatures (>300 C). Under these conditions, the selectivity to shorter hydrocarbons is enhanced, increasing lower olefins selectivity but at the same time increasing methane production. The formation of carbon deposits is also favored at high reaction temperatures thus having a negative effect on catalytic activity."

Light olefins like ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry. They have diverse applications, ranging from packaging materials and synthetic textiles to antifreeze agents, solvents, and coatings. These olefins are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide.

The demand for lower olefins has been growing steadily, with global production capacity doubling over the past 15 years. Despite a temporary decrease in demand during 2008-2009 due to slow economic growth, analysts predicted growth to resume after 2012.

The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking, which is one of the most energy-intensive processes in the chemical and petrochemical industry. This highlights a key challenge in their synthesis.

Thermodynamic challenges in light olefin synthesis are primarily related to temperature and pressure effects. Higher reaction temperatures (>300°C) can achieve high CO conversions and enhance selectivity towards shorter hydrocarbons, including light olefins. However, this also increases methane production and carbon deposit formation, which negatively affects catalytic activity.

The effect of alkane chain length is not directly addressed in the given quotes, but it's implied that selectivity towards shorter hydrocarbons (like light olefins) is enhanced at higher temperatures.

Stability of catalysts under reaction conditions is another challenge. For instance, while water presence during reactions could potentially compromise zeolite stability, some catalysts like ZSM-5 have shown maintained hydrothermal stability and activity for at least 100 hours.

Overall, the synthesis of light olefins involves balancing between high conversion rates, selectivity towards desired products, and maintaining catalyst stability under demanding reaction conditions.

轻质烯烃如乙烯、丙烯和丁烯是化学工业的关键基础材料。它们有广泛的应用，从包装材料和合成纺织品到防冻剂、溶剂和涂料。这些烯烃是全球产量最大的有机化学品之一。

轻质烯烃的需求一直在稳步增长，过去15年全球产能翻了一番。尽管2008-2009年由于经济增长缓慢导致需求暂时下降，但分析师预测2012年后需求会恢复增长。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解，这是化学和石油化学工业中能耗最高的工艺之一。这凸显了其合成过程中的一个关键挑战。

轻质烯烃合成中的热力学挑战主要与温度和压力效应有关。较高的反应温度（>300°C）可以实现高CO转化率并提高对较短碳氢化合物（包括轻质烯烃）的选择性。然而，这也会增加甲烷的产量和碳沉积的形成，对催化活性产生负面影响。

给定的引文中没有直接讨论烷烃链长的影响，但暗示在较高温度下对较短碳氢化合物（如轻质烯烃）的选择性会提高。

在反应条件下保持催化剂的稳定性是另一个挑战。例如，虽然反应过程中存在水可能会影响沸石的稳定性，但一些催化剂如ZSM-5已显示出在至少100小时内保持水热稳定性和活性。

总的来说，轻质烯烃的合成涉及在高转化率、对目标产物的选择性以及在苛刻反应条件下保持催化剂稳定性之间取得平衡。
