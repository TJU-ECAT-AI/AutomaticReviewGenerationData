[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

[2] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000."

[3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene."

[4] "Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."

[5] "The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

Light olefins like ethylene, propylene and butylenes are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry, with some of the largest production volumes worldwide. They have diverse applications, including:

1. Packaging materials
2. Synthetic textiles  
3. Antifreeze agents
4. Solvents
5. Coatings

Ethylene is the highest volume petrochemical globally. It's used to produce important intermediate chemicals like ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride. 

Propylene has seen tremendous demand growth, mainly driven by increased polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years. It has even more derivatives than ethylene.

The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, naphtha, gas oil and condensates are the main feedstocks. In North America and the Middle East, ethane and propane are used.

A key challenge is that steam cracking to produce olefins is extremely energy-intensive, ranking among the top 10 most energy-consuming processes in the chemical industry. This creates thermodynamic challenges related to temperature and pressure requirements.

The literature does not provide specific details on thermodynamic challenges related to alkane chain length effects in olefin synthesis. However, it's clear that different feedstocks (e.g. naphtha vs ethane) are used in different regions, which likely impacts process conditions and energy requirements.

轻质烯烃如乙烯、丙烯和丁烯是化学工业的关键基础原料，其产量居世界前列。它们有广泛的应用，包括：

1. 包装材料
2. 合成纺织品
3. 防冻剂
4. 溶剂
5. 涂料

乙烯是全球产量最大的石油化工产品。它用于生产重要的中间化学品，如乙苯、环氧乙烷和二氯乙烷。

丙烯的需求增长巨大，主要由过去15年聚丙烯消费量的增加所驱动。它的衍生物甚至比乙烯还多。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解碳氢化合物原料。在欧洲和亚洲，主要原料是石脑油、汽油和凝析油。在北美和中东，使用乙烷和丙烷。

一个关键挑战是，生产烯烃的蒸汽裂解过程极其耗能，位列化学工业十大最耗能过程之列。这造成了与温度和压力要求相关的热力学挑战。

文献中没有提供烯烃合成中与烷烃链长效应相关的具体热力学挑战细节。然而，很明显不同地区使用不同的原料（如石脑油vs乙烷），这可能会影响工艺条件和能源需求。
