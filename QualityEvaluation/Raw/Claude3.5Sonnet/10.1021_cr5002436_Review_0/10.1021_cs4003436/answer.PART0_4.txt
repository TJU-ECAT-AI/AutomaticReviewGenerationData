[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

[2] "Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."

[3] "The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

[4] "The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."

Light olefins like ethylene, propylene and butylenes are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry, with some of the largest production volumes worldwide. They have diverse applications, from packaging materials and synthetic textiles to antifreeze agents, solvents and coatings.

The demand for light olefins has grown significantly, with global production capacity doubling in the past 15 years. Though demand decreased in 2008-2009 due to slow economic growth, analysts predicted growth would resume after 2012.

The main production method for light olefins, particularly ethylene, is steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, naphtha, gas oil and condensates are commonly used, while in North America and the Middle East, ethane and propane are the primary feedstocks.

A key challenge in light olefin production is that steam cracking is extremely energy-intensive, ranking among the top 10 most energy-consuming processes in the chemical industry. This presents both economic and environmental challenges.

The literature does not provide specific information on thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects in light olefin synthesis. However, the energy-intensive nature of the process suggests that optimizing these parameters is likely a significant focus in improving production efficiency.

轻质烯烃如乙烯、丙烯和丁烯是化学工业的重要基础原料，其产量位居世界前列。它们的应用范围广泛，从包装材料和合成纤维到防冻剂、溶剂和涂料等。

轻质烯烃的需求显著增长，过去15年全球产能翻了一番。虽然2008-2009年因经济增长放缓导致需求下降，但分析师预测2012年后需求将恢复增长。

生产轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯的主要方法是蒸汽裂解碳氢化合物原料。在欧洲和亚洲，常用石脑油、柴油和凝析油；而在北美和中东，主要使用乙烷和丙烷。

轻质烯烃生产的一个主要挑战是蒸汽裂解过程极其耗能，位列化学工业十大能耗过程之一。这既带来经济挑战，也带来环境挑战。

文献中没有提供关于轻质烯烃合成中温度、压力和烷烃链长效应的具体热力学挑战信息。然而，考虑到该过程的高能耗特性，优化这些参数很可能是提高生产效率的重要焦点。
