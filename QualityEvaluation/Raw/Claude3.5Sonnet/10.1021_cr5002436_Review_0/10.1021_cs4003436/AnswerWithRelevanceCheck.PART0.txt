          "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

"The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."

"Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."

"The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

"According to the ASF model, the maximum selectivity toward C2C4 olefins is achieved with an alpha value between 0.4 and 0.5. One of the most efficient ways of shifting product selectivity to low alpha values is by increasing reaction temperature. However, a decrease on the chain growth probability results in an increase of methane selectivity as indicated by the ASF product distribution."

"Figure 13 displays lower olefins selectivity as a function of temperature for supported catalysts. This graph shows that high CO conversions can be achieved using high reaction temperatures (>300 C). Under these conditions, the selectivity to shorter hydrocarbons is enhanced, increasing lower olefins selectivity but at the same time increasing methane production. The formation of carbon deposits is also favored at high reaction temperatures thus having a negative effect on catalytic activity."

          Light olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, and butylenes, are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry with diverse applications ranging from packaging materials and synthetic textiles to antifreeze agents, solvents, and coatings. They are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide.

Market trends show a consistently growing demand for light olefins, with global production capacity doubling over the past 15 years. Despite a temporary decrease in demand during 2008-2009 due to slow economic growth, analysts predicted growth to resume after 2012.

The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, naphtha, gas oil, and condensates are commonly used, while in North America and the Middle East, ethane and propane are the primary feedstocks. This process is one of the ten most energy-consuming in the chemical and petrochemical industry, presenting significant thermodynamic challenges.

Key thermodynamic challenges in light olefin synthesis relate to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects:

1. Temperature: Higher reaction temperatures (>300°C) can achieve high CO conversions and enhance selectivity towards shorter hydrocarbons, including light olefins. However, this also increases methane production and carbon deposit formation, negatively affecting catalytic activity.

2. Selectivity: According to the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model, maximum selectivity towards C2-C4 olefins is achieved with an alpha value between 0.4 and 0.5. Increasing reaction temperature is an efficient way to shift product selectivity to low alpha values, but this decreases chain growth probability and increases methane selectivity.

3. Alkane chain length: While not explicitly discussed, the choice of feedstock (e.g., naphtha vs. ethane) affects the distribution of products, with lighter feedstocks generally favoring the production of ethylene over longer-chain olefins.

These factors highlight the complex balance that must be struck in optimizing light olefin production, considering energy consumption, product selectivity, and catalyst performance.

          轻质烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和丁烯，是化学工业的关键基础材料，具有广泛的应用，从包装材料和合成纺织品到防冻剂、溶剂和涂料。它们是全球产量最大的有机化学品之一。

市场趋势显示轻质烯烃的需求持续增长，过去15年全球产能翻了一番。尽管2008-2009年由于经济增长缓慢导致需求暂时下降，但分析师预测2012年后需求会恢复增长。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是碳氢化合物原料的蒸汽裂解。在欧洲和亚洲，常用石脑油、气油和凝析油，而在北美和中东，主要使用乙烷和丙烷。这个过程是化学和石油化工行业十大最耗能过程之一，带来了重大的热力学挑战。

轻质烯烃合成中的主要热力学挑战与温度、压力和烷烃链长效应有关：

1. 温度：较高的反应温度（>300°C）可以实现高CO转化率并提高对较短碳氢化合物（包括轻质烯烃）的选择性。然而，这也会增加甲烷的产量和碳沉积的形成，对催化活性产生负面影响。

2. 选择性：根据Anderson-Schulz-Flory（ASF）模型，C2-C4烯烃的最大选择性是在alpha值在0.4到0.5之间时实现的。提高反应温度是将产品选择性转向低alpha值的有效方法，但这会降低链增长概率并增加甲烷选择性。

3. 烷烃链长：虽然没有明确讨论，但原料的选择（如石脑油vs乙烷）影响产品的分布，较轻的原料通常有利于乙烯的生产而不是长链烯烃。

这些因素突出了在优化轻质烯烃生产时需要在能耗、产品选择性和催化剂性能之间取得复杂平衡。
