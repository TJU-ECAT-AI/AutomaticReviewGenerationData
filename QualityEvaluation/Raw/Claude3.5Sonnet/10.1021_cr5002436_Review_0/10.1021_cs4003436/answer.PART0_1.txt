[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

[2] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000."

[3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene."

[4] "The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."

[5] "Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."

[6] "The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

[7] "Several processes have been developed in an attempt to solve one or more of the challenges encountered by the lower olefins industry. These processes are based on alternative feedstock such as coal, natural gas, or biomass."

[8] "The FTO process is a direct route that offers feedstock flexibility. When iron-based catalysts are used, the process can be performed using CO-rich syngas directly, without any H2/CO ratio adjustment, in view of their high water gas shift activity."

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry:

1. Applications: Light olefins are key building blocks used to produce a wide range of products, including packing materials, synthetic textiles, antifreeze agents, solvents, and coatings. Ethylene is used to make important intermediate chemicals like ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride. Propylene has even more derivatives than ethylene, with polypropylene being a major driver of demand growth.

2. Market trends: The demand for light olefins has been consistently growing, with global production capacity doubling over the past 15 years. Despite a temporary decrease in 2008-2009 due to slow economic growth, analysts predict continued growth in demand.

3. Production methods: The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, naphtha, gas oil, and condensates are commonly used, while in North America and the Middle East, ethane and propane are preferred. Alternative production methods using coal, natural gas, or biomass as feedstocks are being developed to address challenges in the industry.

4. Thermodynamic challenges: Steam cracking for olefin production is one of the most energy-intensive processes in the chemical industry. This presents significant thermodynamic challenges related to temperature and pressure control. The Fischer-Tropsch to Olefins (FTO) process is being explored as an alternative, offering more feedstock flexibility and the ability to use CO-rich syngas directly with iron-based catalysts.

5. Alkane chain length effects: The choice of feedstock (e.g., naphtha vs. ethane) affects the distribution of products, with lighter feedstocks generally favoring the production of ethylene over longer-chain olefins. This relationship between feedstock chain length and product distribution is an important consideration in olefin production.

轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，在化学工业中扮演着至关重要的角色：

1. 应用：轻质烯烃是生产广泛产品的关键基础材料，包括包装材料、合成纺织品、防冻剂、溶剂和涂料。乙烯用于生产重要的中间化学品，如乙苯、环氧乙烷和二氯乙烷。丙烯的衍生物比乙烯更多，其中聚丙烯是需求增长的主要驱动力。

2. 市场趋势：轻质烯烃的需求持续增长，过去15年全球产能翻了一番。尽管2008-2009年由于经济增长缓慢而暂时下降，但分析师预测需求将继续增长。

3. 生产方法：轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是碳氢化合物原料的蒸汽裂解。在欧洲和亚洲，常用石脑油、气油和凝析油，而在北美和中东，主要使用乙烷和丙烷。目前正在开发使用煤炭、天然气或生物质作为原料的替代生产方法，以应对行业面临的挑战。

4. 热力学挑战：用于烯烃生产的蒸汽裂解是化学工业中最耗能的过程之一。这带来了与温度和压力控制相关的重大热力学挑战。费托合成制烯烃（FTO）工艺正在被探索作为一种替代方法，它提供了更大的原料灵活性，并且可以直接使用铁基催化剂处理富CO的合成气。

5. 烷烃链长效应：原料的选择（如石脑油vs乙烷）影响产品的分布，较轻的原料通常有利于乙烯的生产而不是长链烯烃。这种原料链长与产品分布之间的关系是烯烃生产中的一个重要考虑因素。
