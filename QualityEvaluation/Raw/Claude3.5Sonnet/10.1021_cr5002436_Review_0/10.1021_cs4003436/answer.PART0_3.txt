[1] "Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

[2] "Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced worldwide. It is used to produce intermediate chemicals of high importance in industry such as ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride, which were listed, along with ethylene, in the top 30 highest volume chemicals in the United States in 2000."

[3] "Propylene is a versatile petrochemical which has even more derivatives than ethylene. However, the tremendous growth of polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years has been the main driver of the large increase of the demand of propylene."

[4] "The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."

[5] "Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."

[6] "The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

[7] "According to the ASF model, the maximum selectivity toward C2C4 olefins is achieved with an alpha value between 0.4 and 0.5. One of the most efficient ways of shifting product selectivity to low alpha values is by increasing reaction temperature. However, a decrease on the chain growth probability results in an increase of methane selectivity as indicated by the ASF product distribution."

Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry. They are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide, with a broad spectrum of derivatives used in diverse end markets including packaging materials, synthetic textiles, antifreeze agents, solvents, and coatings.

Ethylene is the largest-volume petrochemical produced globally. It is used to create important intermediate chemicals like ethyl benzene, ethylene oxide, and ethylene dichloride. Propylene, on the other hand, is even more versatile, with its demand largely driven by the growth in polypropylene consumption over the past 15 years.

The demand for lower olefins has been consistently growing, causing global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. Despite a decrease in demand during 2008-2009 due to slow economic growth, analysts predicted growth to resume after 2012.

The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, this primarily involves cracking naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in North America and the Middle East, ethane and propane are the main feedstocks. However, this process is one of the ten most energy-consuming in the chemical and petrochemical industry.

In terms of thermodynamic challenges, the production of light olefins faces issues related to selectivity and temperature. According to the Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF) model, maximum selectivity towards C2-C4 olefins is achieved with an alpha value between 0.4 and 0.5. Increasing reaction temperature is one of the most efficient ways to shift product selectivity to low alpha values. However, this decrease in chain growth probability also results in increased methane selectivity, which is an undesired by-product. This highlights the delicate balance that must be struck between temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length in the production of light olefins.

轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，是化学工业的关键构建模块。它们是全球产量最大的有机化学品之一，其广泛的衍生物应用于多样化的终端市场，包括包装材料、合成纺织品、防冻剂、溶剂和涂料。

乙烯是全球产量最大的石油化工产品。它用于生产重要的中间化学品，如乙苯、环氧乙烷和二氯乙烷。另一方面，丙烯更加多样化，其需求在过去15年主要由聚丙烯消费的增长驱动。

轻质烯烃的需求持续增长，导致全球产能在过去15年翻了一番。尽管2008-2009年由于经济增长缓慢导致需求下降，但分析师预测2012年后需求将恢复增长。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是碳氢化合物原料的蒸汽裂解。在欧洲和亚洲，这主要涉及裂解石脑油、气油和凝析油，而在北美和中东，乙烷和丙烷是主要原料。然而，这个过程是化学和石油化工行业十大能耗最高的过程之一。

在热力学挑战方面，轻质烯烃的生产面临着与选择性和温度相关的问题。根据Anderson-Schulz-Flory (ASF)模型，C2-C4烯烃的最大选择性是在alpha值在0.4到0.5之间时实现的。提高反应温度是将产品选择性转向低alpha值的最有效方法之一。然而，这种链增长概率的降低也导致了甲烷选择性的增加，而甲烷是一种不受欢迎的副产品。这突出了在轻质烯烃生产中必须在温度、压力和烷烃链长之间取得微妙平衡的需要。
