CHAPTER 1
1
Origin of Shale Gas
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The generic term natural gas applies to gases commonly associated with
petroliferous (petroleum producing, petroleum containing) geologic for-
mations. Natural gas generally contains high proportions of methane
(a single carbon hydrocarbon compound, CH4) and some of the higher
molecular weight higher paraffins (CnH2n12) generally containing up to
six carbon atoms may also be present in small quantities (Table 1.1). The
hydrocarbon constituents of natural gas are combustible, but nonflam-
mable nonhydrocarbon components such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
and helium are often present in the minority and are regarded as
contaminants.
In addition to the natural gas found in petroleum reservoirs, there
are also those reservoirs in which natural gas may be the sole occupant.
The principal constituent of natural gas is methane, but other hydrocar-
bons, such as ethane, propane, and butane, may also be present.
Carbon dioxide is also a common constituent of natural gas. Trace
amounts of rare gases, such as helium, may also occur, and certain natu-
ral gas reservoirs are a source of these rare gases. Just as petroleum can
vary in composition, so can natural gas. Differences in natural gas com-
position occur between different reservoirs, and two wells in the same
field may also yield gaseous products that are different in composition
(Mokhatab et al., 2006; Speight, 2007, 2014).
Natural gas resources are typically divided into two categories: con-
ventional and unconventional (Mokhatab et al., 2006; Speight, 2007,
2014). Conventional gas typically is found in reservoirs with a permeabil-
ity greater than 1 millidarcy ( .1 mD) and can be extracted via tradi-
tional techniques. A large proportion of the gas produced globally to date
is conventional and is relatively easy and inexpensive to extract.
In contrast, unconventional gas is found in reservoirs with relatively low
permeability (,1 mD) and hence cannot be extracted by conventional
methods.
There are several general definitions that have been applied to natu-
ral gas. Thus, lean gas is gas in which methane is the major constitu-
ent. Wet gas contains considerable amounts of the higher molecular
weight hydrocarbons. Sour gas contains hydrogen sulfide whereas
sweet gas contains very little, if any, hydrogen sulfide. Residue gas is
natural gas from which the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons
have been extracted and casing head gas is derived from petroleum but
is separated at the separation facility at the well head.
To further define the terms dry and wet in quantitative measures, the
term dry natural gas indicates that there is less than 0.1 gallon (1 gallon,
US, 5 264.2 m3) of gasoline vapor (higher molecular weight paraffins) per
1000 ft3 (1 ft3 5 0.028 m3). The term wet natural gas indicates that there
are such paraffins present in the gas, in fact more than 0.1 gal/1000 ft3.
1.2 SHALE
Shale formations and silt formations are the most abundant sedimentary
rocks in the Earths crust. In petroleum geology, organic shale formations
are source rocks as well as seal rocks that trap oil and gas (Speight, 2014).
In reservoir engineering, shale formations are flow barriers. In drilling,
the bit often encounters greater shale volumes than reservoir sands.
In seismic exploration, shale formations interfacing with other rocks often
form good seismic reflectors. As a result, seismic and petrophysical

Shale Gas Production Processes
properties of shale formations and the relationships among these proper-
ties are important for both exploration and reservoir management. Shale
formations are a worldwide occurrence (see Chapter 2).
Shale is a geological rock formation rich in clay, typically derived
from fine sediments, deposited in fairly quiet environments at the bot-
tom of seas or lakes, having then been buried over the course of
millions of years. Shale formations can serve as pressure barriers in
basins, as top seals, and as reservoirs in shale gas plays.
More technically, shale is a fissile, terrigenous sedimentary rock in
which particles are mostly of silt and clay size (Blatt and Tracy, 2000).
In this definition, fissile refers to the ability of the shale to split into thin
sheets along the bedding and terrigenous refers to the origin of the sedi-
ment. In many basins, the fluid pressure of the aqueous system becomes
significantly elevated, leading to the formation of a hydrofracture, and
fluid bleed-off. However, the occurrence of a natural hydrofracture is an
unlikely process in the circumstances that exist in most basins.
When a significant amount of organic matter has been deposited with
the sediments, the shale rock can contain organic solid material (kero-
gen). The properties and composition of shale place it in the category of
sedimentary rocks known as mudstones. Shale is distinguished from other
mudstones because it is laminated and fissilethe shale is composed of
many thin layers and readily splits into thin pieces along the laminations.
Shale is composed mainly of clay-size mineral grains, which are
usually clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite, and smectite. Shale usu-
ally contains other clay-size mineral particles such as quartz, chert,
and feldspar. Other constituents might include organic particles, car-
bonate minerals, iron oxide minerals, sulfide minerals, and heavy min-
eral grains and the presence of such minerals in shale is determined by
the environment under which the shale constituents were.
Shale comes in two general varieties based on organic content:
(i) dark or (ii) light. Dark colored or black shale formations are organic
rich, whereas the lighter colored shale formations are organic lean.
Organic-rich shale formations were deposited under conditions of little
or no oxygen in the water, which preserved the organic material from
decay.

Origin of Shale Gas
Black organic shale formations are the source rock for many of the
oil and natural gas deposits of the world. These black shale formations
obtain their black color from tiny particles of organic matter that were
deposited with the mud from which the shale formed. As the mud was
buried and warmed within the earth some of the organic material was
transformed into oil and natural gas.
A black color in sedimentary rocks almost always indicates the
presence of organic materials. Just 1% or 2% of organic materials can
impart a dark gray or black color to the rock. In addition, this black
color almost always implies that the shale formed from sediment
deposited in an oxygen-deficient environment. Any oxygen that
entered the environment quickly reacted with the decaying organic
debris. If a large amount of oxygen was present, the organic debris
would all have decayed. An oxygen-poor environment also provides
the proper conditions for the formation of sulfide minerals such as
pyrite, another important mineral found in most black shale sediments
or formations.
The presence of organic debris in black shale formations makes
them the candidates for oil and gas generation. If the organic material
is preserved and properly heated after burial, oil and natural gas might
be produced. The Barnett shale, Marcellus shale, Haynesville shale,
Fayetteville shale, and other gas producing rocks are all dark gray or
black shale formations that yield natural gas.
The oil and natural gas migrated out of the shale and upward
through the sediment mass because of their low density. The oil and
gas were often trapped within the pore spaces of an overlying rock
unit such as a sandstone formation. These types of oil and gas deposits
are known as conventional reservoirs because the fluids can easily flow
through the pores of the rock and into the extraction well.
Shale formations are ubiquitous in sedimentary basins: they typi-
cally form about 80% of what a well will drill through. As a result, the
main organic-rich shale formations have already been identified in
most regions of the world. Their depths vary from near surface to sev-
eral thousand feet underground, while their thickness varies from tens
of feet to several hundred feet. Often, enough is known about the geo-
logical history (Table 1.2) to infer which shale formations are likely to
contain gas (or oil, or a mixture of both). In that sense there may
4
Shale Gas Production Processes
appear to be no real need for a major exploration effort and expense
required for shale gas. However, the amount of gas present and partic-
ularly the amount of gas that can be recovered technically and eco-
nomically cannot be known until a number of wells have been drilled
and tested.
Each shale formation has different geological characteristics that
affect the way gas can be produced, the technologies needed, and the
economics of production. Different parts of the (generally large)
shale deposits will also have different characteristics: small sweet
spots or core areas may provide much better production than the
remainder of the formation, often because of the presence of natural
fractures that enhance permeability (Hunter and Young, 1953).

higher molecular weight than methane, such as propane, butane,

Origin of Shale Gas
natural gas production present in the gas can also vary considerably,
with important implications for the economics of production. While
most dry gas plays in the United States are probably uneconomic at
the current low natural gas prices, plays with significant liquid content
can be produced for the value of the liquids only (the market value of
NGLs is correlated with oil prices, rather than gas prices), making gas
an essentially free by-product.
In the late 1990s, natural gas drilling companies developed new
methods for liberating oil and natural gas that is trapped within the
tiny pore spaces of shale. This discovery was significant because it
unlocked some of the largest natural gas deposits in the world.
The Barnett shale of Texas was the first major natural gas field
developed in a shale reservoir rock. Producing gas from the Barnett
shale was a challenge because the pore spaces in shale are so tiny that
the gas has difficulty moving through the shale and into the well.
Drillers discovered that the permeability of the shale could be
increased by pumping water down the well under pressure that was
high enough to fracture the shale. These fractures liberated some of
the gas from the pore spaces and allowed that gas to flow to the well
(hydraulic fracturing, hydrofracking).
Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing revolutionized drilling
technology and paved the way for developing several giant natural gas
fields. These include the Marcellus shale in the Appalachians, the
Haynesville shale in Louisiana, and the Fayetteville shale in Arkansas.
These enormous shale reservoirs hold enough natural gas to serve all
of the United States needs for 20 years or more.
Hydraulic properties are characteristics of a rock such as permeabil-
ity and porosity that reflect its ability to hold and transmit fluids such
as water, oil, or natural gas. In this respect, shale has a very small par-
ticle size so the interstitial spaces are very small. In fact they are so
small that oil, natural gas, and water have difficulty moving through
the rock. Shale can therefore serve as a cap rock for oil and natural
gas traps and it also is an aquiclude that blocks or limits the flow of
underground water.
Although the interstitial spaces in a shale formation are very small
they can take up a significant volume of the rock. This allows the shale
6
Shale Gas Production Processes
to hold significant amounts of water, gas, or oil but not be able to
effectively transmit them because of the low permeability. The oil and
gas industry overcomes these limitations of shale by using horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing to create artificial porosity and perme-
ability within the rock.
Some of the clay minerals that occur in shale have the ability to
absorb or adsorb large amounts of water, natural gas, ions, or other
substances. This property of shale can enable it to selectively and tena-
ciously hold or freely release fluids or ions.
Thus, this shale gas resource can be considered a technology-driven
resource as achieving gas production out of otherwise unproductive
rock requires technology-intensive processes. Maximizing gas recovery
requires far more wells than would be the case in conventional natural
gas operations. Furthermore, horizontal wells with horizontal legs up
to one mile or more in length are widely used to access the reservoir to
the greatest extent possible.
Multistage hydraulic fracturing (see Chapter 3), where the shale is
cracked under high pressures at several places along the horizontal sec-
tion of the well, is used to create conduits through which gas can flow.
Microseismic imaging allows operators to visualize where this fracture
growth is occurring in the reservoir. However, as a technology-driven
resource, the rate of development of shale gas may become limited by
the availability of required resources, such as freshwater, fracture prop-
pant, or drilling rigs capable of drilling wells two miles or more in
length.
1.3 RESERVOIRS
In conventional gas reservoirs (GAO, 2012; Speight, 2007, 2014), oil and
gas are fairly mobile and easily move through the permeable formation
because of buoyancy (they are lighter than the water in the same forma-
tion and therefore rise) until they are trapped against an impermeable
rock (i.e., a seal) that prevents further movement. This leads to localized
pools of oil and gas while the rest of the formation is filled with water.
However, both biogenic and thermogenic shale gases remain where they
were first generated and can be found in three forms: (i) free gas in the
pore spaces and fractures; (ii) adsorbed gas, where the gas is electrically
7
Origin of Shale Gas
stuck to the organic matter and clay; and (iii) a small amount of dissolved
gas that is dissolved in the organic matter.
In such reservoirs, typically an impermeable shale formation is
either the basement rock or the cap rock of a sandstone formation
thereby preventing any fluids within the sandstone from escaping or
migrating to other formations.
A shale gas reservoir (gas shale) is an organic rich, and fine-grained
shale that contains natural gas (Bustin, 2006; Bustin et al., 2008).
However, the term shale is used very loosely and does not describe the
lithology of the reservoir. Lithological variations in American shale
gas reservoirs indicate that natural gas is retained in the reservoir not
only in shale but also a wide spectrum of lithology and texture from
mudstone (i.e., nonfissile shale) to siltstone and fine-grained sandstone,
any of which may be of siliceous or carbonate composition. For exam-
ple, in many basins, much of what is described as shale is often silt-
stone, or encompasses multiple rock types, such as siltstone or
sandstone laminations interbedded with shale laminations or beds.
The presence of multiple rock types in organic-rich shale formations
implies that there are multiple gas storage mechanisms, as gas may be
adsorbed on organic matter and stored as free gas in micropores and
macropores. Laminations serve a dual purpose because they both store
free gas and transmit gas desorbed from organic matter in shale to the
wellbore. The determination of the permeability and porosity of the
laminations, and the linking of these laminations via a hydraulic frac-
ture to the wellbore, are key requirements for efficient development.
Additionally, solute or solution gas may be held in micropores and
nanopores of bitumen (Bustin, 2006) and may be an additional source
of gas, although traditionally this is thought to be a minor component.
Free gas may be a more dominant source of production than desorbed
gas or solute gas in a shale gas reservoir. Determining the percentage
of free gas versus solute gas versus desorbed gas is important for
resource and reserve evaluation and is a significant issue in gas produc-
tion and reserve calculations, as desorbed gas diffuses at a lower pres-
sure than free gas.
The lack of a strict definition for shale causes an additional degree of
difficulty for resource evaluation. Such a broad spectrum of lithology
appears to form a transition with other resources, such as tight gas,
8
Shale Gas Production Processes
where the difference between the tight gas reservoir and gas shale may
be the higher amount of sandstone (in the tight gas reservoir) and the
tight gas reservoir may actually contain no organic matter.
Briefly, a shale gas reservoir (shale gas play) is similar on a world-
wide basis insofar as organic rich, gas-prone shale is generally difficult
to discover. In all cases, a thorough understanding of the fundamental
geochemical and geological attributes of shale is essential for resource
assessment, development, and environmental stewardship. Four prop-
erties that are important characteristics in each shale gas play are:
(i) the maturity of the organic matter, (ii) the type of gas generated
and stored in the reservoirbiogenic gas or thermogenic gas, (iii) the
total organic carbon (TOC) content of the strata, and (iv) the perme-
ability of the reservoir.
A tight gas reservoir (tight gas sands) is a low-permeability sand-
stone reservoir that produces primarily dry natural gas. A tight gas res-
ervoir is one that cannot be produced at economic flow rates or
recover economic volumes of gas unless the well is stimulated by a
large hydraulic fracture treatment and/or produced using horizontal
wellbores. This definition also applies to coalbed methane (CBM) and
tight carbonate reservoirsshale gas reservoirs are also included by
some observers (but not in this text).
In addition, the variety of rock types observed in organic-rich shale
formations implies the presence of a range of different types of shale gas
reservoirs. Each reservoir may have distinct geochemical and geological
characteristics that may require equally unique methods of drilling, com-
pletion, production, and resource and reserve evaluation (Cramer,
2008)leading to further necessary considerations when the shale gas
had to be processed (see Chapter 4). Additionally, it must not be forgot-
ten that a shale formation is often a seal or cap rock for a conventional
(sandstone) petroleum or natural gas reservoir and that not all shale is
necessarily reservoir rock (Speight, 2007, 2014).
On a more physical note, typical shale formations can be anywhere
from 20 ft to a mile or so thick and extend over very wide geographic
areas. A gas shale reservoir is often referred to as a resource play, where
natural gas resources are widely distributed over extensive areas (perhaps
several fields) rather than concentrated in a specific location. The volume
of natural gas contained within a resource play increases as the
9
Origin of Shale Gas
thickness and areal extent of the deposit grows. Individual gas shale
formations may have a billion cubic feet (1 3 109 ft3) or even a trillion
cubic feet (1 3 1012 ft3) of gas in place spread over hundreds to thou-
sands of square miles. The difficulty lies in extracting even a small
fraction of that gas.
Shale formations exhibit a wide range of mechanical properties and
significant anisotropy reflecting their wide range of material composi-
tion and fabric anisotropy (Sone, 2012). The elastic properties of these
shale rocks are successfully described by tracking the relative amount
of soft components (clay and solid organic materials) in the rock and
also acknowledging the anisotropic distribution of the soft compo-
nents. Gas shale formations also possess relatively stronger degree of
anisotropy compared to other organic-rich shale formations, possibly
due to the fact that these rocks come from peak-maturity source rocks.
The deformational properties are influenced by the amount of soft
components in the rock and exhibit mechanical anisotropy.
The pore spaces in shale, through which the natural gas must move
if the gas is to flow into any well, are as much as 1000 times smaller
than pores in conventional sandstone reservoirs. The gaps that connect
pores (the pore throats) are smaller still, only 20 times larger than a
single methane molecule. Therefore, shale has very low permeability
but natural or induced fractures, which act as conduits for the move-
ment of natural gas, will increase the permeability of the shale.
There is also the possibility (only assiduous geological studies will
tell) of hybrid gas shale formation, where the originally deposited mud
was rich in sand or silt. These foreign minerals (sand silt) result in a
natural higher permeability for the shale formation and result in
greater susceptibility of the shale to hydraulic fracturing.
1.4 SHALE GAS
Shale gas is natural gas produced from shale formations that typically
function as both the reservoir and the source rocks for the natural gas.
In terms of chemical makeup, shale gas is typically a dry gas composed
primarily of methane (6095% v/v), but some formations do produce
wet gas. The Antrim and New Albany plays have typically produced
water and gas. Gas shale formations are organic-rich shale formations
10
Shale Gas Production Processes
that were previously regarded only as source rocks and seals for gas
accumulating in the strata near sandstone and carbonate reservoirs of
traditional onshore gas development.
Shale is a sedimentary rock that is predominantly composed of consol-
idated clay-sized particles. Shale formations are deposited as muds in
low-energy environments such as tidal flats and deepwater basins where
the fine-grained clay particles fall out of suspension in the quiet waters.
During the deposition of these very fine-grained sediments, there can also
be accumulation of organic matter in the form of algae, plant, and
animal-derived organic debris (Davis, 1992). The very fine sheet-like clay
mineral grains and laminated layers of sediment result in a rock with per-
meability that is limited horizontally and extremely limited vertically.
This low permeability means that gas trapped in shale cannot move easily
within the rock except over geologic expanses of time, i.e., millions of
years. These units are often organic rich and are thought to be the source
beds for a large percentage of the hydrocarbons produced in these basins.
Thus, by definition, shale gas is the hydrocarbon gas present in
organic rich, fine grained, sedimentary rocks (shale and associated
lithofacies). The gas is generated and stored in situ in gas shale as both
sorbed gas (on organic matter) and free gas (in fractures or pores).
As such, shale containing gas is a self-sourced reservoir. Low-
permeable shale requires extensive fractures (natural or induced) to
produce commercial quantities of gas.
Shale is a very fine-grained sedimentary rock, which is easily break-
able into thin, parallel layers. It is a very soft rock, but it does not dis-
integrate when it becomes wet. The shale formations can contain
natural gas, usually when two thick, black shale deposits sandwich a
thinner area of shale. Because of some of the properties of the shale
deposits, the extraction of natural gas from shale formations is more
difficult and perhaps more expensive than that of conventional natural
gas. Shale basins are scattered across the United States.
There are several types of unconventional gas resources that are
currently produced. They are as follows:
1. Deep natural gasnatural gas that exists in deposits very far under-
ground, beyond conventional drilling depths, typically 15,000 ft
or more.
11
Origin of Shale Gas
2. Shale gasnatural gas that occurs in low-permeability shale
formations.
3. Tight natural gasnatural gas that occurs in low-permeability
formations.
4. Geopressurized zonesnatural underground formations that are
under unusually high pressure for their depth.
5. Coalbed methanenatural gas that occurs in conjunction with coal
seams.
6. Methane hydratesnatural gas that occurs at low temperature and
high pressure regions such as the seabed and is made up of a lattice
of frozen water, which forms a cage around the methane.
CBM is produced from wells drilled into coal seams which act as
source and reservoir to the produced gas (Speight, 2013). These wells
often produce water in the initial production phase, as well as natural
gas. Economic CBM reservoirs are normally shallow, as the coal matrix
tends to have insufficient strength to maintain porosity at depth.
On the other hand, shale gas is obtained from ultra-low permeabil-
ity shale formations that may also be the source rock for other gas
reservoirs. The natural gas volumes can be stored in fracture porosity,
within the micropores of the shale itself, or adsorbed onto the shale.
In the context of this book, the focus is on shale gas and, when nec-
essary, reference will also be made to tight gas. In respect to the low
permeability of these reservoirs, the gas must be developed via special
techniques including stimulation by hydraulic fracturing (or fraccing,
fracking) in order to be produced commercially.
To prevent the fractures from closing when the pressure is reduced,
several tons of sand or other proppant is pumped down the well and
into the pressurized portion of the hole. When the fracturing occurs
millions of sand grains are forced into the fractures. If enough sand
grains are trapped in the fracture, it will be propped partially open
when the pressure is reduced. This provides an improved permeability
for the flow of gas to the well.
It has been estimated that there is in the order of 750 trillion cubic
feet (Tcf, 1 3 1012 ft3) of technically recoverable shale gas resources in
the United States; represents a large and very important share of the
United States recoverable resource base and, in addition, by 2035
12
Shale Gas Production Processes
approximately 46% of the natural gas supply of the United States will
come from shale gas (EIA, 2011).
Tight gas is a form of unconventional natural gas that is contained in
a very low-permeability formation undergroundusually hard rock or a
sandstone or limestone formation that is unusually impermeable and non-
porous (tight sand). In a conventional natural gas deposit, once drilled,
the gas can usually be extracted quite readily and easily (Speight, 2007).
Like shale gas reservoirs, tight gas reservoirs are generally defined as hav-
ing low permeability (in many cases less than 0.1 mD) (Law and Spencer,
1993). Tight gas makes up a significant portion of the natural gas
resource basemore than 21% v/v of the total recoverable natural gas in
the United States is in tight formations and represents an extremely
important portion of natural gas resources (GAO, 2012).
In tight gas sands (low-porosity sandstones and carbonate reser-
voirs.), gas is produced through wells and the gas arose from a source
outside the reservoir and migrated into the reservoir over geological
time. Some tight gas reservoirs have also been found to be sourced by
underlying coal and shale formation source rocks, as appears to be the
case in the basin-centered gas accumulations.
However, extracting gas from a tight formation requires more severe
extraction methodsseveral such methods do exist that allow natural gas
to be extracted, including hydraulic fracturing and acidizing. It has been
projected that gas-containing formations with permeability as little as
1 nD may be economically productive with optimized spacing and com-
pletion of staged fractures to maximize yield with respect to cost (McKoy
and Sams, 2007). Like all unconventional natural gas, the economic
incentive must be there to encourage companies to extract this costly gas
instead of more easily obtainable, conventional natural gas.
The focus of this book is on shale gas, i.e., gas that exists in shale
formation and requires additional efforts (such as fracking) for recov-
ery but when necessary reference will also be made to tight gas.
1.4.1 Origin
Gas from shale is generated in two different ways, although a mixture
of gas types is possible: (i) thermogenic gas is generated from cracking
of organic matter or the secondary cracking of oil, and (ii) biogenic
13
Origin of Shale Gas
gas, such as in the Antrim shale gas field in Michigan, is generated
from microbes in areas of fresh water recharge (Martini et al., 1998,
2003, 2004; Shurr and Ridgley, 2002). Thermogenic gas is associated
with mature organic matter that has been subjected to relatively high
temperature and pressure in order to generate hydrocarbons. Broadly
speaking, more mature organic matter should generate higher gas-in-
place resources than less mature organic matter, all other factors being
equal (Martini et al., 1998; Schettler and Parmely, 1990).
Gas from shale is generated in two different ways, although a mix-
ture of gas types is possible: (i) thermogenic gas is generated from ther-
mal decomposition of organic matter or the secondary thermal
decomposition of any liquid productsoil, and (ii) biogenic gas, such
as in the Antrim shale gas field in Michigan, is generated from
microbes in areas of fresh water recharge (Martini et al., 1998, 2003,
2004). Thermogenic gas is associated with mature organic matter that
has been subjected to relatively high temperature and pressure in order
to generate hydrocarbons.
Generally, more mature organic matter should generate higher gas-
in-place resources than less mature organic matter, all other factors
being equal. Organic maturity is often expressed in terms of vitrinite
reflectance (% Ro), where a value above approximately 1.01.1%
indicates that the organic matter is sufficiently mature to generate gas
and could be an effective source rock.
Well-fractured shale that typically contains an abundance of mature
organic matter and is deep or under high pressure will yield a high ini-
tial flow rate. For example, horizontal wells in the Barnett with a high
initial reservoir pressure can yield an initial flow rate of a few million
cubic feet per day after induced fracturing. However, after the first
year, gas flow may be dominated by the rate of diffusion from the
matrix to the induced fractures (Bustin et al., 2008).
Biogenic gas can be associated with either mature or immature
organic matter, and can add substantially to shale gas reserves.
For example, the San Juan Basin CBM gas field is a mixture of both
gases and has generated much of its gas from biogenic processes (Scott
et al., 1994). Likewise, gas from the Antrim shale formation in the
Michigan Basin is largely biogenic gas that has been generated in the
last 10,00020,000 years (Martini et al., 1998, 2003, 2004) and more
14
Shale Gas Production Processes
than 2.4 Tcf has been produced as of 2006. A mixture of gases is
suggested for the New Albany shale formation in the Illinois Basin
(Wipf and Party, 2006) and is certainly possible in Alberta shale.
1.4.2 Shale Reservoirs
Shale gas is natural gas that is produced from a type of sedimentary
rock derived from clastic sources often including mudstone or siltstone
which is known as shale. Clastic sedimentary rocks are composed of
fragments (clasts) of preexisting rocks that have been eroded, trans-
ported, deposited, and lithified (hardened) into new rocks. Shale depos-
its typically contain organic material which was laid down along with
the rock fragments.
In areas where conventional resources are located, shale can be
found in the underlying rock strata and can be the source of the hydro-
carbons that have migrated upwards into the reservoir rock. Over
time, as the rock matures, hydrocarbons are produced from the kero-
gen. These may then migrate, as either a liquid (petroleum) or a gas
(natural gas), through existing fissures and fractures in the rock until
they reach the earths surface or until they become trapped by strata of
impermeable rock. Porous areas beneath these traps collect the hydro-
carbons in a conventional reservoir, frequently of sandstone.
Shale gas reservoirs generally recover less gas (from ,5% to 20% v/v)
relative to conventional gas reservoirs (approximately 5090% v/v) (Faraj
et al., 2004), although the naturally well-fractured Antrim shale may have
a recovery factor as high as 5060% v/v. More recently, there have been
suggestions that the Haynesville shale in Louisiana may have a recovery
factor as high as 30% (Durham, 2008). To increase the recovery factor,
innovation in drilling and completion technology is paramount in low-
permeability shale reservoirs. In the initial state of pool development, per-
meability sweet spots are often sought because they result in higher rates
of daily production and increased recovery of gas compared to less perme-
able shale.
But these sweet spots are small, relative to the size of unconventional
pools, so horizontal drilling and new completion techniques (such as
staged fracs and simultaneous fracs; Cramer, 2008) were developed
to improve economics both inside and outside of sweet spots. The
result is a significant increase in economically producible reserves and a
substantial extension of the area of economically producible gas.

Origin of Shale Gas
Shale gas resources differ from conventional natural gas resources
insofar as the shale acts as both the source for the gas and the zone
(the reservoir) in which the gas is trapped. The very low permeability
of the rock causes the rock to trap the gas and prevent it from migrat-
ing toward the surface. The gas can be held in natural fractures or
pore spaces, or can be adsorbed onto organic material. With the
advancement of drilling and completion technology, this gas can be
successfully exploited and extracted commercially as has been proven
in various basins in North America.
Aside from permeability, the key properties of shale, when consider-
ing gas potential, are (i) total organic content and (ii) thermal
maturity.
The total organic content is the total amount of organic material
present in the rock, expressed as a percentage by weight. Generally,
the higher the total organic content, the better the potential for hydro-
carbon generation. The thermal maturity of the rock is a measure of
the degree to which organic matter contained in the rock has been
heated over time, and potentially converted into liquid and/or gaseous
hydrocarbons.
Because of the special techniques required for extraction, shale gas
can be more expensive than conventional gas to extract. On the other
hand, the in-place gas resource can be very large given the significant
lateral extent and thickness of many shale formations. However, only a
small portion of a shale gas resource may be theoretically producible
and is even less likely to be producible in a commercially viable manner.
Therefore, a key determinant of the success of a shale play is whether,
and how much, gas can be recovered to the surface and at what cost.
The gas storage properties of shale are quite different to those of
conventional reservoirs. In addition to having gas present in the matrix
system of pores similar to that found in conventional reservoir rocks,
shale also has gas bound or adsorbed to the surface of organic materi-
als in the shale. The relative contributions and combinations of free
gas from matrix porosity and from desorption of adsorbed gas is a key
determinant of the production profile of the well.
The amount and distribution of gas within the shale is determined
by, among other things, the initial reservoir pressure, the petrophysical
16
Shale Gas Production Processes
properties of the rock, and its adsorption characteristics. During
production there are three main processes at play. Initial gas production
is dominated by depletion of gas from the fracture network. This form
of production declines rapidly due to limited storage capacity. After the
initial decline rate stabilizes, the depletion of gas stored in the matrix
becomes the primary process involved in production. The amount
of gas held in the matrix is dependent on the particular properties of the
shale reservoir, which can be hard to estimate. Secondary to this deple-
tion process is desorption whereby adsorbed gas is released from the
rock as pressure in the reservoir declines. The rate of gas production via
the desorption process depends on there being a significant drop in
reservoir pressure.
Pressure changes typically advance through the rock very slowly
due to low permeability. Tight well spacing can therefore be required
to lower the reservoir pressure enough to cause significant amounts of
adsorbed gas to be desorbed.
The ultimate recovery of the gas in place surrounding a particular
shale gas well can be in the order of 2840% of the original volume in
place whereas the recovery per conventional well may be as high as
6080% v/v. The development of shale gas plays, therefore, differs
significantly from the development of conventional resources. With a
conventional reservoir, each well is capable of draining oil or gas over
a relatively large area (dependent on reservoir properties). As such,
only a few wells (normally vertical) are required to produce commercial
volumes from the field. With shale gas projects, a large number of rela-
tively closely spaced wells are required to produce large enough
volumes to make the plays economic. As a result, many wells must be
drilled in a shale play to drain the reservoir sufficientlyin the Barnett
shale resource in the United States, the drilling density can exceed one
well per 60 acres.
TOC is a fundamental attribute of gas shale and is a measure of
organic richness. The TOC content, the thickness of organic shale, and
organic maturity are key attributes that aid in determining the eco-
nomic viability of a shale gas play. There is no unique combination or
minimum amount of these factors that determines economic viability.
The factors are highly variable between shale of different ages and can
vary, in fact, within a single deposit or stratum of shale over short
17
Origin of Shale Gas
distances. At the low end of these factors, there is very little gas gener-
ated. At higher values, more gas is generated and stored in the shale (if
it has not been expelled from the source rock), and the shale can be a
target for exploration and production. However, the presence of suffi-
cient quantities of gas does not guarantee economic success, since shale
has very low permeability and the withdrawal of gas is a difficult prop-
osition that depends largely upon efficient drilling and completion
techniques.
Induced fracturing may occur many times during the productive life of
a shale gas reservoir (Walser and Pursell, 2007). Shale, in particular, exhi-
bits permeability lower than CBM or tight gas and, because of this, forms
the source and seal of many conventional oil and gas pools. Hence, not
all shale is capable of sustaining an economic rate of production. In this
respect, permeability of the shale matrix is the most important parameter
influencing sustainable shale gas production (Bennett et al., 1991a,b;
Bustin et al., 2008; Davies and Vessell, 2002; Davies et al., 1991; Gingras
et al., 2004; Pemberton and Gingras, 2005).
To sustain yearly production, gas must diffuse from the low-
permeability matrix to induced or natural fractures. Generally, higher
matrix permeability results in a higher rate of diffusion to fractures
and a higher rate of flow to the wellbore (Bustin et al., 2008).
Furthermore, more fractured shale (i.e., shorter fracture spacing),
given sufficient matrix permeability, should result in higher production
rates (Bustin et al., 2008), a greater recovery of hydrocarbons, and a
larger drainage area (Cramer, 2008; Walser and Pursell, 2007).
Additionally, microfractures within shale matrix may be important for
economic production; however, these microfractures are not easily
determined in situ in a reservoir (Tinker and Potter, 2007), and only
further research and analysis will determine their role in shale gas
production.
An additional factor to consider is shale thickness. The substantial
thickness of shale is one of the primary reasons, along with a large sur-
face area of fine-grained sediment and organic matter for adsorption
of gas, that shale resource evaluations yield such high values.
Therefore, a general rule is that thicker shale is a better target. Shale
targets such as the Bakken oil play in the Williston Basin (itself a
hybrid conventionalunconventional play), however, are less than
50 m thick in many areas and are yielding apparently economic rates
18
Shale Gas Production Processes
of flow. The required thickness to economically develop a shale gas
target may decrease as drilling and completion techniques improve, as
porosity and permeability detection techniques progress in unconven-
tional targets and, perhaps, as the price of gas increases. Such a situa-
tion would add a substantial amount of resources and reserves to the
province.
1.5 SHALE GAS AND ENERGY SECURITY
Energy security is the continuous and uninterrupted availability of
energy to a specific country or region. The security of energy supply
performs a crucial role in decisions that are related to the formulation
of energy policy strategies. The economies of many countries are
dependent on the energy imports in the notion that their balance of
payments is affected by the magnitude of the vulnerability that the
countries have in crude oil and natural gas (Speight, 2011).
Energy security has been an on-again-off-again political issue in the
United States since the first Arab oil embargo in 1973. Since that time,
the speeches of various presidents and the Congress of the United
States have continued to call for an end to the dependence on foreign
oil and gas by the United States. The congressional rhetoric of energy
security and energy independence continues but meaningful sugges-
tions of how to address this issue remain few and far between.
The energy literature and numerous statements by officials of oil-
and-gas-producing and oil-and-gas-consuming countries indicate that
the concept of energy security is elusive. Definitions of energy security
range from uninterrupted oil supplies to the physical security of energy
facilities to support for biofuels and renewable energy resources.
Historically, experts and politicians referred to security of oil supplies
as energy security. Only recently policy makers started to include natu-
ral gas supplies in the portfolio of energy definitions.
The security aspects of natural gas are similar, but not identical, to
those of oil. Compared with oil imports, natural gas imports play a
smaller role in most importing countriesmainly because it is less
costly to transport liquid crude oil and petroleum products than natu-
ral gas. Natural gas is transported by pipeline over long distances
because of the pressurization costs of transmission; the need to finance
19
Origin of Shale Gas
the cost of these pipelines encourages long-term contracts that dampen
price volatility.
The past decade has yielded substantial change in the natural gas
industry. Specifically, there has been rapid development of technology
allowing the recovery of natural gas from shale formations. Since
2000, rapid growth in the production of natural gas from shale forma-
tions in North America has dramatically altered the global natural gas
market landscape. Indeed, the emergence of shale gas is perhaps the
most intriguing development in global energy markets in recent
memory.
Beginning with the Barnett shale in northeast Texas, the application
of innovative new techniques involving the use of horizontal drilling
with hydraulic fracturing has resulted in the rapid growth in produc-
tion of natural gas from shale. Knowledge of the shale gas resource is
not new as geologists have long known about the existence of shale
formations, and accessing those resources was long held in the geology
community to be an issue of technology and cost. In the past decade,
innovations have yielded substantial cost reductions, making shale gas
production a commercial reality. In fact, shale gas production in the
United States has increased from virtually nothing in 2000 to over
10 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd, 1 3 109 ft3 per day) in 2010, and it
is expected to more than quadruple by 2040, reaching 50% or more of
total US natural gas production by the decade starting in 2030.
Natural gasif not disadvantaged by government policies that pro-
tect competing fuels, such as coalstands to play a very important
role in the US energy mix for decades to come. Rising shale gas pro-
duction has already delivered large beneficial impacts to the United
States. Shale gas resources are generally located in close proximity to
end-use markets where natural gas is utilized to fuel industry, generate
electricity, and heat homes. This offers both security of supply and
economic benefits (Medlock et al., 2011).
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (originally
named the Clean Energy Act of 2007) is an Act of Congress concerning
the energy policy of the United States. The stated purpose of the act is
to move the United States toward greater energy independence and
energy security, to increase the production of clean renewable fuels, to
protect consumers, to increase the efficiency of products, buildings,
20
Shale Gas Production Processes
and vehicles, to promote research on and deploy greenhouse gas cap-
ture and storage options, and to improve the energy performance of
the Federal Government, and for other purposes.
The bill originally sought to cut subsidies to the petroleum industry
in order to promote petroleum independence and different forms of
alternative energy. These tax changes were ultimately dropped after
opposition in the Senate, and the final bill focused on automobile fuel
economy, development of biofuels, and energy efficiency in public
buildings and lighting.
It was, and still is, felt by many observers that there should have been
greater recognition of the role that natural gas can play in energy
security.
In fact, viewed from the perspective of the energy-importing coun-
tries as a whole, diversification in oil supplies has remained constant
over the last decade while diversification in natural gas supplies has
steadily increased. Given the increasing importance of natural gas in
world energy use, this points to an increase in overall energy security
(Cohen et al., 2011).
However, natural gas is an attractive fuel, and its attraction is growing
because of its clean burning characteristics, compared to oil or coal, and
because of its price advantage, on an energy equivalent basis, compared
to oil. Accordingly, analysts predict significant future growth in natural
gas consumption worldwide and growth in the trade of natural gas.
Significant investments are being made to meet this future demand by
bringing so-called stranded gas (including shale gas) to market.
Current trends suggest that natural gas will gradually become a
global commodity with a single world market, just like oil, adjusted
for transportation differences. The outcome of a global gas market is
inevitable; once this occurs, the tendency will be toward a world price
of natural gas, as with oil today, and the prices of oil and gas each will
reach a global equivalence based on energy content (Deutch, 2010).
