The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about light olefins, their applications, market trends, production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. The only relevant information is about a methanol-to-olefins (MTO) unit, which is one production method for light olefins. However, this single piece of information is not enough to address the various aspects of the question comprehensively.

The text mentions that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has accepted a new MTO unit from Honeywell UOP, with a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's largest single-train MTO unit. This suggests that MTO technology is being used on a large scale for olefin production, but it does not provide details on applications, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges associated with olefin synthesis.

提供的文献中没有足够的信息来全面回答关于轻质烯烃的应用、市场趋势、生产方法和热力学挑战的问题。唯一相关的信息是关于一个甲醇制烯烃(MTO)装置，这是轻质烯烃的一种生产方法。然而，这一单一信息不足以全面解答问题的各个方面。

文本提到江苏扬子石化公司接受了霍尼韦尔UOP提供的新MTO装置，年产能为83.3万吨，是世界上最大的单系列MTO装置。这表明MTO技术正在大规模用于烯烃生产，但它没有提供关于应用、市场趋势或与烯烃合成相关的热力学挑战的详细信息。
