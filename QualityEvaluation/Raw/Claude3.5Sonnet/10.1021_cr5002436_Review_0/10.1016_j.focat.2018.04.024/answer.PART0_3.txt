The literature provided does not contain comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contribution to the chemical industry, their applications, market trends, key production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. However, it does mention methanol-to-olefins (MTO) as a production method for olefins. The text indicates that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has implemented a large-scale MTO unit with a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes per year, suggesting that olefins are in high demand in the chemical industry. This implies that olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are important feedstocks for various chemical processes and products. The scale of the MTO unit also suggests that this is a significant production method for olefins. However, the document does not provide information on specific applications, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges associated with olefin synthesis.

提供的文献并不包含全面的信息来完整回答关于轻烯烃对化工行业的贡献、其应用、市场趋势、主要生产方法以及热力学挑战的问题。然而，它确实提到了甲醇制烯烃（MTO）作为烯烃的一种生产方法。文本指出，江苏海翼石化公司已经实施了一个大规模的MTO装置，年产能为83.3万吨，这表明烯烃在化工行业有很高的需求。这意味着烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是各种化学过程和产品的重要原料。MTO装置的规模也表明这是烯烃的一个重要生产方法。然而，该文件没有提供关于具体应用、市场趋势或与烯烃合成相关的热力学挑战的信息。
