The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contribution to the chemical industry, their applications, market trends, key production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. However, it does mention methanol-to-olefins (MTO) as a production method for olefins. The text indicates that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has implemented a large-scale MTO unit with a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes per year, suggesting that there is significant demand for olefins in the chemical industry. This implies that olefins are important feedstocks for various chemical processes and products. The scale of the MTO unit also suggests that this production method is economically viable and technically feasible for large-scale olefin production.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于轻烯烃对化工行业的贡献、应用、市场趋势、主要生产方法和热力学挑战的问题。但是，它确实提到了甲醇制烯烃(MTO)作为一种生产烯烃的方法。文中指出，江苏海船石化有限公司实施了一个大规模的MTO装置，年产能为83.3万吨，这表明化工行业对烯烃有着巨大的需求。这意味着烯烃是各种化学过程和产品的重要原料。MTO装置的规模也表明，这种生产方法在经济上是可行的，技术上也适合大规模烯烃生产。
