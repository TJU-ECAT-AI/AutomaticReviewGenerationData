The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contributions, applications, market trends, production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. However, it does mention methanol-to-olefins (MTO) as a production method for olefins. The document reports that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has started operating the world's largest single-train MTO unit, with a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes per year. This suggests that MTO is a significant and scalable method for producing light olefins like ethylene and propylene. The large scale of this plant indicates a strong demand for olefins in the chemical industry. However, the document does not provide details on specific applications, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges associated with olefin synthesis.
