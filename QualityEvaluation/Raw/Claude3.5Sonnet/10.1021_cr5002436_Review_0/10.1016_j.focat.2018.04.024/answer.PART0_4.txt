[1] "Honeywell announced on March 1, 2018 that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has accepted a new methanol-to-olefins (MTO) unit provided by Honeywell UOP, and that the plant is operating and has met all guarantees. With a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes/y, the unit is the largest single-train MTO unit in the world."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contributions to the chemical industry, their applications, market trends, key production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. The only relevant information is a brief mention of a methanol-to-olefins (MTO) unit, which is one production method for light olefins. However, this does not provide enough context to address the specific aspects asked in the question.

The document mentions that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has accepted a new MTO unit with a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes/y, making it the largest single-train MTO unit in the world. This suggests that there is significant demand for olefins in the chemical industry, but does not provide details on applications, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges.

To properly answer this question, more specific information would be needed about the uses of propylene and ethylene, current market demands, various production methods beyond MTO, and the scientific principles involved in their synthesis.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于轻质烯烃对化工行业的贡献、应用、市场趋势、关键生产方法和热力学挑战的问题。唯一相关的信息是简要提到了一个甲醇制烯烃(MTO)装置，这是轻质烯烃的一种生产方法。然而，这并不足以解答问题中提到的具体方面。

文件提到江苏海翼石化有限公司接受了一个新的MTO装置，年产能为83.3万吨，是世界上最大的单线MTO装置。这表明化工行业对烯烃有巨大需求，但没有提供应用、市场趋势或热力学挑战的详细信息。

要正确回答这个问题，需要更多关于丙烯和乙烯用途、当前市场需求、除MTO以外的各种生产方法以及它们合成过程中涉及的科学原理的具体信息。
