[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[1] "For polymerization, Ceresana forecasts the most dynamic development at an AAGR of 3.1%/y until 2021, with the synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene accounting for the major share."

[2] "The shift to lighter cracker feedstock results in reduced volumes of co-products. Therefore the on-purpose production of higher olefins is gaining more and more importance."

[3] "BASF has developed process technology and catalysts as well as the extraction technologies, while Linde is providing its expertise for the integration, optimization, and commercialization of the process. The new process will deliver an on-purpose route from butane to butadiene via butenes."

[4] "About 80% of all the catalysts consumed are utilized in the refining of crude oil, for example in processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, or reforming."

[1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

          [2] "An important step in the manufacture of olefins is large-scale separation of the olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]."

          [3] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

[1] "Selective catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation processes of hydrocarbons comprise approximately one quarter of the value produced by all catalytic processes world wide."

          [2] "More than 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile are produced worldwide by this SOHIO (now BP America) invented process. Acrylonitrile is a versatile petrochemical intermediate used extensively in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers and specialty products."

          [3] "The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile commands the foremost commercial position among all ammoxidation processes"

[1] "Reactions of oxidative transformation of organic compounds of different classes (alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols) with a nontraditional oxidant, carbon dioxide, were studied on oxide catalysts"

[2] "Independently of the greenhouse effect CO2 can be considered as a very important raw material for the chemical industry in the future."

[3] "The oxidative cracking (reactions 20-22) prevails over the oxidative dehydrogenation"

[4] "C4H10 + CO2 = C3H6 + 2CO + 2H2O"

[5] "C4H10 + CO2 = C2H4 + CH4 + 2CO + H2"

[6] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[7] "We have studied (Krylov et al., 1993; Mamedov, 1991; Mamedov et al., 1990a,b, 1992; Mirzabekova et al., 1992a-e, 1993a-d) new reactions of C1-C7 alkane reduction with COZ to olefins and synthesis gas."

[8] "The possibility of ethylene transformation into butadiene allows putting forward a new scheme of its production from natural gas without the use of crude petroleum:"

[9] "The use of manganese-containing catalysts in these reactions provides high conversions both of the oxidized substance and of C02 with a stable activity level during a long period without coke accumulation."

[10] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs. This catalyst is also effective for ethane transformation. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 "C 3600 h-l and COz/ C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion"

[11] "C2H4 conversion of 30.5%, CO2 conversion of 13.7%, C4H6 selectivity of 50.2%, and C3H6 selectivity of 30.6%; C4H8, C2H6, CO, and CH4 were also formed."

[12] "2CH4 + CO2 = C2H6 + CO + H2O"

[13] "C2H6 + CO2 = C2H4 + CO + H2O"

[14] "Ethane conversion of 81-94% and C2-C4 olefin production with the selectivity 76-78% was observed on the Cr-Mn-La-V-O/Al2O3 catalysts at 630-650 °C and with n-C4H10/CO2 = 1-1.2."

[15] "The process can be directed toward the formation of light olefins, light alkanes, and isoalkanes without accumulation of coke at the surface."

[1] "Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) will provide basic design and engineering services for a propylene facility in Jilin City owned by Jilin Chemical (JiHua) Group Corp. The facility will have a 200,000 tonne/y nominal capacity and will utilize KBRs Superflex fluidized catalytic cracking process technology."

          [2] "Dow Chemical is developing a process for making olefins from methane. The methane is reacted"

[1] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."

[2] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."

[3] "However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[4] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

[5] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins."

[6] "For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

[1] "Today, because it is not easy to convert methane into heavier molecules, natural gas (composed largely of methane) is mostly burned for heating and electrical power generation; a tiny fraction is used in vehicles."

[2] "Almost all industrial chemical processing of natural gas is performed with steam. In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."

[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[4] "It would seem that between cracking for olefin production and reforming to make synthesis gas, all of the chemistry needed to make use of natural gas is already available. However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."

[5] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges. Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

[6] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensitive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

[1] "Per year, close to 10 million metric tons of olefins are produced using catalytic dehydrogenation processes."

          [2] "The dehydrogenation of propane is an industrially very important reaction with a relatively short catalyst lifetime."

          [3] "Commonly, a regenerative procedure in air is, therefore, used for the catalyst once every 2030 min. After this regeneration, the catalyst can be re-used for the dehydrogenation."

          [4] "Having a pure alkane feed will drastically decrease the timescale in which changes on the catalyst are taking place (oxidation state and coke formation) compared to our observations."

          [5] "In the propane dehydrogenation the catalyst deactivates fast. Commonly, a regenerative procedure in air is, therefore, used for the catalyst once every 2030 min."

[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

          [2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

          [3] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."

          [4] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[3] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3–0.5 atm and 823–923 K"

[4] "The classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, which leads initially to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front will move through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction."

[5] "Operation is generally at 823–873 K and ~0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm."

[6] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

"The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

"Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the temperature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase."

"Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2."

"In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control. However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."

"For example, at 600 C and with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 reaches 92%, whereas, in the absence of CO2, only 50% conversion is achieved under the same conditions."

"Honeywell announced on March 1, 2018 that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has accepted a new methanol-to-olefins (MTO) unit provided by Honeywell UOP, and that the plant is operating and has met all guarantees. With a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes/y, the unit is the largest single-train MTO unit in the world."

[1] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."

[2] "Dehydrogenation reactions, CnH2n2$CnH2nH2, are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamical equilibrium [51]."

[3] "Theoretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures."

[4] "For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively."

[5] "Conversions can also be increased by using lower pressures or by using diluents with the alkane feed."

[6] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain signicant yields of alkenes"

"Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

"The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."

"Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."

"The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

"According to the ASF model, the maximum selectivity toward C2C4 olefins is achieved with an alpha value between 0.4 and 0.5. One of the most efficient ways of shifting product selectivity to low alpha values is by increasing reaction temperature. However, a decrease on the chain growth probability results in an increase of methane selectivity as indicated by the ASF product distribution."

"Figure 13 displays lower olefins selectivity as a function of temperature for supported catalysts. This graph shows that high CO conversions can be achieved using high reaction temperatures (>300 C). Under these conditions, the selectivity to shorter hydrocarbons is enhanced, increasing lower olefins selectivity but at the same time increasing methane production. The formation of carbon deposits is also favored at high reaction temperatures thus having a negative effect on catalytic activity."

[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking. To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."

[8] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[4] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

[1] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."

          [2] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. Fig. 3 shows the equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of n-paraffins ranging from ethane to pentadecane"

          [3] "For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

          [4] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

          [5] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. Thus, extrapolation directly from heavy olefins to light olefins cannot be done without taking other factors into consideration."

          [6] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."

[1] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons has been the major source of light olefins for more than half a century."

          [2] "The recent studies have reported that ethylene and propylene can also be produced through the cracking of hydrocarbons over modified ZSM-5 zeolites in a considerable amount."

          [3] "This paper highlights the important current ideas about acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon cracking that has resulted in high yield of ethylene and propylene."

          [4] "Light olefin production via catalytic cracking of various industrial feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane, over modified ZSM-5 zeolites, has been reviewed in the present paper."

          [5] "Moreover, the influences of different factors, including the zeolite acidity, Si/Al ratio and the temperature, on the light olefin production and the reaction scheme have been specified."

[1] "Jacobs Engineering has been awarded a contract from Borealis to perform a feasibility study for a proposed propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit at Borealis' existing production site in Kallo, Belgium. The new world-scale PDH, which would be based on Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology, would have a targeted production of 740,000 tonnes/y, making it "one of the largest and most efficient facilities in the world''."

[2] "SBE Chemical Partners, a joint venture between Stonebridge Energy Partners and Evonik Industries, has secured funding, customer and engineering deals for its butene-1 plant in Baytown, TX, US. The 100,000 tonnes/y plant, which will open in 2018, will cost around $200 M. It will employ Axen's AlphaButol technology to produce butane-1 by dimerizing ethylene."

[1] "Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical Co has started up a second propylene plant using Honeywell UOPs C3 Oleflex technology at a new petrochemical complex in China. The new unit has the capacity to produce 450,000 tonne/y of polymer-grade propylene."

          [2] "Honeywell UOPs C3 Oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert propane into propylene."

          [3] "PetroLogistics II has awarded a front-end engineering design (FEED) contract to McDermott, valued at between $1 M and $50 M, for a planned propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit on the US Gulf Coast. The 500,000 tonne/y PDH unit, for which a specific location has not yet been decided, will utilize Dows proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology."

[1] "The conversion of alkanes (a by-product of petroleum processing and present in natural gas) to olefins (ethylene, propylene, butene and butadiene) is in great demand in the chemical industry."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields."

[3] "The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct"

[1] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."

[2] "Cheap natural gas liquids put U.S. producers at a big advantage over European and Asian chemical producers that primarily use petroleum-derived feedstocks such as naphtha."

[3] "According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liquids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."

[4] "ETHYLENE CRACKERS normally have some latitude to change feedstock slates to react to changing market conditions. In recent years, they have been cracking as much ethane as they possibly can."

[5] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to. Those cracker coproducts are in short supply and are becoming increasingly costly."

[6] "Dow recently inked a licensing agreement with Honeywell's UOP engineering unit for a propane dehydrogenation unit that would add 750,000 tons of propylene capacity in Texas by 2015."

[1] "The combination of methanol production using state-of-the-art mega-scale methanol technology and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) technology developed by UOP and Norsk Hydro provides an economically attractive route from natural gas to ethylene and propylene, two large-tonnage, high-value petrochemicals."

[2] "Temperature is an important control variable- higher temperatures are required to increase the proportion of ethylene in the product relative to propylene, but higher temperatures also result in a small reduction in the overall light olefin selectivity."

[3] "Pressure is normally dictated by mechanical considerations, with lower methanol partial pressures resulting in higher overall yields. Thus, some yield advantage can be obtained by using a crude methanol feed that typically may contain around 20 wt% water. On the other hand, increased pressures may be favored for the production of higher propylene ratios."

[4] "The MTO process utilizes a SAPO-34-containing catalyst that provides up to 80% yield of ethylene and propylene at near-complete methanol conversion."

[5] "Reactor operating conditions can be adjusted to the desired product requirements."

[6] "If additional propylene is desired, the production ratio of propylene to ethylene can be further increased by reducing the operating severity of the MTO unit and slightly increasing the size of the OCP unit."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene has become a critical technology to fill the propylene shortage, which is increasing due to the portion of steam crackers now using inexpensive ethane feedstock"

          [2] "Briefly, the main considerations in the catalytic dehydrogenation are the high reaction enthalpy, 30 kcal/mol, and the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. These two factors require the process to operate at high temperatures (>600 C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels."

          [3] "Catalytic dehydrogenation continues to grow in importance for the production of olefins, especially with the availability of inexpensive light paraffin supplies."

          [4] "As evidence, over 5 million tons of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation capacity is expected in the next 5 years."

          [5] "As Vora has pointed out, alumina supported catalysts are preferred for selected paraffin dehydrogenation chemistry"

[1] "UOP Honeywell will licence its propane dehydrogenation technology to Zhejiang Shaoxing Sanjin Petrochemical Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Fuling Holding Group, China. The new facility, which is slated to go online in 2013, will utilize UOPs Oleflex technology to manufacture 450,000 tonne/y of propylene."

          [2] "The Oleflex process employs catalytic dehydrogenation for the conversion of propane to propylene. The process, in comparison with the alternative propane dehydrogenation process, offers lower manufacturing costs and the highest return on investment."

          [3] "Sd-Chemie AG, a Clariant Group company, has announced that its breakthrough in CATOFIN propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyst has been successful in delivering a significant increase in propylene selectivity, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption."

          [4] "The CATOFIN PDH process is a reliable, proven route for the production of propylene from propane; the process can also be used to produce isobutylenes from isobutane."

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[1] "For polymerization, Ceresana forecasts the most dynamic development at an AAGR of 3.1%/y until 2021, with the synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene accounting for the major share."

[2] "The shift to lighter cracker feedstock results in reduced volumes of co-products. Therefore the on-purpose production of higher olefins is gaining more and more importance."

[3] "BASF has developed process technology and catalysts as well as the extraction technologies, while Linde is providing its expertise for the integration, optimization, and commercialization of the process. The new process will deliver an on-purpose route from butane to butadiene via butenes."

[4] "About 80% of all the catalysts consumed are utilized in the refining of crude oil, for example in processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, or reforming."

[1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

          [2] "An important step in the manufacture of olefins is large-scale separation of the olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]."

          [3] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

[1] "Selective catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation processes of hydrocarbons comprise approximately one quarter of the value produced by all catalytic processes world wide."

          [2] "More than 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile are produced worldwide by this SOHIO (now BP America) invented process. Acrylonitrile is a versatile petrochemical intermediate used extensively in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers and specialty products."

          [3] "The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile commands the foremost commercial position among all ammoxidation processes"

[6] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[7] "We have studied (Krylov et al., 1993; Mamedov, 1991; Mamedov et al., 1990a,b, 1992; Mirzabekova et al., 1992a-e, 1993a-d) new reactions of C1-C7 alkane reduction with COZ to olefins and synthesis gas."

[8] "The possibility of ethylene transformation into butadiene allows putting forward a new scheme of its production from natural gas without the use of crude petroleum:"

[9] "The use of manganese-containing catalysts in these reactions provides high conversions both of the oxidized substance and of C02 with a stable activity level during a long period without coke accumulation."

[10] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs. This catalyst is also effective for ethane transformation. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 "C 3600 h-l and COz/ C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion"

[11] "C2H4 conversion of 30.5%, CO2 conversion of 13.7%, C4H6 selectivity of 50.2%, and C3H6 selectivity of 30.6%; C4H8, C2H6, CO, and CH4 were also formed."

[12] "2CH4 + CO2 = C2H6 + CO + H2O"

[13] "C2H6 + CO2 = C2H4 + CO + H2O"

[14] "Ethane conversion of 81-94% and C2-C4 olefin production with the selectivity 76-78% was observed on the Cr-Mn-La-V-O/Al2O3 catalysts at 630-650 °C and with n-C4H10/CO2 = 1-1.2."

[15] "The process can be directed toward the formation of light olefins, light alkanes, and isoalkanes without accumulation of coke at the surface."

[1] "Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) will provide basic design and engineering services for a propylene facility in Jilin City owned by Jilin Chemical (JiHua) Group Corp. The facility will have a 200,000 tonne/y nominal capacity and will utilize KBRs Superflex fluidized catalytic cracking process technology."

          [2] "Dow Chemical is developing a process for making olefins from methane. The methane is reacted"

[1] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."

[2] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."

[3] "However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[4] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

[5] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins."

[6] "For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

[1] "Today, because it is not easy to convert methane into heavier molecules, natural gas (composed largely of methane) is mostly burned for heating and electrical power generation; a tiny fraction is used in vehicles."

[2] "Almost all industrial chemical processing of natural gas is performed with steam. In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."

[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[4] "It would seem that between cracking for olefin production and reforming to make synthesis gas, all of the chemistry needed to make use of natural gas is already available. However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."

[5] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges. Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

[6] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensitive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

[1] "Per year, close to 10 million metric tons of olefins are produced using catalytic dehydrogenation processes."

          [2] "The dehydrogenation of propane is an industrially very important reaction with a relatively short catalyst lifetime."

          [3] "Commonly, a regenerative procedure in air is, therefore, used for the catalyst once every 2030 min. After this regeneration, the catalyst can be re-used for the dehydrogenation."

          [4] "Having a pure alkane feed will drastically decrease the timescale in which changes on the catalyst are taking place (oxidation state and coke formation) compared to our observations."

          [5] "In the propane dehydrogenation the catalyst deactivates fast. Commonly, a regenerative procedure in air is, therefore, used for the catalyst once every 2030 min."

[1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

          [2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

          [3] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."

          [4] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[3] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3–0.5 atm and 823–923 K"

[4] "The classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, which leads initially to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front will move through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction."

[5] "Operation is generally at 823–873 K and ~0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm."

[6] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

"The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

"Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the temperature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase."

"Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2."

"In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control. However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."

"For example, at 600 C and with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 reaches 92%, whereas, in the absence of CO2, only 50% conversion is achieved under the same conditions."

"Honeywell announced on March 1, 2018 that Jiangsu Sailboat Petrochemical Company Ltd has accepted a new methanol-to-olefins (MTO) unit provided by Honeywell UOP, and that the plant is operating and has met all guarantees. With a production capacity of 833,000 tonnes/y, the unit is the largest single-train MTO unit in the world."

[1] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."

[2] "Dehydrogenation reactions, CnH2n2$CnH2nH2, are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamical equilibrium [51]."

[3] "Theoretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures."

[4] "For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively."

[5] "Conversions can also be increased by using lower pressures or by using diluents with the alkane feed."

[6] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain signicant yields of alkenes"

"Ethylene, propylene, and butylenes are key building blocks in the chemical industry. Throughout this review we refer to C2C4 olefins as lower or light olefins. These base chemicals are among the organic chemicals with the largest production volumes worldwide (Table 1). Their broad spectrum of derivatives result in a very diverse end market ranging from packing materials and synthetic textiles to antifreezing agents, solvents, and coatings."

"The constantly growing demand for lower olefins has caused the global production capacity to double over the past 15 years. During 2008 and 2009, ethylene demand decreased due to the slow global economic growth; nevertheless, analysts predict that the demand will grow after 2012 (Figure 3)."

"Commercial ethylene production is mainly based on steam cracking of a broad range of hydrocarbon feedstocks. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking of naphtha, gas oil, and condensates, while in the U.S., Canada, and the Middle East ethylene is produced by cracking of ethane and propane."

"The production of lower olefins via steam cracking is one of the ten most energy-consuming processes of the chemical and petrochemical industry."

"According to the ASF model, the maximum selectivity toward C2C4 olefins is achieved with an alpha value between 0.4 and 0.5. One of the most efficient ways of shifting product selectivity to low alpha values is by increasing reaction temperature. However, a decrease on the chain growth probability results in an increase of methane selectivity as indicated by the ASF product distribution."

"Figure 13 displays lower olefins selectivity as a function of temperature for supported catalysts. This graph shows that high CO conversions can be achieved using high reaction temperatures (>300 C). Under these conditions, the selectivity to shorter hydrocarbons is enhanced, increasing lower olefins selectivity but at the same time increasing methane production. The formation of carbon deposits is also favored at high reaction temperatures thus having a negative effect on catalytic activity."

[1] "Light alkenes are among the most important intermediate products in the chemical industry. For example, in 2003, the worldwide production of ethene was 100 × 106 t and approximately 56 × 106 t for propene [1]."

[2] "Ethene is primarily used for the production of polymers, especially polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) or precursors of other polymer compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane/vinyl chloride as a precursor of PVC, ethylbenzene/styrene as a precursor of polystyrene or ethylene oxide as a precursor of ethylene glycols or polyethoxylates."

[3] "Propene is also important for the production of polymers, mainly for the production of polypropylene (PP), but also in the production of cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid/acrolein or propylene oxide [2]."

[4] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons is the most important process for the production of light alkenes. World-scale steam crackers have the capacity to produce more than 106 t per annum of ethene."

[5] "Another source of low alkenes, especially propene, is catalytic cracking in the form of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)."

[6] "In 2002, approximately 61% of propene production was via steam cracking and approximately 34% was obtained by catalytic cracking. To cover the continuously increasing demand for propene, it was also necessary to generate about another 3% by catalytic dehydrogenation of propane [3]."

[7] "An increase in the share of the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in the overall production of propene can be expected."

[8] "Figure 1 shows the equilibrium conversion for selected alkanes as a function of reaction temperature. To achieve technically relevant conversions of 30–50%, reaction temperatures of 825–975 K are required for propane and 775–825 K are correspondingly required for isobutane. As the carbon number of the alkanes to be dehydrogenated increases, the reaction temperature falls."

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[4] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

[1] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."

          [2] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. Fig. 3 shows the equilibrium constant for the dehydrogenation of n-paraffins ranging from ethane to pentadecane"

          [3] "For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

          [4] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

          [5] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. Thus, extrapolation directly from heavy olefins to light olefins cannot be done without taking other factors into consideration."

          [6] "Although production of ethylene via catalytic dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts is very selective (about 95%), extension of this dehydrogenation technology to ethane has not taken place due to the need for even more severe operating conditions; higher temperatures and lower pressures."

[1] "Steam cracking of hydrocarbons has been the major source of light olefins for more than half a century."

          [2] "The recent studies have reported that ethylene and propylene can also be produced through the cracking of hydrocarbons over modified ZSM-5 zeolites in a considerable amount."

          [3] "This paper highlights the important current ideas about acid-catalyzed hydrocarbon cracking that has resulted in high yield of ethylene and propylene."

          [4] "Light olefin production via catalytic cracking of various industrial feedstocks, ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane, over modified ZSM-5 zeolites, has been reviewed in the present paper."

          [5] "Moreover, the influences of different factors, including the zeolite acidity, Si/Al ratio and the temperature, on the light olefin production and the reaction scheme have been specified."

[1] "Jacobs Engineering has been awarded a contract from Borealis to perform a feasibility study for a proposed propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit at Borealis' existing production site in Kallo, Belgium. The new world-scale PDH, which would be based on Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology, would have a targeted production of 740,000 tonnes/y, making it "one of the largest and most efficient facilities in the world''."

[2] "SBE Chemical Partners, a joint venture between Stonebridge Energy Partners and Evonik Industries, has secured funding, customer and engineering deals for its butene-1 plant in Baytown, TX, US. The 100,000 tonnes/y plant, which will open in 2018, will cost around $200 M. It will employ Axen's AlphaButol technology to produce butane-1 by dimerizing ethylene."

[1] "Zhejiang Satellite Petrochemical Co has started up a second propylene plant using Honeywell UOPs C3 Oleflex technology at a new petrochemical complex in China. The new unit has the capacity to produce 450,000 tonne/y of polymer-grade propylene."

          [2] "Honeywell UOPs C3 Oleflex technology uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert propane into propylene."

          [3] "PetroLogistics II has awarded a front-end engineering design (FEED) contract to McDermott, valued at between $1 M and $50 M, for a planned propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit on the US Gulf Coast. The 500,000 tonne/y PDH unit, for which a specific location has not yet been decided, will utilize Dows proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation technology."

[1] "The conversion of alkanes (a by-product of petroleum processing and present in natural gas) to olefins (ethylene, propylene, butene and butadiene) is in great demand in the chemical industry."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields."

[3] "The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct"

[1] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."

[2] "Cheap natural gas liquids put U.S. producers at a big advantage over European and Asian chemical producers that primarily use petroleum-derived feedstocks such as naphtha."

[3] "According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liquids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."

[4] "ETHYLENE CRACKERS normally have some latitude to change feedstock slates to react to changing market conditions. In recent years, they have been cracking as much ethane as they possibly can."

[5] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to. Those cracker coproducts are in short supply and are becoming increasingly costly."

[6] "Dow recently inked a licensing agreement with Honeywell's UOP engineering unit for a propane dehydrogenation unit that would add 750,000 tons of propylene capacity in Texas by 2015."

[1] "The combination of methanol production using state-of-the-art mega-scale methanol technology and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) technology developed by UOP and Norsk Hydro provides an economically attractive route from natural gas to ethylene and propylene, two large-tonnage, high-value petrochemicals."

[2] "Temperature is an important control variable- higher temperatures are required to increase the proportion of ethylene in the product relative to propylene, but higher temperatures also result in a small reduction in the overall light olefin selectivity."

[3] "Pressure is normally dictated by mechanical considerations, with lower methanol partial pressures resulting in higher overall yields. Thus, some yield advantage can be obtained by using a crude methanol feed that typically may contain around 20 wt% water. On the other hand, increased pressures may be favored for the production of higher propylene ratios."

[4] "The MTO process utilizes a SAPO-34-containing catalyst that provides up to 80% yield of ethylene and propylene at near-complete methanol conversion."

[5] "Reactor operating conditions can be adjusted to the desired product requirements."

[6] "If additional propylene is desired, the production ratio of propylene to ethylene can be further increased by reducing the operating severity of the MTO unit and slightly increasing the size of the OCP unit."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene has become a critical technology to fill the propylene shortage, which is increasing due to the portion of steam crackers now using inexpensive ethane feedstock"

          [2] "Briefly, the main considerations in the catalytic dehydrogenation are the high reaction enthalpy, 30 kcal/mol, and the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations. These two factors require the process to operate at high temperatures (>600 C) and lower pressures (<30 psig) to achieve economic conversion levels."

          [3] "Catalytic dehydrogenation continues to grow in importance for the production of olefins, especially with the availability of inexpensive light paraffin supplies."

          [4] "As evidence, over 5 million tons of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation capacity is expected in the next 5 years."

          [5] "As Vora has pointed out, alumina supported catalysts are preferred for selected paraffin dehydrogenation chemistry"

[1] "UOP Honeywell will licence its propane dehydrogenation technology to Zhejiang Shaoxing Sanjin Petrochemical Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Fuling Holding Group, China. The new facility, which is slated to go online in 2013, will utilize UOPs Oleflex technology to manufacture 450,000 tonne/y of propylene."

          [2] "The Oleflex process employs catalytic dehydrogenation for the conversion of propane to propylene. The process, in comparison with the alternative propane dehydrogenation process, offers lower manufacturing costs and the highest return on investment."

          [3] "Sd-Chemie AG, a Clariant Group company, has announced that its breakthrough in CATOFIN propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyst has been successful in delivering a significant increase in propylene selectivity, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption."

          [4] "The CATOFIN PDH process is a reliable, proven route for the production of propylene from propane; the process can also be used to produce isobutylenes from isobutane."
