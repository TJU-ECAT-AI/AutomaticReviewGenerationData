          [1] "In the petrochemical industry, olefins such as ethylene and propylene are the most important chemicals used for the production of polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol."

          [2] "An important step in the manufacture of olefins is large-scale separation of the olefin from the corresponding paraffin [6]."

          [3] "Currently, this separation is carried out by cryogenic distillation, which is highly energy-intensive due to the cryogenic temperatures required for the process and low relative volatilities of components. Distillation columns are often up to 300 ft tall and typically contain over 200 trays. With reflux ratios greater than 10, a very high energy input is required for the distillation process."

          Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of important chemicals and materials including polyethylene, polypropylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, ethylene dichloride, acrylonitrile, and isopropanol. These products have extensive applications across many industries.

          The primary production method for light olefins is steam cracking, followed by separation from paraffins via cryogenic distillation. This separation process faces significant thermodynamic challenges due to the similar boiling points of olefins and paraffins. It requires extremely low temperatures and very tall distillation columns (up to 300 ft) with over 200 trays. The process is highly energy-intensive, with high reflux ratios exceeding 10.

          The difficulty of separation increases with increasing carbon chain length, as the boiling points become even closer. This makes propylene/propane separation more challenging than ethylene/ethane. High pressures are generally avoided as they reduce the relative volatility further. The high energy requirements and capital costs of the current cryogenic distillation process have driven research into alternative separation methods like membrane technology.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是石油化工行业的关键原料。它们被用于生产多种重要的化学品和材料，包括聚乙烯、聚丙烯、苯乙烯、乙苯、二氯乙烷、丙烯腈和异丙醇。这些产品在许多行业中有广泛的应用。

          生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解，随后通过低温蒸馏将烯烃从烷烃中分离出来。由于烯烃和烷烃的沸点相近，这一分离过程面临着重大的热力学挑战。它需要极低的温度和非常高的蒸馏塔（高达300英尺），塔内有超过200个塔板。这个过程非常耗能，回流比高达10以上。

          随着碳链长度的增加，分离难度也会增加，因为沸点会变得更加接近。这使得丙烯/丙烷的分离比乙烯/乙烷更具挑战性。通常避免使用高压，因为它会进一步降低相对挥发度。目前低温蒸馏工艺的高能耗和高资本成本推动了对膜技术等替代分离方法的研究。
