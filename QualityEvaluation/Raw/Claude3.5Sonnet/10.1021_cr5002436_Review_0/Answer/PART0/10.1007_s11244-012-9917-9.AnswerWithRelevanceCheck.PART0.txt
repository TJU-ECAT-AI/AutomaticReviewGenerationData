          [1] "Ethylene and propylene are No.1 and No.2 largest volume petrochemical intermediates. Figure 1 shows worldwide demand of ethylene and propylene and growth from 1990 to 2010 [1]."

[2] "For ethylene thermal cracking of ethane, LPG and heavier feedstocks continues to be the primary route. Thermal cracking of LPG or heavier feedstocks also provide significant quantity of propylene byproduct."

[3] "However, over the past two decades propylene growth rate has out-paced these conventional supply routes leading to construction of number of commercial units for selective catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

[4] "Paraffin dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that is limited by chemical equilibrium and, according to Le Chateliers principle, higher conversion will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures."

[5] "The equilibrium constant for paraffin dehydrogenation increases significantly as the carbon number increases. The temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins."

[6] "For example, at 1 atm absolute pressure for 40 % conversion, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

          Light olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene, are the two largest volume petrochemical intermediates globally, with significant demand growth from 1990 to 2010. They have extensive applications in the chemical industry.

Main production methods:
1. Thermal cracking of ethane, LPG, and heavier feedstocks (primary route for ethylene, also produces propylene as byproduct)
2. Fluid catalytic cracking in refineries (produces propylene as byproduct)
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (growing route for propylene production)

Key thermodynamic challenges in synthesizing light olefins through dehydrogenation include:
1. Endothermic reaction limited by chemical equilibrium
2. Higher temperatures or lower pressures required for higher conversion (Le Chatelier's principle)
3. Light paraffins require much higher temperatures than heavy paraffins for dehydrogenation
4. Equilibrium constant increases with increasing carbon number

For example, at 1 atm pressure and 40% conversion, propane dehydrogenation needs at least 580°C, while dodecane only requires 450°C. These factors make light olefin production more challenging than heavier olefins, requiring careful reactor and process design to overcome thermodynamic limitations and achieve economically viable yields.

          轻质烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯，是全球产量最大的两种石油化工中间体，从1990年到2010年需求增长显著。它们在化工行业有广泛的应用。

主要生产方法：
1. 乙烷、液化石油气和重质原料的热裂解（乙烯的主要途径，同时也生产丙烯副产品）
2. 炼油厂的流化催化裂化（生产丙烯副产品）
3. 丙烷的催化脱氢（丙烯生产的增长途径）

通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃的主要热力学挑战包括：
1. 吸热反应受化学平衡限制
2. 需要更高的温度或更低的压力才能获得更高的转化率（勒夏特列原理）
3. 轻质烷烃的脱氢需要比重质烷烃高得多的温度
4. 平衡常数随碳数增加而增加

例如，在1个大气压下，40%转化率时丙烷脱氢需要至少580°C，而十二烷只需450°C。这些因素使得轻质烯烃的生产比重质烯烃更具挑战性，需要精心设计反应器和工艺来克服热力学限制并实现经济可行的产率。
