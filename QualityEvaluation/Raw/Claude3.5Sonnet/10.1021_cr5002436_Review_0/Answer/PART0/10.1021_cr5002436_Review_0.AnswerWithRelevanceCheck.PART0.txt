          [1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[4] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

          Light olefins, particularly propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry as essential building blocks for a wide range of products. They are used as feedstocks for producing polymers (like polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (such as ethylene glycol and acetone), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene).

The market trends show a steady increase in demand for these light olefins, with positive growth observed in most major markets, except for the Eurozone due to recent economic challenges.

The primary production methods for light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. Another important method is the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is a one-step reaction converting paraffins into olefins and hydrogen.

However, the synthesis of light olefins through dehydrogenation faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures (550-750°C) and low paraffin partial pressures to achieve high conversions. This is in line with Le Chatelier's principle, which states that higher temperatures and lower pressures favor the formation of products in endothermic reactions.

The thermodynamic challenges vary with alkane chain length. The enthalpy required for dehydrogenation decreases as the chain length increases (e.g., 137 kJ/mol for ethane, 124.3 kJ/mol for propane, and 117.6 kJ/mol for isobutane). However, on a mass basis, dehydrogenating lighter paraffins requires more energy.

These thermodynamic constraints necessitate careful control of reaction conditions and catalyst design to optimize olefin yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and coke formation, which are favored at the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation.

          轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和乙烯，作为重要的化学建筑模块，在化工行业中扮演着至关重要的角色。它们被用作生产多种产品的原料，包括聚合物（如聚乙烯和聚丙烯）、含氧化合物（如乙二醇和丙酮）以及重要的化学中间体（如乙苯）。

市场趋势显示，这些轻质烯烃的需求持续增长，除了因经济因素影响的欧元区外，大多数主要市场都呈现出正增长。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是对石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品进行蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）。另一个重要方法是轻质烷烃的脱氢，这是一种将烷烃转化为烯烃和氢气的一步反应。

然而，通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃面临着显著的热力学挑战。这个反应是高度吸热的，并且受到热力学限制，需要高温（550-750°C）和低烷烃分压才能达到高转化率。这符合勒夏特列原理，该原理指出，在吸热反应中，较高的温度和较低的压力有利于产物的形成。

热力学挑战随着烷烃链长的变化而变化。随着链长的增加，脱氢所需的焓值减小（例如，乙烷为137 kJ/mol，丙烷为124.3 kJ/mol，异丁烷为117.6 kJ/mol）。然而，以质量为基础，脱氢轻质烷烃需要更多的能量。

这些热力学约束要求仔细控制反应条件和催化剂设计，以优化烯烃产率，同时最大限度地减少不需要的副反应和焦炭形成，这些在脱氢所需的高温下很容易发生。
