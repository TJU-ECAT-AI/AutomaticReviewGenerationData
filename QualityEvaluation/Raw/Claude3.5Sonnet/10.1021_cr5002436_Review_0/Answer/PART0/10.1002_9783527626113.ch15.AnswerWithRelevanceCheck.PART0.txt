          [1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[3] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3–0.5 atm and 823–923 K"

[4] "The classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, which leads initially to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front will move through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction."

[5] "Operation is generally at 823–873 K and ~0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm."

[6] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

          Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, used to produce a wide range of polymers, plastics, and other chemical products. While the provided literature does not directly address current applications and market trends, it offers insights into their production methods and associated thermodynamic challenges:

1. Production Method: The main production method discussed is catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, which has been known since the 1930s and uses chromia catalysts.

2. Thermodynamic Challenges:
   a) The reaction is highly endothermic, requiring substantial energy input. For example, propane dehydrogenation to propene has a ΔH298° of +110 kJ mol−1.
   b) It is equilibrium-limited at lower temperatures, necessitating high reaction temperatures (typically 823-923 K) to achieve reasonable conversions.
   c) Low pressures (0.3-0.5 atm) are used to shift the equilibrium towards products and achieve higher per-pass conversion.

3. Temperature and Pressure Effects: The challenges increase with shorter alkane chain length, as implied by the use of higher temperatures for propane dehydrogenation compared to butane. For instance, isobutane to isobutene conversion typically occurs at 923 K and 0.5 atm.

4. Reactor Design: The endothermic nature of the reaction causes temperature gradients in the reactor, with the inlet being hotter than the outlet. This requires careful heat management in industrial processes.

5. Historical Application: During World War II, butane dehydrogenation was used to produce butenes, which were further processed into high-octane aviation fuel, highlighting an early application of this technology.

These thermodynamic constraints necessitate careful reactor and process design to achieve economically viable olefin production. Despite these challenges, dehydrogenation processes have been commercially important for decades, underlining the value of light olefins in the chemical industry.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料,用于生产多种聚合物、塑料和其他化学产品。尽管所提供的文献没有直接讨论当前的应用和市场趋势,但它提供了有关其生产方法和相关热力学挑战的见解:

1. 生产方法:讨论的主要生产方法是轻质烷烃的催化脱氢,这种方法自20世纪30年代就已知,并使用铬催化剂。

2. 热力学挑战:
   a) 反应是高度吸热的,需要大量能量输入。例如,丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的ΔH298°为+110 kJ mol−1。
   b) 在较低温度下受平衡限制,需要高反应温度(通常为823-923 K)才能达到合理的转化率。
   c) 使用低压(0.3-0.5 atm)来将平衡向产物方向移动,实现更高的单程转化率。

3. 温度和压力影响:随着烷烃链长的缩短,这些挑战会增加,这从丙烷脱氢比丁烷使用更高温度可以看出。例如,异丁烷到异丁烯的转化通常在923 K和0.5 atm下进行。

4. 反应器设计:反应的吸热性质导致反应器内存在温度梯度,入口温度高于出口温度。这要求在工业过程中进行仔细的热量管理。

5. 历史应用:在第二次世界大战期间,丁烷脱氢被用来生产丁烯,这些丁烯进一步被加工成高辛烷值航空燃料,突显了这项技术的早期应用。

这些热力学限制需要仔细的反应器和工艺设计,以实现经济可行的烯烃生产。尽管存在这些挑战,脱氢工艺几十年来一直具有商业重要性,凸显了轻质烯烃在化工行业的价值。
