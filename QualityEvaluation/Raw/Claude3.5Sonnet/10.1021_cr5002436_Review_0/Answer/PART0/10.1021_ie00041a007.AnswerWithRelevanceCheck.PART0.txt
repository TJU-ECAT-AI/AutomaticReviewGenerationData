          [1] "Reactions of oxidative transformation of organic compounds of different classes (alkanes, alkenes, and alcohols) with a nontraditional oxidant, carbon dioxide, were studied on oxide catalysts"

[2] "Independently of the greenhouse effect CO2 can be considered as a very important raw material for the chemical industry in the future."

[3] "The oxidative cracking (reactions 20-22) prevails over the oxidative dehydrogenation"

[4] "C4H10 + CO2 = C3H6 + 2CO + 2H2O"

[5] "C4H10 + CO2 = C2H4 + CH4 + 2CO + H2"

[6] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."

[7] "We have studied (Krylov et al., 1993; Mamedov, 1991; Mamedov et al., 1990a,b, 1992; Mirzabekova et al., 1992a-e, 1993a-d) new reactions of C1-C7 alkane reduction with COZ to olefins and synthesis gas."

[8] "The possibility of ethylene transformation into butadiene allows putting forward a new scheme of its production from natural gas without the use of crude petroleum:"

[9] "The use of manganese-containing catalysts in these reactions provides high conversions both of the oxidized substance and of C02 with a stable activity level during a long period without coke accumulation."

[10] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with C02 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOs. This catalyst is also effective for ethane transformation. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 "C 3600 h-l and COz/ C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion"

[11] "C2H4 conversion of 30.5%, CO2 conversion of 13.7%, C4H6 selectivity of 50.2%, and C3H6 selectivity of 30.6%; C4H8, C2H6, CO, and CH4 were also formed."

[12] "2CH4 + CO2 = C2H6 + CO + H2O"

[13] "C2H6 + CO2 = C2H4 + CO + H2O"

[14] "Ethane conversion of 81-94% and C2-C4 olefin production with the selectivity 76-78% was observed on the Cr-Mn-La-V-O/Al2O3 catalysts at 630-650 °C and with n-C4H10/CO2 = 1-1.2."

[15] "The process can be directed toward the formation of light olefins, light alkanes, and isoalkanes without accumulation of coke at the surface."

          Light olefins such as propylene and ethylene are important raw materials for the chemical industry. While the literature does not provide specific details on their applications or market trends, it discusses several aspects of their production and associated challenges:

1. Production methods:
   - Oxidative transformation of alkanes and alkenes using carbon dioxide as an oxidant over oxide catalysts.
   - Reactions of C1-C7 alkane reduction with CO2 to produce olefins and synthesis gas.
   - A new scheme for producing ethylene from natural gas and then converting it to butadiene, without using crude petroleum.

2. Catalysts:
   - Manganese oxide-based catalysts are highlighted for not forming carbon layers during reactions.
   - Manganese-containing catalysts provide high conversions of both the oxidized substance and CO2 with stable activity over long periods without coke accumulation.
   - The best catalyst for selective propane conversion is 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2, which is also effective for ethane transformation.
   - Cr-Mn-La-V-O/Al2O3 catalysts show high activity for C2-C4 olefin production from butane.

3. Reaction conditions and thermodynamic challenges:
   - High temperatures are required, e.g., 830°C for propane conversion and 630-650°C for butane conversion.
   - The CO2 to alkane ratio affects product distribution, with ratios around 1-1.5 mentioned for various reactions.
   - Oxidative cracking prevails over oxidative dehydrogenation for higher alkanes.
   - Multiple products are formed during reactions, indicating challenges in achieving high selectivity.

4. Performance metrics:
   - 73% yield of C2-C3 olefins at 96% propane conversion using the best catalyst.
   - Ethane conversion of 81-94% and C2-C4 olefin production with 76-78% selectivity on Cr-Mn-La-V-O/Al2O3 catalysts.
   - Ethylene conversion of 30.5% with 50.2% selectivity to butadiene and 30.6% to propylene.

The literature demonstrates ongoing research into alternative production methods for light olefins, likely driven by economic and environmental factors. While not providing comprehensive information on industrial applications and market trends, it suggests potential new pathways for olefin production that could impact the industry.
