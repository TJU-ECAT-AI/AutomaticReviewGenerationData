          [1] "Selective catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation processes of hydrocarbons comprise approximately one quarter of the value produced by all catalytic processes world wide."

          [2] "More than 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile are produced worldwide by this SOHIO (now BP America) invented process. Acrylonitrile is a versatile petrochemical intermediate used extensively in the production of acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers and specialty products."

          [3] "The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile commands the foremost commercial position among all ammoxidation processes"

          [4] "CH2CHCH3 + NH3 + 3/2O2 (air) → catalyst CH2CHCN + 3H2O"

          The literature provides limited information on light olefins in general, focusing primarily on propylene and its ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. Propylene contributes significantly to the chemical industry through its conversion to acrylonitrile, which is a versatile petrochemical intermediate. Acrylonitrile is extensively used in producing acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products. The global production of acrylonitrile exceeds 10 billion pounds annually.

          The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is described as the foremost commercial ammoxidation process, indicating its importance in the industry. The reaction involves propylene, ammonia, and oxygen (from air) reacting over a catalyst to form acrylonitrile and water.

          More broadly, selective catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation processes of hydrocarbons, which include reactions involving light olefins like propylene, account for approximately 25% of the value produced by all catalytic processes worldwide. This underscores the significant economic contribution of light olefins to the chemical industry.

          However, the document does not provide information on ethylene, other production methods for light olefins, or thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects in their synthesis. It also lacks details on market trends for light olefins in general.

          该文献对轻质烯烃的整体信息有限，主要集中在丙烯及其氨氧化制备丙烯腈上。丙烯通过转化为丙烯腈对化学工业做出了重大贡献，丙烯腈是一种用途广泛的石油化工中间体。丙烯腈广泛用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品。全球丙烯腈的年产量超过100亿磅。

          丙烯氨氧化制备丙烯腈被描述为最重要的商业氨氧化工艺，显示了其在行业中的重要性。该反应涉及丙烯、氨和氧气（来自空气）在催化剂上反应形成丙烯腈和水。

          更广泛地说，包括涉及丙烯等轻质烯烃在内的碳氢化合物的选择性催化氧化和氨氧化过程，约占全球所有催化过程产生价值的25%。这凸显了轻质烯烃对化学工业的重大经济贡献。

          然而，该文档没有提供关于乙烯、轻质烯烃的其他生产方法，或与其合成相关的温度、压力或烷烃链长效应的热力学挑战的信息。它也缺乏有关轻质烯烃整体市场趋势的详细信息。
