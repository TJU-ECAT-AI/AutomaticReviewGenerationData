          [1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe"

[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[5] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

          Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry, with demand expected to grow significantly. They are primarily used to produce various polymers and chemical intermediates. The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation.

Market trends:
1. Demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly.
2. Propylene demand is growing faster than ethylene, particularly in Western Europe.
3. There is a mismatch between current production capabilities and market demand, driving research into alternative production methods.

Production methods and challenges:
1. Steam cracking: Favors ethylene production over propylene.
2. Fluid catalytic cracking: Produces smaller amounts of propylene.
3. Catalytic dehydrogenation: Faces thermodynamic constraints and catalyst coking issues.

Thermodynamic challenges:
1. Dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium.
2. Higher temperatures are needed for shorter alkane chains, but this can lead to undesired side reactions and coke formation.
3. Lower pressures generally favor olefin formation.
4. As alkane chain length increases, dehydrogenation becomes more thermodynamically favorable but also more complex due to increased side reactions.

Research directions:
1. Development of more effective catalysts with high activity for alkane conversion and selectivity to desired olefins.
2. Exploration of alternative production methods like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to overcome thermodynamic limitations and improve energy efficiency.
3. Investigation of various catalyst compositions and reactor configurations to address challenges in existing production methods.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料，预计需求将显著增长。它们主要用于生产各种聚合物和化学中间体。生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解（FCC）和催化脱氢。

市场趋势：
1. 烯烃，特别是乙烯和丙烯的需求预计将显著增加。
2. 丙烯的需求增长速度快于乙烯，尤其是在西欧地区。
3. 当前生产能力与市场需求之间存在不匹配，推动了对替代生产方法的研究。

生产方法和挑战：
1. 蒸汽裂解：更倾向于生产乙烯而非丙烯。
2. 流化催化裂解：产生较少量的丙烯。
3. 催化脱氢：面临热力学限制和催化剂结焦问题。

热力学挑战：
1. 脱氢反应是吸热的，并受热力学平衡限制。
2. 较短的烷烃链需要更高的温度，但这可能导致不希望的副反应和焦炭形成。
3. 较低的压力通常有利于烯烃的形成。
4. 随着烷烃链长的增加，脱氢在热力学上变得更有利，但由于副反应增加，过程也变得更复杂。

研究方向：
1. 开发更有效的催化剂，具有高活性的烷烃转化和对所需烯烃的选择性。
2. 探索替代生产方法，如氧化脱氢（ODH），以克服热力学限制并提高能源效率。
3. 研究各种催化剂组成和反应器配置，以解决现有生产方法中的挑战。
