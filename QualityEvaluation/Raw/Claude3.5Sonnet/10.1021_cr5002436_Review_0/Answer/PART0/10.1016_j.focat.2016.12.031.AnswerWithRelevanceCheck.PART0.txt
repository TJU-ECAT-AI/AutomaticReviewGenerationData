          [1] "Jacobs Engineering has been awarded a contract from Borealis to perform a feasibility study for a proposed propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit at Borealis' existing production site in Kallo, Belgium. The new world-scale PDH, which would be based on Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology, would have a targeted production of 740,000 tonnes/y, making it "one of the largest and most efficient facilities in the world''."

[2] "SBE Chemical Partners, a joint venture between Stonebridge Energy Partners and Evonik Industries, has secured funding, customer and engineering deals for its butene-1 plant in Baytown, TX, US. The 100,000 tonnes/y plant, which will open in 2018, will cost around $200 M. It will employ Axen's AlphaButol technology to produce butane-1 by dimerizing ethylene."

          Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important in the chemical industry, as evidenced by significant investments in production facilities. A world-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) unit is being considered in Belgium, with a targeted production of 740,000 tonnes/year of propylene, indicating strong market demand. Ethylene is also valuable, shown by a planned 100,000 tonnes/year butene-1 plant in Texas that will use ethylene as feedstock. This plant will employ dimerization technology to convert ethylene into butene-1, demonstrating one application of ethylene in producing higher olefins. Two specific production technologies are mentioned: Honeywell UOP's Oleflex technology for propane dehydrogenation and Axen's AlphaButol technology for ethylene dimerization. These examples highlight the importance of catalytic processes in olefin production. However, the document does not provide information on thermodynamic challenges, temperature and pressure effects, or the influence of alkane chain length on olefin synthesis.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯在化工行业中非常重要，这从对生产设施的重大投资可以看出。在比利时正在考虑建设一个世界级规模的丙烷脱氢(PDH)装置，目标年产量为74万吨丙烯，表明市场对丙烯有强劲的需求。乙烯也很有价值，这从计划在德克萨斯州建设的年产10万吨的丁烯-1工厂可以看出，该工厂将使用乙烯作为原料。该工厂将采用二聚化技术将乙烯转化为丁烯-1，展示了乙烯在生产高级烯烃中的一种应用。文献提到了两种具体技术：霍尼韦尔UOP的Oleflex技术用于丙烷脱氢和Axen的AlphaButol技术用于乙烯二聚化。这些例子突出了催化过程在烯烃生产中的重要性。然而，该文档没有提供关于热力学挑战、温度和压力效应，或烷烃链长对烯烃合成影响的信息。
