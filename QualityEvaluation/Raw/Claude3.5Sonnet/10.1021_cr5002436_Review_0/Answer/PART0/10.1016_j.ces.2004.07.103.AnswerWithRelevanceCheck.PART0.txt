          [1] "Over the past decade the demand for propene has increased significantly, outgrowing the quantity that can be supplied by the conventional sources, ethane steam crackers and FCCs (fluidized catalytic crackers)"

          [2] "Consequently, the dehydrogenation of propane is becoming more attractive."

          [3] "The process is run at a temperature of around 850 K and a subatmospheric pressure of 0.20.5 bar."

          [4] "During the dehydrogenation cycle the catalyst activity changes because of two main reasons: the formation of coke on the catalyst and the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)."

          Light olefins like propylene have seen significantly increased demand over the past decade, outpacing supply from conventional sources like steam crackers and fluid catalytic crackers (FCCs). This has made propane dehydrogenation an increasingly attractive production method.

          Key production methods for propylene include:
          1. Ethane steam cracking
          2. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC)
          3. Propane dehydrogenation

          Thermodynamic challenges in propane dehydrogenation include:
          - High temperatures (around 850 K)
          - Low pressures (subatmospheric, 0.2-0.5 bar)
          - Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation
          - Reduction of the catalyst from Cr(VI) to Cr(III)

          The process is endothermic, requiring heat input. Higher temperatures and lower pressures generally favor dehydrogenation reactions, especially for longer chain alkanes.

          The document does not provide specific information on ethylene production, applications of light olefins, or detailed market trends beyond mentioning increased demand for propylene.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯在过去十年中需求显著增加，超过了蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）等传统来源的供应能力。这使得丙烷脱氢成为一种越来越具有吸引力的生产方法。

          丙烯的主要生产方法包括：
          1. 乙烷蒸汽裂解
          2. 流化催化裂化（FCC）
          3. 丙烷脱氢

          丙烷脱氢的热力学挑战包括：
          - 高温（约850 K）
          - 低压（亚大气压，0.2-0.5巴）
          - 因积碳导致的催化剂失活
          - 催化剂从Cr(VI)还原为Cr(III)

          该过程是吸热的，需要输入热量。较高的温度和较低的压力通常有利于脱氢反应，尤其是对于较长链的烷烃。

          该文献没有提供关于乙烯生产、轻质烯烃应用或详细市场趋势的具体信息，除了提到丙烯需求增加外。
