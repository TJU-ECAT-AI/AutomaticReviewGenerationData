          [1] "The conversion of alkanes (a by-product of petroleum processing and present in natural gas) to olefins (ethylene, propylene, butene and butadiene) is in great demand in the chemical industry."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields."

[3] "The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct"

          Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are in high demand in the chemical industry as they are key building blocks for many chemical products. They are primarily produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and components of natural gas.

The main production methods include:
1. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation: This is an endothermic process that faces thermodynamic challenges. It leads to carbon formation and production of lower molecular weight alkanes, which decrease alkene yields.

2. CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation: This is an exothermic process that offers a more attractive route. It avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct instead of carbon deposits.

Key thermodynamic challenges include:
- High temperatures required for endothermic non-oxidative dehydrogenation
- Carbon formation at high temperatures
- Thermodynamic equilibrium limitations for longer alkane chain lengths

Using CO2 as an oxidant helps overcome some of these challenges by making the reaction exothermic and avoiding carbon formation. This likely allows for lower reaction temperatures and pressures compared to traditional methods.

While specific details on temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects are not provided, it can be inferred that:
- Higher temperatures would favor endothermic non-oxidative routes
- The exothermic oxidative route may allow for lower temperatures
- Longer alkane chains would likely be more difficult to dehydrogenate due to stronger C-C bonds
- CO2-mediated processes aim to overcome the temperature and pressure limitations of conventional methods

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯在化工行业需求量很大，因为它们是许多化学品的关键原料。它们主要由烷烃生产，烷烃是石油加工的副产品，也是天然气的成分。

主要的生产方法包括：
1. 非氧化脱氢：这是一个吸热过程，面临热力学挑战。它会导致碳的形成和低分子量烷烃的产生，从而降低烯烃产率。

2. 以CO2为介质的氧化脱氢：这是一个放热过程，提供了一种更有吸引力的路线。它通过形成水作为副产品而不是碳沉积，避免了非氧化路线的热力学限制。

主要的热力学挑战包括：
- 吸热非氧化脱氢需要高温
- 高温下碳的形成
- 较长烷烃链长度的热力学平衡限制

使用CO2作为氧化剂有助于克服其中一些挑战，因为它使反应成为放热反应并避免碳的形成。与传统方法相比，这可能允许较低的反应温度和压力。

虽然没有提供关于温度、压力和烷烃链长影响的具体细节，但可以推断：
- 较高的温度有利于吸热的非氧化路线
- 放热的氧化路线可能允许较低的温度
- 较长的烷烃链由于C-C键更强，可能更难脱氢
- 以CO2为介质的工艺旨在克服传统方法的温度和压力限制
