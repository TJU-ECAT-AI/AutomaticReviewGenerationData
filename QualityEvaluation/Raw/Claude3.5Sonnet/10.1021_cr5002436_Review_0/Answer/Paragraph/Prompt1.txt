Catalytic cracking over modified ZSM-5 zeolites (emerging method)\n\n          The document focuses on the catalytic cracking method using modified ZSM-5 zeolites, which can produce ethylene and propylene in considerable amounts from various feedstocks ranging from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane.\n\n          Regarding thermodynamic challenges, the paper mentions that temperature is a significant factor influencing light olefin production. The zeolite acidity and Si/Al ratio also affect the reaction scheme and olefin yield. However, the document does not provide specific details on pressure effects or how alkane chain length impacts the synthesis.\n\n          While the document doesn't explicitly discuss pressure effects or alkane chain length impacts, it implies that these factors may be relevant by mentioning the use of various feedstocks from heavy hydrocarbons to ethane.\n\n          The use of modified ZSM-5 zeolites for catalytic cracking appears to be a promising area of research for enhancing light olefin production. Various modifications to the zeolites, including the incorporation of different elements, are being studied to improve selectivity and yield of light olefins.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcata.2011.03.009"},
