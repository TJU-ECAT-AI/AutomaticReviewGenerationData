Light olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, are crucial building blocks in the petrochemical industry, serving as precursors for a wide range of products including plastics, synthetic rubbers, and solvents. Their industrial importance has led to significant research and development in production methods, with steam cracking of hydrocarbons remaining the dominant process. However, this method faces thermodynamic challenges due to its high energy consumption and carbon footprint. Alternative production routes, such as catalytic dehydrogenation and methanol-to-olefins processes, are gaining traction as more sustainable options. These methods aim to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of traditional processes by utilizing catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions. Despite these advancements, the synthesis of light olefins continues to present challenges in terms of energy efficiency, selectivity, and yield optimization. As the demand for these valuable chemicals grows, researchers and industry professionals are working to develop innovative technologies that can address these challenges while meeting the increasing global need for light olefins in a more environmentally friendly manner.
