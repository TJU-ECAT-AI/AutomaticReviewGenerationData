[1] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."

[2] "Dehydrogenation reactions are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamical equilibrium"

[3] "Theoretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures."

[4] "For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively."

[5] "Conversions can also be increased by using lower pressures or by using diluents with the alkane feed."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important feedstocks for the chemical industry. Propylene is used to produce polypropylene, while isobutene is used to make fuel additives like MTBE and ETBE. The production of these olefins faces significant thermodynamic challenges:

1. Dehydrogenation reactions to produce olefins are strongly endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium.

2. Lighter alkanes require higher temperatures for dehydrogenation. For example, ethane needs about 725°C to reach 50% conversion to ethene at atmospheric pressure.

3. Longer chain alkanes can be dehydrogenated at lower temperatures compared to shorter chains.

4. Increasing conversion requires either higher temperatures, lower pressures, or the use of diluents in the feed.

The main production method discussed is catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, which faces these thermodynamic constraints. The industry must balance temperature, pressure, and feedstock selection to optimize olefin production while managing energy costs and equipment limitations.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料。丙烯用于生产聚丙烯，而异丁烯用于生产MTBE和ETBE等燃料添加剂。这些烯烃的生产面临着显著的热力学挑战：

1. 生产烯烃的脱氢反应强烈吸热，并受热力学平衡限制。

2. 较轻的烷烃需要更高的温度进行脱氢。例如，在大气压下，乙烷需要约725°C才能达到50%的转化率转化为乙烯。

3. 相比于短链烷烃，长链烷烃可以在较低的温度下脱氢。

4. 提高转化率需要更高的温度、更低的压力，或在进料中使用稀释剂。

文中讨论的主要生产方法是烷烃的催化脱氢，这一过程面临着这些热力学限制。工业上必须在温度、压力和原料选择之间取得平衡，以优化烯烃生产，同时管理能源成本和设备限制。
