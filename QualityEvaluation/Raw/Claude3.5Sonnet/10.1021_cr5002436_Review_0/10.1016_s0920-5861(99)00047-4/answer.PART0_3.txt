[3] "Theoretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures."

[4] "For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry. Propylene is primarily used to produce polypropylene, a widely used polymer. Isobutene, another light olefin, is used to synthesize gasoline additives MTBE and ETBE. 

The main production method for these light olefins is alkane dehydrogenation. This process faces significant thermodynamic challenges. It is endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures to achieve good alkene yields. The temperature requirements vary based on the alkane chain length - longer chains dehydrogenate at lower temperatures, while shorter chains like ethane need higher temperatures. For instance, to achieve 50% conversion at atmospheric pressure, n-hexane requires about 585°C, while ethane needs 725°C.

These thermodynamic constraints pose challenges for industrial production, necessitating careful control of reaction conditions to maximize yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions. The high temperature requirements also impact process economics and catalyst stability.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料。丙烯主要用于生产聚丙烯，这是一种广泛使用的聚合物。异丁烯是另一种轻质烯烃，用于合成汽油添加剂MTBE和ETBE。

这些轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是烷烃脱氢。这个过程面临着重大的热力学挑战。它是吸热的，需要高温和低压才能获得良好的烯烃产率。温度要求因烷烃链长而异 - 较长的链在较低的温度下脱氢，而较短的链如乙烷需要更高的温度。例如，在大气压下要达到50%的转化率，正己烷需要约585°C，而乙烷需要725°C。

这些热力学限制对工业生产构成了挑战，需要仔细控制反应条件以最大化产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。高温要求也影响了工艺经济性和催化剂稳定性。
