[1] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."

[2] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain signicant yields of alkenes"

[3] "Theoretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures."

[4] "For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are critical feedstocks for the chemical industry. Propylene is used to produce polypropylene, while isobutene is used to make gasoline additives like MTBE and ETBE. The production of these olefins faces significant thermodynamic challenges. Alkane dehydrogenation to produce olefins is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures to achieve good yields. There is an inverse relationship between alkane chain length and required dehydrogenation temperature - lighter alkanes like ethane need much higher temperatures than longer chain alkanes. For example, achieving 50% conversion of ethane to ethylene requires 725°C, while n-hexane only needs 585°C for the same conversion level. These high temperature requirements, combined with the endothermic nature of the reaction, make olefin production via alkane dehydrogenation an energy-intensive process that faces thermodynamic constraints.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业的重要原料。丙烯用于生产聚丙烯，而异丁烯用于制造汽油添加剂如MTBE和ETBE。这些烯烃的生产面临着显著的热力学挑战。烷烃脱氢生产烯烃是吸热过程，需要高温和低压才能获得良好的产率。烷烃链长与所需脱氢温度之间存在反比关系 - 像乙烷这样的轻质烷烃需要比长链烷烃高得多的温度。例如，要达到50%的转化率，乙烷转化为乙烯需要725°C，而正己烷只需要585°C就能达到同样的转化水平。这些高温要求，加上反应的吸热性质，使得通过烷烃脱氢生产烯烃成为一个能源密集型过程，面临着热力学限制。
