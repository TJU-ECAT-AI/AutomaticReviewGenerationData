          [1] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."

[2] "Dehydrogenation reactions, CnH2n2$CnH2nH2, are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamical equilibrium [51]."

[3] "Theoretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures."

[4] "For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively."

[5] "Conversions can also be increased by using lower pressures or by using diluents with the alkane feed."

[6] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process, and requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain signicant yields of alkenes"

          Light olefins such as propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry. Propylene is primarily used in the production of high-purity polypropylene, while ethylene serves as a key building block for many plastics and chemicals. Another light olefin, isobutene, is used to synthesize gasoline additives like MTBE and ETBE. The market for these olefins is growing due to increasing demand for their derivative products.

The main production method for light olefins is alkane dehydrogenation. However, this process faces significant thermodynamic challenges:

1. The reactions are strongly endothermic, requiring high temperatures.
2. Conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium.
3. Low pressures are needed to obtain significant yields.
4. Lighter alkanes (e.g., ethane) require higher temperatures than longer chain alkanes for dehydrogenation.
5. Conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium - for example, ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene only reaches 50% conversion at 725°C under atmospheric pressure, while n-hexane reaches the same conversion at 585°C.

To overcome these constraints, industrial processes use low pressures and diluents to increase conversions. They must also carefully control temperatures to maximize yields while minimizing side reactions. The high temperatures required also promote unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking.

Overall, the production of light olefins via alkane dehydrogenation involves a delicate balance of thermodynamic and kinetic factors to achieve commercially viable processes. Despite these challenges, alkane dehydrogenation remains an important route for light olefin production, especially as demand grows for chemicals like polypropylene.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料。丙烯主要用于生产高纯度聚丙烯，而乙烯是许多塑料和化学品的关键构建模块。另一种轻质烯烃异丁烯用于合成MTBE和ETBE等汽油添加剂。由于这些衍生产品需求的增加，轻质烯烃的市场正在增长。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是烷烃脱氢。然而，这个过程面临着重大的热力学挑战：

1. 这些反应强烈吸热，需要高温。
2. 每次通过的转化率受热力学平衡限制。
3. 需要低压才能获得显著产率。
4. 较轻的烷烃（如乙烷）比较长链的烷烃需要更高的脱氢温度。
5. 转化率受热力学平衡限制 - 例如，在大气压下乙烷脱氢生成乙烯的转化率在725°C时只能达到50%，而正己烷在585°C时就能达到相同的转化率。

为了克服这些限制，工业过程使用低压和稀释剂来提高转化率。他们还必须仔细控制温度，以最大化产率，同时最小化副反应。所需的高温还会促进裂解和结焦等不良副反应。

总的来说，通过烷烃脱氢生产轻质烯烃涉及热力学和动力学因素的微妙平衡，以实现商业上可行的过程。尽管存在这些挑战，随着聚丙烯等化学品需求的增长，烷烃脱氢仍然是轻质烯烃生产的重要途径。
