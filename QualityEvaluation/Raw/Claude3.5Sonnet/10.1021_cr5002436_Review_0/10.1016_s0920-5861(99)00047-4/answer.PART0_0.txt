[1] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."

[2] "Dehydrogenation reactions, CnH2n2$CnH2nH2, are strongly endothermic, and the conversion per pass is limited by thermodynamical equilibrium [51]."

[3] "Theoretical dehydrogenation equilibria for alkanes to alkenes indicate that longer chains are dehydrogenated at lower temperatures, whereas lighter alkanes require higher dehydrogenation temperatures."

[4] "For example, an equilibrium conversion of 50% is reached under atmospheric pressure at around 5858C and 7258C for n-hexane (to n-hexene) and ethane (to ethene), respectively."

[5] "Conversions can also be increased by using lower pressures or by using diluents with the alkane feed."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry. Propylene is used to produce polypropylene, while ethylene is a key building block for many plastics and chemicals. The market for these olefins is growing due to increasing demand for their derivative products.

The main production method for light olefins is dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, this process faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The reactions are strongly endothermic and limited by equilibrium, requiring high temperatures to achieve reasonable conversions. Lighter alkanes like ethane need higher temperatures than longer chain alkanes. For example, 50% conversion of ethane to ethylene requires about 725°C, compared to 585°C for hexane to hexene.

To overcome these constraints, industrial processes use low pressures and diluents to increase conversions. They must also carefully control temperatures to maximize yields while minimizing side reactions. Overall, the production of light olefins via alkane dehydrogenation involves a delicate balance of thermodynamic and kinetic factors to achieve commercially viable processes.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料。丙烯用于生产聚丙烯,而乙烯是许多塑料和化学品的关键构建模块。由于这些衍生产品需求的增加,轻质烯烃的市场正在增长。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是烷烃脱氢。然而,这个过程面临着重大的热力学挑战。这些反应强烈吸热,并受平衡限制,需要高温才能达到合理的转化率。较轻的烷烃(如乙烷)比较长链的烷烃需要更高的温度。例如,乙烷转化为乙烯的50%转化率需要约725°C,而己烷转化为己烯只需585°C。

为了克服这些限制,工业过程使用低压和稀释剂来提高转化率。他们还必须仔细控制温度,以最大化产率,同时最小化副反应。总的来说,通过烷烃脱氢生产轻质烯烃涉及热力学和动力学因素的微妙平衡,以实现商业上可行的过程。
