[1] "Today, because it is not easy to convert methane into heavier molecules, natural gas (composed largely of methane) is mostly burned for heating and electrical power generation; a tiny fraction is used in vehicles."

[2] "Almost all industrial chemical processing of natural gas is performed with steam. In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."

[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[4] "However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals. Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are important products in the chemical industry, primarily produced through steam cracking of natural gas components. They serve as building blocks for many chemicals and materials. However, their production faces several challenges:

1. Production methods: The main method is steam cracking, which uses steam as a diluent to promote radical formation and minimize coke formation.

2. Yield and selectivity: High yields of ethylene and propylene can be achieved when ethane is the primary feedstock, but the process still produces a mixture of products.

3. Thermodynamic challenges: Steam cracking and reforming require high temperatures (700-1000°C) and pressures (15-40 atm), making the process energy-intensive and costly.

4. Reactor design: The high temperatures and pressures necessitate expensive reactors with complex heat transfer and coke management systems.

5. Product mixture: About 15% of the products from ethane steam cracking are not high-value chemicals, reducing overall efficiency.

6. Feedstock limitations: Converting methane, the primary component of natural gas, into heavier molecules remains challenging, limiting its use as a chemical feedstock.

These challenges highlight the need for new, more efficient processes to convert natural gas components into valuable chemical products.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业中的重要产品，主要通过天然气成分的蒸汽裂解生产。它们是许多化学品和材料的基本构建块。但是，它们的生产面临几个挑战：

1. 生产方法：主要方法是蒸汽裂解，使用蒸汽作为稀释剂来促进自由基形成并最小化焦炭形成。

2. 产率和选择性：当乙烷是主要原料时，可以获得高产率的乙烯和丙烯，但该过程仍然产生混合产物。

3. 热力学挑战：蒸汽裂解和重整需要高温（700-1000°C）和高压（15-40 atm），使过程能源密集且成本高昂。

4. 反应器设计：高温高压需要昂贵的反应器，配备复杂的传热和焦炭管理系统。

5. 产品混合：乙烷蒸汽裂解的产品中约有15%不是高价值化学品，降低了整体效率。

6. 原料限制：将甲烷（天然气的主要成分）转化为较重分子仍然具有挑战性，限制了其作为化学原料的使用。

这些挑战突显了需要新的、更高效的过程来将天然气成分转化为有价值的化学产品。
