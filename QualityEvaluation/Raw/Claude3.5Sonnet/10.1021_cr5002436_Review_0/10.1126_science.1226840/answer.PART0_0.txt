[1] "Today, because it is not easy to convert methane into heavier molecules, natural gas (composed largely of methane) is mostly burned for heating and electrical power generation; a tiny fraction is used in vehicles."

[2] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[3] "It would seem that between cracking for olefin production and reforming to make synthesis gas, all of the chemistry needed to make use of natural gas is already available. However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."

[4] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges. Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are important products in the chemical industry, primarily obtained from steam cracking of natural gas components. These olefins serve as building blocks for many chemicals and materials. However, their production faces several challenges:

1. Conversion difficulty: It's not easy to convert methane, the main component of natural gas, into heavier molecules like olefins.

2. Production inefficiency: While high yields of ethylene and propylene can be achieved from ethane, the process still produces other hydrocarbons and hydrogen as byproducts.

3. Mixture of products: Steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, with about 15% being non-high-value chemicals.

4. Thermodynamic challenges: Steam reforming, another key process, requires high temperatures (700-1000°C) and pressures (15-40 atm), making it costly and energy-intensive.

5. Efficiency limitations: Current processes have overall efficiencies of 75% or lower.

These challenges highlight the need for new, more efficient technologies to produce light olefins from natural gas, especially as the industry seeks to shift away from petroleum-based feedstocks.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业中的重要产品，主要通过天然气组分的蒸汽裂解获得。这些烯烃是许多化学品和材料的基本构建块。然而，它们的生产面临几个挑战：

1. 转化困难：将甲烷（天然气的主要成分）转化为更重的分子（如烯烃）并不容易。

2. 生产效率低：虽然从乙烷可以获得高产率的乙烯和丙烯，但该过程仍会产生其他碳氢化合物和氢气作为副产品。

3. 产品混合：乙烷的蒸汽裂解会产生混合产品，其中约15%是非高价值化学品。

4. 热力学挑战：另一个关键过程蒸汽重整需要高温（700-1000°C）和高压（15-40大气压），使其成本高昂且能源密集。

5. 效率限制：当前工艺的总体效率为75%或更低。

这些挑战突显了从天然气生产轻质烯烃需要新的、更高效技术的必要性，特别是在行业寻求从石油基原料转移的情况下。
