[1] "Today, because it is not easy to convert methane into heavier molecules, natural gas (composed largely of methane) is mostly burned for heating and electrical power generation; a tiny fraction is used in vehicles."

[2] "Almost all industrial chemical processing of natural gas is performed with steam. In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."

[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[4] "It would seem that between cracking for olefin production and reforming to make synthesis gas, all of the chemistry needed to make use of natural gas is already available. However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."

[5] "Steam reforming is costly; it requires high operating pressures and temperatures (15 to 40 atm, 700 to 1000°C) in expensive reactors with heat transfer and coke management challenges. Overall efficiencies are 75% or lower."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are important products in the chemical industry, primarily produced from natural gas. They are used as building blocks for many other chemicals and materials. The main production method for these olefins is steam cracking, which can yield high amounts of ethylene and propylene when ethane is the primary feedstock. However, this process also produces other hydrocarbons and hydrogen as by-products.

The key challenges in producing light olefins are related to the thermodynamics and efficiency of the process. Steam cracking requires high temperatures and pressures, typically 700-1000°C and 15-40 atm. These conditions make the process energy-intensive and expensive, with overall efficiencies of 75% or lower. Additionally, the process produces a mixture of products, with about 15% being non-high-value chemicals.

The alkane chain length affects the product distribution, with ethane being the preferred feedstock for high ethylene and propylene yields. However, converting methane, the primary component of natural gas, into heavier molecules remains challenging.

To improve the production of light olefins, there is a need for new, more efficient processes that can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, while providing higher selectivity towards the desired products. This would help reduce costs and increase the utilization of natural gas as a feedstock for the chemical industry.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业中的重要产品，主要从天然气中生产。它们被用作许多其他化学品和材料的基本构建单元。生产这些烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解，当乙烷作为主要原料时，可以产生大量的乙烯和丙烯。然而，这个过程也会产生其他碳氢化合物和氢气作为副产品。

生产轻质烯烃的主要挑战与过程的热力学和效率有关。蒸汽裂解需要高温和高压，通常是700-1000°C和15-40大气压。这些条件使得该过程能源密集且昂贵，总体效率为75%或更低。此外，该过程产生的产品混合物中约有15%是非高价值化学品。

烷烃链长影响产品分布，乙烷是获得高乙烯和丙烯产率的首选原料。然而，将甲烷（天然气的主要成分）转化为更重的分子仍然具有挑战性。

为了改进轻质烯烃的生产，需要开发新的、更高效的工艺，能够在更低的温度和压力下运行，同时提供更高的目标产品选择性。这将有助于降低成本，增加天然气作为化学工业原料的利用率。
