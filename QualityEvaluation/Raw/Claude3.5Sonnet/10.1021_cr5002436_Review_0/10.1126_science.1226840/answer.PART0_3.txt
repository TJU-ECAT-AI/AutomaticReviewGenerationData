[1] "Today, because it is not easy to convert methane into heavier molecules, natural gas (composed largely of methane) is mostly burned for heating and electrical power generation; a tiny fraction is used in vehicles."

[2] "Almost all industrial chemical processing of natural gas is performed with steam. In steam crackers, the steam acts as a relatively unreactive diluent that favors fragmented radical formation and minimizes solid carbon (coke)."

[3] "A high yield of ethylene and propylene can be achieved under properly selected reaction conditions when the primary feed is ethane; but steam cracking still produces a mixture of olefin products along with other hydrocarbons and H2."

[4] "It would seem that between cracking for olefin production and reforming to make synthesis gas, all of the chemistry needed to make use of natural gas is already available. However, steam cracking of ethane produces a mixture of products, 15% of which are not high-value chemicals."

[5] "New low-temperature, high-yield alkane conversion chemistries that are relatively insensitive to common natural gas impurities are needed if we want to do better than cracking and reforming."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are important products in the chemical industry, but the literature doesn't provide specific information about their applications or market trends. The main production method mentioned is steam cracking, particularly of ethane. This process can yield high amounts of ethylene and propylene under specific conditions, but it also produces other hydrocarbons and hydrogen.

The key thermodynamic challenges in synthesizing these olefins involve high temperatures and the formation of unwanted byproducts. Steam cracking requires high temperatures to break the chemical bonds in the feedstock. The process also faces challenges in controlling the product mix, as about 15% of the products from ethane steam cracking are not high-value chemicals.

The literature suggests that improvements are needed in alkane conversion chemistry, specifically mentioning the need for low-temperature processes that can achieve high yields and are less sensitive to impurities in natural gas. This implies that current methods struggle with efficiency at lower temperatures and may be negatively affected by impurities in the feedstock.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss pressure effects or the impact of alkane chain length, it does mention that steam crackers use steam as a diluent to favor radical formation and minimize coke formation. This suggests that pressure and the nature of the hydrocarbon feedstock (i.e., chain length) play important roles in the reaction dynamics and product distribution.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化工行业的重要产品，但文献中没有提供关于它们的具体应用或市场趋势的信息。文中提到的主要生产方法是蒸汽裂解，特别是对乙烷的蒸汽裂解。在特定条件下，这一过程可以产生大量的乙烯和丙烯，但同时也会产生其他碳氢化合物和氢气。

合成这些烯烃的主要热力学挑战涉及高温和不必要副产品的形成。蒸汽裂解需要高温来破坏原料中的化学键。该过程还面临着控制产品组合的挑战，因为乙烷蒸汽裂解产生的约15%的产品不是高价值化学品。

文献表明，烷烃转化化学需要改进，特别提到了需要能够在低温下实现高产率且对天然气中的杂质不敏感的工艺。这意味着当前的方法在较低温度下效率较低，可能会受到原料中杂质的负面影响。

虽然文中没有明确讨论压力效应或烷烃链长的影响，但确实提到蒸汽裂解器使用蒸汽作为稀释剂，以促进自由基的形成并最小化焦炭的形成。这表明压力和碳氢化合物原料的性质（即链长）在反应动力学和产品分布中起着重要作用。
