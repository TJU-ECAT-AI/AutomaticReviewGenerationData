[1] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

[2] "In commercial practice, steam is co-fed with the EB and serves several purposes. First, it delivers the required heat and acts as a diluent, resulting in a shift to higher equilibrium conversions. Second, it limits the buildup of carbonaceous deposits by gasification. Finally, as an oxidation agent, it renders the iron oxide in an appropriate oxidation state."

[3] "Figure 1 Equilibrium conversions of methane (CH4) to ethane (C2H6) (dotted lines) and ethylene (C2H4) (solid lines) using carbon dioxide (CO2): curves a and c, CO2:CH4 = 1; curves b and d, CO2:CH4 = 2."

[4] "Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry. They are primarily used to produce a wide range of valuable chemical products, making them essential feedstocks. The main production methods for these olefins involve converting light alkanes, which are abundant and inexpensive but chemically stable.

The key thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis include:

1. Temperature effects: Higher temperatures generally favor higher conversions of alkanes to olefins. For example, methane conversion to ethylene increases with temperature.

2. Pressure effects: While not explicitly stated, pressure likely plays a role in equilibrium conversions, as gaseous reactions are involved.

3. Alkane chain length effects: Longer chain alkanes (e.g., propane) tend to have higher equilibrium conversions to olefins compared to shorter chains (e.g., methane) under similar conditions.

4. Use of diluents/oxidants: Adding CO2 or steam can shift equilibrium towards higher conversions by acting as a diluent and oxidant. For instance, CO2 addition significantly increases propane conversion compared to reactions without CO2.

These challenges are addressed through various strategies, such as using catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and employing oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 or steam to improve yields and reduce energy requirements.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是现代化工行业的重要起始原料。它们主要用于生产各种有价值的化学产品，使其成为必不可少的原料。这些烯烃的主要生产方法涉及转化轻质烷烃，后者虽然丰富且便宜，但化学性质稳定。

烯烃合成中的主要热力学挑战包括：

1. 温度效应：一般来说，较高的温度有利于烷烃向烯烃的更高转化。例如，甲烷向乙烯的转化随温度升高而增加。

2. 压力效应：虽然没有明确说明，但压力可能会影响平衡转化，因为涉及气相反应。

3. 烷烃链长效应：在类似条件下，较长链烷烃（如丙烷）往往比较短链烷烃（如甲烷）具有更高的烯烃平衡转化率。

4. 稀释剂/氧化剂的使用：添加CO2或蒸汽可以通过作为稀释剂和氧化剂来提高平衡转化率。例如，与不添加CO2的反应相比，添加CO2显著提高了丙烷的转化率。

这些挑战通过各种策略来解决，如使用催化剂、优化反应条件，以及采用CO2或蒸汽氧化脱氢来提高产率并降低能耗。
