[1] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

[2] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control. However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."

[3] "Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2. For example, at 600 C and with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 reaches 92%, whereas, in the absence of CO2, only 50% conversion is achieved under the same conditions."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry. They are widely used to produce various chemical products. The main production methods for light olefins include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

Thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis include:

1. High temperatures required: Traditional dehydrogenation processes operate at high temperatures.

2. Heat management: ODH reactions are exothermic, necessitating heat removal to avoid over-oxidation of olefins.

3. Equilibrium limitations: Alkane conversion is thermodynamically limited, especially at lower temperatures.

4. Pressure effects: Higher pressures generally disfavor dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Chain length effects: Longer alkane chains tend to have lower bond dissociation energies, affecting reaction thermodynamics.

To address these challenges, CO2 has been explored as an alternative oxidant. The use of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation, for example, significantly improves equilibrium conversion compared to traditional dehydrogenation. At 600°C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5:1, propane conversion reaches 92%, compared to only 50% without CO2 under the same conditions. This demonstrates how CO2 can help overcome thermodynamic limitations in olefin production.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是现代化工行业的重要起始原料。它们被广泛用于生产各种化学产品。生产轻质烯烃的主要方法包括轻质烷烃的脱氢和氧化脱氢(ODH)。

烯烃合成中的热力学挑战包括：

1. 需要高温：传统脱氢工艺在高温下进行。

2. 热量管理：ODH反应是放热的，需要去除热量以避免烯烃过度氧化。

3. 平衡限制：烷烃转化在热力学上受到限制，尤其是在较低温度下。

4. 压力影响：较高压力通常不利于脱氢反应。

5. 链长效应：较长的烷烃链往往具有较低的键解离能，影响反应热力学。

为了解决这些挑战，CO2被探索用作替代氧化剂。例如，在丙烷脱氢中使用CO2显著提高了平衡转化率，相比传统脱氢。在600°C下，CO2:C3H8比为5:1时，丙烷转化率达到92%，而在相同条件下无CO2时仅为50%。这表明CO2可以帮助克服烯烃生产中的热力学限制。
