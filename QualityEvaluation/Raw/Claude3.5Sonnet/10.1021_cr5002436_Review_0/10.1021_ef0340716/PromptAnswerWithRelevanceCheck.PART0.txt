[1] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

[2] "Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the temperature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase."

[3] "Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry. They are primarily produced from light alkanes, which are abundant and low-cost but chemically stable. The conversion of alkanes to olefins is of great practical interest due to the chemical industry's heavy reliance on olefins.

The main production methods for light olefins involve dehydrogenation of alkanes, which faces thermodynamic challenges. Temperature and pressure play significant roles in the conversion process. Higher temperatures generally increase conversion rates for both methane to ethylene and propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 as an oxidant can significantly improve conversion rates compared to simple dehydrogenation.

The alkane chain length also affects the dehydrogenation process. For example, propane (C3H8) shows higher equilibrium conversion in the presence of CO2 compared to without CO2, indicating that longer chain alkanes may be more readily converted under certain conditions.

These production methods aim to overcome the inherent stability of alkanes and push the equilibrium towards olefin formation, addressing the growing market demand for these essential chemical building blocks.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是现代化工行业的重要起始材料。它们主要由轻质烷烃生产，这些烷烃虽然丰富且价格低廉，但化学性质稳定。由于化学工业严重依赖烯烃，将烷烃转化为烯烃具有重要的实际意义。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法涉及烷烃的脱氢，这面临着热力学挑战。温度和压力在转化过程中起着重要作用。通常，更高的温度会增加甲烷到乙烯和丙烷脱氢的转化率。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂可以显著提高转化率，相比于简单脱氢过程。

烷烃链长也影响脱氢过程。例如，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，丙烷（C3H8）显示出比无二氧化碳时更高的平衡转化率，这表明在某些条件下，较长链的烷烃可能更容易转化。

这些生产方法旨在克服烷烃固有的稳定性，并推动平衡向烯烃形成方向发展，以满足这些重要化学基础材料不断增长的市场需求。

[2] "In commercial practice, steam is co-fed with the EB and serves several purposes. First, it delivers the required heat and acts as a diluent, resulting in a shift to higher equilibrium conversions. Second, it limits the buildup of carbonaceous deposits by gasification. Finally, as an oxidation agent, it renders the iron oxide in an appropriate oxidation state."

[3] "Figure 1 Equilibrium conversions of methane (CH4) to ethane (C2H6) (dotted lines) and ethylene (C2H4) (solid lines) using carbon dioxide (CO2): curves a and c, CO2:CH4 = 1; curves b and d, CO2:CH4 = 2."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry. They are primarily used to produce a wide range of valuable chemical products, making them essential feedstocks. The main production methods for these olefins involve converting light alkanes, which are abundant and inexpensive but chemically stable.

The key thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis include:

1. Temperature effects: Higher temperatures generally favor higher conversions of alkanes to olefins. For example, methane conversion to ethylene increases with temperature.

2. Pressure effects: While not explicitly stated, pressure likely plays a role in equilibrium conversions, as gaseous reactions are involved.

3. Alkane chain length effects: Longer chain alkanes (e.g., propane) tend to have higher equilibrium conversions to olefins compared to shorter chains (e.g., methane) under similar conditions.

4. Use of diluents/oxidants: Adding CO2 or steam can shift equilibrium towards higher conversions by acting as a diluent and oxidant. For instance, CO2 addition significantly increases propane conversion compared to reactions without CO2.

These challenges are addressed through various strategies, such as using catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and employing oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 or steam to improve yields and reduce energy requirements.

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are critical starting materials in the chemical industry. They serve as building blocks for many downstream chemical products and polymers. The market for light olefins has been growing due to increasing demand for plastics and other petrochemicals.

Key production methods for light olefins include steam cracking of naphtha or ethane, fluid catalytic cracking of heavier hydrocarbons, and dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Each method faces thermodynamic challenges:

Steam cracking is highly endothermic and requires very high temperatures (800-900°C). Selectivity to desired olefins decreases at higher temperatures due to side reactions.

Catalytic cracking operates at lower temperatures but still faces selectivity issues. 

Alkane dehydrogenation is equilibrium-limited at lower temperatures. Higher temperatures improve conversion but reduce selectivity and accelerate catalyst deactivation.

In general, as alkane chain length increases, dehydrogenation becomes more thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures. However, longer chains are more prone to cracking reactions.

Pressure negatively impacts olefin yields for dehydrogenation reactions. Lower pressures are preferred but have practical limitations.

To address these challenges, new catalytic approaches like oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 are being explored to improve yields and energy efficiency. However, optimizing reaction conditions to maximize olefin selectivity remains an ongoing challenge.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业的重要起始原料。它们是许多下游化学品和聚合物的基本构建单元。由于塑料和其他石油化学品需求的增加，轻质烯烃的市场一直在增长。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括石脑油或乙烷的蒸汽裂解、重质烃的流化催化裂解以及轻质烷烃的脱氢。每种方法都面临热力学挑战：

蒸汽裂解是高度吸热的，需要非常高的温度(800-900°C)。在更高的温度下，由于副反应的存在，所需烯烃的选择性降低。

催化裂解在较低的温度下进行，但仍然面临选择性问题。

烷烃脱氢在较低温度下受到平衡限制。提高温度可以改善转化率，但会降低选择性并加速催化剂失活。

一般来说，随着烷烃链长的增加，脱氢在较低温度下变得更有利于热力学。然而，较长的链更容易发生裂解反应。

压力对脱氢反应的烯烃产率有负面影响。较低的压力是首选，但存在实际限制。

为了应对这些挑战，正在探索新的催化方法，如使用二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢，以提高产率和能源效率。然而，优化反应条件以最大化烯烃选择性仍然是一个持续的挑战。

The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2. For example, at 600 C and with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 reaches 92%, whereas, in the absence of CO2, only 50% conversion is achieved under the same conditions."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry. They are widely used to produce various chemical products. The main production methods for light olefins include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH).

Thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis include:

1. High temperatures required: Traditional dehydrogenation processes operate at high temperatures.

2. Heat management: ODH reactions are exothermic, necessitating heat removal to avoid over-oxidation of olefins.

3. Equilibrium limitations: Alkane conversion is thermodynamically limited, especially at lower temperatures.

4. Pressure effects: Higher pressures generally disfavor dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Chain length effects: Longer alkane chains tend to have lower bond dissociation energies, affecting reaction thermodynamics.

To address these challenges, CO2 has been explored as an alternative oxidant. The use of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation, for example, significantly improves equilibrium conversion compared to traditional dehydrogenation. At 600°C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5:1, propane conversion reaches 92%, compared to only 50% without CO2 under the same conditions. This demonstrates how CO2 can help overcome thermodynamic limitations in olefin production.

烯烃合成中的热力学挑战包括：

1. 需要高温：传统脱氢工艺在高温下进行。

2. 热量管理：ODH反应是放热的，需要去除热量以避免烯烃过度氧化。

3. 平衡限制：烷烃转化在热力学上受到限制，尤其是在较低温度下。

4. 压力影响：较高压力通常不利于脱氢反应。

5. 链长效应：较长的烷烃链往往具有较低的键解离能，影响反应热力学。

为了解决这些挑战，CO2被探索用作替代氧化剂。例如，在丙烷脱氢中使用CO2显著提高了平衡转化率，相比传统脱氢。在600°C下，CO2:C3H8比为5:1时，丙烷转化率达到92%，而在相同条件下无CO2时仅为50%。这表明CO2可以帮助克服烯烃生产中的热力学限制。
