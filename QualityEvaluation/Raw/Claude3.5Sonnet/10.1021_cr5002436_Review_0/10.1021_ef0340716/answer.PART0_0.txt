[1] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

[2] "Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the temperature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase."

[3] "Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry. They are primarily produced from light alkanes, which are abundant and low-cost but chemically stable. The conversion of alkanes to olefins is of great practical interest due to the chemical industry's heavy reliance on olefins.

The main production methods for light olefins involve dehydrogenation of alkanes, which faces thermodynamic challenges. Temperature and pressure play significant roles in the conversion process. Higher temperatures generally increase conversion rates for both methane to ethylene and propane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 as an oxidant can significantly improve conversion rates compared to simple dehydrogenation.

The alkane chain length also affects the dehydrogenation process. For example, propane (C3H8) shows higher equilibrium conversion in the presence of CO2 compared to without CO2, indicating that longer chain alkanes may be more readily converted under certain conditions.

These production methods aim to overcome the inherent stability of alkanes and push the equilibrium towards olefin formation, addressing the growing market demand for these essential chemical building blocks.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是现代化工行业的重要起始材料。它们主要由轻质烷烃生产，这些烷烃虽然丰富且价格低廉，但化学性质稳定。由于化学工业严重依赖烯烃，将烷烃转化为烯烃具有重要的实际意义。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法涉及烷烃的脱氢，这面临着热力学挑战。温度和压力在转化过程中起着重要作用。通常，更高的温度会增加甲烷到乙烯和丙烷脱氢的转化率。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂可以显著提高转化率，相比于简单脱氢过程。

烷烃链长也影响脱氢过程。例如，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，丙烷（C3H8）显示出比无二氧化碳时更高的平衡转化率，这表明在某些条件下，较长链的烷烃可能更容易转化。

这些生产方法旨在克服烷烃固有的稳定性，并推动平衡向烯烃形成方向发展，以满足这些重要化学基础材料不断增长的市场需求。
