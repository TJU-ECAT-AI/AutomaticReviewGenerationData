          "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

"Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the temperature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase."

"Figure 5 shows the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 and effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8. The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is much higher than that without CO2."

"In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control. However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."

"For example, at 600 C and with a CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 5:1, the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 reaches 92%, whereas, in the absence of CO2, only 50% conversion is achieved under the same conditions."

          Light olefins such as propylene and ethylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry, with a wide range of applications in producing various chemical products. Their importance has led to growing market trends and demand.

Key production methods for light olefins include:
1. Dehydrogenation of light alkanes
2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with oxygen
3. ODH with CO2 (an emerging method)

The main thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis include:

1. Temperature effects: Higher temperatures generally increase conversion rates but may reduce selectivity and cause catalyst deactivation. For example, methane conversion to ethylene increases with temperature.

2. Pressure effects: Pressure influences equilibrium conversions, especially in gas-phase reactions. Generally, lower pressures are preferred for dehydrogenation reactions, but this has practical limitations.

3. Alkane chain length effects: Longer chain alkanes (e.g., propane) tend to have higher equilibrium conversions to olefins compared to shorter chains (e.g., methane) under similar conditions. This is due to lower bond dissociation energies in longer chains.

4. Heat management: ODH reactions are exothermic, requiring efficient heat removal to avoid over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides.

5. Equilibrium limitations: Alkane conversion is thermodynamically limited, especially at lower temperatures.

To address these challenges, strategies such as using CO2 as an oxidant have been explored. For instance, in propane dehydrogenation at 600°C with a CO2:C3H8 ratio of 5:1, propane conversion reaches 92%, compared to only 50% without CO2 under the same conditions. This demonstrates how CO2 can help overcome thermodynamic limitations and improve yields in olefin production.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是现代化工行业的重要起始原料，在生产各种化学产品中有广泛的应用。它们的重要性导致市场趋势和需求不断增长。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括：
1. 轻质烷烃脱氢
2. 氧气氧化脱氢（ODH）
3. 二氧化碳氧化脱氢（新兴方法）

与其合成相关的主要热力学挑战包括：

1. 温度效应：较高的温度通常会增加转化率，但可能降低选择性并导致催化剂失活。例如，甲烷到乙烯的转化随温度升高而增加。

2. 压力效应：压力影响平衡转化率，尤其是在气相反应中。通常，脱氢反应倾向于较低压力，但这存在实际限制。

3. 烷烃链长效应：在类似条件下，较长链烷烃（如丙烷）往往比较短链烷烃（如甲烷）具有更高的烯烃平衡转化率。这是由于较长链中的键解离能较低。

4. 热量管理：ODH反应是放热的，需要有效去除热量以避免烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物。

5. 平衡限制：烷烃转化在热力学上受到限制，尤其是在较低温度下。

为了应对这些挑战，已经探索了使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂等策略。例如，在600°C下，CO2:C3H8比为5:1的丙烷脱氢中，丙烷转化率达到92%，而在相同条件下无CO2时仅为50%。这表明CO2可以帮助克服热力学限制，提高烯烃生产的产率。
