[1] "Olefins as starting materials."

[2] "Olefins yields were higher than those without CO2."

[3] "The production of chemicals from CO2 could have a small but significant positive impact on the global carbon balance."

[4] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest."

[5] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are critical starting materials in the chemical industry. They serve as building blocks for many downstream chemical products and polymers. The market for light olefins has been growing due to increasing demand for plastics and other petrochemicals.

Key production methods for light olefins include steam cracking of naphtha or ethane, fluid catalytic cracking of heavier hydrocarbons, and dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Each method faces thermodynamic challenges:

Steam cracking is highly endothermic and requires very high temperatures (800-900°C). Selectivity to desired olefins decreases at higher temperatures due to side reactions.

Catalytic cracking operates at lower temperatures but still faces selectivity issues. 

Alkane dehydrogenation is equilibrium-limited at lower temperatures. Higher temperatures improve conversion but reduce selectivity and accelerate catalyst deactivation.

In general, as alkane chain length increases, dehydrogenation becomes more thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures. However, longer chains are more prone to cracking reactions.

Pressure negatively impacts olefin yields for dehydrogenation reactions. Lower pressures are preferred but have practical limitations.

To address these challenges, new catalytic approaches like oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 are being explored to improve yields and energy efficiency. However, optimizing reaction conditions to maximize olefin selectivity remains an ongoing challenge.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业的重要起始原料。它们是许多下游化学品和聚合物的基本构建单元。由于塑料和其他石油化学品需求的增加，轻质烯烃的市场一直在增长。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括石脑油或乙烷的蒸汽裂解、重质烃的流化催化裂解以及轻质烷烃的脱氢。每种方法都面临热力学挑战：

蒸汽裂解是高度吸热的，需要非常高的温度(800-900°C)。在更高的温度下，由于副反应的存在，所需烯烃的选择性降低。

催化裂解在较低的温度下进行，但仍然面临选择性问题。

烷烃脱氢在较低温度下受到平衡限制。提高温度可以改善转化率，但会降低选择性并加速催化剂失活。

一般来说，随着烷烃链长的增加，脱氢在较低温度下变得更有利于热力学。然而，较长的链更容易发生裂解反应。

压力对脱氢反应的烯烃产率有负面影响。较低的压力是首选，但存在实际限制。

为了应对这些挑战，正在探索新的催化方法，如使用二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢，以提高产率和能源效率。然而，优化反应条件以最大化烯烃选择性仍然是一个持续的挑战。
