[1] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest. A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."

[2] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control. However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."

[3] "Equilibrium conversions of CH4 to C2H6 (reaction 7) and C2H4 (reaction 8) from thermodynamic calculations are shown in Figure 1. Conversion increases as the temperature and CO2:CH4 ratio each increase. An enhancement in the CO2:CH4 ratio increases the CH4 conversions to C2H6 and C2H4 and their yields exceed 15% and 25%, respectively, at 800 C for the reactant with a CO2:CH4 ratio of 2."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial starting materials for the modern chemical industry. They are widely used to produce various chemical products, making them essential feedstocks. The key production methods for these olefins include:

1. Dehydrogenation of light alkanes: This process converts alkanes to olefins but requires high temperatures and faces challenges with catalyst coking.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with oxygen: This method operates at lower temperatures but struggles with over-oxidation and selectivity issues.

3. ODH with CO2: This emerging method aims to overcome the limitations of traditional processes.

The main thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis are:

1. Temperature effects: Higher temperatures generally increase conversion but may reduce selectivity and cause catalyst deactivation.

2. Pressure effects: Pressure can influence equilibrium conversions, especially in reactions involving gases.

3. Alkane chain length effects: Longer chain alkanes tend to be more reactive but may produce a wider range of products.

These challenges necessitate careful process design and catalyst development to optimize olefin yields while maintaining high selectivity and catalyst stability.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是现代化工行业的重要原料。它们被广泛用于生产各种化学产品，是不可或缺的原料。这些烯烃的主要生产方法包括：

1. 轻质烷烃脱氢：这种方法将烷烃转化为烯烃，但需要高温，并面临催化剂结焦的挑战。

2. 氧气氧化脱氢（ODH）：这种方法在较低温度下运行，但存在过度氧化和选择性问题。

3. 二氧化碳氧化脱氢：这是一种新兴方法，旨在克服传统工艺的局限性。

烯烃合成中的主要热力学挑战包括：

1. 温度效应：较高的温度通常会增加转化率，但可能降低选择性并导致催化剂失活。

2. 压力效应：压力可以影响平衡转化率，尤其是在涉及气体的反应中。

3. 烷烃链长效应：较长链的烷烃往往更具反应性，但可能产生更广泛的产品。

这些挑战需要仔细的工艺设计和催化剂开发，以优化烯烃产率，同时保持高选择性和催化剂稳定性。
