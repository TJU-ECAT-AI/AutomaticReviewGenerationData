Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, primarily used for polymerization to produce plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The market for these polymers is growing, with forecasts indicating dynamic development in the coming years.

Traditionally, light olefins have been produced as co-products from naphtha cracking during ethylene production. However, the industry is shifting towards lighter cracker feedstocks, which results in reduced co-product volumes. This shift is driving the development of on-purpose production methods for higher olefins.

Key production methods now include dedicated processes for converting alkanes to olefins. For example, new technologies are being developed to produce butadiene from butane via butenes. These on-purpose routes help address the supply gap created by the shift to lighter feedstocks.

The thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis often relate to the high temperatures and pressures required for dehydrogenation reactions. As alkane chain length increases, the ease of dehydrogenation generally improves, but selectivity can become an issue. Catalysts play a crucial role in optimizing these processes, with about 80% of catalysts used in the refining industry for processes like fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, and reforming.

The development of new catalysts and process technologies is ongoing, with companies collaborating to integrate, optimize, and commercialize these processes to meet the growing demand for light olefins in the chemical industry.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料，主要用于聚合生产塑料，如聚乙烯和聚丙烯。这些聚合物的市场正在增长，预计未来几年将呈现动态发展。

传统上，轻质烯烃是在乙烯生产过程中裂解石脑油的副产品。然而，行业正在向更轻的裂解原料转移，这导致副产品产量减少。这种转变正在推动高级烯烃定向生产方法的发展。

现在的主要生产方法包括将烷烃转化为烯烃的专门工艺。例如，正在开发新技术通过丁烯从丁烷生产丁二烯。这些定向路线有助于解决转向轻质原料造成的供应缺口。

烯烃合成中的热力学挑战通常与脱氢反应所需的高温和高压有关。随着烷烃链长增加，脱氢通常变得更容易，但选择性可能成为一个问题。催化剂在优化这些过程中起着至关重要的作用，约80%的催化剂用于炼油行业的流化催化裂化、加氢裂化和重整等工艺。

新催化剂和工艺技术的开发正在进行中，公司正在合作以整合、优化和商业化这些工艺，以满足化工行业对轻质烯烃日益增长的需求。
