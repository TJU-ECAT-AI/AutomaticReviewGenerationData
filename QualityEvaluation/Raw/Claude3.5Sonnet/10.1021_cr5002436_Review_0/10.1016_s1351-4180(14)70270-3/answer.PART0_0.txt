[1] "About 80% of all the catalysts consumed are utilized in the refining of crude oil, for example in processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, or reforming."

[2] "For polymerization, Ceresana forecasts the most dynamic development at an AAGR of 3.1%/y until 2021, with the synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene accounting for the major share."

[3] "The new process will deliver an on-purpose route from butane to butadiene via butenes. Currently, the industry relies mainly on butadiene as a co-product from naphtha-cracking to ethylene."

[4] "The shift to lighter cracker feedstock results in reduced volumes of co-products. Therefore the on-purpose production of higher olefins is gaining more and more importance."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial in the chemical industry, primarily used in polymerization processes to produce polyethylene and polypropylene. These polymers have a significant market share, with forecasts indicating dynamic growth in the coming years.

The main production method for light olefins has traditionally been as co-products from naphtha-cracking to produce ethylene. However, there's a shift towards on-purpose production methods due to changes in feedstock availability. For instance, a new process is being developed to produce butadiene from butane via butenes.

The production of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. While specific details aren't provided in the given text, it's known that these factors significantly influence the efficiency and yield of olefin production processes.

The industry is adapting to changes in feedstock availability, with a trend towards lighter cracker feedstocks. This shift results in reduced volumes of co-products, necessitating the development of on-purpose production methods for higher olefins.

Overall, the production and application of light olefins are evolving in response to market demands and feedstock availability, with ongoing efforts to develop more efficient and targeted production methods.
