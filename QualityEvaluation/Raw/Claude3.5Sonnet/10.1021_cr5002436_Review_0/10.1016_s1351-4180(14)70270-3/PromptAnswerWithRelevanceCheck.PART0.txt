Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, primarily used in the production of polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The market for these polymers is growing, with forecasts indicating a dynamic development in polymerization at an annual average growth rate of 3.1% until 2021.

The main production method for light olefins has traditionally been as co-products from naphtha cracking during ethylene production. However, the industry is shifting towards lighter cracker feedstocks, which results in reduced volumes of these co-products. This shift is driving the development of on-purpose production methods for higher olefins.

The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. These factors affect the equilibrium and kinetics of the reactions. For instance, higher temperatures generally favor olefin formation but can lead to unwanted side reactions. Pressure effects depend on the specific reaction, with some dehydrogenation reactions favored by lower pressures. Alkane chain length influences the ease of C-H bond activation, with longer chains generally being more reactive.

To address these challenges, companies are developing new catalytic processes. For example, BASF and Linde are collaborating on a new process for the on-purpose production of butadiene via butenes, starting from butane. This process likely involves careful control of reaction conditions and specialized catalysts to overcome thermodynamic limitations and optimize selectivity.

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, primarily used for polymerization to produce plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The market for these polymers is growing, with forecasts indicating dynamic development in the coming years.

Traditionally, light olefins have been produced as co-products from naphtha cracking during ethylene production. However, the industry is shifting towards lighter cracker feedstocks, which results in reduced co-product volumes. This shift is driving the development of on-purpose production methods for higher olefins.

Key production methods now include dedicated processes for converting alkanes to olefins. For example, new technologies are being developed to produce butadiene from butane via butenes. These on-purpose routes help address the supply gap created by the shift to lighter feedstocks.

The thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis often relate to the high temperatures and pressures required for dehydrogenation reactions. As alkane chain length increases, the ease of dehydrogenation generally improves, but selectivity can become an issue. Catalysts play a crucial role in optimizing these processes, with about 80% of catalysts used in the refining industry for processes like fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, and reforming.

The development of new catalysts and process technologies is ongoing, with companies collaborating to integrate, optimize, and commercialize these processes to meet the growing demand for light olefins in the chemical industry.
