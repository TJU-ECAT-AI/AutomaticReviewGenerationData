          [1] "For polymerization, Ceresana forecasts the most dynamic development at an AAGR of 3.1%/y until 2021, with the synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene accounting for the major share."

[2] "The shift to lighter cracker feedstock results in reduced volumes of co-products. Therefore the on-purpose production of higher olefins is gaining more and more importance."

[3] "BASF has developed process technology and catalysts as well as the extraction technologies, while Linde is providing its expertise for the integration, optimization, and commercialization of the process. The new process will deliver an on-purpose route from butane to butadiene via butenes."

[4] "About 80% of all the catalysts consumed are utilized in the refining of crude oil, for example in processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, or reforming."

          Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial in the chemical industry, primarily used in polymerization processes to produce polyethylene and polypropylene. The market for these polymers is growing, with forecasts predicting a dynamic development at an annual average growth rate of 3.1% until 2021.

Production methods for light olefins are evolving due to changes in feedstock availability. Traditionally, these olefins were obtained as co-products from naphtha cracking during ethylene production. However, the shift to lighter cracker feedstocks has reduced co-product volumes, necessitating the development of on-purpose production routes for higher olefins.

One example of an on-purpose production method is the new process developed by BASF and Linde, which produces butadiene from butane via butenes. This illustrates the industry's move towards more targeted production methods for specific olefins.

While the provided information doesn't directly address the thermodynamic challenges associated with light olefin synthesis or details about temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects, it's clear that the industry is actively developing new catalysts and processes to overcome production challenges. About 80% of catalysts consumed are used in crude oil refining processes, indicating the importance of catalytic processes in the production of olefins and related products.

          轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯在化学工业中至关重要，主要用于聚合过程生产聚乙烯和聚丙烯。这些聚合物的市场正在增长，预计到2021年，年均增长率将达到3.1%。

由于原料供应的变化，轻质烯烃的生产方法正在演变。传统上，这些烯烃是在乙烯生产过程中裂解石脑油时获得的副产品。然而，转向更轻的裂解原料减少了副产品的产量，因此需要开发更高级烯烃的定向生产路线。

定向生产方法的一个例子是巴斯夫和林德开发的新工艺，通过丁烯从丁烷生产丁二烯。这说明了行业正在向更有针对性的特定烯烃生产方法转变。

虽然提供的信息没有直接涉及轻质烯烃合成相关的热力学挑战或温度、压力和烷烃链长效应的具体细节，但很明显，行业正在积极开发新的催化剂和工艺，以克服生产挑战。约80%的消耗的催化剂用于原油精炼过程，这表明催化过程在烯烃及相关产品的生产中的重要性。
