[1] "About 80% of all the catalysts consumed are utilized in the refining of crude oil, for example in processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, or reforming."

[2] "For polymerization, Ceresana forecasts the most dynamic development at an AAGR of 3.1%/y until 2021, with the synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene accounting for the major share."

[3] "The shift to lighter cracker feedstock results in reduced volumes of co-products. Therefore the on-purpose production of higher olefins is gaining more and more importance."

[4] "BASF has developed process technology and catalysts as well as the extraction technologies, while Linde is providing its expertise for the integration, optimization, and commercialization of the process. The new process will deliver an on-purpose route from butane to butadiene via butenes."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contribution to the chemical industry, their applications, market trends, key production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. However, based on the available information:

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are important in the chemical industry, particularly for polymerization. The synthesis of polyethylene and polypropylene accounts for a significant share of catalyst use in polymerization processes. 

The market for polymerization catalysts is expected to grow at an annual rate of 3.1% until 2021, indicating increasing demand for light olefins in polymer production.

There is a trend towards using lighter feedstocks in crackers, which results in reduced co-product volumes. This has led to increased importance of on-purpose production methods for higher olefins.

One example of an on-purpose production method is the process developed by BASF and Linde for producing butadiene from butane via butenes. This demonstrates the industry's efforts to develop more efficient and targeted production methods for olefins.

The document does not provide specific information on thermodynamic challenges or the effects of temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length on olefin synthesis.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于轻质烯烃对化学工业的贡献、其应用、市场趋势、主要生产方法以及与其合成相关的热力学挑战的问题。然而，根据可用信息：

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯在化学工业中非常重要，特别是在聚合反应中。聚乙烯和聚丙烯的合成占聚合催化剂使用的很大一部分。

聚合催化剂市场预计将以每年3.1%的速度增长，直到2021年，这表明聚合物生产对轻质烯烃的需求正在增加。

裂解装置使用更轻的原料的趋势导致了副产品产量的减少。这使得高级烯烃的定向生产方法变得越来越重要。

定向生产方法的一个例子是巴斯夫和林德开发的通过丁烯从丁烷生产丁二烯的工艺。这表明行业正在努力开发更高效和有针对性的烯烃生产方法。

该文档没有提供关于热力学挑战或温度、压力和烷烃链长对烯烃合成影响的具体信息。
