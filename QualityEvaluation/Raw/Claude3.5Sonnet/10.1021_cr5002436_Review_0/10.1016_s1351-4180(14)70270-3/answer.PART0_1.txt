Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, primarily used in the production of polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The market for these polymers is growing, with forecasts indicating a dynamic development in polymerization at an annual average growth rate of 3.1% until 2021.

The main production method for light olefins has traditionally been as co-products from naphtha cracking during ethylene production. However, the industry is shifting towards lighter cracker feedstocks, which results in reduced volumes of these co-products. This shift is driving the development of on-purpose production methods for higher olefins.

The synthesis of light olefins faces thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length. These factors affect the equilibrium and kinetics of the reactions. For instance, higher temperatures generally favor olefin formation but can lead to unwanted side reactions. Pressure effects depend on the specific reaction, with some dehydrogenation reactions favored by lower pressures. Alkane chain length influences the ease of C-H bond activation, with longer chains generally being more reactive.

To address these challenges, companies are developing new catalytic processes. For example, BASF and Linde are collaborating on a new process for the on-purpose production of butadiene via butenes, starting from butane. This process likely involves careful control of reaction conditions and specialized catalysts to overcome thermodynamic limitations and optimize selectivity.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的关键原料,主要用于生产聚乙烯和聚丙烯等聚合物。这些聚合物的市场正在增长,预计到2021年聚合反应将以3.1%的年均增长率动态发展。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法传统上是作为乙烯生产过程中石脑油裂解的副产品。然而,该行业正在向更轻的裂解原料转移,这导致这些副产品的产量减少。这种转变正在推动高级烯烃定向生产方法的发展。

轻质烯烃的合成面临着与温度、压力和烷烃链长相关的热力学挑战。这些因素影响反应的平衡和动力学。例如,较高的温度通常有利于烯烃的形成,但可能导致不希望的副反应。压力效应取决于具体反应,某些脱氢反应在较低压力下更有利。烷烃链长影响C-H键活化的难易程度,通常较长的链更具反应性。

为了应对这些挑战,公司正在开发新的催化工艺。例如,巴斯夫和林德正在合作开发一种新工艺,通过丁烯定向生产丁二烯,起始原料为丁烷。这个过程可能涉及对反应条件的精确控制和专用催化剂的使用,以克服热力学限制并优化选择性。
