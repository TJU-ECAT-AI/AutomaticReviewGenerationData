[1] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."

[2] "Cheap natural gas liquids put U.S. producers at a big advantage over European and Asian chemical producers that primarily use petroleum-derived feedstocks such as naphtha."

[3] "According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liquids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."

[4] "ETHYLENE CRACKERS normally have some latitude to change feedstock slates to react to changing market conditions. In recent years, they have been cracking as much ethane as they possibly can."

[5] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to. Those cracker coproducts are in short supply and are becoming increasingly costly."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry. They serve as key raw materials for a wide range of products including plastics, fibers, and other chemicals. 

The market trends for these olefins have been significantly impacted by the shale gas boom in North America. Ethylene production has become particularly cost-effective due to the abundance of cheap ethane from shale gas. This has given U.S. producers a competitive advantage over their European and Asian counterparts who rely more on naphtha cracking.

The main production method for light olefins in North America is steam cracking of natural gas liquids, particularly ethane. Ethane cracking produces primarily ethylene, while cracking of heavier feedstocks like naphtha yields more co-products such as propylene and butadiene.

A key challenge in light olefin production is the trade-off between ethylene and propylene yields. As producers shift to lighter feedstocks like ethane to maximize ethylene production, they produce less propylene as a co-product. This has led to tighter propylene supplies and higher prices.

The thermodynamics of olefin production are affected by factors like temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition. Higher temperatures generally favor the production of lighter olefins like ethylene, while longer-chain alkanes tend to produce more propylene and heavier co-products when cracked. Optimizing these parameters is crucial for maximizing desired product yields.

The document doesn't provide specific details on the exact thermodynamic challenges or the effects of pressure on olefin synthesis. However, it's clear that feedstock selection and cracking conditions play a major role in determining product ratios and economics in light olefin production.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化工行业的重要基础原料。它们是塑料、纤维和其他化学品的关键原材料。

北美页岩气繁荣对这些烯烃的市场趋势产生了重大影响。由于页岩气提供了大量廉价乙烷，乙烯生产变得特别具有成本效益。这使美国生产商相对于更依赖石脑油裂解的欧洲和亚洲同行具有竞争优势。

北美轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是蒸汽裂解天然气液体，特别是乙烷。乙烷裂解主要生产乙烯，而裂解石脑油等较重的原料则会产生更多的副产品，如丙烯和丁二烯。

轻质烯烃生产的一个关键挑战是乙烯和丙烯产量之间的权衡。随着生产商转向使用乙烷等较轻的原料以最大化乙烯产量，他们作为副产品的丙烯产量减少。这导致丙烯供应趋紧，价格上涨。

烯烃生产的热力学受温度、压力和原料组成等因素的影响。较高的温度通常有利于生产乙烯等较轻的烯烃，而较长链的烷烃在裂解时倾向于产生更多的丙烯和较重的副产品。优化这些参数对于最大化所需产品产量至关重要。

该文档没有提供关于烯烃合成的确切热力学挑战或压力效应的具体细节。然而，很明显，原料选择和裂解条件在决定轻质烯烃生产的产品比例和经济性方面起着重要作用。
