[1] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."

[2] "Cheap natural gas liquids put U.S. producers at a big advantage over European and Asian chemical producers that primarily use petroleum-derived feedstocks such as naphtha."

[3] "According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liquids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."

[4] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to. Those cracker coproducts are in short supply and are becoming increasingly costly."

[5] "Dow recently inked a licensing agreement with Honeywell's UOP engineering unit for a propane dehydrogenation unit that would add 750,000 tons of propylene capacity in Texas by 2015."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are critical feedstocks for the petrochemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of downstream chemical products and plastics. 

The market trend for light olefins in North America has shifted dramatically due to the shale gas boom. Cheap ethane from shale gas has made ethylene production very cost-competitive in the U.S. compared to naphtha-based production in Europe and Asia. This has led to significant investment in new ethylene capacity in North America.

However, the shift to ethane cracking has reduced propylene production as a co-product. This has led to tight propylene supplies and higher prices. As a result, there is growing interest in on-purpose propylene production methods like propane dehydrogenation.

The main production method for ethylene is steam cracking of hydrocarbons, primarily ethane in the U.S. For propylene, steam cracking of naphtha historically was the main source, but propane dehydrogenation is growing. 

Key thermodynamic challenges include the high temperatures required for cracking reactions (800-900°C) and the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions. Longer alkane chain lengths generally allow for milder reaction conditions but produce a more complex product mix. Pressure effects are important for controlling selectivity and preventing coke formation.

The document does not provide specific details on temperature, pressure, or chain length effects, so a more comprehensive answer to those aspects is not possible based solely on this text.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是石油化工行业的关键原料。它们被用于生产广泛的下游化学产品和塑料。

由于页岩气繁荣，北美轻质烯烃市场趋势发生了巨大变化。页岩气提供的廉价乙烷使美国的乙烯生产在成本上比欧洲和亚洲基于石脑油的生产更具竞争力。这导致了北美新增大量乙烯产能投资。

然而，转向乙烷裂解减少了丙烯作为副产品的产量。这导致丙烯供应紧张和价格上涨。因此，人们对丙烷脱氢等专门的丙烯生产方法越来越感兴趣。

乙烯的主要生产方法是碳氢化合物的蒸汽裂解，在美国主要是乙烷裂解。对于丙烯，历史上主要来源是石脑油的蒸汽裂解，但丙烷脱氢正在增长。

主要的热力学挑战包括裂解反应所需的高温（800-900°C）和脱氢反应的吸热性质。较长的烷烃链长通常允许较温和的反应条件，但会产生更复杂的产品混合物。压力效应对控制选择性和防止焦炭形成很重要。

文档没有提供关于温度、压力或链长效应的具体细节，因此仅基于这篇文章无法对这些方面给出更全面的回答。
