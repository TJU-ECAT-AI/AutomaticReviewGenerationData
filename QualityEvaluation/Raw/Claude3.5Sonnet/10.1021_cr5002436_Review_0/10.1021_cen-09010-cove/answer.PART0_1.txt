[1] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."

[2] "Cheap natural gas liquids put U.S. producers at a big advantage over European and Asian chemical producers that primarily use petroleum-derived feedstocks such as naphtha."

[3] "According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liquids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."

[4] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants arent making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to. Those cracker coproducts are in short supply and are becoming increasingly costly."

[5] "Dow plans a second propylene unit that would use its own technology."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial feedstocks for the chemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of products including plastics, solvents, and other chemicals. 

The market trend shows a shift towards using natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, as feedstock in North America due to the shale gas boom. This has given U.S. producers a significant cost advantage over their European and Asian counterparts who still rely heavily on naphtha cracking.

The main production method for ethylene in North America is steam cracking of ethane, while propylene is increasingly being produced through dedicated propane dehydrogenation units due to reduced propylene yield from ethane cracking.

Thermodynamic challenges in olefin production include high temperature requirements for cracking reactions, typically above 800°C. Pressure also plays a role, with lower pressures generally favoring olefin formation. The alkane chain length affects product distribution, with lighter feedstocks like ethane producing mostly ethylene, while heavier feedstocks yield more diverse products including propylene and aromatics.

The industry is adapting to these challenges by developing new technologies and optimizing existing processes to improve yields and energy efficiency. Companies are also investing in dedicated propylene production units to compensate for reduced propylene yield from increased ethane cracking.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业的关键原料。它们用于生产包括塑料、溶剂和其他化学品在内的广泛产品。

市场趋势显示，由于页岩气热潮，北美地区正在转向使用天然气液体，特别是乙烷作为原料。这使得美国生产商相对于仍然严重依赖石脑油裂解的欧洲和亚洲同行具有显著的成本优势。

在北美，乙烯的主要生产方法是乙烷蒸汽裂解，而由于乙烷裂解产生的丙烯产量减少，丙烯越来越多地通过专门的丙烷脱氢装置生产。

烯烃生产的热力学挑战包括裂解反应需要高温，通常超过800°C。压力也起着作用，较低的压力通常有利于烯烃的形成。烷烃链长影响产品分布，较轻的原料如乙烷主要产生乙烯，而较重的原料产生更多样化的产品，包括丙烯和芳烃。

行业正在通过开发新技术和优化现有工艺来适应这些挑战，以提高产量和能源效率。公司还在投资专门的丙烯生产装置，以弥补因增加乙烷裂解而导致的丙烯产量减少。
