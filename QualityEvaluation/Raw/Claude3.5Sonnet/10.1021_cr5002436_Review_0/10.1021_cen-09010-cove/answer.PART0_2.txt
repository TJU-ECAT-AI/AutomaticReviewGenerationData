[1] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."

[2] "Cheap natural gas liquids put U.S. producers at a big advantage over European and Asian chemical producers that primarily use petroleum-derived feedstocks such as naphtha."

[3] "According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liquids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."

[4] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants aren't making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to. Those cracker coproducts are in short supply and are becoming increasingly costly."

[5] "Dow plans a second propylene unit that would use its own technology."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry. They serve as key raw materials for producing plastics, fibers, and other chemical products. 

The market trends for these olefins have been significantly impacted by the shale gas boom in North America. Cheap natural gas liquids, particularly ethane, have given U.S. producers a major cost advantage in producing ethylene compared to producers in other regions using naphtha feedstocks. This has led to increased investment in ethylene production capacity in North America.

However, the shift towards ethane cracking has resulted in reduced production of propylene as a co-product. This has led to a tight supply and increased costs for propylene, prompting some companies to invest in on-purpose propylene production technologies like propane dehydrogenation.

The main production method for light olefins is steam cracking, where hydrocarbons are heated to very high temperatures (800-900°C) to break chemical bonds and form olefins. The feed and product slate can vary based on the feedstock used (e.g., ethane vs. naphtha).

Thermodynamic challenges in olefin production include the high temperatures required to break C-C and C-H bonds, the need for rapid cooling to prevent unwanted side reactions, and the energy-intensive separation of the resulting product mixture. The selectivity towards different olefins can be influenced by temperature, pressure, and the length of the alkane chain in the feedstock.

While the document doesn't provide specific details on the thermodynamics, it's clear that companies are investing in new technologies and optimizing processes to improve olefin production efficiency in light of changing feedstock economics.

轻烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业的重要基础原料。它们是生产塑料、纤维和其他化学产品的关键原材料。

这些烯烃的市场趋势受到北美页岩气繁荣的显著影响。廉价的天然气液体，尤其是乙烷，使美国生产商在生产乙烯方面相比其他使用石脑油原料的地区生产商具有重大成本优势。这导致了北美乙烯产能投资的增加。

然而，向乙烷裂解的转变导致了丙烯作为副产品的产量减少。这导致了丙烯供应紧张和成本增加，促使一些公司投资于定向丙烯生产技术，如丙烷脱氢。

轻烯烃的主要生产方法是蒸汽裂解，其中碳氢化合物被加热到很高的温度（800-900°C）以打破化学键并形成烯烃。根据使用的原料（如乙烷vs石脑油），进料和产品组合可能会有所不同。

烯烃生产中的热力学挑战包括打破C-C和C-H键所需的高温，需要快速冷却以防止不需要的副反应，以及能源密集型的产品混合物分离。不同烯烃的选择性可以受到温度、压力和原料中烷烃链长度的影响。

虽然文件没有提供关于热力学的具体细节，但很明显，考虑到不断变化的原料经济性，公司正在投资新技术并优化工艺以提高烯烃生产效率。
