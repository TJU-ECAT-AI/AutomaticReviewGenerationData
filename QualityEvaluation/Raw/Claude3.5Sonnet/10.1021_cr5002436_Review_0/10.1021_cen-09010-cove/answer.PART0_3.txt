[1] "The main feedstock for North American petrochemical facilities is natural gas liquids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons that is extracted from natural gas and then usually separated into its components."

[2] "ETHYLENE CRACKERS normally have some latitude to change feedstock slates to react to changing market conditions. In recent years, they have been cracking as much ethane as they possibly can."

[3] "Cracking ethane instead of heavier feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants arent making as much propylene, butadiene, and aromatics as they used to. Those cracker coproducts are in short supply and are becoming increasingly costly."

[4] "According to Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liquids and cracker economics at the consulting group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents per lb. The cash cost of using light naphtha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 68.5 cents per lb, IHS says."

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of plastics, fibers, and other materials. The market trends for these olefins have been significantly impacted by the shale gas boom in North America.

Ethylene is primarily produced through steam cracking of hydrocarbons, with ethane becoming an increasingly popular feedstock due to its low cost from shale gas. Propylene, traditionally a co-product of ethylene production, is now being produced through dedicated processes like propane dehydrogenation due to the shift towards ethane cracking.

The main production method for ethylene in North America is steam cracking of ethane, which has become more economical than naphtha cracking due to shale gas availability. This shift has led to a shortage of other co-products like propylene and butadiene.

The thermodynamic challenges in olefin production are related to the high temperatures required for cracking (around 850°C for ethane), the need for rapid quenching to prevent undesired side reactions, and the energy-intensive separation processes. The choice of feedstock (e.g., ethane vs. longer-chain alkanes) affects the product distribution and energy requirements of the process.

The industry is adapting to these challenges by investing in new ethylene crackers, propylene production units, and exploring alternative technologies to meet the changing market demands driven by shale gas availability.

轻烯烃如乙烯和丙烯是化学工业中的关键基础原料。它们用于生产广泛的塑料、纤维和其他材料。这些烯烃的市场趋势受到北美页岩气热潮的显著影响。

乙烯主要通过碳氢化合物的蒸汽裂解生产，由于页岩气带来的低成本，乙烷正成为越来越受欢迎的原料。丙烯传统上是乙烯生产的副产品，由于向乙烷裂解的转变，现在正通过专门的工艺如丙烷脱氢进行生产。

在北美，乙烯的主要生产方法是乙烷的蒸汽裂解，由于页岩气的可用性，这种方法比石脑油裂解更经济。这种转变导致了其他副产品如丙烯和丁二烯的短缺。

烯烃生产中的热力学挑战与裂解所需的高温（乙烷约850°C）、防止不良副反应的快速淬火需求，以及能源密集型分离过程有关。原料的选择（如乙烷与长链烷烃）影响产品分布和过程的能源需求。

业界正在通过投资新的乙烯裂解装置、丙烯生产装置，并探索替代技术来应对这些挑战，以满足由页岩气可用性驱动的不断变化的市场需求。
