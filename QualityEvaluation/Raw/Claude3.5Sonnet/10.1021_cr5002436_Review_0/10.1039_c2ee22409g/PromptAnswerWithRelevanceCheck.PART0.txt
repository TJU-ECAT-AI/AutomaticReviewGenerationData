[1] "The conversion of alkanes (a by-product of petroleum processing and present in natural gas) to olefins (ethylene, propylene, butene and butadiene) is in great demand in the chemical industry."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields."

[3] "The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct"
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry. They are produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and natural gas. 

The main production methods include non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges as it is endothermic and leads to unwanted byproducts that decrease yields. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 offers advantages as it is exothermic and avoids thermodynamic constraints by forming water as a byproduct. This allows for lower temperatures and pressures compared to non-oxidative routes.

The thermodynamic challenges generally increase with longer alkane chain lengths, requiring higher temperatures and pressures for dehydrogenation. Using CO2 as an oxidant helps overcome some of these challenges across different alkane feedstocks.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯在化工行业需求量很大。它们是由石油加工和天然气的副产品烷烃生产而来的。

主要的生产方法包括非氧化脱氢和氧化脱氢。非氧化脱氢面临热力学挑战,因为它是吸热反应,并会产生不必要的副产品降低收率。

使用二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢具有优势,因为它是放热反应,并通过形成水作为副产品避免了热力学限制。与非氧化路线相比,这允许在较低的温度和压力下进行反应。

随着烷烃链长的增加,热力学挑战通常会增加,需要更高的温度和压力进行脱氢。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂有助于克服不同烷烃原料所面临的一些挑战。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry as they are key building blocks for many chemical products. They are typically produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and natural gas.

The main production methods for light olefins include:

1. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation: This is an endothermic process that faces thermodynamic constraints and leads to carbon formation, reducing alkene yields.

2. CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation: This is an exothermic process that avoids the thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative routes. It produces water as a byproduct instead of carbon.

The key thermodynamic challenges are:

- High temperatures required for endothermic non-oxidative dehydrogenation
- Carbon formation at high temperatures 
- Thermodynamic equilibrium limitations for longer alkane chain lengths

Using CO2 as an oxidant helps overcome some of these challenges by making the reaction exothermic and avoiding carbon formation. However, the literature does not provide specific details on temperature, pressure, or chain length effects.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯在化学工业中需求量很大,因为它们是许多化学产品的关键构建模块。它们通常由石油加工和天然气的副产品烷烃生产。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法包括:

1. 非氧化脱氢:这是一个吸热过程,面临热力学限制,并导致碳的形成,降低烯烃产率。

2. 二氧化碳介导的氧化脱氢:这是一个放热过程,避免了非氧化路线的热力学限制。它产生水作为副产品,而不是碳。

主要的热力学挑战是:

- 吸热非氧化脱氢需要高温
- 高温下碳的形成
- 较长烷烃链长度的热力学平衡限制

使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂有助于克服其中一些挑战,因为它使反应成为放热反应并避免碳的形成。然而,文献中没有提供关于温度、压力或链长效应的具体细节。

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are in high demand in the chemical industry, as they are key building blocks for many products. They are typically produced by converting alkanes derived from petroleum processing and natural gas. 

Traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation to produce olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, as the reactions are endothermic and prone to side reactions that decrease yields. The process requires high temperatures and often leads to carbon formation and production of lower molecular weight alkanes as byproducts.

CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation is emerging as a promising alternative production method. This approach is exothermic and avoids some of the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes. It produces water as a byproduct instead of carbon deposits. While not explicitly stated, this likely allows for lower reaction temperatures and pressures compared to traditional methods.

The document does not provide specific details on how alkane chain length affects the process or precise temperature/pressure conditions. However, it implies that longer chain alkanes (propane, butane etc.) can be converted to corresponding olefins using similar oxidative dehydrogenation approaches with CO2.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯在化学工业中需求量很大，因为它们是许多产品的关键构建块。它们通常是通过转化石油加工和天然气中的烷烃生产的。

传统的非氧化脱氢生产烯烃面临热力学挑战，因为这些反应是吸热的，并且容易发生降低产率的副反应。该过程需要高温，并经常导致碳的形成和低分子量烷烃副产品的产生。

以CO2为介质的氧化脱氢正在成为一种有前景的替代生产方法。这种方法是放热的，避免了非氧化路线的一些热力学限制。它产生水作为副产品，而不是碳沉积。虽然没有明确说明，但这可能允许与传统方法相比更低的反应温度和压力。

文献没有提供烷烃链长如何影响该过程的具体细节，或精确的温度/压力条件。然而，它暗示较长链的烷烃（丙烷、丁烷等）可以使用类似的CO2氧化脱氢方法转化为相应的烯烃。

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are in high demand in the chemical industry as they are key building blocks for many chemical products. They are primarily produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and components of natural gas. 

The main production methods include non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges as it is endothermic and leads to carbon formation and production of lower alkanes, reducing olefin yields. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as an oxidant offers advantages as it is exothermic and avoids thermodynamic constraints by forming water as a byproduct. This allows for more favorable reaction conditions in terms of temperature and pressure.

The effects of temperature, pressure and alkane chain length are not explicitly discussed in the given text. However, it can be inferred that higher temperatures would favor endothermic non-oxidative routes, while the exothermic oxidative route may allow for lower temperatures. Longer alkane chains would likely be more difficult to dehydrogenate due to stronger C-C bonds.
