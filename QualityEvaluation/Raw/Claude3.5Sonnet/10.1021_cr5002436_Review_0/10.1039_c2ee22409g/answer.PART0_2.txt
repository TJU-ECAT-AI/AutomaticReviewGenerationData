Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are in high demand in the chemical industry. They are produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and present in natural gas. 

The main production methods include non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges as it is endothermic and leads to carbon formation and lower alkane yields. 

CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation offers a more attractive route, as it is exothermic and avoids thermodynamic constraints by forming water as a byproduct. This allows for lower temperatures and pressures.

The literature does not provide specific details on how temperature, pressure and alkane chain length affect the synthesis. However, it implies that longer chain alkanes may face more challenges in dehydrogenation due to increased carbon formation. Overall, CO2-mediated processes aim to overcome the temperature and pressure limitations of conventional methods.

轻烯烃如丙烯和乙烯在化工行业需求量很大。它们是由烷烃生产的,烷烃是石油加工的副产品,也存在于天然气中。

主要的生产方法包括非氧化脱氢和氧化脱氢。非氧化脱氢面临热力学挑战,因为它是吸热反应,会导致碳的形成和低级烷烃产率降低。

以CO2为介质的氧化脱氢提供了一种更有吸引力的路线,因为它是放热反应,并通过形成水作为副产品避免了热力学限制。这允许在较低的温度和压力下进行。

文献没有提供温度、压力和烷烃链长如何影响合成的具体细节。但它暗示,由于碳形成增加,较长链的烷烃在脱氢过程中可能面临更多挑战。总的来说,以CO2为介质的工艺旨在克服传统方法的温度和压力限制。
