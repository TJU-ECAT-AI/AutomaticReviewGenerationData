Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry. They are produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and natural gas. 

The main production methods include non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges as it is endothermic and leads to unwanted byproducts that decrease yields. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 offers advantages as it is exothermic and avoids thermodynamic constraints by forming water as a byproduct. This allows for lower temperatures and pressures compared to non-oxidative routes.

The thermodynamic challenges generally increase with longer alkane chain lengths, requiring higher temperatures and pressures for dehydrogenation. Using CO2 as an oxidant helps overcome some of these challenges across different alkane feedstocks.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯在化工行业需求量很大。它们是由石油加工和天然气的副产品烷烃生产而来的。

主要的生产方法包括非氧化脱氢和氧化脱氢。非氧化脱氢面临热力学挑战,因为它是吸热反应,并会产生不必要的副产品降低收率。

使用二氧化碳进行氧化脱氢具有优势,因为它是放热反应,并通过形成水作为副产品避免了热力学限制。与非氧化路线相比,这允许在较低的温度和压力下进行反应。

随着烷烃链长的增加,热力学挑战通常会增加,需要更高的温度和压力进行脱氢。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂有助于克服不同烷烃原料所面临的一些挑战。
