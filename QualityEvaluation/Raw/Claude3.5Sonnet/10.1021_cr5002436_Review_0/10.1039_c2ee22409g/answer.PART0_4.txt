Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are in high demand in the chemical industry as they are key building blocks for many chemical products. They are primarily produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and components of natural gas. 

The main production methods include non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation faces thermodynamic challenges as it is endothermic and leads to carbon formation and production of lower alkanes, reducing olefin yields. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as an oxidant offers advantages as it is exothermic and avoids thermodynamic constraints by forming water as a byproduct. This allows for more favorable reaction conditions in terms of temperature and pressure.

The effects of temperature, pressure and alkane chain length are not explicitly discussed in the given text. However, it can be inferred that higher temperatures would favor endothermic non-oxidative routes, while the exothermic oxidative route may allow for lower temperatures. Longer alkane chains would likely be more difficult to dehydrogenate due to stronger C-C bonds.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯在化工行业需求量很大,因为它们是许多化学品的关键原料。它们主要由烷烃生产,烷烃是石油加工的副产品,也是天然气的成分。

主要生产方法包括非氧化脱氢和氧化脱氢。非氧化脱氢面临热力学挑战,因为它是吸热反应,会导致碳的形成和低级烷烃的产生,从而降低烯烃产率。

以CO2为氧化剂的氧化脱氢提供了优势,因为它是放热反应,并通过形成水作为副产品避免了热力学限制。这使得在温度和压力方面可以有更有利的反应条件。

文中没有明确讨论温度、压力和烷烃链长的影响。但可以推断,较高的温度有利于吸热的非氧化路线,而放热的氧化路线可能允许较低的温度。较长的烷烃链由于C-C键更强,可能更难脱氢。
