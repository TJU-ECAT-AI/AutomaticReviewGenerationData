Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are in high demand in the chemical industry, as they are key building blocks for many products. They are typically produced by converting alkanes derived from petroleum processing and natural gas. 

Traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation to produce olefins faces thermodynamic challenges, as the reactions are endothermic and prone to side reactions that decrease yields. The process requires high temperatures and often leads to carbon formation and production of lower molecular weight alkanes as byproducts.

CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation is emerging as a promising alternative production method. This approach is exothermic and avoids some of the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes. It produces water as a byproduct instead of carbon deposits. While not explicitly stated, this likely allows for lower reaction temperatures and pressures compared to traditional methods.

The document does not provide specific details on how alkane chain length affects the process or precise temperature/pressure conditions. However, it implies that longer chain alkanes (propane, butane etc.) can be converted to corresponding olefins using similar oxidative dehydrogenation approaches with CO2.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯在化学工业中需求量很大，因为它们是许多产品的关键构建块。它们通常是通过转化石油加工和天然气中的烷烃生产的。

传统的非氧化脱氢生产烯烃面临热力学挑战，因为这些反应是吸热的，并且容易发生降低产率的副反应。该过程需要高温，并经常导致碳的形成和低分子量烷烃副产品的产生。

以CO2为介质的氧化脱氢正在成为一种有前景的替代生产方法。这种方法是放热的，避免了非氧化路线的一些热力学限制。它产生水作为副产品，而不是碳沉积。虽然没有明确说明，但这可能允许与传统方法相比更低的反应温度和压力。

文献没有提供烷烃链长如何影响该过程的具体细节，或精确的温度/压力条件。然而，它暗示较长链的烷烃（丙烷、丁烷等）可以使用类似的CO2氧化脱氢方法转化为相应的烯烃。
