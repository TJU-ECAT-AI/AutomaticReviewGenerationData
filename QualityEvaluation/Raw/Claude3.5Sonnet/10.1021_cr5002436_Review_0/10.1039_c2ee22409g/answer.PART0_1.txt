Light olefins like ethylene and propylene are in high demand in the chemical industry as they are key building blocks for many chemical products. They are typically produced from alkanes, which are byproducts of petroleum processing and natural gas.

The main production methods for light olefins include:

1. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation: This is an endothermic process that faces thermodynamic constraints and leads to carbon formation, reducing alkene yields.

2. CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation: This is an exothermic process that avoids the thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative routes. It produces water as a byproduct instead of carbon.

The key thermodynamic challenges are:

- High temperatures required for endothermic non-oxidative dehydrogenation
- Carbon formation at high temperatures 
- Thermodynamic equilibrium limitations for longer alkane chain lengths

Using CO2 as an oxidant helps overcome some of these challenges by making the reaction exothermic and avoiding carbon formation. However, the literature does not provide specific details on temperature, pressure, or chain length effects.

轻质烯烃如乙烯和丙烯在化学工业中需求量很大,因为它们是许多化学产品的关键构建模块。它们通常由石油加工和天然气的副产品烷烃生产。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法包括:

1. 非氧化脱氢:这是一个吸热过程,面临热力学限制,并导致碳的形成,降低烯烃产率。

2. 二氧化碳介导的氧化脱氢:这是一个放热过程,避免了非氧化路线的热力学限制。它产生水作为副产品,而不是碳。

主要的热力学挑战是:

- 吸热非氧化脱氢需要高温
- 高温下碳的形成
- 较长烷烃链长度的热力学平衡限制

使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂有助于克服其中一些挑战,因为它使反应成为放热反应并避免碳的形成。然而,文献中没有提供关于温度、压力或链长效应的具体细节。
