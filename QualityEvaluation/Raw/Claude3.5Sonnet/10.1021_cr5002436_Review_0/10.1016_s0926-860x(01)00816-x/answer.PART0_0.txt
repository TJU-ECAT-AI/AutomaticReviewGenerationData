Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, with significant production volumes. In 2000, about 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation alone. 

The main production method for light olefins is catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, this process faces thermodynamic challenges, particularly for shorter chain alkanes. The equilibrium constant for dehydrogenation increases with carbon number, meaning longer chain alkanes are easier to dehydrogenate.

Temperature and pressure play critical roles in the dehydrogenation process. Higher temperatures are required for shorter chain alkanes to achieve the same conversion levels as longer chains. For example, propane dehydrogenation needs at least 580°C for 40% conversion, while dodecane can achieve the same conversion at only 450°C.

Commercial processes reflect these thermodynamic constraints. Propane and butane dehydrogenation typically achieve 30-60% per-pass conversions, while C10-C14 paraffin dehydrogenation operates at 10-20% conversion levels.

These thermodynamic challenges drive ongoing research into alternative production methods and catalyst improvements to enhance light olefin yields and process efficiency.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料,产量巨大。仅2000年,通过催化脱氢就生产了约700万吨C3-C4烯烃。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是烷烃的催化脱氢。但这个过程面临热力学挑战,尤其是对短链烷烃而言。脱氢的平衡常数随碳数增加而增加,这意味着长链烷烃更容易脱氢。

温度和压力在脱氢过程中起着关键作用。短链烷烃需要更高的温度才能达到与长链相同的转化率。例如,丙烷脱氢需要至少580°C才能达到40%的转化率,而十二烷只需450°C就能达到同样的转化率。

商业过程反映了这些热力学限制。丙烷和丁烷脱氢通常能达到30-60%的单程转化率,而C10-C14石蜡脱氢的转化率为10-20%。

这些热力学挑战推动了对替代生产方法和催化剂改进的持续研究,以提高轻质烯烃产率和工艺效率。
