[1] "In the year 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3C4 olefins and 2 million metric tons of C10C14 range olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[3] "Fig. 4 shows the temperatures required to achieve 1040% equilibrium conversion based on these equilibrium constants. Fig. 4 indicates that the temperature required for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is much higher than for heavy paraffins. For 40% conversion, for example, the dehydrogenation of propane requires a temperature of at least about 580 C, while dodecane can be theoretically dehydrogenated to the same extent at only 450 C."

[4] "The equilibrium conversion increases at higher temperatures, but side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation are also accelerated. Thus, extrapolation directly from heavy olefins to light olefins cannot be done without taking other factors into consideration."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, with significant production volumes and diverse applications. In 2000, catalytic dehydrogenation produced nearly 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins alone.

The main production method for these light olefins is catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, this process faces several thermodynamic challenges:

1. Temperature effects: Light paraffins require much higher temperatures for dehydrogenation compared to heavy paraffins. For example, propane needs about 580°C for 40% conversion, while dodecane only needs 450°C for the same conversion.

2. Pressure effects: Lower pressures favor higher conversions due to Le Chatelier's principle, as dehydrogenation increases the number of moles.

3. Alkane chain length effects: Longer chain alkanes are easier to dehydrogenate, achieving higher conversions at lower temperatures.

4. Equilibrium limitations: Commercial processes for propane and butane dehydrogenation typically achieve 30-60% per-pass conversions, while C10-C14 paraffins only reach 10-20% conversions.

5. Side reactions: Higher temperatures increase conversion but also accelerate unwanted side reactions, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

These challenges make it difficult to directly extrapolate processes from heavy to light olefins, necessitating careful optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst design for efficient light olefin production.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化学工业中的关键原料，产量巨大，应用广泛。仅在2000年，通过催化脱氢就生产了近700万公吨的C3-C4烯烃。

这些轻质烯烃的主要生产方法是烷烃的催化脱氢。然而，这个过程面临几个热力学挑战：

1. 温度影响：轻质烷烃需要比重质烷烃更高的脱氢温度。例如，丙烷需要约580°C才能达到40%的转化率，而十二烷只需450°C就能达到相同的转化率。

2. 压力影响：根据勒夏特列原理，较低的压力有利于更高的转化率，因为脱氢会增加摩尔数。

3. 烷烃链长影响：较长链的烷烃更容易脱氢，在较低温度下就能达到更高的转化率。

4. 平衡限制：丙烷和丁烷脱氢的商业过程通常能达到30-60%的单程转化率，而C10-C14烷烃只能达到10-20%的转化率。

5. 副反应：更高的温度会增加转化率，但也会加速不需要的副反应、积碳形成和催化剂失活。

这些挑战使得难以直接将重质烯烃的工艺外推到轻质烯烃，需要仔细优化反应条件和催化剂设计，以实现高效的轻质烯烃生产。
