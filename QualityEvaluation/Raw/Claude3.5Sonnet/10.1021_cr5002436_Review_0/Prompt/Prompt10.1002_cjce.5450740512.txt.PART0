Reaction-Reheat Paraffin Dehydrogenation System

The classical fixed bed C3-C4 
paraffin dehydrogenation process is a cyclic operation in which the reactor alternates 
between reaction and reheat cycles. During the reheat cycle, the necessary energy for the dehydrogenation reaction is 
stored in the fixed bed by passing hot air through it. In this established technology, both the hydrocarbon reactant and 
the reheat hot air are fed into the fixed bed from the same end (top) of the reactor. This is termed parallel flow (cocurrent) 
operation. An alternative feeding fixed bed has the hydrocarbon reactant and the reheat air entering from the opposite 
ends of the reactor. This is termed reverse flow (countercurrent) operation. This alternate creates an ideal temperature 
profile for an equilibrium limited endothermic reaction (rising temperature profile along the reactor). The transient flow 
behavior of both parallel and reverse flow reactors has been modelled and the dynamics of temperature profile develop- 
ment for both concepts have been analyzed. Based upon the model predictions, the characteristics as well as the reactor 
stability of the both concepts have been discussed. 
 
Le procede classique de deshydrogenation des paraffines C,-C, 
en lit fixe est un procede cyclique dans lequel le reac- 
teur alterne entre le mode reactif et les cycles de rechauffement. Durant le cycle de rechauffement, Ienergie necessaire 
pour la reaction de deshydrogenation est emmagasinee dans le lit fixe par de lair chaud circulant dans le lit. Dans cette 
technologie qui est bien etablie, le reactif dhydrocarbure et Iair chaud entre dans le lit fixe par la mCme extremite

paraffin dehydrogenation. 
ransient operations of catalytic fixed bed reactors are 
T 
receiving increasing attention due to the potential for 
improved performance. Two basic methods of achieving a 
transient operation have been reported in the literature; by 
forced cycling of feed compositions or temperature 
(Silveston, 1987) 
and by reversing 
the direction 
of the reactant 
flow into the reactor (Boreskov and Matros, 1983; Matros 
et al., 1984, 1988). Although improved performance has 
been reported for transient operation by both methods, the 
second method of achieving a transient operation is more 
suitable for the commercial applications. In addition to 
improved reactor performance, more efficient energy utiliza- 
tion and favorable temperature profiles can be considered as 
the other additional advantages of the second method. 
While transient operation is being studied as a new reac- 
tion engineering 
phenomenon, there are certain commercial 
fixed bed catalytic processes which are already transient in 
nature due to their cyclic operation. For these processes, the 
reactor is cycled between reaction and reheat or regenera- 
tion modes with different fluids (eg. hydrocarbon and air) 
flowing through the reactor in alternating cycles. The use of 
two different fluids distinguishes this class of reactors from 
the more well known reverse flow systems where the 
feedstock direction to the reactor is periodically reversed. 
The duration of each cycle is short enough to make them 
truly transient and distinguish them from the more conven- 
tional fixed bed reaction systems 
with periodic regeneration. 
The most important example of this type of process are the 
fixed bed C3-C, paraffin dehydrogenation processes 
(CATOFINR 
and CATADIENER).

A few commercial applications of the transient operation 
(reverse feed flow) concept have been reported by Matros 
and his co-authors in Eastern Europe and Russia (Boreskov 
and Matros, 1983; Matros et al., 1984, 1988). All of these 
applications involve exothermic systems. The CATOFINR 
process has been operated commercially 
for over 40 years as 
an endothermic transient fixed bed reactor system. Recent 
developmental efforts by a team of engineers from ABB 
Lummus Global Inc. and United Catalyst Inc., working in 
conjunction with engineers from North Sea Petrochemicals 
VOF and their parent companies, have produced a major 
technological advance. As a result of modelling efforts, the 
flow directions under cyclic operation have been changed 
resulting in significant improvements in the reactor perfor- 
mance. The first commercial 
application 
of the countercurrent 
or Reverse Flow CATOFINR 
technology for propane dehy- 
drogenation will be in operation in early 1996. 
This paper will discuss the modeling and simulations of 
the cyclic; unsteady state fixed bed CATOFINR 
process for 
C,-C, dehydrogenation operating under both the conven- 
tional parallel (cocurrent) flow and improved reverse 
(counter-current) flow conditions. The dynamics of the 
cyclic behavior of the process and how the reverse flow 
option generates favorable operational conditions and 
improved 
performance will be examined in detail. In addition, 
the reactor stability 
under cyclic conditions will be discussed. 
Most of the works done so far on the reverse flow concept 
have concentrated on exothermic systems, such as SO, oxi- 
dation. Literature references have reported the possible 
application of reverse flow for ethylbenzene dehydrogena- 
tion (Hayes et al., 1992; Snyder and Subramaniam, 1994). 
The present work is the first extensive study on C3-C, dehy- 
drogenation which involves a fundamental reactor and 
kinetic modeling of both the reaction and the reheat cycle.

Description of the process 
The C 
ATOFINR fixed bed dehydrogenation process for 
C,-, 
paraffin is a cyclic operation in which the reactor 
alternates between reaction and reheat cycles. Reaction is 
carried out at approximately 6

 and under vacuum in 
order to achieve high conversion and selectivity in light of 
the dehydrogenation 
equilibrium. 
The heat for the endothermic 
reaction is supplied by the thermal energy of the solids 
themselves. 
In commercial 
operation, between 3 and 7 reactors 
are operated in parallel on alternating cycles to achieve con- 
tinuous operation for the entire plant. As the reaction pro- 
ceeds, the heat content of the catalyst and hence the temper- 
ature level is reduced, leading to reduced reaction. At some 
point, the temperature level within the bed becomes insuffi- 
cient to sustain commercially desired levels of conversion 
and the bed must be reheated. That particular bed is then 
taken offline, purged, and reheated using a hot air stream to 
both provide sensible heat and remove the small amount of 
coke deposited during the reaction cycle. The air stream is 
preheated in a common unit and then fed to a header supply- 
ing all the reactors. Within each reactor, fuel gas can be 
injected into flowing air stream to allow for individual con- 
trol of the heat input to that reactor if desired. It is important 
to note that, given the large amount of catalyst relative to 
total hydrocarbon flow in any single cycle, the amount of 
coke deposited on the catalyst is small and does not impact 
the reaction kinetics in any way over the duration of the 
cycle. The coke combusted during the reheat cycle does, 
however, represent a valuable heat source. Following the air 
cycle, the catalyst is reduced using a hydrogen stream. 
Additional heat for the bed is realized as the oxygen released 
during the reduction combusts the hydrogen present. At this 
point, the bed is ready to be returned to reaction service. 
A typical reactor cycle duration is on the order of 24 min- 
utes. Some portion (30 to 50%) of that time is spent in the 
reaction mode, some fraction (25 to 30%) in the reheat 
mode, with the balance of the time taken for purging, cata- 
lyst reduction, and valve switching. Exact sequencing is a 
design variable. Fast acting, tight shutoff valves are used to 
separate the flows in different cycles. The entire process is 
controlled through a computer controlled cycle timer that 
coordinates reactor switching. In the over 40 years of com- 
mercial operation, there has not been one accident due to 
airlhydrocarbon contact. 
Mathematical modelling 
In our earlier communications (Gartside et al. 1993, 
1994) the development of fundamental modelling was 
briefly discussed. There were two key decisions 
made in the 
early stages of model development 
that dramatically impact 
the model utilization. These are: 
a. Separate models were developed for the reaction and 
reheat operations. Each model is distinct and can be used 
separately. 
Cyclic operation is simulated via file transfer. 
b. Each model can be characterized as a true flow model. 
Actual reactor goemetries and flows are used instead of 
the more common space velocity/ unit cross sectional 
area concept. This allows specification of varying geom- 
etry sections with varying catalyst concentrations 
that is 
invaluable in designing commercial reactor systems. 
A one-dimensional, heterogeneous fixed bed reactor 
model was used for both reaction and reheat cycles. Since 
plant operation is adiabatic, a one dimensional model was 
deemed sufficient to describe the process. As stated abovc. 
each model can be used separately 
to simulate 
the performance 
of each cycle starting with known initial conditions. Each 
model has its own data file which contains the appropriate 
information for the process involved such as operating condi- 
tions, kinetic constants, etc. as well as the data for twelve pro- 
files along the reactor. These profiles allow one to impose an 
initial bed temperature profile or transfer a profile generated 
by the previous (reaction or reheat) cycle. Profiles also allow 
one to vary some of the important reactor properties such as 
reactor diameter, catalyst concentration and activity (including 
aging), bed porosity, etc. along the reactor length. The data file 
for the reheat cycle also allows one to vary gas and fuel gas 
flow conditions as 
well as the duration of fuel gas during the 
cycle. This mimics the commercial practice. In the output file, 
both instantaneous and time averaged performance are sum- 
marized. The amounts of energy lost by the bed and the 
amount consumed by the chemical reactions are also calculat- 
ed to monitor the internal energy balance within the cycle. 
The two models can be linked through a file transfer, 
which allows the simulation of actual cycles and the study 
of the transient behavior of the process from cycle to cycle 
without the requirement of specific heat balance agreement 
between reaction and reheat cycles. Each cycle is, however, 
in internal heat balance. The temperature and coke profiles 
generated at the end of one cycle are used as the input to the 
other cycle and vice versa. Thus, the main benefits from the 
model can be obtained through sequential 
cyclic simulations 
like a real operation. The first reaction cycle starts with a 
specified bed temperature profile and at the end of this 
cycle, new bed temperature and coke profiles are generated. 
The reheat cycle starts with these new profiles and at the end 
of that cycle, new profiles are generated which will be the 
starting profiles for the following reaction cycle. Thus, the 
sequential reaction-reheat simulations can be carried out 
until the so called cyclic steady state profiles are reached.

In addition to the same assumptions made in the deriva- 
tion of hydrocarbon reaction model, the following are the 
additional assumptions for the reheat cycle. 
- 
Coke is made only of carbon and hydrogen and undergoes 
complete combustion. 
- 
Hydrogen, CH4 and propane are options as fuel gas; it is 
also assumed that the fuel gas combustion goes directly to 
CO, and H,O. Fuel gas combustion can take place in the 
gas phase or within the catalyst bed. Separate kinetics are 
incorporated for combustion in each. 
The mass balance equation for oxygen on the catalyst sur- 
face accounts for the external mass transfer effect in 0, 
transfer from the gas phase to the catalyst surface. 
Since the process is transient, the mass and energy bal- 
ance equations for fluid phases are in reality partial differ- 
ential equations which include a time dependent term. The 
method of characteristics was used as the numerical tech- 
nique to solve these partial differential equations. The gas 
phase partial differential equations were reduced to ordi- 
nary differential equations along the characteristics 
(Acrivos, 1956; Liu and Amudson, 1962; Hatcher et al., 
1978). The reduced equations (ordinary differential equa- 
tions) for the fluid phase are presented above. These ordi- 
nary differential equations were solved numerically by the 
Runga-Kutta-Gill routine. The conceptual procedure is to 
set the initial bed temperature and the coke profiles along 
the length of the reactor at time zero. The set of mass and 
energy balance equations for the fluid phase are solved 
numerically. Then, time is incremented one step, the values 
of bed temperature and coke profiles are computed for each 
axial position from the mass and energy balance equations 
for the solid phases. Thereafter, the process of increment- 
ing time and marching along the axial position is repeated 
until the end of the cycle. 
The actual kinetic model developed 
resulted in a total of 19 
reactions covering 
the dehydrogenation 
of propane, isobutane 
and n-butane, as well as coking and both catalytic and ther- 
mal cracking. The reactions for the hydrocarbon cycle are:

Reaction kinetics used in the simulation 
have been devel- 
oped from extensive laboratory data obtained in a small 
integral fixed bed reactor using actual commercial catalyst 
samples. Those kinetic studies covered an extensive range 
of pressure, temperature, space time, and compositional 
variables. Special attention was paid to the important side 
reactions, including coking.

THE CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, VOLUME 74, OCTOBER, 1996 
The kinetics of fuel gas combustion are based upon labo- 
ratory tests on propane, methane, and hydrogen combustion 
performed at Lummus Global. The mass and heat transfer 
coefficients were estimated from the correlations given by 
Froment and Bischoff (1 990). The other physical parame- 
ters, such as viscosity, enthalpy, etc, used are from the cor- 
relations given by Reid et al. (1 987). During the numerical 
solutions, physical and thermodynamic properties are recal- 
culated in every increment in order to incorporate the effects 
of temperature and composition. 
A brief summary of the basic characteristics of the model 
can be summarized as follows: 
- Simulates reaction and regeneration cycles separately. 
Sequential simulation gives a real life representation of 
the process. 
- Based upon a fundamental kinetic model determined 
with extensive laboratory data using commercial catalyst. 
- Independent energy accounts for each cycle indicate the 
soundness of fundamentals of the model and numerical 
technique used. 
- Includes prediction of coke laydown along the reactor 
which is very important for thermal stability analysis of 
the reactor. 
- Accounts for deactivation by coke. 
- It has the feasibility to explore new reactor configurations 
and conditions by specifying 12 axial profiles along the 
reactor as well as reheat cycle gas and fuel propedes dur- 
ing the cycle. These 12 axial profiles includes solid temper- 
ature profiles, coke profiles, inert and catalyst concentra- 
tions, reactor diameter, catalyst activity along the reactor. 
- Performance of the model has been fully tested against 
pilot plant and commercial data. 
Dynamics and temperature profile development 
In any cyclic process, the ultimate performance is deter- 
mined by the complex interaction between a number of vari- 
ables. The performance of the dehydrogenation system is 
intimately tied to the axial temperature profile that is devel- 
oped. In a transient system such as CATOFINR, 
there is not 
one temperature profile but a continuously changing temper- 
ature profile resulting from the Convective transfer of heat 
axially along the catalyst bed and either the gradual removal 
of heat from the bed by reaction or the gradual addition of 
heat to the bed from either the sensible heat of the air stream 
or coke combustion. Dependent upon the cycle length, an 
operating temperature envelope is defined and under 
cyclic steady state conditions, the process operates between 
the two extremes defined by the profiles at the end of reac- 
tion cycle (HC off) and the end of the reheat cycle (HC on). 
The reaction temperature profiles achieved are deter- 
mined by a combination of 
a. Reaction kinetics, which defines both where heat is 
removed from the bed and where coke is deposited along 
the bed and heat subsequently released during reheat, and 
b. hydrodynamics, which determines the convective heat 
movements through the bed during both reaction and 
reheat cycles. 
There are a large number of variables that can be altered to 
achieve optimal reactor performance. Examples are: 
- feed and air flow rates 
- timing of reaction and reheat cycles 
- catalyst volume (thermal 
inertia), composition, and catalyst!

All of these variables are strongly interrelated. It is essen-

Model (TFM) satisfies these requirements.

ture profile in each case based on the simulation results. Thc

tions for propane dehydrogenation only. These operations 
are shown diagrammatically in Figure 1. The simulations

Before specifically discussing the actual operation, it is 
important to note the influence of hydrodynamics on the 
development of the temperature 
profile. The CATOFINR 
sys- 
tem uses the thermal energy stored in the packed bed of solids 
(catalyst and inert) as the heat source for the endothermic 
reaction. It has, by design, a very large mass of solids within 
the reactor. In fact, the mass of solids withm the reactor is 25 
or more times the mass of hydrocarbon 
that contacts 
the solids 
during a typical reaction cycle. For short cycles, the heat sup 
plied by the reheat gas or the heat removed by reaction will 
affect only a portion of the solid bed. As the solid bed experi- 
ences varying cycles of hot reheat gas and cooler hydrocar- 
bons undergoing endothermic reaction, alternating waves or 
thermal fronts will be set up within the bed. The shape and 
periodicity of those waves will be determined 
primarily by: 
- 
the direction and relative flow rates of hydrocarbon and 
reheat gas (air), 
- 
the cycle length, 
- 
the uniformity of heat removal (reaction) over the catalyst 
- 
the profile of heat provided internally within the bed 
- 
the thermal inertia of the bed of solids, 
Only for long cycle operation, where the cycle length is 
longer than a characteristic thermal penetration time of 
the bed, will thermal waves not be present. 
bed, 
(combustion of coke), 
PARALLEL 
FLOW 
In conventional parallel (cocurrent) flow operation, the 
hydrocarbon feed and the reheat hot air alternately are fed 
into the reactor from the same side (top of the reactor) and 
produce a temperature envelope such as that shown in 
Figure 2. The reaction cycle starts from the upper curve (t = 
0 min). At the end of the reaction cycle, the bed temperature 
has dropped due to the endothermic reaction. The tempera- 
ture profile for this case is represented by the lower curve (t 
= 9 rnin). The reheat cycle then follows and the bed temper- 
ature profile is raised and the upper curve is re-established 
at the end of the reheat cycle. The process cycles between 
these two profiles in cyclic steady state. Note that there 
are thermal waves (areas of temperature rise and fall) with- 
in the bed created by the alternating nature of the operation. 
Consider first what happens during a typical cycle (both 
reaction and reheat). The initial flow of hydrocarbon con- 
tacts the top of the catalyst bed which has been reheated to 
a temperature of approximately 635C during the previous 
reheat cycle. During any time increment the gas rapidly 
reaches the solid temperature because the high mass ratio of 
solid to hydrocarbon 
provides a significant 
heat transfer area 
and high thermal inertia. The combination of high tempera- 
ture and high feed concentration produces a very high reac- 
tion rate and the reaction moves rapidly toward equilibrium. 
The reaction mixture continues to react as it moves deeper 
into the catalyst bed. At some depth, the catalyst bed tem- 
perature profile drops as a result of the heat removal by reac- 
tion during the previous reaction cycle. This penetration 
depth is set as a result of the interaction of flow rates and 
cycle times. At that point, the conversion is limited by equi- 
librium as a result of the falling temperatures if it has not 
reached equilibrium 
already. The dehydrogenation 
reactions 
are slowed dramatically. For the balance of the bed, the 
flowing gas transfers heat convectively, but endothermic 
reaction heat removal due to dehydrogenation is limited.

Figure 2 -Typical

As the reaction proceeds, more and more heat is with- 
drawn from the top of the bed given the higher extent of ini- 
tial reaction at that point. Reaction moves deeper into the 
bed since temperatures (and hence rate) have been reduced 
near the inlet. Further, some heat has been transferred con- 
vectively axially. 
Figures 3a and 3b show the progression of 
the comparative temperature and conversion profiles with 
time over a reaction cycle length of 9 minutes. The conver- 
sion and selectivity of the reacting mixture continually 
change. In the commercial reactor design, parameters are 
selected to keep these values within acceptable limits. 
At the end of the reaction cycle, after a hydrocarbon 
purge, 
reheat gas (hot air) is used to re-establish the temperature 
pro- 
file. Initially the hot air transfers heat convectively and com- 
busts the coke laid down during the reaction cycle. The axial 
coke profile along the reactor is defined by reaction kinetics. 
That profile determines the location of the heat released by 
coke combustion whch in t

impact the temperature pro- 
file which in turn impacts the reaction profile. The reheat gas 
flow continues for the balance of the cycle transferring its 
sensible heat to the bed and pushing heat through the bed 
convectively. In some commercial applications fuel gas is 
added to the air stream to provide additional heat. 
Figure 4 illustrates how this so called cyclic steady 
state bed temperature profile is developed starting with an 
isothermal bed of solids at 525C and under cocurrent flow 
of hydrocarbon and reheat air. The conditions used in the 
simulation are summarized at the beginning of the section. 
Reaction cycle #I (Figure 4a) 
Initial bed temperature is 525C and uniform. HC feed 
contacts the catalyst bed at 580C, and passes through the 
bed for 9 min. At the end of the 9 min., the bed temperature 
has dropped due to endothermic nature of the reaction (pro- 
file HC end). The drop near the inlet is greater due to the 
greater extent of reaction 
that occurred at that point. The tem- 
perature profile rises gradually axially because of reduced 
reaction deeper in the bed resulting from the decrease in 
reaction rate due to the approach to equilibrium. A valley is 
created close to the top of the catalyst bed. The end of the 
reaction cycle is the starting point for the reheat cycle.

Reheat cycle #1 and reaction cycle #2 (Figure 4b) 
In the first reheat cycle, the combustion of coke deposited 
on catalyst particles along the reactor and a flow of hot air 
(625OC) for 4.5 min raises the bed temperature to the posi- 
tion shown (Reheat end - 
top curve). Note that the hot air 
has pushed a thermal front approximately 0.4 m into the 
bed. Ahead of that front however, the valley created in the 
previous reaction cycle is shifted deeper into the bed. 
Reaction 
cycle #2 starts with this top curve created by reheat 
cycle. Again, bed temperature 
drops rapidly at the top of the 
bed due to the highly endothermic reaction resulting from 
the combination of high reactant concentration and high 
temperature. The rates are faster than in the first cycle due 
to the higher temperatures. A second valley is created in 
front of the first one. This valley is sharper as a result of the 
faster reaction and the falling bed profile created during the 
reheat cycle. The first valley is hrther pushed deep into the 
bed by flowing gas. 
Reheat cycle #2 and HC cycle #3 (Figure 4c) 
In the following reheat cycle, the bed temperature is 
raised again and the existing 
valleys are further pushed deep 
into the bed by flowing hot air. Note the distance between 
the valleys. These define the characteristic penetration 
depths which are a commercial reactor design variable, 
Again, during the reaction cycle, bed temperature drops, a 
new valley is created in the front of the existing ones and 
existing valleys are moved along. The initial valley created 
has now been pushed completely out of the bed. 
Reheat cycles 3-5 and reaction cycles &6 (Figures 4d-4j) 
As can be seen, after approximately 5 cycles, the cyclcs 
repeat one another leading to so called cyclic steady state 
temperature envelope. Thermal waves move down the bed 
in a regular pattern. Based upon the inlet conditions chosen, 
the resulting conversion is 62.8 mass% and the selectivity is 
84.3 mass% averaged over the entire hydrocarbon cycle. 
Olefin yield is 52.9 mass%.

It is important to note that the characteristic distances 
between the wave fronts and the profile of coke deposition 
along the length of the reactor. This interrelationship will 
have a major impact on the process thermal efficiency 
of the 
reactor. Note that for this case, the reheat gas will move a 
peak or a valley approximately 0.4 m in its cycle. 
Importantly, any coke deposited on the last 0.4 m of catalyst 
bed during the reaction cycle will be combusted and its heat 
pushed out of the bed during the subsequent reheat cycle. 
This heat will be recovered downstream as steam but is lost 
as reaction heat. 
REVERSE 
FLOW 
In reverse or counter-current flow, the direction of either 
the HC reactants or reheat air is shifted. For the purpose of 
the model, the model equations and their solution technique 
is the same as the ones for cocurrent flow except for the sign 
of axial direction (in convection term). 
The counter-current flow of reactants and reheat gas 
through the reactor produces a typical cyclic steady state 
temperature 
profile for reverse flow. This is shown in Figure 
5. The reheat gas and the hydrocarbon feed enter into the 
reactor from opposite sides (Figure 1). 
The external operating conditions used in producing this 
temperature profile are the same as the conditions used in 
Figure 2 for cocunent flow. Thus, even the visual compari- 
son of these two figures reveals the differences in basic 
characteristics of two concepts. With countercurrent flow, 
the hydrocarbon reaction sees a temperature profile that 
continually rises along the axial length of the reactor. At the 
end of the reaction cycle, the bed temperature has dropped 
to the lower curve. 
Since for endothermic reversible reactions, the equilibri- 
um constant increases as temperature increases, the ideal 
temperature profile for an endothermic equilibrium limited 
reaction is a rising profile that m 
parallel to the equilibrium 
conversion vs. temperature curve. It is this profile that the 
reverse flow concept can generate. The rising temperature 
profile continually 
shifts the equilibrium 
limitations 
as reac- 
tants proceed along the reactor. 
At the hydrocarbon inlet, the reactant concentration 
is high 
and bed temperature is low. This combination produces a 
moderate controllable conversion with high selectivity. As 
reactants move deeper into the bed, feed concentration drops 
and the bed temperature rises. Thus, falling concentration 
and rising bed temperatures counterbalance each other and 
combine to continue to produce a moderate conversion with 
high selectivity. Thus in reverse flow, all of the bed con- 
tributes to the process more or less equally. Even though the 
reaction is moving toward equilibrium, the equilibrium limi- 
tations are continually moving away as a result of the 
increasing temperature. Thus, there is uniform reaction all 
along the reactor in reverse flow case. This leads to a uniform 
drop in solids bed temperature as a function of reactor length. 
Figures 6a and 6b present the temperature profiles and 
conversion profiles for the reverse or counter-current opera- 
tion as a function of time during a cycle. The difference 
between the temperature 
profile at t = 0 and the temperature 
profile at the end of the cycle is proportional to the amount 
of the reaction that occurred along the reactor. Note that the 
difference is more or less constant throughout the bed. 
In Figure 7, the development of so called cyclic steady 
state temperature profile for counter-current flow is dis-

played, similar to Figure 4 for the cocurrent flow case. 
Conditions and the starting 
points are the same. Again start- 
ing with an isothermal bed at 525C, the first reaction cycle 
will proceed identically to that of the co-current flow case 
and create a similar temperature profile (Figure 7a). 
Reheat cycle #I and reaction cycle #
2
 
(Figure 7b) 
Starting 
with the temperature profile at the end of the first 
reaction cycle, hot reheat air is introduced into the opposite 
end of the bed. It first contacts the solids at approximately 
515OC, outlet from the reaction cycle #l. The gas quickly 
gives up its heat to the much larger mass of solids. Over the 
reheat cycle, the upper temperature 
profile is formed (reheat 
end). Note that the temperature falls sharply from the hydro- 
carbon outlet to the hydrocarbon inlet. The reheat cycle air 
outlet temperature (eg 5
O
O
O
C
)
 is set by contact with the 
solids whose starting temperature was low due to the reac- 
tion valley formed in the first reaction cycle. 
The second reaction cycle now sees a rising temperature 
profile. At the hydrocarbon entrance, the solids are in fact at 
a lower temperature than 
the feed inlet temperature and the 
reaction mixture actually reacts and transfers heat to the 
solids. As reaction proceeds, heat is removed uniformly 
along the reactor length. 
Reheat cycle #2 and reaction cycle #3 (Figure 7c) 
The reheat gas now sees a uniformly falling profile as it 
passes through the bed. Heat is released more or less uni- 
formly along the bed. During the subsequent 
reaction cycle, 
heat is removed uniformly along the length. 
Reheat cycles 3-5 and reaction cycles 4-6 (Figures 7d-7j3 
As it will be noticed there are not any waves pushed out 
of the bed but nonetheless, there is substantial thermal 
movement in each direction. Based upon the identical oper- 
ating conditions for the co-current case (Figure 4), the con- 
version in counter-current 
flow is 70.7 mass% and the selec- 
tivity is 85.9 mass%. Olefin yield is 60.7 mass%, or 15% 
higher than the comparable cocurrent flow case.

The counter-current nature of the flows tends to keep 
energy within the bed. The heat generated from any coke 
deposition within the last section of the catalyst bed is 
pushed directly 
back into the bed by the countercurrent flow 
of air. It thus provides reaction heat in contrast to being 
pushed from the bed as in cocurrent flow. This effect com- 
bined with much lower exit air temperature created by the 
counter-current contacting results in better energy utiliza- 
tion in the reverse flow case.

Model validation 
The kinetics for isobutane and propane dehydrogenation 
have been discussed in our previous communication 
(Gartside et al., 1993). In that publication, Figures 2 and 3 
compare the experimental 
and the predicted conversion and 
selectivity values, respectively. In another publication 
(Gartside et al., 1994), the model and kinetics used in the 
model were further verified by matching pilot scale reactor 
performance experimentally for rising, falling and isother- 
mal (constant) temperature profiles. Perfect match of yields 
from these three different profiles proves the accuracy of the 
model and its kinetics. 
The change in temperature profile with time was also val- 
idated in a large scale pilot plant reactor system. The pro- 
gression of instantaneous bed temperature profile with time 
was recorded by imposing an initial temperature profile 
along the reactor and then initiating a reaction cycle for 
propane dehydrogenation. Temperatures were measured 
during the cycle. At the end of the cycle time, the coke 
deposited 
on the catalyst along the reactor was measured. In 
order to measure the coke profile along the reactor, the 
amount of coke accumulated within the three regions (top, 
middle and bottom) of the reactor was determined separately 
measuring the CO, generated by burning, starting from the 
lower (bottom) region. The model simulations were per- 
formed for the duration of the cycle by imposing the initial 
experimental temperature profile as the starting profile for 
the model. Predicted temperature profiles and the end of 
cycle coke profile were compared with the experimental 
data. Figure 8 shows a typical sample of this type of com- 
parison. Figure 8a shows the predicted temperature and coke

Comparison of reactor performance for parallel and 
reverse flow 
The commercial CATOFJXR 
process (and its predecessor 
C 
ATADIENER) 
both operated in parallel or cocurrent flow. 
The flow direction was defined early on in the process 
development and remained unchanged for many years. It 
was not until a detailed fundamental model was developed 
that the optimization 
of this transient process could be com- 
pleted in any systematic manner. Consider first the parallel 
or cocurrent flow operation. 
Parallel flow produces a falling temperature 
profile which 
contradicts the basic nature of the equilibrium-limited 
endothermic dehydrogenation process. The ideal tempera- 
ture profile an endothermic reaction system is a rising pro- 
file, where the temperature conversion 
relationship runs par- 
allel to the equilibrium curve. With a falling profile, the 
dehydrogenation reaction is limited by equilibrium at some 
point within the reactor. However, the other simultaneous 
reactions of cracking and coking are not limited by equilib- 
rium. Thus, a falling profile will inherently at similar con- 
versions have lower selectivity. This was discussed in our 
previous communication 
(Gartside et al., 1994). 
It is known that high temperatures have an adverse effect 
on long term catalyst deactivation. 
With a falling temperature 
profile, the highest temperatures are at the hydrocarbon inlet. 
This is also where the bulk of the reaction occurs. The balance 
of the bed does minimal work during a cycle, yet by the 
nature of the temperature 
profile still is exposed to relatively 
high temperature 
at the reactor outlet. As the inlet zone of the 
bed ages, the reaction moves deeper into the bed, but then 
contacts catalyst that has already been aged to some extent. 
As discussed above, the nature of the cocurrent operation 
will lead to a nonefficient process heat utilization since 
some of the heat from the coke will be pushed from the 
reactor. The coking reactions in paraffin dehydrogenation 
are proportional to the concentration of olefinic product as 
acetylenic compounds and eventually the aromatics. By 
forming these compounds early on in the reactor, there is 
increased time for coking to occur. A significant portion of 
the coke is formed near the outlet as a result of the favorable 
combination of product concentration and residence time. 
This heat is lost in the cocurrent flow. 
The parallel flow process has been successfully operated 
for many years and represents the combination of highest 
conversion and selectivity in the industry today. However, 
the process can be considerably enhanced by reverse or 
counter-current flow. First and foremost, as shown in the 
examples above, at the same heat input form the external 
sources, reverse flow operation will produce higher conver- 
sions at the same or higher selectivities. For the example 
shown in Figures 3 and 6, this represents an increase in 
propylene yield from 52.9 to 60.7 mass%. 
The main advantages of the reverse flow can be summarized 
as follows: 
- 
Reverse flow produces a rising temperature profile which 
is on ideal profile for an equilibrium limited endothermic 
reaction system. Due to increasing temperature profiles 
along the reactor, the equilibrium limitation is shifted as 
the reaction proceeds along the reactor. 
- 
Energy utilization in reverse flow is much better than that 
in parallel flow. 
- 
At the same conversion, the average bed temperature is 
lower in reverse flow than in parallel flow. This will 
increase catalyst life and reduce the thermal stress in 
equipment. 
- 
The whole bed is an active participant in the process, 
product uniformly is better and catalyst deactivates uni- 
formly. 
Reverse flow is not however beneficial in every condition. 
In fact there are certain operating conditions where the per- 
formance is poorer than for parallel flow operation. 
As stated above, the energy 
utilization for counter-current 
operation is better than for cocurrent operation. This is 
always true when comparing cocurrent versus countercurrent 
heat exchange. When reaction is added, and the heat 
exchange is via direct contact in a cyclic process, there is a 
definite hydrodynamic influence. While the loss of heat for 
the reaction system with the cocurrent flow of the reheat gas 
has been noted above, there is also a similar type of loss in 
countercurrent flow during the reaction cycle. The reactor 
effluent in counter-current flow operation carries more heat 
from the reactor (to downstream exchangers) due to the 
higher temperatures at the hydrocarbon outlet. The magni- 
tude of this loss compared to the energy gain during the 
reheat cycle will be a function of the relative flow rates (and 
heat capacities) of the hydrocarbon and air streams.

Yield as a function of energy input during reheat cycle. 
For either process scheme (co or counter-current), the 
extent of reaction will increase with additional heat input. 
Thus, for a given hydrocarbon flow and temperature, 
increasing the reheat flow (or temperature) will increase the 
available heat for reaction and thus increase conversion. In 
order to obtain a given conversion, 
a certain quantity of heat 
must be added to the solids every reaction cycle. At high 
reheat air flows, this can be done with moderate tempera- 
tures; at low reheat air flows, the temperatures 
must be higher. 
The reheat air flow sets the slope of the temperature profile 
(rising or falling). 
When operating in counter-current 
flow mode, low reheat 
air flows will mean that the hydrocarbon flow losses will be 
higher relative to cases with higher reheat air flows as a 
result of the higher hydrocarbon outlet temperatures. At a 
certain point, these losses will be greater than the energy 
savings in the reheat cycle. At this point, parallel flow oper- 
ation will be more efficient. Figure 9 compares the propy- 
lene yield for parallel and reverse flow operation as a func- 
tion of the ratio of reheat air flow to hydrocarbon flow. As 
can be seen, the slope for counter-current 
operation 
is steeper 
providing greater advantages 
at high airlHC ratios and lesser 
or negative advantages at lower ratios. 
Reactor stability 
Figure 9 also illustrates a very important point. As con- 
versions are increased, the importance of secondary reac- 
tions increases. At high energy input, the propylene yields 
flatten and even turn down. In addition, the amount of coke- 
deposited at high conversions increases and will eventually 
led to instability in performance. 
If the coke produced in the reaction cycle is high, then the 
total energy input during the reheat cycle may exceed the 
energy removed during the endothermic dehydrogenation 
cycle. That will lead to an increase in bed operating 
tempera- 
tures from cycle to cycle. Changes in bed temperature 
profile 
from cycle to cycle are the evidence of unstable operation. 
This phenomenon can occur in both parallel and reverse 
flow operation. 
If this occurs, the solution is to reduce energy 
input from the sources other than coke (air flow rate or air 
temperature). This is easily accomplished. This in turn will 
reduce conversion and, hence, coke, which reduces total 
heat input even further. 
The overall model as developed and used, with separatc 
reaction and reheat models, is ideal for examining the reactor 
stability. As stated earlier, there is no requircment in the 
model that the heat removed from the solids during the reac- 
tion cycle balances the heat added to the solids during reheat 
cycle. The simulations are totally separated. This mimics 
actual reactor operation. The formation of a stable cyclic 
steady state 
temperature envelope 
(and hence a stable reactor) 
depends not only upon the external heat added but on the 
specific profiles along the reactor of heat removed (reaction) 
and heat supplied (coke combustion). 
Imbalances between heat supplied and heat consumed at 
any axial point along the reactor will lead to increases in tem- 
perature at that point. In many cases this will simply reprc- 
sent a dynamic shift in profile and eventually convection 
will 
shift the heat to a point where it can be used. However, there 
are situations for both parallel and reverse flow where the 
heat can not be removed. In these cases, reaction tempera- 
tures will increase to the point of rapid catalyst deactivation. 
The model as developed has been extensively validated 
against commercial operations in both C, and C, service. 
Plant test runs have been modelled and the conditions 
where 
increasing temperatures have been noted in commercial 
reactors (and immediately corrected) have been simulated. 
This provides us with full confidence in the model as a tool 
for dynamic analysis of transient reactor operation. 
Coke produced during dehydrogenation is a function of 
both temperature level and concentration 
of olefin (coking is 
a secondary reaction). 
For parallel (cocurrent) flow, near the 
reactor HC inlet, the temperatures are high, but olefin con- 
centrations are low. Near the HC outlet, the reverse is true. 
This leads more or less to uniform coke laydown over the 
bed. For reverse (counter-current) flow, near the HC inlet 
both temperature and olefin concentrations 
are low, while at 
the outlet both are higher. This leads to considerably greater 
percentage 
of the coke being deposited near the reactor outlet 
relative to the HC inlet. Coke profiles measured at identical 
total coke make for both cocurrent and countercurrent opcr- 
ation have confirmed this observation. 
There is a fundamental difference between parallel and 
reverse flow operations in the response to these different 
coke profiles. This difference can be expressed simply as: 
a. Cocurrent flow will push the heat generated by combus- 
tion of the coke through the bed and eventually out of the 
bed in the form of sensible heat of the reheat air stream. 
This heat is recovered as steam. 
b. Counter-current flow will push the heat generated back 
into the bed, especially since the majority of the coke is 
deposited at the reheat air inlet (HC outlet) portion of the 
bed. This heat is recovered as reaction heat. 
In a transient operation, the hydrodynamics of the bed 
strongly influence the temperature profile and hence the 
reaction profile. This in t
u
r
n
 impacts the coke profile. A 
very useful tool in examining the stability performance of 
transient endothermic reactors operating under alternating 
reaction-reheat cycles is the ratio of the local heat generated 
at any specific axial location (coke laydown) to the local 
heat consumed by reaction at that same axial location. 
Figure 10 presents this ratio for both parallel and reverse 
flow as a function of axial position. This ratio is not, how- 
ever, a heat balance; the convective heat transfer axially is

not included. Under steady state heat balance, the ratio of 
total heat supplied to total heat consumed would be unity at 
any point in the bed. 
As can be seen there are significant differences between 
parallel and reverse flow. For parallel flow, the portion of 
the bed near the HC (and reheat air) outlet has a ratio greater 
than unity. This means that heat must be removed convec- 
tively in order to maintain consistent temperature profiles. 
This is consistent with the loss of reactor process efficiency. 
For reverse flow, any point in the bed, the ratio is less than 
unity. Heat must be added convectively (by reheat air 
flow/temperature) in order to maintain heat balance. 
From these curves, one can see that the reverse flow oper- 
ation is inherently more stable and heat is uniformly sup- 
plied and removed over most of the bed length. There is a 
slight rise toward the HC outlet due to the higher relative 
coke laydown at that point. Importantly however, the point 
where the ratio is highest for reverse flow is also the point 
most directly affected by changes in reheat air flow or tem- 
perature. This provides a direct and easily controllable 
means of balancing the heats of the reactor. Reverse flow 
operation is inherently more stable and controllable than 
parallel flow operation in spite of the fact that the parallel 
flow system has operated commercially without incident. 
Conclusions 
It is known that the preferred temperature profile for an 
equilibrium limited dehydrogenation reactor is rising temper- 
ature profile more or less parallel to the equilibrium conver- 
sion versus temperature curve. This is directly the opposite 
of the temperature profile generated in commercial adiabatic 
reactors or in the parallel flow transient dehydrogenation 
reactor system. Shifting the flow pattern for CATOFIN from 
parallel (cocurrent) 
to reverse (counter-current) flow achieves 
such a profile. The main advantages of rising temperature 
profile (reverse flow), can be summarized as follows: 
1. Better heat utilization within the reactor, which reduces 
the amount of heat input to the reactor for a given con- 
version. 
2. A higher catalyst bed outlet temperature, which results in 
more favorable equilibrium conditions. 
3. A reduced total product residence time at temperature in 
the reactor as a result of the more uniform conversion 
profile and the rising temperature profile. This leads to 
reduced product degradation and higher selectivity at 
equivalent conversion. 
4. Uniform dehydrogenation reaction rate from the inlet to 
the outlet of the reactor, which results in uniform utiliza- 
tion of the entire bed.

The CATOFINR paraffin dehydrogenation system is a 
commercially operated transient "unsteady" reaction system. 
Fundamental analysis and performance simulation have 
realized considerable optimization of the system and has 
shed new light on an existing technology. As a result of 
these activities, economic performance has been consider- 
ably enhanced. Commercial demonstration of this improve- 
ment will take place in early 1996.
