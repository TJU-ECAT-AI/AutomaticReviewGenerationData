ABSTRACT 
The UOP/Hydro MTO Process utilizes a SAPO-34-containing catalyst that 
provides up to 80% yield of ethylene and propylene at near-complete methanol 
conversion. The process has great flexibility to produce a product with a range 
of ethylene/propylene ratios, depending on the operating conditions used. This 
paper will discuss recent improvements related to the technology which have 
increased the carbon selectivity from methanol to ethylene-plus-propylene to 
about 85-90%. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
As worldwide natural gas reserves continue to increase, natural gas is expected 
to become an increasingly important raw material for the chemical industry in 
the 21 st century. Conversion of natural gas to syn-gas and higher value added 
products such as methanol, ammonia and transportation fuels is currently being 
practiced commercially. The combination of methanol production using state-of- 
the-art mega-scale methanol technology and methanol-to-olefins (MTO) 
technology developed by UOP and Norsk Hydro provides an economically 
attractive route from natural gas to ethylene and propylene, two large-tonnage, 
high-value petrochemicals. The MTO technology has been extensively 
demonstrated at a large-scale facility owned by Norsk Hydro in Norway. The 
process converts methanol or dimethyl ether (DME) to ethylene and propylene 
at about 75-80% carbon selectivity 
. A world-scale MTO unit is currently under 
design 
2'3. This paper will discuss recent improvements related to the MTO 
technology which have increased the carbon selectivity from methanol to 
ethylene-plus-propylene to about 85-90%. 
2. MTO CATALYST 
The MTO process utilizes a molecular sieve, SAPO-34, that contains silicon, 
aluminium, and phosphorous. The structure of SAPO-34 along with small 
organic molecules that are key to the MTO process are shown in Figure 1. The 
small pore size (about 4 ) of SAPO-34 restricts the diffusion of branched 
hydrocarbons, and this leads to high selectivity to the desired small linear olefins. 
ZSM-5 molecular sieve used in methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) processes 
produces much lower ethylene and propylene yields 
4, primarily due to the larger 
pore openings of the MFI structure (about 5.5 A) (Fig. 2).

Another key feature of the SAPO-34 molecular sieve is its mild acidity 
which reduces paraffinic by-product formation through the hydride transfer 
reaction. This feature provides olefin purities of about 97% even without splitter 
columns for further purification, and makes it easy to upgrade the olefins to 
polymer grade. 
3. PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND RECENT IMPROVEMENTS 
The MTO process utilizes a circulating fluidized bed reactor that offers a 
number of advantages. The moving bed of catalyst allows the continuous 
movement of a portion of used catalyst to a separate regeneration vessel for the 
removal of coke deposits by burning with air. Thus, a constant catalyst activity 
and product composition can be maintained in the MTO reactor. A fluidized-bed 
reactor also allows for better heat recovery from the exothermic methanol-to- 
olefins reaction. Catalysts manufactured at the commercial scale have 
demonstrated the required selectivity, long term stability, and attrition resistance.

Reactor operating conditions can be adjusted to the desired product 
requirements. Pressure is normally dictated by mechanical considerations, with 
lower methanol partial pressures resulting in higher overall yields. Thus, some 
yield advantage can be obtained by using a crude methanol feed that typically 
may contain around 20 wt% water. On the other hand, increased pressures may 
be favored for the production of higher propylene ratios. Temperature is an 
important control variable- higher temperatures are required to increase the 
proportion of ethylene in the product relative to propylene, but higher 
temperatures also result in a small reduction in the overall light olefin selectivity. 
Temperature severity effects are best appreciated in Figure 3 where operating 
temperatures range from 400 to about 550 
Figure 3 also shows that the 
maximum (carbon-based) selectivity of ethylene plus propylene are just shy of 
80% and occur at an ethylene-to-propylene ratio close to 1:1. 
It may be appreciated though that, if butenes were included, the overall 
carbon selectivity would be in the order of 90%. This lends itself to a modified 
process scheme whereby the heavier olefins are fed to an ATOFINA/UOP 
Olefin Cracking Process unit (OCP) based on technology developed and 
demonstrated by ATOFINA and UOP 5. In essence, C4 to C6+ olefins generated 
as byproducts from the MTO process unit can be fed to the OCP unit in which 
these heavier olefins are cracked to ethylene plus propylene, but with a 
preponderance of propylene. The fractionation scheme in the MTO unit remains 
unchanged except that it has to be sized to accommodate the added circulation to 
and from the OCP unit; a small purge removes the heavier or more refractory 
components from the recycle loop. Figure 4 illustrates the carbon selectivity 
pattern from high-purity methanol (99.85 wt% methanol) to ethylene plus 
propylene with the incorporation of the OCP unit.

Fig. 4. Olefin selectivity vs. operating severity with and without OCP 
The OCP unit makes use of a very robust catalyst that yields low levels of 
coke as byproduct from the olefin cracking reaction. Thus, although the catalyst 
is fully regenerable by using a standard carbon burn, it is not necessary to use a 
fluidized bed with catalyst transport as used in the MTO unit; either a fixed bed 
or a moving bed suffices in the OCP unit. 
The incorporation of an MTO unit with an OCP unit on a once-through basis 
without recycle boosts the overall ethylene plus propylene selectivity to about 
83% compared to 77-78% selectivity for an MTO unit by itself as in Figure 3 
and 4 above. The addition of recycle around the OCP unit for maximum 
conversion of the heavy olefins leads to an overall yield of about 89% (Fig. 4). 
In the process, however, the points at which the maximum C2=+C3 
= yields are 
achieved shift to higher C3-/C2 
= ratios (on an overall MTO plus OCP basis) as 
corresponds to the preferential production of propylene from the OCP unit. 
4. ECONOMICS 
An MTO unit designed to produce 400,000 MTA of polymer-grade ethylene and 
400,000 MTA of polymer-grade propylene will also produce about 175,000 
MTA of C4+ olefins which, although valuable in an integrated refining or 
petrochemical complex, may only warrant fuel value in some remote locations. 
If integrated with an OCP unit, the same MTO unit can produce about 426,000 
MTA of polymer-grade ethylene and 500,000 MTA of polymer-grade propylene, 
with a 78% decrease in the amount of C4+ byproduct to only 39,000 MTA. The 
ISBL cost of the OCP unit with recycle of unconverted olefins is about $50 
million and, in addition, some extra capacity is required in the fractionation and 
recovery section of the MTO unit that amounts to another $10 million. Overall, 
inclusive of OSBL incremental allowances, license fees, catalysts, etc., inclusion 
of the OCP unit requires an incremental investment of about $70 million. Thus, 
the overall investment for the integrated MTO/OCP complex increases from 
about $425 million to about $495 million. Typical IRR rates are in the order of 
20% or higher depending on the relative values assigned to the key products. 
If additional propylene is desired, the production ratio of propylene to 
ethylene can be further increased by reducing the operating severity of the MTO 
unit and slightly increasing the size of the OCP unit. Thus, for example, with the 
same methanol feed rate as in the previous example, the MTO unit could be 
operated to produce about 340,000 MTA ethylene and 450,000 MTA propylene 
(propylene/ethylene ratio  1.33) without OCP. The operation can be further 
shifted to produce about 370,000 MTA ethylene and 570,000 MTA propylene 
(propylene/ethylene ratio  1.54) by incorporating an OCP unit to convert about 
200,000 MTA of C4+ olefins and reduce the Ca+ byproducts by almost 80%. 
Note that, as seen in Figure 3, the amount of C4+ olefins increases and the yield 
of C2=+C3 
= decreases slightly as operating severity decreases (increased 
C3=/C2 
= ratio) in an MTO unit; however, by incorporating an OCP unit the 
overall C2=+C3 
= yield actually increases at the lower operating severity (higher 
C3=/C2 
= ratio) as shown in Figure 4. 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
The MTO process provides an economically attractive alternative for the 
production of light olefins, ethylene and propylene, and the corresponding 
polyolefins from methanol or DME that can be produced at low cost and in large 
quantities from natural gas or other hydrocarbon sources. The MTO process can 
be operated over a relatively broad range of C3=/C2 
= ratios, but with slightly 
lower C2=+C3 
= yields at the higher or lower C3=/C2 
-- ratios. The integration of 
an MTO unit with an OCP unit increases the carbon-based yield of ethylene plus 
propylene to almost 90% of the methanol feedstock. This essentially eliminates 
the need to market less desirable C4+ byproducts and thereby provides a product 
slate focused entirely on ethylene and propylene with high propylene/ethylene 
ratios. 
This paper has discussed some of the features of a typical process unit for 
the conversion of methanol and/or DME to light olefins. Though based on a 
relatively novel chemistry, the process configuration and recovery and 
purification techniques are akin to those currently practiced in industry, either 
for the production of olefins by fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) of heavy 
hydrocarbons or by steam cracking of LPG or naphtha fractions
