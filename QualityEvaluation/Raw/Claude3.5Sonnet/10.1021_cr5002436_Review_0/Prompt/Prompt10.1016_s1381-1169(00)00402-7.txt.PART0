Abstract
Kinetic models are formulated to describe the essential surface chemistry involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum
catalysts, through consolidation of results obtained from first principles calculations and reaction kinetics studies. Quantum
chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were conducted to probe the structures and energetics of
various adsorbed C2Hx species on platinum, as well as activated complexes involved in cleavage of the CC bond. De
Donder relations were used to identify kinetic coefficients that minimize complications from unintentional compensation
effects. Results from DFT calculations and kinetic analyses suggest that the most abundant surface species during ethane
hydrogenolysis are adsorbed atomic hydrogen and highly dehydrogenated hydrocarbon species (e.g. ethylidyne species),
whereas the primary reaction pathways for cleavage of the CC bond on Pt take place through transition states that are more
highly hydrogenated (e.g. C2H5 and CHCH3 species). The results from DFT calculations indicate that C2Hx adsorbed species
and transition states interact more strongly with Pt(2 1 1) than with Pt(1 1 1) surfaces, in agreement with the known structure
sensitivity of ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt catalysts.  2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Catalytic processes on surfaces take place through
sequences of elementary reactions involving adsorbed
reactants, products, and reaction intermediates associ-
ated with active sites on the catalyst surface. Studies
of chemical kinetics of catalytic processes, thus, typ-
ically involve analyses of reaction schemes, with the
aim of describing the rate of the overall reaction in
terms of contributions from individual elementary
steps. While in the most general case it is desirable
to determine pre-exponential factors and activation
energies for each of these elementary steps, there

is usually not sufficient information to extract the
values of all kinetic parameters. Accordingly, there
is an information-deficit that requires a compromise
between the desire to include chemical detail in the
reaction scheme and the realization that the observed
reaction kinetics is controlled by a limited number
of kinetic parameters. In this respect, several issues
become important. For example, what elementary
steps are kinetically important, and how many ki-
netic parameters are required to capture the observed
chemistry of a given catalytic process?
During the past several years, significant advances
have been made in the applications of quantum
chemical techniques to identify the geometries, en-
ergetics and vibrational modes of chemical species
interacting with catalytic sites consisting of clusters

or periodic arrangements of atoms [1,2]. In addi-
tion, considerable information about the properties
of chemical species on catalyst surfaces is avail-
able from experimental studies [3,4]. This increasing
availability of energetic and entropic information
obtained from theoretical and experimental studies
is invaluable in kinetic analyses to minimize the
information-deficit and to help determine which of the
kinetic parameters are important in controlling catalyst
performance.
An important consequence of conducting kinetic
analyses in conjunction with results from quantum
chemical calculations and experimental studies of
surface species is that quantitative knowledge about
the catalytic process is built at the molecular level
into the kinetic model. In fact, one of the difficulties
encountered when trying to utilize reaction kinetic
data collected for a particular catalyst system to as-
sist in the development of another catalyst system
is that a common basis for comparison between the
systems cannot be identified. For example, the ac-
tive sites may have different structures; the reaction
sequences may involve different reaction intermedi-
ates; the surface coverage regimes may be different.
Without a means to account for the key differences
between the catalyst systems, it is not possible to take
advantage of the similarities that these systems may
possess. However, by extracting information about
the catalyst system at the molecular level, it may be
possible to identify the common factors that control
the nature and the strength of the chemical bonding
in both catalyst systems. This process of extracting
fundamental knowledge from experimental informa-
tion, therefore, provides a molecular-level basis for
comparison between catalyst systems, and it provides
unifying principles for the design of new catalyst
systems.
In the present paper, the combined results from
experimental and theoretical investigations are con-
solidated with the aim of interpreting the observed
reaction kinetics data for ethane hydrogenolysis over
platinum. Ethane hydrogenolysis has been a bell-
wether probe reaction to investigate the reactivities
of hydrocarbons over metal catalysts [514]. To this
day, investigators have conducted analyses of kinetic
data for ethane hydrogenolysis using models based
on the following two-step reaction scheme proposed
by Cimino et al. [15]:
C2H6
C2Hx(ads) +
6 x
2
H2
C2Hx(ads) + H2 CH4
where the first step is quasi-equilibrated and the
second step is irreversible. This scheme leads to a
rate expression of the power-law form:
rate = kPn
EP 1na
H
(1)
where a is equal to (6 x)/2 and PE and PH are the
partial pressures of ethane and dihydrogen, respec-
tively. Over the years, this two-step mechanism has
been modified to incorporate such features such as
competitive adsorption of hydrogen and cleavage of
the CC bond through interaction with either gaseous
dihydrogen, surface atomic hydrogen, or vacant sur-
face sites (as reviewed by Shang and Kenney [13]).
However, two main features of the model have been
maintained: (1) the most abundant reactive interme-
diate is formed in quasi-equilibrium with gas-phase
ethane and dihydrogen, and (2) this same reactive in-
termediate is involved in the rate-limiting CC bond
cleavage step. In this paper, we show that the reactive
intermediates are not necessarily the most abundant
surface intermediates.
The present paper begins with a detailed reaction
scheme to describe the results of a previously re-
ported kinetic study of ethane hydrogenolysis over
platinum [14], and uses recent results from quantum
chemical calculations employing density functional
theory (DFT) [16] to provide initial guesses for the
kinetic parameters of this system. In addition, the
present paper uses reaction schemes involving the
quasi-equilibrated formation of reaction intermediates
and transitions states from gaseous ethane and dihy-
drogen, as identified using the concepts of De Donder
[1721]. Moreover, the use of De Donder relations
provides a simple means to determine the number of
kinetic parameters required to calculate the overall
reaction rate from a reaction scheme.
2. Kinetic analyses
2.1. De Donder analyses
According to the De Donder relation, we write the
net rate for elementary step i in terms of the forward

rate of the step, 
ri, and the affinity for the step, Ai:
ri = 
ri
1 exp
Ai
RT
(2)
where the affinity is equal to minus the change in the
Gibbs free energy with respect to the extent of reaction
(i.e. equal to the difference in the Gibbs free energies
of the reactants and products of the elementary step
at the reaction temperature and at the corresponding
partial pressure for each reactant, product, and reaction
intermediate). In general, the affinity, Ai, is expressed
in terms of the standard state Gibbs free energies, Go
j,
and the activities, aj, of the j reactants and products
of the step
Ai = 
X
j
υijGj = 
X
j
υij[Go
j + RT ln(aj)]
(3)
where υij are the stoichiometric coefficients for the j
reactants and products of step i. This expression can
be written in terms of the equilibrium coefficient for
the step, Kieq:
exp
Ai
RT
=
Q
ja
υij
j
Kieq
(4)
since the equilibrium coefficient is determined by the
change in the standard state Gibbs free energies:
Kieq = exp
"
P
jυijGo
j
RT
#
(5)
For convenience, we define a dimensionless variable,
zi, equal to the exponential of Ai/RT:
zi = exp
Ai
RT
=
Q
ja
υij
j
Kieq
(6)
The value of zi approaches zero as step i becomes
irreversible, and as zi approaches unity as step i be-
comes quasi-equilibrated; therefore, this value of zi
may be termed the reversibility of step i. We note
that the definition of the reversibility, zi, is simply
a transform of the affinity, Ai, in the De Donder re-
lation for step i. We also note that the value of zi
remains bounded between 0 and 1 provided that step
i proceeds in the forward direction. If step i changes
direction, then the value of zi becomes >1. In such
cases, it may be convenient to rewrite the step in the
opposite direction so that the value of zi remains <1.
This above approach can now be used to analyze the
following reaction scheme for ethane hydrogenolysis
over Pt:
1. CH3CH3 + 2CH2CH3 +H
2. CH2CH3 +2CH2CH2 2 +H
3. CH2CH2 2 +2CHCH2 3 +H
4. CHCH2 3 +2CCH2 4 +H
5. CH2CH22 CHCH32
6. CHCH23 CCH33
7. CH2CH3 +2CH2 2 +CH3
8. CH2CH2 2 +2CH2 2 +CH22
9. CHCH3 2 +2CH3 +CH3
10. CHCH2 3 +2CH3 +CH22
11. H2 + 22H
where represents a vacant surface site. Steps 14
are dehydrogenation processes, steps 5 and 6 are iso-
merization processes, steps 79 are CC bond cleav-
age steps, and step 11 is the adsorption of dihydrogen
on the surface. Note that isomerization steps 5 and 6
may, in fact, involve hydrogenation-dehydrogenation
steps, i.e. CHCH32 may be formed by dehydrogena-
tion of CH2CH22 to form CHCH23, followed by
hydrogenation of CHCH23 to from CHCH32. The
above reaction scheme involves four possible routes
for ethane hydrogenolysis, since CC bond cleavage
may occur in four separate adsorbed species. Our pre-
vious work has shown that the activation barrier for a
fifth possible route for CC bond cleavage involving
adsorbed CCH2 species is considerably higher than
the barriers for the other four routes, and hence, we
do not include that route [16]. In this reaction scheme,
we allow for the possibility that the most abundant
adsorbed C2Hx surface species is not necessarily the
primary species that undergoes CC bond cleavage.
Finally, it is assumed for simplicity that mono-carbon
species CHxare rapidly converted to methane, mak-
ing steps 710 irreversible.
This 11-step reaction scheme involves seven re-
versible steps and four irreversible steps, giving rise
to 18 rate coefficients, ki. We note that each rate co-
efficient is composed of a pre-exponential factor and
an activation energy, giving rise to two kinetic para-
meters for each rate coefficient. Next, we address the
factors controlling the number of rate coefficients that
must be known to conduct reaction kinetics analyses
using this reaction scheme.
At steady state, the rates of formation are equal
to the rates of consumption for each surface species.
94
R.D. Cortright et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 163 (2000) 91103
The net rates of steps 4 and 6 are zero, since ethyli-
dyne species, CCH33, and di-s/p vinylidene species,
CCH24, do not readily undergo CC bond cleavage,
i.e. these species are spectator species on the catalyst
surface. Accordingly, z4 and z6 are equal to one.
Using De Donder relations, the following seven
relations may be written for the fractional surface cov-
erages by the various adsorbed species:

Finally, a site balance may be written to express θin
terms of fractional surface coverages by C2Hx species
(assuming that surface coverages by mono-carbon
species CHx species are negligible):
1 = θ+ θH + θCH2CH3 + 2θCH2CH2 + 2θCHCH3
+3θCHCH2 + 3θCCH3 + 4θCCH2
(39)
At steady state, the rates of formation are equal to the
rates of consumptions for each surface species, leading
to the following relations:
dθCH2CH3
dt
= r1 r2 r7 = 0
(40)
dθCH2CH2
dt
= r2 r3 r5 r8 = 0
(41)
dθCHCH2

= r5 r9 = 0
(43)
dθH
dt = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 3r7 4r8 4r9
5r10 + 2r11 = 0
(44)
To solve the kinetic model, we now have six equations
(e.g. five steady state relations involving non-zero rates
(Eqs. (40)(44)) and one site balance (Eq. (39)) and
six unknowns (z1, z2, z3, z5, z11 and θ).
It can now be seen that the maximum number of
kinetic coefficients required for the analysis is equal
to nine (corresponding to C1 through C9), plus one
additional coefficient (Cieq) for each species that is
non-negligible in the site balance. For example, the
maximum number of kinetic coefficients is equal to
11, if Hand CCH33 are the most abundant surface
species.
The number of kinetic coefficients required for
kinetic analyses decreases further if various steps be-
come quasi-equilibrated. For example, if we assume
that Hand CCH33 remain the most abundant surface
species, then the number of significant kinetic coeffi-
cients decreases from 11 to 7 if the hydrogenation
dehydrogenation steps and the dihydrogen desorption
step are assumed to be quasi-equilibrated. The num-
ber of significant kinetic coefficients decreases from
seven to six if the isomerization step 5 is also as-
sumed to be quasi-equilibrated. Finally, the number of
kinetically significant coefficients decreases from six
to three if only one of the CC bond cleavage routes
(e.g. cleavage of CHCH32 species) is important.
According to transition state theory, we may express
the forward rate coefficient for a given step in terms
of an equilibrium relation between the reactants and
the activated complex for that step. Therefore, kinetic
coefficients C5 through C8 can be expressed in terms
of quasi-equilibrium coefficients, K

Temperature effects may be taken into account for the
lumped kinetic coefficients (Ci and Cieq) by writing
these coefficients in terms of the standard entropy and
enthalpy changes for the formation of stable species
and activated complexes:
Ci = exp

i
R
exp
1Hi
RT
(49)
For example, the standard entropy changes for the for-
mation of stable species (S1S7) and activated com-
plexes (T1T4) can be expressed in terms of standard
entropies of gaseous ethane and dihydrogen and stan-
dard entropies of the appropriate surface species and
activated complexes. Similarly, the enthalpy changes
for these steps may be written in terms of known
gaseous enthalpies of ethane and dihydrogen and
enthalpies of the appropriate surface species. An im-
portant advantage of using lumped kinetic coefficients
(Ci and Cieq) to conduct analyses of reaction schemes
is that these coefficients minimize complications from
unintentional compensation effects. For example, we
consider the situation where step 11 (adsorption of
H2) is quasi-equilibrated, and the equilibrium surface
coverage by atomic hydrogen is low (low pressures
of H2 and/or high temperatures). In this case, the
lumped quasi-equilibria identified by De Donder
analyses show that rate of ethane hydrogenolysis is
independent of the properties of adsorbed H atoms. If
the kinetic model had been formulated in terms of the
individual rate coefficients for the elementary steps,
then it would appear that the rates of specific steps
might depend on the strength of interaction of atomic
hydrogen with the surface, e.g. the reverse rate coeffi-
cients for steps 14 would be expected to decrease as
the strength of interaction of hydrogen atoms with the
surface increases. However, this decrease in reverse
rate coefficients would be compensated by changes
in the surfaces coverages by Hand C2Hxspecies,
such that the net rates of steps 14 are independent
of the properties of adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Ac-
cordingly, the use of the proper lumped kinetic coeffi-
cients provides a more direct approach for identifying
the factors controlling the kinetics of the catalytic
process.
Another unintentional compensation effect would
be introduced into the kinetic model by expressing
the activation barrier for cleavage of the CC bond
in terms of the energy of the corresponding stable,
adsorbed C2Hx species. If this stable adsorbed C2Hx
species remains in low concentration on the surface,
then we recognize from De Donder relations that the
kinetic parameters controlling the surface coverage by
this species are not significant. However, these kinetic
parameters can appear to be significant if we relate the
properties of the transition states to the properties of
this stable, adsorbed species.
2.2. Application of theoretical results
Computational methods using density functional
theory (DFT) have rapidly progressed owing to ad-
vances in computational speed, along with the de-
velopment of new algorithms. For example, DFT
methods have proven to be useful to predict accurate
geometries and reasonable energetics for molecules
containing transition metals [1,2,16,2124]. The re-
sults of quantum chemical calculations, therefore,
complement the results of experimental investiga-
tions of stable adsorbed species. Furthermore, these
calculations can be used to predict the energetics of
highly reactive intermediates and transition states that
cannot be observed experimentally. Recent DFT com-
putational studies have address the factors controlling
the rate of ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt catalysts
[16,25]. These DFT studies involved calculations to
investigate the interactions of C2Hx species with Pt10
clusters and Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(2 1 1) slabs.
Detailed descriptions about these DFT calculations
can be found elsewhere [16]. Density functional the-
ory calculations for Pt clusters were carried out with
Jaguar software (Schrodinger, Inc.) [26]. The chosen
density functional uses a hybrid method employing

97
Beckes three-parameter approach, B3LYP. The basis
set employed in all calculations uses an effective core
potential on all Pt atoms. The C and H atoms have
been treated with the 631Gbasis set, with all elec-
trons being considered explicitly. Slab calculations
[27] were conducted for both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(2 1 1)
surfaces. Calculations were performed on both two
and three layer slabs, which were periodically repeated
in a super cell geometry with four equivalent layers
of vacuum between any two successive metal slabs. A
2×2 unit cell was used to study the adsorption of vari-
ous species, corresponding to 1/4 monolayer coverage.
Ionic cores are described by ultra-soft pseudopoten-
tials, and the KohnSham one-electron valence states
are expanded in a basis of plane waves with kinetic en-
ergies below 25 Ry. The surface Brillouin zone is sam-
pled at 18 special k-points. The exchange-correlation
energy and potential are described by the generalized
gradient approximation (PW-91).
These DFT calculations were used to determine the
binding energies of experimentally observed surface
species, such as di-s bonded ethylene, ethylidyne
species, and di-s/p vinylidene species as well as the
binding energies of the other unobserved species,
such as ethyl, ethylidene and vinyl species, that are
postulated to be reactive intermediates in surface
[16,25]. Furthermore, these calculations predicted ac-
tivation energies for CC bond dissociation of various

a Thermodynamic properties (1H, 1So, and 1Go) determined at 623 K and 1 atm. The calculated standard entropies (1 atm, 623 K) for
gaseous ethane and dihydrogen are 278 and 152 J/mol/K, respectively.
adsorbed C2Hx species. Importantly, it was shown
that the bonding energies are dependent on the geom-
etry of the surface, leading to the observed structure
sensitivity of ethane hydrogenolysis [16].
The results from our DFT calculations for various
stable C2Hx species and transitions states on Pt(1 1 1)
and Pt(2 1 1) surfaces are summarized in Table 1. This
table also shows entropy changes for the various steps,
as estimated from DFT calculations of the vibrational
frequencies for the various C2Hx species and transi-
tion states on 10-atom Pt clusters [16]. In addition,
Table 1 shows estimates of the standard Gibbs free
energy changes for the formation of stable C2Hx sur-
face species and activated complexes responsible for
CC bond cleavage at 623 K. These estimates were
made by combining the energetic information ob-
tained from DFT calculations involving C2Hx species
on Pt slabs, with entropic information obtained from
DFT calculations involving C2Hx species on Pt clus-
ters. In can be seen in Table 1 that the processes with
the most favorable changes in Gibbs free energies are
steps S7 and S5, i.e. the formation of atomic hydrogen
and ethylidyne species (CCH3) on Pt. In contrast,
the lowest Gibbs free energy barrier for cleavage
of the CC bond is through the activated complex
based on ethyl species (C2H
5 ). Additionally, Table 1
shows that the calculated values of the activation bar-
riers are significantly lower on Pt(2 1 1) compared to

Pt(1 1 1), illustrating the structure sensitivity of ethane
hydrogenolysis over platinum-based materials.
The results of our DFT calculations predict that the
primary pathways for CC bond cleavage involve ac-
tivated complexes that are more highly hydrogenated
(e.g. adsorbed CHCH3 and C2H5 species) compared
to the most abundant surface intermediates (e.g.
adsorbed CCH3). Accordingly, the adsorbed C2Hx
reactive species that are responsible for CC bond
cleavage are not necessarily the most abundant surface
intermediates that can be observed spectroscopically.
However, the most abundant surface intermediates
(e.g. adsorbed atomic hydrogen and CCH3) still play
an important role in the reaction kinetics by determin-
ing the fraction of the surface that is available for cat-
alytic reaction (i.e. they participate in site blocking).
2.3. Reaction scheme for ethane hydrogenolysis
Based on the results from our DFT calculations, we
have employed the reaction scheme shown in Table 2
to describe our reaction kinetic data for ethane hydro-
genolysis over Pt. This reaction scheme incorporates
the quasi-equilibrated formation of C2Hx species with
2 x 5 and CC bond cleavage of C2Hx species
with 3 x 5. As shown above, the surface cover-
ages by stable C2Hx species and activated complexes
for CC cleavage of C2Hx species are expressed in

2.4. Parameterization of the kinetic model
In view of the present accuracy of quantum chem-
ical calculations, it is typically necessary to adjust
the initial estimates of the potential energy surface
to describe the observed kinetics of a catalytic pro-
cess. Accordingly, the theoretical results presented in
Table 1 provide initial guesses for the entropies and
enthalpies of the stable species and reactive intermedi-
ates involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over platinum.
In the present kinetic analysis, the entropies of surface
species were adjusted by two fitting parameters: (1)
a multiplicative factor applied to the DFT-predicted
entropies for stable C2Hx species; and (2) a multi-
plicative factor applied to the DFT-predicted entropies
of activated complexes. Additionally, the enthalpy
changes for the eight quasi-equilibrated steps shown
in Table 2 were varied. For the stable adsorbed
species, we have used the energetic properties corre-
sponding to the most favorable Gibbs free energy for
a given stoichiometry. For example, we have included
the coverage of di-s bonded ethylene species, C2H4,
instead of the vinylidene species, CHCH3. However,
the transition state for cleavage of the CC bond
in adsorbed C2H4 species has a higher Gibbs free

99
energy than the transition state for adsorbed CHCH3
species. Therefore, we have expressed CC bond
cleavage through the activated vinylidene species
rather than the activated di-s bonded ethylene.
2.5. Results of the kinetic analysis
Values for the fitted parameters were determined
using Athena Visual Workbench [28]. This software
employs a general regression analysis of the reaction
kinetics data with the reactor treated as a continuous
stirred-tank reactor. All values of the parameters were
estimated at the average reactor temperature of 623 K.

These figures show the change of the methane produc-
tion rate with respect to the ethane and hydrogen pres-
sures at 573, 623, and 673 K. Tests were conducted at
replicate conditions to track possible changes in cata-
lyst reactivity (e.g. deactivation). Data points for these
replicate tests are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The experi-
mental error determined from these points was <6%.

shows that the ethane kinetic orders are near unity at
all temperatures at the higher hydrogen pressure of

Table 2 lists the values of the fixed and fitted param-
eters, along with 95% confidence limits for the fitted
parameters. The surface coverages of the stable C2H5
and CCH2 adsorbed species are predicted to be low;
therefore, the overall rate was not sensitive to the en-
thalpy changes to form these surface species, and the
values for these enthalpy changes were maintained at
the theoretically predicted values. In this simulation,
the surface entropy for adsorbed hydrogen was con-
strained to not exceed a value corresponding to two
degrees of translational freedom (mobile adsorption).
The resulting enthalpy change for hydrogen adsorp-
tion was fitted to a value of 54 kJ/mol. The kinetic
analyses predict that the surface should be largely
covered with atomic hydrogen (fractional coverage
of 0.55). Results from previous microcalorimetric
studies of hydrogen adsorption on silica-supported
platinum indicate that the fitted standard entropy and
enthalpy changes are reasonable at this average cover-
age [2932]. Furthermore, Table 2 shows comparisons
between the theoretically predicted and the fitted free
energy changes. For the adsorption of hydrogen, this
free energy comparison shows good agreement be-
tween the predicted value and fitted value. Similarly,
Table 2 shows good agreement between theory and
the fitted values for the free energy changes involved

101
in the formation of stable CCH3 and C2H4 species
on the surface. The results in Table 2 indicate that the
mobilities for the stable adsorbed C2Hx species are
higher than the predicted values, since the value of
the multiplicative factor applied to the standard sur-
face entropies of these stable species was found to be
1.41. This multiplicative factor results in fitted values
for the surface entropies of the stable species that
correspond to species with one degree of translational
freedom on the surface. Table 2 also indicates that the
fit of the kinetic data utilizes slightly lower entropies
for the transition states compared to theoretical pre-
dictions, since the multiplicative factor applied to the
standard surface entropies of these transition states
was found to be 0.86. These results indicate that the
transition states are essentially immobile species.
The largest differences between the theoretical pre-
dictions and the results of the kinetic analysis are in
the enthalpy changes to form the transition states from
gas-phase ethane. The theoretically predicted enthalpy
changes for the formation of C2Hx transition states
were too large to achieve the measured rate of ethane
hydrogenolysis. Accordingly, these enthalpy changes
were allowed to decrease, but they were constrained
to remain within 50 kJ/mol of the theoretical values.
The results of the DFT calculations predict that the
preferred reaction pathway for cleavage of the CC
bond involves adsorbed C2H5 species, while the re-
sults from kinetic analyses suggest that the preferred
reaction pathway involves adsorbed CHCH3 species.
Importantly, the results from DFT calculations and
the kinetic analyses agree that CC bond cleavage
takes place through C2Hx species that are more hy-
drogenated than the most abundant C2Hx species on
the surface.
3. Discussion
The results from De Donder analyses of a general
reaction scheme for ethane hydrogenolysis indicate
that the rate of the overall reaction can be described
in terms of a series of lumped reaction steps involving
the formation of stable C2Hx adsorbed species and
transition states from gas-phase ethane and dihydro-
gen. Over Pt catalysts, these lumped reactions to form
stable C2Hx adsorbed species are quasi-equilibrated,
since deuterium tracing experiments show that ex-
change reactions between ethane and deuterium to
yield deuterated ethane occur at higher rates than
the rate of the hydrogenolysis reaction. In particular,
Zaera and Somorjai [33] showed that the deuterium
exchange rates were three orders of magnitude faster
than the rate of ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt(1 1 1)
at temperatures between 475 and 625 K.
The formation of surface intermediates in quasi-
equilibrium with gas-phase ethane and dihydrogen
was proposed by Cimino et al. [15]. As mentioned
above, this mechanism involves the quasi-equilibrated
formation of a most abundant reactive intermediate
that undergoes CC bond cleavage. Sinfelt [7,8] used
a variation of this mechanism to analyze kinetic data
for ethane hydrogenolysis over a variety of metal
catalysts, and estimated values of x for the adsorbed
C2Hx reactive intermediates on these metals. Results
from kinetic analyses by Sinfelt over Pt suggested
that the rate-limiting step involved a highly dehydro-
genated C2Hx intermediate [7]. The results of DFT
calculations presented in Table 1 suggest that the
most abundant stable C2Hx surface species are not
necessarily the most reactive species. In particular, the
most abundant species on the surface are predicted
to be atomic hydrogen and CCH3 species, whereas
CC bond cleavage is predicted to take place through
C2H5 species, with contributions also from CHCH3
and/or C2H3 species. While the most abundant sur-
face species (e.g. adsorbed atomic hydrogen and
ethylidyne species) are not directly involved in the
primary reaction pathways, they affect the observed
kinetic rates through blocking of sites.
More recent results of NMR investigations con-
ducted by Klug et al. [34] in conjunction with Sinfelt
suggest that the CC bond breaking step may involve
an adsorbed C2Hx species with x = 3 over platinum.
In this more recent investigation, it was demonstrated
that ethylidyne (CCH3) species form upon adsorption
of acetylene on platinum, and it was suggested that
these ethylidyne species may play a role in the CC
bond scission of acetylene [34]. Our kinetic model for
ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt, based on lumped re-
actions identified by De Donder analysis and utilizing
initial guesses for kinetic parameters from results of
DFT calculations, provides a good description of the
reaction kinetics data collected over a wide range of
reaction conditions. The primary difference between
the values of the final kinetic parameters used in the
102
R.D. Cortright et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 163 (2000) 91103
model and the initial values obtained from DFT cal-
culations was that the fitted enthalpy changes for the
formation of C2Hx transition states involved in cleav-
age of the CC bond were lower than the initial values
predicted from DFT calculations. This difference may
be caused by the observed structure sensitivity of the
ethane hydrogenolysis over metals. In fact, Table 1
shows significant differences between the binding en-
ergies on Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(2 1 1) for various adsorbates
and transition states. In general, the hydrocarbon
species and transition states are held more strongly on
the step edge of the Pt(2 1 1) surface compared to the
Pt(1 1 1) surface, leading to higher reactivity of defect
sites like the step edge of Pt(2 1 1). Accordingly, the
studied Pt catalyst may contain Pt surface atoms with
even higher reactivity than the sites present on the
Pt(2 1 1) surface. It must also be noted that the errors
involved in the DFT calculations may contribute to
the differences in the predicted and experimental val-
ues. For example, the calculated bonding energetics
are dependent on the functional used to describe the
effects of electron exchange and correlation.
Finally, the kinetic analyses presented in this study
were based on the assumption of a uniform surface
that follows Langmuiran kinetics. This simplification
may not be completely justified, since the kinetic anal-
yses suggest that the surface is highly covered with
adsorbed hydrogen atoms and/or hydrocarbon species.
Furthermore, this analysis involves intermediates and
transition states that interact with three, four, or five
Pt atoms to explain the observed variations in the
overall rate with respect to the dihydrogen and ethane
pressures. Accordingly, the next step for the analysis
of this system may be to use the results from DFT
calculations in conjunction with Monte Carlo calcu-
lations to predict the observed reaction kinetics data.
4. Conclusions
The principles of De Donder can be applied to
a general reaction scheme of elementary steps for
ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt to identify a set of
kinetic coefficients that explain the observed reaction
kinetics. These kinetic coefficients are expressed in
terms of lumped reaction steps involving the formation
of stable adsorbed species and transition states from
gaseous ethane and dihydrogen. Values for the stan-
dard entropy and enthalpy changes for these steps are
predicted from DFT calculations of the interactions
of the appropriate species with Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(2 1 1)
slabs. The results of these DFT calculations suggest
that the primary pathways for CC bond cleavage
may take place through activated complexes that are
more highly hydrogenated (e.g. C2H5 and CHCH3)
compared to the most abundant surface intermediates
(e.g. CCH3). Accordingly, the reactive species that are
responsible for CC bond cleavage are not necessar-
ily the most abundant surface intermediates that can
be observed spectroscopically. However, these most
abundant surface intermediates still play an important
role in the reaction kinetics by determining the frac-
tion of the surface that is available for catalytic reac-
tion (i.e. they participate in site blocking). The initial
values for most of the kinetic parameters obtained
from DFT calculations provide a good description
for the reaction kinetics data collected over a wide
range of reaction conditions. The primary difference
between the values of the final kinetic parameters
used in the model and the initial values obtained from
DFT calculations was that the fitted enthalpy changes
for the formation of C2Hx transition states involved
in cleavage of the CC bond were lower than the
initial values predicted from DFT calculations. This
difference may be explained by the structure sensi-
tivity of the system and/or the inherent error of the
DFT calculations. The analyses of this study provide
a description at the molecular-level of the catalytic
chemistry involved in ethane hydrogenolysis over Pt,
and this description may be useful for further studies
of hydrocarbon reactions on metal surfaces.
