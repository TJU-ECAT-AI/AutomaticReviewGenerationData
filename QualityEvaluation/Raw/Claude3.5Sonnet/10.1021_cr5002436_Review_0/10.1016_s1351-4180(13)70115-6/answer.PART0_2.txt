The given text does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does mention the Oleflex process, which is used to produce olefins. Specifically, the text mentions that the C4 Oleflex process converts iso-butane to iso-butylene through catalytic dehydrogenation. This iso-butylene is described as a valuable petrochemical used in the production of fuels and synthetic rubber. The text does not provide information on ethylene or propylene production, their specific applications beyond fuels and rubber, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges related to their synthesis.
