[1] "UOP LLC announced on 30 Jan 2013 that its Oleflex process technology has been selected by Chinas Longgang Chemical Co to produce key ingredients for fuels and synthetic rubber. This process will be used to convert refinery-derived iso-butane to iso-butylene, a valuable petrochemical used in the production of fuels and synthetic rubber."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does mention some relevant points about olefin production:

The Oleflex process technology is used to produce olefins, specifically converting iso-butane to iso-butylene. This iso-butylene is described as a valuable petrochemical used in producing fuels and synthetic rubber. 

The process uses catalytic dehydrogenation to convert the alkane (iso-butane) to the olefin (iso-butylene). This gives some insight into one production method for olefins, though it focuses on C4 rather than the lighter C2-C3 olefins mentioned in the question.

The literature does not provide information on market trends, thermodynamic challenges, or effects of temperature, pressure and chain length for light olefin production. More comprehensive sources would be needed to fully address those aspects of the question.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于轻质烯烃(如丙烯和乙烯)的问题。但是,它确实提到了一些与烯烃生产相关的要点:

Oleflex工艺技术用于生产烯烃,特别是将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。这种异丁烯被描述为用于生产燃料和合成橡胶的有价值的石化产品。

该工艺使用催化脱氢将烷烃(异丁烷)转化为烯烃(异丁烯)。这提供了烯烃生产方法的一些见解,尽管它侧重于C4而不是问题中提到的更轻的C2-C3烯烃。

该文献没有提供有关轻质烯烃生产的市场趋势、热力学挑战或温度、压力和链长效应的信息。需要更全面的资料来充分解决问题中的这些方面。
