The given literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does mention some relevant information about olefin production:

The Oleflex process technology is used to produce key ingredients for fuels and synthetic rubber. Specifically, it converts iso-butane to iso-butylene, which is described as a valuable petrochemical used in fuel and synthetic rubber production. The process uses catalytic dehydrogenation for this conversion.

The literature does not discuss propylene or ethylene directly, nor does it provide details on market trends, thermodynamic challenges, or effects of temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length on olefin synthesis. More comprehensive information would be needed to fully address all aspects of the question.

给定的文献并没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于丙烯和乙烯等轻质烯烃的问题。但是，它确实提到了一些与烯烃生产相关的信息：

Oleflex工艺技术被用于生产燃料和合成橡胶的关键成分。具体来说，它将异丁烷转化为异丁烯，后者被描述为用于燃料和合成橡胶生产的有价值的石化产品。该过程使用催化脱氢来实现这种转化。

文献没有直接讨论丙烯或乙烯，也没有提供有关市场趋势、热力学挑战或温度、压力和烷烃链长对烯烃合成影响的详细信息。需要更全面的信息才能完整地解答问题的所有方面。
