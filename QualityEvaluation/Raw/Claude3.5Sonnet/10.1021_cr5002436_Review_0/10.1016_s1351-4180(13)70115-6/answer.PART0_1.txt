The given literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins such as propylene and ethylene. However, it does mention some relevant information about olefin production:

The UOP Oleflex process is used to produce olefins, specifically converting iso-butane to iso-butylene. This iso-butylene is described as a valuable petrochemical used in the production of fuels and synthetic rubber. The process employs catalytic dehydrogenation to convert the alkane (iso-butane) to the corresponding olefin (iso-butylene).

The literature does not provide details on ethylene or propylene production, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects. It also lacks information on other key production methods for light olefins.

给定的文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于轻质烯烃(如丙烯和乙烯)的问题。但是,它确实提到了一些与烯烃生产相关的信息:

UOP的Oleflex工艺用于生产烯烃,具体是将异丁烷转化为异丁烯。这种异丁烯被描述为一种用于生产燃料和合成橡胶的有价值的石化产品。该工艺采用催化脱氢法将烷烃(异丁烷)转化为相应的烯烃(异丁烯)。

文献没有提供关于乙烯或丙烯生产、市场趋势或与温度、压力或烷烃链长效应相关的热力学挑战的详细信息。它也缺乏关于轻质烯烃其他关键生产方法的信息。
