KINETICS AND CATALYSIS 
Kinetic Modeling of the Thermal Cracking of Hydrocarbons. 1. 
Calculation of Frequency Factors

The kinetic modeling of the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons is done by means of a free-radical 
reaction scheme containing several hundreds of reactions. The most important problem to be solved 
is to assign values to the corresponding reaction rate parameters. The procedure used for the 
frequency factors is dealt with here. Starting from detailed mechanisms for every reaction, a structure 
is set forward for the corresponding activated complex. The standard entropy of the activated 
complex is estimated by means of statistical thermodynamics. The frequency factor is then calculated 
by means of the results of transition-state theory. The procedure drastically reduces the number 
of parameters. These are now related to the fundamental aspects of transition-state theory. An 
optimization procedure can then be used to determine the optimal parameter values corresponding 
to a given set of experimental data. Values for the parameters based on literature information are 
given. 
In today's operation of a plant for the thermal cracking 
of hydrocarbons, 
simulation models play a very important 
role. Determining the optimal process conditions and 
evaluating potential feedstocks are two important appli- 
cations. 
Simulation models for a chemical reactor comprise two 
major parts: a mathematical model of the reactor itself 
and a kinetic model for the stoichiometric changes in the 
reactor. For both parts, different levels of sophistication 
can be used. 
The one-dimensional mathematical reactor model con- 
sists of a set of ordinary differential equations describing 
the change in composition, temperature, and pressure as 
a function of the axial position in the reactor. Plug flow 
conditions are met well in thermal cracking reactors be- 
cause of the high Reynolds number at which they operate. 
Only moderate heat fluxes are used in classical reactors, 
and in this case, the one-dimensional 
model is sufficiently 
accurate. In reactors with high heat fluxes, however, sig- 
nificant radial temperature gradients may exist. In turn, 
the radial temperature profile causes radial concentration 
profiles because of the differences in reaction rate. In this 
case, it becomes necessary to use a two-dimensional 
model 
which considers changes in temperature and composition 
in both radial and axial directions (Sundaram and Fro- 
ment, 1979). The computational effort for the solution of 
the corresponding set of partial differential equations is 
significant, and the use of this type of model is restricted 
to special cases only (Froment and Bischoff, 1979). 
The model which describes the stoichiometric 
changes 
in the reactor and the rate at which they occur is usually 
referred to as the kinetic model. The thermal cracking of 
hydrocarbons is known to proceed through free-radical 
mechanisms. The modeling of thermal cracking based 
upon these mechanisms requires a kinetic model contain- 
ing several hundreds of reactions. The earlier kinetic 
models used a limited number of globalizing molecular 
reactions to describe the stoichiometry of the process

(Sundaram and Froment, 1977a,b). 
Because of their globalizing nature, these models are 
only valid for specific feedstocks and for a limited range 
of operating conditions. Recent modeling work in the field 
of thermal cracking concentrates on the use of free-radical 
reaction mechanisms (Sundaram and Froment, 1978; 
Edelson and Allara, 1980; Goossens et al., 1979; Scharfe 
et al., 1985). This is presently generally recognized as the 
only possible approach to obtain a model which is valid 
over a wide range of operating conditions and for different 
feedstocks. 
Construction of a Kinetic Model 
In the chain mechanism of the thermal decomposition 
of hydrocarbons, the smaller free radicals like H', CH,', 
CzH5*, 
etc., are the chain carriers. As in every chain 
mechanism, the reactions can be classified into initiation, 
propagation, and termination steps. The propagation re- 
actions themselves can be further divided into hydrogen 
abstraction, radical addition, radical decomposition, and 
radical isomerization reactions. 
Termination reactions are the opposite process of ini- 
tiation reactions. Together these two classes of reactions 
can be considered as a group of reversible reactions. 
Radical addition and radical decomposition are also two 
opposite processes. Finally, the group of H-abstraction 
reactions and the group of radical isomerization 
reactions 
can also be considered as 
two groups of reversible reactions. 
In total, the reaction scheme thus contains four groups of 
reversible reactions. The application of this reaction 
mechanism to the thermal cracking of light hydrocarbons 
is rather straightforward. This paper deals with feedstocks, 
which are mixtures that may contain the following light 
hydrocarbons: methane, ethylene, ethane, propylene, 
propane, 1-butene 
and isobutene, n-butene, 
and isobutane. 
The resulting reaction scheme contains some 500 reactions 
in which some 30 molecular species and 30 radicals are 
involved.

The most difficult part of the construction of a kinetic 
model consists of assigning values to the rate constants of 
the individual reactions. For every reaction, this requires 
a value for the frequency factor and one for the activation 
energy. It is quite obvious that determining values for a 
thousand parameters by means of regression of experi- 
mental product distributions is both practically impossible 
and fundamentally undesirable. The problem to be solved 
in constructing a free-radical kinetic model could then be 
stated as follows: develop a systematic approach for the 
calculation of frequency factors and activation energies 
which contains a minimal number of parameters, to be 
estimated by regression, without affecting the fundamental 
nature of the model. This systematic approach has to be 
based on accurate experimental data on the cracking of 
the components of the various feeds and their products 
and on fundamental chemical and thermodynamic laws. 
In the present paper, the calculation of frequency factors 
is based on a combination of transition-state theory and 
statistical thermodynamics. According to transition-state 
theory, the calculation of a frequency factor reduces to the 
calculation of the standard entropy of the activated com- 
plex. From a detailed analysis of the mechanism of a 
reaction, a structure is set forward for the corresponding 
activated complex. Since the activated complex is not a 
stable compound, 
this entropy can only be estimated. The 
standard entropy of a parent molecule whose structure is 
close to that of the activated complex is used as 
a starting 
point in the estimation. The differences in the degrees of 
freedom between the activated complex and the parent 
molecule are taken into account by means of statistical 
thermodynamics. In the following, the relevant theoretical 
aspects will be briefly reviewed. 
Degrees of Freedom of a Molecule 
An amount of 3N variables is necessary to define the 
exact position of all nuclei in a molecule with N atoms. 
The molecule is said to have 3N degrees of freedom. Every 
nonlinear molecule has 6 external degrees of freedom as- 
sociated with motions of the entire molecule: 3 transla- 
tional and 3 external rotational degrees of freedom, leaving 
3N - 
6 internal degrees of freedom. These have so-called 
fundamental frequencies associated with them. For larger 
molecules, these fundamental frequencies can only be 
assigned on an empirical basis. The internal degrees of 
freedom and their associated frequencies are divided into 
three groups: (hindered) internal rotations, one for every 
single bond between polyvalent atoms in an acyclic chain; 
stretching frequencies, in general N - 1 
bonds exist be- 
tween N atoms (except in rings); the motion associated 
with these frequencies is a vibration along the direction 
of the bond; and bending frequencies, the corresponding 
vibration consists of a deformation of the bond angles; the 
number of bending frequencies 
is generally obtained from 
a balance on the number of degrees of freedom. 
Transition-State Theory 
Eyring and his co-workers (Eyring, 1935a,b; Glasstone 
et al., 1941) were the first to present a quantitative for- 
mulation of transition-state theory (also called activated 
complex theory). After these pioneering papers, work 
mainly centered around theoretical aspects, but very few 
authors have tried to apply the theory to practical cases. 
Cohen (1982) used the theory to extrapolate experimental 
rate constants to higher temperatures. Benson (1976) 
discussed the application of the theory to various types 
of gas-phase reactions. 
According 
to transition-state theory, the rate constant 
of a reaction can be written as 
k T  
h 
12, = -Kc* 
where k, is the reaction rate constant written in terms of 
concentrations, K,' is a modified equilibrium constant for 
the formation 
of the activated complex from the reactants, 
written in terms of concentrations, T is the absolute tem- 
perature (K), k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 X 
J/K), and h is the Planck constant (6.62 X 
J-s). 
Equation 1 
is valid both for unimolecular and for bimo- 
lecular reactions. The difference between both types of 
reactions is taken into account through the equilibrium 
constant, K,', calculated with respect to a standard state 
in concentration units. During the reaction, one of the 
internal vibrations of the activated complex is converted 
into the reaction coordinate. In the derivation of eq 1, 
the 
partition function (see eq 6 and following) corresponding 
to this degree of freedom has been factored out of the 
equilibrium constant. Therefore, K,' is called a modified 
equilibrium constant. 
The Arrhenius dependence of the reaction rate and the 
dependence of the equilibrium constant on the state 
functions of the species involved can be introduced into 
eq 1, 
yielding the following equations for the activation 
energy, E,, and the frequency factor, A,:

and ASo* are the standard enthalpy and the 
standard entropy of activation. They are calculated as 
the 
difference between the state functions of the activated 
complex and those of the reactants. The change in number 
of moles in the transition from the reactants to the acti- 
vated complex is represented by Av', with a value of 0 for 
unimolecular reactions and -1 for bimolecular reactions. 
To date, transition-state theory can only be used with 
sufficient accuracy 
for calculating frequency factors, since 
energies are not accurately known for most molecules. 
The thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons only starts 
around 600 "C, and the maximum temperatures in an 
industrial reactor are of the order of 850-900 "C. There- 
fore, 750 "C (1023 
K) is an acceptable average temperature 
to be used in eq 3. For unimolecular reactions, eq 3 reduces 
to

Given eq 4 and 5, the calculation of a frequency factor 
reduces to the calculation of the standard entropy of ac- 
tivation and thus to the calculation of the standard entropy 
of the activated complex. 
By definition the activated complex for the forward and 
the backward steps of a reversible reaction is the same 
component. Once the standard entropy of the activated 
complex is known, the frequency factors for both reaction 
steps can be readily calculated. Using transition-state 
theory for the calculation of frequency factors therefore

guarantees their thermodynamic consistency. 
Calculation of the Standard Entropy from 
Partition Functions 
In statistical thermodynamics, the state of a molecule 
is described by a so-called partition function. For ideal 
gases, the molar partition function, Q, can be factored with 
good accuracy into a product of partition functions, one 
for each degree of freedom of the molecule 
Q = QtransQext rotQint rotQvibQelecQsym 
(6) 
The electronic partition function, Qelec, 
only occurs when 
the molecule contains an odd electron. The symmetry of 
the entire molecule and of the internal rotations is grouped 
into the symmetry partition function, QsW. 
The standard entropy is related to the molar partition 
function according to 
degree of freedom 
So 
= k In (Q) + k - 
(d" :," ;:;)" 
(7) 
From eq 6 and 7, it is obvious that the standard entropy 
is composed of additive contributions for the different 
degrees of freedom 
so 
= sotrans + Soextrot + Sointrot + S'vib + S'elec + soap 
(8) 
Each of these contributions is related to the corresponding 
partition function by eq 7. Table I lists the contributions 
of the different degrees of freedom to the standard entropy. 
When all the vibration frequencies and the mechanical 
properties of the molecule are known, the standard entropy 
can be calculated by means of the equations given in Table 
I. 
The equations in Table I can also be used to calculate 
the change in entropy due to changes in the molecular 
structure during the transition to the activated complex. 
This is how statistical thermodynamics enters into the 
application of transition-state theory. The standard en- 
tropy of a component contains a contribution due to the 
symmetry of the molecule. The remainder is called the 
intrinsic standard entropy. 
(9) 
The determination of the symmetry number, u, requires 
a detailed scrutiny of the spatial structure of the molecule. 
Experimental values for the standard entropies of simple 
components can be found in the literature (Reid et al., 
1976), but for many complex molecules no such experi- 
mental data are available. For these components, the 
standard entropy can be calculated with reasonable accu- 
racy from group contribution methods. For reasons of 
consistency,

calculations were obtained from the group contribution 
method of Benson (1976). The agreement with experi- 
mental values is satisfactory. The intrinsic standard en- 
tropy is calculated directly by means of group contribu- 
tions. The correction for the symmetry number has to be 
made separately. 
Calculation of the Standard Activation Entropy 
General Outline. Frequency factors for unimolecular 
and bimolecular reactions are easily calculated from eq 4 
and 5 when the standard activation entropy, ASo', of the 
reaction is known. The latter is calculated from the dif- 
ference in standard entropy between the activated complex 
and the reactants. 
ASo* = So(ts) 
- 
CSO(reactants) 
(10) 
So(ts) 
is the standard entropy of the activated complex 
in the transition state.

as

It was already pointed out that the symmetry contribution 
to the standard entropy cannot always be determined in 
a straightforward way. The value of the symmetry cor- 
rection depends upon the proposed structure for the ac- 
tivated complex. Quite obviously this is undesirable, since 
the precise structure is not always known. The alternative 
approach, which used intrinsic entropies together with a 
so-called "statistical factor", does not have these draw- 
backs. The statistical factor, s, is defined as the number 
of identical bonds in a molecule which can undergo a given 
reaction. This number is always easily determined by 
visual inspection of the symbolic structure of the molecule. 
For those reactions in which all symmetry numbers are 
well-known, both methods are in agreement. Because of 
its simplicity, the approach with the statistical factor is 
used here. The standard activation entropy is then cal- 
culated from 
ASo* = Sointr(ts) 
- 
CSointr(reactants) 
+ R In (s) 
(12) 
The intrinsic standard entropies of the reactants can be 
calculated from group contributions. The activated com- 
plex is not a stable compound, however, and group con- 
tributions are not applicable in this case. Therefore, 
Sointr(ts) 
can only be estimated. 
From a detailed analysis of the mechanism of every 
reaction, a structure can be proposed for the corresponding 
activated complex. This is shown in Table I1 for a few 
typical reactions. The parent molecule associated with the 
activated complex is the stable compound whose structure 
1962 Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., Vol. 27, No. 11, 1988 
is as similar as possible to the structure of the activated 
complex. These are also shown in Table 11. 
Initiation mainly occurs through the rupture of a C-C 
bond and to a lesser extent also through rupture of C-H 
bonds. In the transition state, the bond which is about 
to be broken is elongated by a factor of approximately 2.8 
(Benson, 1976). The two fragments 
are relatively far apart, 
and this is called a loose transition state. In general, the 
rupture of a bond with no other significant changes in 
internal structure occurs through a loose transition state. 
The change in standard entropy of activation, ASo', for 
these reactions is positive and the frequency factor is 
correspondingly high. 
In the case of H-abstraction reactions, the activated 
complex is defined as follows. The hydrogen to be ab- 
stracted is bound by means of semibonds both with the 
reactant molecule and with the abstracting radical. These 
two semibonds involve three electrons. According to 
Benson (1976), 
the length of these semibonds is approxi- 
mately 1.4 times the normal bond length. It is assumed 
that the two semibonds are colinear. The accompanying 
parent molecule is found by removing the hydrogen to be 
abstracted and attaching the abstracting radical to the 
molecule. 
The transition state of the decomposition reactions is 
called tight since a double bond is formed, together with 
the rupture of the bond. The change in standard entropy 
of activation, ASo', for those reactions is negative and the 
frequency factor correspondingly low. 
In all cases, the structure of the parent molecule is 
similar but not equal to that of the activated complex. 
Therefore, the intrinsic standard entropies of both species 
are comparable, but not equal. Soint,(parent) 
is used as 
a starting point in the calculation of Sohtr(ts). 
The ther- 
modynamic state functions of the parent molecule can be 
calculated by means of group contributions. The equations 
in Table I are used to make corrections for the difference 
in structure between the two species. 
Accounting for eq 8 and 12, the standard activation 
entropy can be written as 
ASo* = Soint,(parent) 
+ 
+ ASo*e,trot + 
ASo*introt 
+ ASotvib + ASo*elec - 
CSoint,(reactants) 
+ R In (8) 
(13) 
ASottranS, 
etc., are corrections for the differences 
in standard entropy between the activated complex and 
the parent molecule due to differences in translational, 
external rotational, etc., degrees of freedom. 
The calculation of those corrections will be discussed for 
the different classes of reactions which occur in the thermal 
cracking of hydrocarbons: initiation, H abstraction, de- 
composition, and isomerization. For every reversible re- 
action, the calculation of Soht,(ts) 
needs to be performed 
only once to obtain both frequency factors. 
Sointr(ts) 
for a termination reaction is obtained by ap- 
plying the procedure for the corresponding initiation re- 
action. For the addition reactions, the procedure for the 
corresponding decomposition reaction has to be followed. 
Initiation Reactions. Four different types of initiation 
reactions have to be considered: rupture of a paraffinic 
C-H or C-C bond and rupture of a bond in the a- or 
@-position 
with respect to a double bond. Initiation of a 
paraffinic bond and of a bond in a-position proceeds 
through a loose transition state. The initiation of a bond 
in the @-position 
proceeds through a compact transition 
state because of the beginning resonance stabilization. 
For all initiation reactions, reactant and parent molecule 
are the same component, so that AS"' consists of the 
corrections for the differences in structure only. 
In the following the calculation of the activation entropy 
is discussed step by step, starting with the simplest case: 
the initiation of a paraffinic C-H bond. 
Consider the initiation of ethane through the rupture 
of a C-H bond: 
CZH, - 
CzHb' + H' 
ts = (H,C-CHZ- - -H) 
* 
The ethane molecule has 6 external and 3 X 8 - 
6 = 18 
internal degrees of freedom, the ethyl radical 6 external 
and 15 internal, and the hydrogen radical 3 external de- 
grees of freedom. This means that in the transition state 
three internal degrees of freedom of the ethane molecule 
are in the process of being converted into external degrees 
of freedom of the reaction products. One of the internal 
degrees of freedom is the C-H stretch, which becomes the 
reaction coordinate. The other two are bending frequen- 
cies. 
The elongation of the C-H bond affects the properties 
of the molecule in several ways. The product of the three 
principal moments of inertia increases due to the distance 
between the two separating fragments. This increases the 
external rotation entropy of the molecule. The separating 
H atom has gained more freedom as a result of the bond 
elongation. The amplitude of the bending frequencies 
associated with the H atom has increased. The influence 
of this on the standard entropy can be taken into account 
by a decrease of the bending frequencies. Benson (1976) 
suggests frequencies which are about one-sixth to one- 
fourth of their normal values. The problem in quantifying 
these influences is that the precise elongation factor and 
the corresponding 
decrease in frequencies are not known. 
These uncertainties in the theory are used to introduce 
parameters into the model. Next, the contributions to the 
standard activation entropy due to the different degrees 
of freedom will be quantified. 
The change in standard entropy caused by translation, 
is zero because the activated complex and the 
parent molecule have the same molecular mass. 
The external rotation entropy is determined by the 
product of the three principal moments of inertia of the 
molecule. Hirschfelder (1940) lists formulas for the cal- 
culation of this product from a set of Cartesian coordinates 
of all atoms in the molecule. For complex molecules (say 
with more than four C atoms), generating such a set of 
coordinates becomes quite complicated, 
and this can only 
be done in an efficient way by means of computer pro- 
grams (Willems and Froment, 1988). When such a pro- 
gram is available, the product of the three principal mo- 
ments of inertia for the parent molecule is readily obtained. 
If the bond elongation factor is known exactly, the same 
calculation could be carried out for the activated complex. 
The bond elongation factor is introduced as 
the parameter 
sin. This parameter is supposed to be valid for all initi- 
ation reactions occurring through the rupture of a paraf- 
finic bond. The ratio of the product of the three principal 
moments of inertia for the activated complex to that for 
the parent molecule was calculated for different values of 
@h. 
It was found that this ratio can be accurately fitted 
by means of a third-order polynomial of ai,. This poly- 
nomial is represented by fin. The correction in external 
rotation entropy is written as

The coefficients in fh have to be calculated once for every 
activated complex. For the rupture of a C-H bond, fh is 
significantly different from unity only for light molecules 
because of the low mass of the H atom. 
The change in internal rotation entropy due to the 
elongation of the C-H bond can be neglected because of 
the low mass of the H atom. In the transition state cor- 
responding to the rupture of a C-H bond, three vibrations 
of the reactant molecule are in the process of being con- 
verted into external degrees of freedom of the product 
molecules. To a first approximation, it can be assumed 
that ASo 
*db is limited to those three vibrations. The en- 
tropy contribution from a C-H stretch at 750 "C is about 
0.6 J/(mol.K). This contribution has to be removed be- 
cause the C-H stretch is converted into the reaction co- 
ordinate. The lowering in frequency of the two bending 
vibrations is not accurately known. Table I11 lists, for 
different frequencies, the change in entropy when the 
frequency 
of a vibration is lowered by a certain factor. The 
frequencies are listed as their wavenumber in the con- 
ventional unit of inverse centimeters. Taking into con- 
sideration that most vibrations in hydrocarbons have 
wavenumbers between 500 and 1500 cm-', it is clear that 
the entropy change is solely determined by the lowering 
factor and is independent of the frequency 
of the vibration. 
The parameter M o * v i b h  accounts for the change in entropy 
when the frequency of one vibration is lowered. For the 
rupture of a C-H bond, this correction has to be applied 
twice. The total vibration correction is then 
AS0lvib = 2ASo*vibin 
- 
0.6 (J/(moEK)) 
(15) 
The total standard activation entropy is obtained by 
adding up all these corrections. The general expression 
for the rupture of a paraffinic C-H bond becomes 
A s o *  = 2AS0*vibin - 
0.6 -t 
0.5R In (fh(@in)) 
+ R In (s) 
(16) 
The correction R In 
(s) 
accounts for the number of identical 
C-H bonds in the molecule. 
For initiation by rupture of a paraffinic C-C bond, an 
analysis of the degrees of freedom shows that in this case 
six internal coordinates of the reactant are in the process 
of being converted to external degrees of freedom of the 
products. 
One of them is the C-C stretch which is converted into 
the reaction coordinate. The entropy contribution of this 
stretch is 6.1 J/(mol.K) at 750 "C. 
At the high temperatures which occur in thermal 
cracking, the internal rotation around the C-C bond in the 
reactant can be considered as free, since there is no steric 
hindrance. The same is true for the activated complex, 
and therefore, there is no change in internal rotation en- 
tropy. 
The four remaining coordinates are bending modes 
whose frequency is lowered. 
The standard activation entropy for the rupture of a 
C-C bond is then calculated from 
ASo* = 4AS0*"ibin 
- 
6.1 + 0.5R In (fin(@in)) 
+ R In (s) 
(17) 
Rupture of a bond in the a-position with respect to a 
double bond is completely analogous to the rupture of a 
paraffinic bond, except for the fact that a torsion frequency 
is associated with the substituents on a double bond. 
Partially removing one of these substituents increases this 
torsion frequency, thus causing a slight decrease in entropy. 
This can be taken into account by introducing an addi- 
tional parameter, ASo 
* d b  
in 
a whose value would be com- 
prised between 0 and -4 J/(mol+K). 
In this case, ASo* is obtained from eq 16 or 17 with the 
additional correction A s o  
*vib 
in a. 
The situation is completely different for initiation by 
rupture of a bond in the @-position 
with respect to a double 
bond. The activated complex has a compact structure 
because of the onset of resonance stabilization. In this 
case, bonds are elongated 
by a factor of approximately 1.4, 
and part of the internal rotation entropy is lost. A pa- 
rameter 
is introduced to account for the uncertainty 
on the bond elongation factor. The correction in external 
rotation entropy is 
ASO'extrot = 0*5R 
In (fin(@in,d) 
(18) 
At 298 K, the loss in standard entropy due to a fully de- 
veloped resonance stabilization is about 13 
J/(mol.K). In 
the transition state, the resonance stabilization is only 
partially developed. It is assumed here that the loss in 
internal rotation entropy can be described as a fraction 
ainu 
of the intrinsic entropy that the internal rotation 
would have if there were no resonance stabilization: 
(19) 
Due to the different bond elongation factor as compared 
to the rupture of a paraffinic bond, the change in vibra- 
tional entropy is also different. 
A new parameter, 
ASo 
*vib in 0, is introduced to account for this. The use of 
this parameter is identical with that of ASo 
*vib 
in: 
Aso*Vib 
= 2ASo*vibinu

(20) 
AS" lint rot = -sin 
USOint rot intr 
ASotvib = 4Asotvibinp 
-

(21) 
The standard activation entropy is again obtained by 
adding up all the above corrections. 
Hydrogen Abstraction Reactions. The transition 
state corresponding 
to hydrogen abstraction reactions has 
a compact structure. Benson (1976) suggests a bond 
elongation by 0.3-0.5 A, which is equivalent to an elon- 
gation factor of approximately 1.4. Furthermore, the ac- 
tivated complex has an unshared electron, and two bonds 
have to be formed by means of three electrons only. The 
parent molecule associated with the activated complex of 
a H-abstraction reaction is obtained by removing the hy- 
drogen to be abstracted from the molecule and attaching 
the abstracting radical to the molecule. This is illustrated 
in Table I1 for a few typical H-abstraction reactions. 
SohJts) is obtained from Sohtr(parent) 
by including the 
following corrections: 
The activated complex has one more H atom than the 
parent molecule. The corresponding change in transla- 
tional entropy is negligible in all cases, however. 
The distance between the two C atoms in the reaction 
center changes from 1.54 A to about 2.8 A because of the 
additional H atom. This has 
a significant influence on the 
external rotation entropy which can be calculated from the 
bond elongation factor by means of computer programs. 
Thereby, a linear structure is assumed for the (C---H---H) 
or (C---H---C) 
bonds in the activated complex. The bond 
1964 Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., Vol. 27, No. 11, 1988 
elongation factor is introduced as a parameter, @&, 
in this 
calculation. The resulting change in the product of the 
three principal moments of inertia is fitted by means of 
a third-order polynomial, fab, as a function of @ab. The 
change in external rotation entropy is then obtained from 
(22) 
The activated complex contains an unshared electron. 
This yields a contribution to ASo* represented by R In (2). 
The fundamental frequencies in the neighborhood of the 
reaction center are influenced by the three-electron bonds. 
This necessitates a correction in vibrational entropy. 
Special corrections are required for abstraction in the 
P-position with respect to a double bond. 
In most cases, the largest contribution to ASo* is the 
difference in standard entropy between the parent mole- 
cule and the reactants. Two cases have to be considered 
for the correction in vibrational entropy: abstraction by 
a H atom and abstraction by a polyatomic alkyl radical. 
For the abstraction by a H atom, six changes in funda- 
mental frequencies have to be taken into account. A sim- 
ple example is the H abstraction on ethane: 
ASo*extrot 
= 0.5R In (fab(@ab)) 
H' + C
z

G
 -
+
 H2 + C2HE' 
ts = (H- 
- -H- 
- -CH,-CH,)* 
The C-H stretch is converted into the reaction coordinate. 
A new H---H stretch and two new H---H---C 
bends have 
to be introduced. Two H-C-H bends are converted into 
H---C-H bends. The precise frequencies of those correc- 
tions are not known. In a first approximation, they are 
considered to be independent of the hydrocarbon from 
which a hydrogen is being abstracted. Therefore, a global 
correction, ASo 
*vib ab(H'), is introduced. For reasons of 
thermodynamic consistency, this parameter also has to be 
used when the abstraction from the hydrogen molecule by 
an alkyl radical is considered. The standard activation 
entropy for the abstraction of a paraffinic H atom from 
a hydrocarbon HC by a hydrogen radical then becomes 
ASo* = Sointr(parent) 
+ ASotvibah(H') 
+ R In (2) + 
0.5R In (fab(Gab)) - 
Sointr(H') 
- 
Sointr(HC) 
+ R In (S) 
(23) 
For the abstraction by an alkyl radical, nine modifications 
in the fundamental frequencies have to be considered. 
They are also grouped into a global correction, ASotvibab- 
(alkyl). The ASo* is given by 
ASo* = ASointr(parent) 
+ ASo*vibab(alkyl) 
+ R In (2) + 
0.5R In (fab(aab)) 
- 
Sointr(alkyl 
radical) - 
Sointr(HC) 
+ 
R In (s) (24) 
In the case of the abstraction of a H atom in the a-position 
with respect to a double bond, allowance is made for a 
difference in vibrational entropy. 
The parameter 
ASo*vibaba is introduced to account for this. 
The abstraction of a H atom in the P-position with re- 
spect to a double bond yields a resonance stabilized allylic 
radical. In the activated complex, this resonance stabili- 
zation is partially achieved, thus causing a loss in internal 
rotation entropy. This loss is taken into account as a 
fraction, aab@, 
of the intrinsic internal rotation entropy 
corresponding to no resonance stabilization at all. 
A s o  
*int rot = -aab@Soint rot intr 
(25) 
This correction also has to be applied in the case of ab- 
straction by an allylic radical. 
Decomposition Reactions. The decomposition of a 
radical by the rupture of a bond in the P-position with 
respect to the free electron yields an olefin and a smaller 
radical. The decomposition 
of the ethyl radical is a simple 
example.

The transition state has a compact structure because a 
double bond is formed at the same time as 
the C-H bond 
is broken. During this process, an internal rotation is 
converted into a torsion on a double bond. In the activated 
complex, this is called a semitorsion, because the double 
bond is not fully developed yet. 
For the decomposition reactions, the reactant and the 
parent molecule always are the same component. In this 
case, ASo 
* only consists of the corrections for the difference 
in structure. The loss in internal rotation entropy is taken 
into account as a fraction, adec, 
of the intrinsic standard 
entropy of the completely 
free internal rotation around the 
C-C bond which is converted into the double bond. 
ASo 
*int rot = -adecSoint rot intr 
(26) 
In most cases, the change in external rotation entropy is 
small because of the small bond elongation. It can be 
calculated in exactly the same way as indicated for the 
other reaction classes. 
AsO'extrot = 0.5R In (fdec(@dec)) 
(27) 
So*vibdec is the change in vibrational entropy for one vi- 
bration whose frequency is changed. Its use and value are 
analogous to So 
*"ib in @. 
The standard activation entropy for a radical decom- 
position by rupture of a paraffinic C-H bond is then given 
by 
A s o *  = 2ASo*vibdec - 
0.6 + 0.5R In (fdec(@dec)) 
- 
"decs'int 
rot intr + R In (8) (28) 
The equation for rupture of a paraffinic C-C bond is 
completely analogous, 
except for the change in vibrational 
entropy. The parameter ASo 
lvib 
dec 
oL is introduced to ac- 
count for the difference in vibrational entropy when the 
decomposition requires the rupture of a bond in the a- 
position with respect to a double bond. 
A few decomposition reactions require special attention. 
The most important of those is the formation of a conju- 
gated diene. The conjugation between the double bonds 
in 1,3-butadiene 
causes a loss in internal rotation entropy 
around the central C-C bond. At 298 K, this loss in 
standard entropy is about 7 J/(mol-K). A completely free 
rotation around this bond would correspond to a standard 
entropy of approximately 30 J/mol.K) at 298 K. About 
20% of this entropy is lost due to the conjugation. 
Two different roads lead to the formation of a conju- 
gated diene: the decomposition of a radical with the free 
electron in the y-position with respect to a double bond 
and the decomposition of an allylic radical. The decom- 
position of the 4-butenyl radical is an example of the first 
type of reaction.

Allyl-type radicals have a stiff structure, because of the 
resonance stabilization. The entropy loss corresponding 
to this is about 13 
J/(mol.K). The entropy loss due to 
conjugation between double bonds is only about 7 J/ 
(mo1.K). This results in an increase in entropy during the 
transition to the activated complex which is taken into 
account by the parameter AS" 
*d,(allyl-diene), 
Because 
the allylic radical already has a stiff structure, no correction 
of the type described by eq 29 has to be applied here. 
For the decomposition of a vinyl-type radical with for- 
mation of a triple bond, no loss in internal rotation entropy 
has to be taken into account. To allow for a difference in 
vibrational frequencies, the parameter AS" 
dec(acet) 
is 
introduced. 
Isomerization Reactions. In a reaction scheme for the 
thermal cracking of light hydrocarbons, only 1,2-isomeri- 
zation reactions have to be considered. As a result, the 
group of radical isomerization reactions is relatively small. 
In order to calculate the standard activation entropy along 
the same lines as for the other groups of reactions, a rel- 
atively large number of parameters has to be introduced. 
The activated complex for this type of reactions can be 
represented by 
1 
-CjH; - 
2-C3H; 
# 
t s  = (HzF-FH-CH3) 
\ /  
H 
The structure of the activated complex is the same for 
every 1,kisomerization. Therefore, it is not really neces- 
sary to carry out a detailed calculation of the activation 
entropy: approximately the same result will be obtained 
for every reaction. 
The frequency factors for all 1,2-isomerization 
reactions 
are considered to be identical, except for the statistical 
factor. This parameter is called Ak(l-2), and the frequency 
factor for any 1,2-isomerization with statistical factor s is 
given by 
log (Ais) = log (Ais(1-2)) + log (s) 
(30) 
Numerical Values for the Parameters 
The values which have been assigned to the above pa- 
rameters are based upon two types of information. Benson 
(1976) lists approximate values for vibrational frequencies, 
bond elongation factors, etc., in the different types of ac- 
tivated complexes. 
Further, several reaction schemes for the thermal 
cracking of light hydrocarbons, together with the corre- 
sponding reaction rate constants, have been published in 
the literature. A data base has been created with reaction 
rate constants from 27 publications. This information can 
be used to extract values for the parameters. 
The resulting parameter values are listed in Table IV. 
In those cases where the parameters can be calculated from 
both sources, the agreement is more than satisfactory. By 
use of the frequencies listed by Benson, a value of 16.7 and 
31.8 J/(mol-K) is obtained for AS" 
ab(H') and 
ASo 
'vib ab(alkyl), 
respectively. The corresponding results

obtained from the literature data are 15.5 and 28.8 J/ 
(mo1.K). The values listed in Table IV were used to cal- 
culate the standard activation entropy and the corre- 
sponding 
frequency 
factor for a few typical reactions. The 
results are shown in Table V. In general, they are in good 
agreement with the average frequency factors calculated 
from the literature data base. 
The values in Table IV can be used to calculate the 
frequency factors of all the free-radical reactions which 
occur in the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons. From 
Table V it can be expected that in general the accuracy 
of the calculated frequency factors will be acceptable. 
The above approach for the calculation of frequency 
factors was stated in such a way that it can easily be in- 
corporated into a parameter optimization procedure. The 
values in Table IV then serve as starting values in the 
optimization. The final tuning of the parameter values 
1966 
Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 1988,27, 1966-1971 
is done in such a way that the agreement between simu- 
lated and experimental product distributions is optimal. 
Conclusions 
It has been shown that, in reaction schemes with large 
numbers of mechanistically similar reactions, transition- 
state 
theory can be successfully 
used to calculate 
frequency 
factors. Theoretical uncertainties have led to the intro- 
duction of parameters, which can then be used to optimize 
the values of the frequency factors with respect to ex- 
perimental results. The above method is only advanta- 
geous if the same group of parameters can be used to 
calculate the frequency factors of a large group of similar 
reactions. In this case, the number of parameters to be 
optimized is reduced in a very significant way. The sta- 
tistical significance of the parameters is increased by the 
fact that every parameter is used in many different reac- 
tions. A lack of direct experimental information for a given 
reaction does not necessarily result in insignificant pa- 
rameter values because the same parameters are used in 
many other reactions. Nevertheless, experimental data on 
the cracking of various types of hydrocarbons over a wide 
range of operating conditions are an absolute necessity.
