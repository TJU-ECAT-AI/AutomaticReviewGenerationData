The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing light olefins like propylene and ethylene, their applications, market trends, or production methods. The document focuses on C-H bond activation and organometallic intermediates on oxide surfaces, but does not discuss the industrial production or applications of light olefins. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

However, I can provide some general information on this topic based on common knowledge in the field:

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry, used to produce a wide range of products including plastics, fibers, and other chemicals. Their production and consumption have been growing steadily due to increasing demand for these downstream products.

The main production methods for light olefins include steam cracking of hydrocarbons, fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions, and on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation for propylene. 

Key thermodynamic challenges in olefin production relate to the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions, which become more favorable at higher temperatures but face equilibrium limitations. Longer alkane chain lengths generally allow for easier dehydrogenation. Pressure typically has a negative effect on olefin yield due to Le Chatelier's principle.

Optimizing reactor conditions and developing more efficient catalysts to overcome these thermodynamic constraints remain active areas of research in improving olefin production processes.

所提供的文献并不包含具体讨论轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯、它们的应用、市场趋势或生产方法的信息。该文档主要关注氧化物表面上的C-H键活化和有机金属中间体，但没有讨论轻质烯烃的工业生产或应用。因此，无法直接基于所提供的文本回答这个问题。

然而，我可以基于该领域的常识提供一些关于这个话题的一般信息：

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要基础原料，用于生产包括塑料、纤维和其他化学品在内的广泛产品。由于这些下游产品需求的增加，它们的生产和消费一直在稳步增长。

轻质烯烃的主要生产方法包括烃类的蒸汽裂解、重质油分的流化催化裂解，以及针对性技术如用于生产丙烯的丙烷脱氢。

烯烃生产中的主要热力学挑战与脱氢反应的吸热性质有关，这些反应在较高温度下变得更有利，但面临平衡限制。较长的烷烃链长通常允许更容易的脱氢。由于勒夏特列原理，压力通常对烯烃产率有负面影响。

优化反应器条件和开发更高效的催化剂以克服这些热力学限制仍然是改进烯烃生产过程的活跃研究领域。

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing light olefins like propylene and ethylene, their applications, market trends, or production methods. The document focuses primarily on CH bond activation on metal centers and oxide surfaces, as well as catalytic processes like alkane dehydrogenation and metathesis. It does not discuss the industrial applications or thermodynamic challenges of light olefin production.

To properly answer this question would require information about:
1. The uses of propylene and ethylene in the chemical industry
2. Current market trends for these olefins
3. Major production methods like steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation 
4. Thermodynamic considerations in olefin synthesis, including temperature and pressure effects
5. How alkane chain length impacts olefin production

This level of detail about light olefin production and markets is not present in the provided literature.
