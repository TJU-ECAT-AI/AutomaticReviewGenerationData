[1] "Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[4] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen"

[5] "The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."

[6] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[7] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

Light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. They are used to produce a wide range of products including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The demand for these building blocks has been steadily increasing in recent years, with growth observed in most major markets except for the Eurozone.

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. However, dehydrogenation of light paraffins is emerging as an important on-purpose production method.

The synthesis of light olefins through dehydrogenation faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures (550-750°C) and low partial pressures to achieve high conversions. The temperature and pressure requirements are dictated by Le Chatelier's principle.

The enthalpy required for dehydrogenation decreases as the alkane chain length increases. For example, the enthalpy of reaction at 298K is 137 kJ/mol for ethane, 124.3 kJ/mol for propane, and 117.6 kJ/mol for isobutane. This means that more energy is required to dehydrogenate lighter paraffins on a mass basis, adding to the challenges of producing lighter olefins like ethylene.

These thermodynamic constraints significantly influence the design and operation of industrial processes for light olefin production, necessitating careful control of reaction conditions to optimize yield and selectivity.

轻质烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，是化学工业中至关重要的原料。它们用于生产广泛的产品，包括聚合物、含氧化合物和化学中间体。近年来，这些基础原料的需求一直在稳步增长，除欧元区外，大多数主要市场都出现了增长。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品。然而，轻质烷烃的脱氢正成为一种重要的定向生产方法。

通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃面临着重大的热力学挑战。该反应是高度吸热的，并且受热力学限制，需要高温（550-750°C）和低分压才能达到高转化率。温度和压力要求是由勒夏特列原理决定的。

脱氢所需的焓随着烷烃链长的增加而减少。例如，在298K时，乙烷的反应焓为137 kJ/mol，丙烷为124.3 kJ/mol，异丁烷为117.6 kJ/mol。这意味着在质量基础上，脱氢较轻的烷烃需要更多的能量，这增加了生产较轻烯烃（如乙烯）的挑战。

这些热力学限制显著影响了轻质烯烃生产的工业过程设计和操作，需要仔细控制反应条件以优化产率和选择性。
