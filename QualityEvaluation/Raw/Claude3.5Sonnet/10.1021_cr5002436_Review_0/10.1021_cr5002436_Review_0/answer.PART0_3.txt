[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."

[2] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[3] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[4] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[5] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial to the chemical industry as feedstocks for producing a wide range of products, including polymers, oxygenates, and chemical intermediates. The demand for these olefins has been steadily increasing in recent years.

The main production methods for light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha and other oil byproducts. However, dehydrogenation of light paraffins is emerging as an important on-purpose production method.

The dehydrogenation reaction faces significant thermodynamic challenges. It is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures to achieve high conversions. The reaction becomes less endothermic for longer alkane chains, but more energy is needed to dehydrogenate lighter paraffins on a mass basis.

Temperature and pressure play crucial roles in the dehydrogenation process. Higher temperatures and lower pressures favor higher olefin yields. However, these conditions also promote unwanted side reactions, necessitating a careful balance in operating conditions.

The alkane chain length affects the dehydrogenation process, with longer chains requiring less energy for dehydrogenation. This impacts the energy requirements and process design for different feedstocks.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯对化学工业至关重要，是生产多种产品的原料，包括聚合物、含氧化合物和化学中间体。近年来，这些烯烃的需求一直在稳步增长。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是对石脑油和其他石油副产品进行蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）。然而，轻质烷烃的脱氢正成为一种重要的定向生产方法。

脱氢反应面临着重大的热力学挑战。它是高度吸热的，并受热力学限制，需要高温（550-750°C）和低压来实现高转化率。对于较长的烷烃链，反应的吸热性降低，但在质量基础上脱氢轻质烷烃需要更多的能量。

温度和压力在脱氢过程中起着关键作用。较高的温度和较低的压力有利于获得较高的烯烃产率。然而，这些条件也促进了不需要的副反应，因此需要在操作条件上仔细平衡。

烷烃链长度影响脱氢过程，较长的链需要较少的脱氢能量。这影响了不同原料的能量需求和工艺设计。
