[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[4] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

Light olefins, particularly propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry as essential building blocks. They are used as feedstocks for producing a wide range of chemicals, including polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene, oxygenates such as ethylene glycol and acetone, and important chemical intermediates like ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde.

The demand for light olefins has been steadily increasing in recent years, with most major markets experiencing positive growth in both demand and production. The exception to this trend is the Eurozone, which has been affected by recent economic downturns.

The primary production methods for light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. However, dehydrogenation of light paraffins is emerging as an alternative production method.

The synthesis of light olefins through dehydrogenation faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures (550-750°C) and low paraffin partial pressures to achieve high conversions. This is in line with Le Chatelier's principle.

The effect of alkane chain length on the dehydrogenation process is notable. As the chain length increases, the enthalpy required for dehydrogenation decreases. For instance, the enthalpy of reaction at 298 K is 137 kJ/mol for ethane, 124.3 kJ/mol for propane, and 117.6 kJ/mol for isobutane. However, this also means that dehydrogenating lighter paraffins requires more energy on a mass basis.

Pressure also plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. Lower pressures result in higher olefin yields at a given temperature, which is why some industrial processes operate at sub-atmospheric pressures to enhance conversion.

轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯和乙烯，作为重要的化学建筑块在化学工业中发挥着关键作用。它们被用作生产多种化学品的原料，包括聚乙烯和聚丙烯等聚合物，乙二醇和丙酮等含氧化合物，以及乙苯和丙醛等重要的化学中间体。

近年来，轻质烯烃的需求一直在稳步增长，大多数主要市场的需求和产量都呈现正增长。欧元区是个例外，受到近期经济衰退的影响。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是对石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品进行蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）。然而，轻质烷烃的脱氢正在成为一种替代生产方法。

通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃面临着重大的热力学挑战。这个反应是高度吸热的，并受到热力学限制，需要高温（550-750°C）和低烷烃分压才能达到高转化率。这符合勒夏特列原理。

烷烃链长对脱氢过程的影响很显著。随着链长的增加，脱氢所需的焓减少。例如，在298 K时，乙烷的反应焓为137 kJ/mol，丙烷为124.3 kJ/mol，异丁烷为117.6 kJ/mol。然而，这也意味着脱氢较轻的烷烃在质量基础上需要更多的能量。

压力在脱氢过程中也起着至关重要的作用。在给定温度下，较低的压力会导致更高的烯烃产率，这就是为什么一些工业过程在亚大气压下操作以提高转化率的原因。
