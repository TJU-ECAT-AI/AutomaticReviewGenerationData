[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."

[2] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[3] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[4] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[5] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[6] "Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis."

Light olefins, particularly propylene and ethylene, play a crucial role in the chemical industry as essential building blocks. They are used extensively in the production of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene, oxygenates such as ethylene glycol and acetone, and important chemical intermediates like ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde.

Market trends show a steady increase in demand for these light olefins, with positive growth in most major markets, except for the Eurozone due to recent economic challenges.

The primary production methods for light olefins are steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. Another method is the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, which is a one-step reaction converting paraffins into olefins and hydrogen.

However, the synthesis of light olefins through dehydrogenation faces significant thermodynamic challenges. The reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures (550-750°C) and low paraffin partial pressures to achieve high conversions. This makes the process energy-intensive and challenging to control.

The effect of alkane chain length on the dehydrogenation process is notable. As the chain length increases, the enthalpy required for dehydrogenation decreases. For example, the enthalpy of reaction at 298K is 137 kJ/mol for ethane, 124.3 kJ/mol for propane, and 117.6 kJ/mol for isobutane. However, this also means that dehydrogenating lighter paraffins requires more energy on a mass basis.

Pressure also plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process. Lower pressures result in higher olefin yields at a given temperature, as per Le Chatelier's principle. This relationship between temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length makes the optimization of light olefin production a complex challenge in industrial settings.

轻质烯烃，尤其是丙烯和乙烯，作为重要的化学构建块在化学工业中扮演着关键角色。它们广泛用于生产各种化学品，包括聚乙烯和聚丙烯等聚合物，乙二醇和丙酮等含氧化合物，以及乙苯和丙醛等重要的化学中间体。

市场趋势显示，这些轻质烯烃的需求持续增长，大多数主要市场都呈现正增长，但由于近期经济挑战，欧元区除外。

生产轻质烯烃的主要方法是对石脑油、轻柴油和其他石油副产品进行蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）。另一种方法是轻质烷烃的脱氢，这是一种将烷烃转化为烯烃和氢气的一步反应。

然而，通过脱氢合成轻质烯烃面临着重大的热力学挑战。这个反应在热力学上受限且高度吸热，需要高温（550-750°C）和低烷烃分压才能达到高转化率。这使得该过程能耗高，控制困难。

烷烃链长对脱氢过程的影响显著。随着链长增加，脱氢所需的焓减少。例如，在298K时，乙烷的反应焓为137 kJ/mol，丙烷为124.3 kJ/mol，异丁烷为117.6 kJ/mol。然而，这也意味着脱氢较轻的烷烃在质量基础上需要更多能量。

压力在脱氢过程中也起着关键作用。根据勒夏特列原理，在给定温度下，较低的压力会导致更高的烯烃产率。温度、压力和烷烃链长之间的这种关系使得在工业环境中优化轻质烯烃的生产成为一个复杂的挑战。
