[1] "UOP Honeywell will licence its propane dehydrogenation technology to Zhejiang Shaoxing Sanjin Petrochemical Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Fuling Holding Group, China. The new facility, which is slated to go online in 2013, will utilize UOPs Oleflex technology to manufacture 450,000 tonne/y of propylene."

[2] "The Oleflex process employs catalytic dehydrogenation for the conversion of propane to propylene. The process, in comparison with the alternative propane dehydrogenation process, offers lower manufacturing costs and the highest return on investment."

Light olefins like propylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. The literature mentions significant investments in propylene production, indicating its importance. Key production methods include propane dehydrogenation, as evidenced by the Oleflex and CATOFIN technologies mentioned. These processes face thermodynamic challenges related to the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation reactions.

The Oleflex process is noted for its lower manufacturing costs and high return on investment compared to alternative methods. Meanwhile, improvements in catalyst technology, such as Sd-Chemie's CATOFIN catalyst, have led to increased propylene selectivity and reduced energy consumption, addressing some of the thermodynamic challenges.

While the document doesn't provide specific details on temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects, it's implied that these factors are important considerations in the design and operation of propylene production facilities. The focus on catalyst improvements and process efficiencies suggests ongoing efforts to optimize these parameters for better yields and economics.

The market trend appears to be towards increased propylene production capacity, as evidenced by the new 450,000 tonne/year facility mentioned. This suggests growing demand for propylene in various applications, though the specific end-uses are not detailed in the given literature.

轻质烯烃如丙烯是化工行业的重要原料。文献中提到了对丙烯生产的大量投资，表明了它的重要性。主要的生产方法包括丙烷脱氢，这从提到的Oleflex和CATOFIN技术中可以看出。这些过程面临着与脱氢反应吸热性质相关的热力学挑战。

据称，与其他方法相比，Oleflex工艺具有较低的制造成本和较高的投资回报率。同时，催化剂技术的改进，如Sd-Chemie的CATOFIN催化剂，已经导致丙烯选择性的提高和能耗的减少，解决了一些热力学挑战。

虽然文档没有提供关于温度、压力或烷烃链长效应的具体细节，但暗示这些因素是丙烯生产设施设计和运营的重要考虑因素。对催化剂改进和工艺效率的关注表明，正在进行持续努力以优化这些参数，以获得更好的产量和经济效益。

市场趋势似乎朝着增加丙烯生产能力的方向发展，这从提到的新的45万吨/年设施可以看出。这表明丙烯在各种应用中的需求正在增长，尽管给定文献中没有详细说明具体的最终用途。
