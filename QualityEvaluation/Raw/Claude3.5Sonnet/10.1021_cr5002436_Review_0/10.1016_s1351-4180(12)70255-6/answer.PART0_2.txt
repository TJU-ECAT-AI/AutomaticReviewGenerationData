Light olefins like propylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. The literature highlights the importance of propylene production, indicating its significant market demand.

Key production methods for propylene include:

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH): Both the CATOFIN and Oleflex processes are mentioned as technologies for converting propane to propylene. These catalytic dehydrogenation processes are becoming increasingly important for on-purpose propylene production.

2. Catalytic technologies: The development of improved catalysts, such as Sd-Chemie's CATOFIN catalyst, aims to increase propylene selectivity and reduce energy consumption in the production process.

Thermodynamic challenges in olefin synthesis include:

1. Energy requirements: The literature mentions efforts to reduce energy consumption in propylene production, suggesting that the dehydrogenation reaction is energy-intensive.

2. Selectivity: Improving propylene selectivity is a key focus, indicating the challenge of achieving high yields of the desired product while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Process optimization: The emphasis on lower manufacturing costs and higher return on investment suggests ongoing efforts to optimize process conditions, likely including temperature and pressure parameters.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the effects of temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length, the focus on catalyst and process improvements implies that these factors play crucial roles in overcoming thermodynamic limitations in olefin production.

The market trends indicate a growing demand for propylene, as evidenced by the construction of new production facilities and the licensing of technologies to increase production capacity.
