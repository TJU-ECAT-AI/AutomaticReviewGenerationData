[1] "UOP Honeywell will licence its propane dehydrogenation technology to Zhejiang Shaoxing Sanjin Petrochemical Co, a wholly owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Fuling Holding Group, China. The new facility, which is slated to go online in 2013, will utilize UOPs Oleflex technology to manufacture 450,000 tonne/y of propylene."

[2] "The Oleflex process employs catalytic dehydrogenation for the conversion of propane to propylene. The process, in comparison with the alternative propane dehydrogenation process, offers lower manufacturing costs and the highest return on investment."

[3] "Sd-Chemie AG, a Clariant Group company, has announced that its breakthrough in CATOFIN propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyst has been successful in delivering a significant increase in propylene selectivity, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption."

Light olefins like propylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry. The literature mentions propylene production, indicating its importance. Key production methods include propane dehydrogenation, as evidenced by the Oleflex and CATOFIN technologies mentioned. These processes face thermodynamic challenges related to temperature and pressure, as implied by the emphasis on energy consumption and efficiency improvements in catalyst technology.

The market trend shows increasing demand for propylene, as demonstrated by the new 450,000 tonne/year facility being built in China. Production methods are focusing on improved efficiency and lower costs, as seen in the development of better catalysts and processes that offer "lower manufacturing costs and the highest return on investment."

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss ethylene or the effects of alkane chain length, it's clear that the industry is working to overcome thermodynamic challenges in olefin production through improved catalysts and process technologies. The focus on reducing energy consumption in these processes highlights the importance of managing temperature and pressure in light olefin synthesis.
