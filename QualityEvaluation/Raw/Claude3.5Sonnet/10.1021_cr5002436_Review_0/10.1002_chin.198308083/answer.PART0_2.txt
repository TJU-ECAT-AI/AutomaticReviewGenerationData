Unfortunately, this literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about light olefins, their applications, production methods, or thermodynamic challenges. The abstract appears to be about isomerization and hydrogenolysis of C6 alkanes on platinum catalysts, which is unrelated to the topic of the question. There is insufficient information provided to address the specific points asked about propylene, ethylene, their industrial uses, or synthesis challenges.

很遗憾,这篇文献中没有任何与回答轻质烯烃、它们的应用、生产方法或热力学挑战相关的信息。文摘似乎是关于C6烷烃在铂催化剂上的异构化和氢解,这与问题中的主题无关。提供的信息不足以解答有关丙烯、乙烯、它们的工业用途或合成挑战等具体问题。
