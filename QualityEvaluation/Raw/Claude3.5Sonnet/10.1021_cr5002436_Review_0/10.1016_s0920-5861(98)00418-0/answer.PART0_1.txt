The literature provides limited information on light olefins in general, focusing primarily on propylene and its ammoxidation to acrylonitrile. Propylene contributes significantly to the chemical industry through its conversion to acrylonitrile, which is a versatile petrochemical intermediate. Acrylonitrile is extensively used in producing acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products. The global production of acrylonitrile exceeds 10 billion pounds annually.

The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is described as the foremost commercial ammoxidation process, indicating its importance in the industry. However, the document does not provide specific information on other light olefins like ethylene, their production methods, or thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis. There is also no mention of temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects on olefin production.

该文献对轻质烯烃的整体信息有限，主要集中在丙烯及其氨氧化制备丙烯腈上。丙烯通过转化为丙烯腈对化学工业做出了重大贡献，丙烯腈是一种用途广泛的石油化工中间体。丙烯腈广泛用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品。全球丙烯腈的年产量超过100亿磅。

丙烯氨氧化制备丙烯腈被描述为最重要的商业氨氧化工艺，显示了其在行业中的重要性。然而，该文档没有提供其他轻质烯烃（如乙烯）的具体信息，也没有提及它们的生产方法或与合成相关的热力学挑战。文中也没有提到温度、压力或烷烃链长对烯烃生产的影响。
