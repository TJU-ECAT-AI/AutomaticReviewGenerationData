The literature provides limited information specifically about light olefins like propylene and ethylene, but does offer some insights on propylene:

Light olefins, particularly propylene, play a significant role in the chemical industry. Propylene is used in the production of acrylonitrile through ammoxidation, which is a major commercial process. Acrylonitrile, derived from propylene, is a versatile petrochemical intermediate used extensively in producing acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers and specialty products. Over 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile are produced worldwide annually, indicating the large scale of propylene's application in this process.

The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is described as a catalytic process using air (oxygen) and ammonia. The reaction equation is provided, showing the conversion of propylene to acrylonitrile. However, the literature does not provide detailed information on production methods for light olefins themselves or discuss thermodynamic challenges related to their synthesis.

The document does not provide information on market trends for light olefins, nor does it discuss temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects on their production. It also lacks information on ethylene applications or production methods for light olefins in general.

该文献对轻质烯烃（如丙烯和乙烯）的信息有限，但确实提供了一些关于丙烯的见解：

轻质烯烃，特别是丙烯，在化学工业中发挥着重要作用。丙烯主要用于通过氨氧化生产丙烯腈，这是一个主要的商业过程。由丙烯衍生的丙烯腈是一种多用途的石油化工中间体，广泛用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品。全球每年生产超过100亿磅的丙烯腈，表明丙烯在这一过程中的应用规模巨大。

丙烯氨氧化制丙烯腈被描述为一个使用空气（氧气）和氨的催化过程。文献提供了反应方程式，显示了丙烯转化为丙烯腈的过程。然而，文献并未提供关于轻质烯烃本身生产方法的详细信息，也没有讨论与其合成相关的热力学挑战。

文档没有提供轻质烯烃市场趋势的信息，也没有讨论温度、压力或烷烃链长对其生产的影响。它还缺乏关于乙烯应用或轻质烯烃一般生产方法的信息。
