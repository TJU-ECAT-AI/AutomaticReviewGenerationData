The literature does not provide comprehensive information about light olefins in general or their production methods and thermodynamic challenges. However, it does discuss propylene specifically in the context of ammoxidation to produce acrylonitrile.

Propylene contributes significantly to the chemical industry through its use in ammoxidation to produce acrylonitrile. This process accounts for a large portion of catalytic processes worldwide, with global acrylonitrile production exceeding 10 billion pounds annually. Acrylonitrile is a versatile petrochemical intermediate used extensively in producing acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products.

The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is described as the most commercially important ammoxidation process. The reaction involves propylene, ammonia, and oxygen (from air) reacting over a catalyst to form acrylonitrile and water.

The document does not provide information on ethylene, other production methods for light olefins, or thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects in their synthesis.

这篇文献没有提供关于轻质烯烃整体或其生产方法和热力学挑战的全面信息。然而，它确实在氨氧化生产丙烯腈的背景下具体讨论了丙烯。

丙烯通过氨氧化生产丙烯腈对化学工业做出了重大贡献。这一过程占全球催化过程的很大一部分，全球丙烯腈年产量超过100亿磅。丙烯腈是一种用途广泛的石油化工中间体，广泛用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品。

丙烯氨氧化生产丙烯腈被描述为商业上最重要的氨氧化过程。该反应涉及丙烯、氨和氧气（来自空气）在催化剂上反应形成丙烯腈和水。

该文档没有提供关于乙烯、轻质烯烃的其他生产方法，或与其合成相关的温度、压力或烷烃链长效应的热力学挑战的信息。
