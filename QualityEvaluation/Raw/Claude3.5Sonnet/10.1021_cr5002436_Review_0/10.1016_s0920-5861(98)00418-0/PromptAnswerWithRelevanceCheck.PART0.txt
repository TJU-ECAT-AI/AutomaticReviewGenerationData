The literature does not provide comprehensive information about light olefins in general or their production methods and thermodynamic challenges. However, it does discuss propylene specifically in the context of ammoxidation to produce acrylonitrile.

Propylene contributes significantly to the chemical industry through its use in ammoxidation to produce acrylonitrile. This process accounts for a large portion of catalytic processes worldwide, with global acrylonitrile production exceeding 10 billion pounds annually. Acrylonitrile is a versatile petrochemical intermediate used extensively in producing acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products.

The ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile is described as the most commercially important ammoxidation process. The reaction involves propylene, ammonia, and oxygen (from air) reacting over a catalyst to form acrylonitrile and water.

The document does not provide information on ethylene, other production methods for light olefins, or thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, or alkane chain length effects in their synthesis.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contributions, production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. However, it does offer some insights into propylene's importance in the chemical industry.

Propylene is a significant light olefin used in the production of acrylonitrile through ammoxidation. This process is of considerable commercial importance, with acrylonitrile being a versatile petrochemical intermediate used in producing acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products. The global production of acrylonitrile exceeds 10 billion pounds annually.

More broadly, selective catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation processes of hydrocarbons, which include reactions involving light olefins like propylene, account for approximately 25% of the value produced by all catalytic processes worldwide. This underscores the significant economic contribution of light olefins to the chemical industry.
