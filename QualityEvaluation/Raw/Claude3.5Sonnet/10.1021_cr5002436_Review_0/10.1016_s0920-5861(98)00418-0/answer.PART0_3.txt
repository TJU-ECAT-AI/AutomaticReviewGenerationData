The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does offer some insights into propylene's importance:

Propylene is a key feedstock for producing acrylonitrile through ammoxidation. This process is of major commercial significance, with over 10 billion pounds of acrylonitrile produced worldwide annually. Acrylonitrile is described as a versatile petrochemical intermediate used extensively to make acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers and specialty products.

More broadly, selective oxidation and ammoxidation processes of hydrocarbons (which would include propylene) account for about 25% of the value produced by all catalytic processes globally. This indicates the substantial economic importance of light olefins like propylene in the chemical industry.

The document does not provide information on production methods, thermodynamic challenges, or effects of temperature, pressure and alkane chain length for light olefin synthesis. It also lacks details on ethylene applications or market trends.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于丙烯和乙烯等轻质烯烃的问题。但是,它确实提供了一些关于丙烯重要性的见解:

丙烯是通过氨氧化法生产丙烯腈的关键原料。这个过程具有重要的商业意义,全球每年生产超过100亿磅丙烯腈。丙烯腈被描述为一种用途广泛的石化中间体,广泛用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品。

从更广泛的角度来看,烃类(包括丙烯)的选择性氧化和氨氧化过程约占全球所有催化过程产生价值的25%。这表明了丙烯等轻质烯烃在化工行业的巨大经济重要性。

该文件没有提供关于轻质烯烃合成的生产方法、热力学挑战,或温度、压力和烷烃链长效应的信息。它也缺乏有关乙烯应用或市场趋势的详细信息。
