The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about light olefins' contributions, production methods, and thermodynamic challenges. However, it does offer some insights into propylene's importance in the chemical industry.

Propylene is a significant light olefin used in the production of acrylonitrile through ammoxidation. This process is of considerable commercial importance, with acrylonitrile being a versatile petrochemical intermediate used in producing acrylic fibers, resins, rubbers, and specialty products. The global production of acrylonitrile exceeds 10 billion pounds annually.

More broadly, selective catalytic oxidation and ammoxidation processes of hydrocarbons, which include reactions involving light olefins like propylene, account for approximately 25% of the value produced by all catalytic processes worldwide. This underscores the significant economic contribution of light olefins to the chemical industry.

The document does not provide information on ethylene, other production methods, market trends, or thermodynamic challenges related to temperature, pressure, and alkane chain length effects in olefin synthesis.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于轻烯烃贡献、生产方法和热力学挑战的问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于丙烯在化学工业中重要性的见解。

丙烯是一种重要的轻烯烃，用于通过氨氧化生产丙烯腈。这个过程具有相当大的商业重要性，丙烯腈是一种多用途的石化中间体，用于生产丙烯酸纤维、树脂、橡胶和特种产品。全球丙烯腈的年产量超过100亿磅。

更广泛地说，包括涉及丙烯等轻烯烃在内的碳氢化合物的选择性催化氧化和氨氧化过程，约占全球所有催化过程产生价值的25%。这凸显了轻烯烃对化学工业的重大经济贡献。

该文档没有提供关于乙烯、其他生产方法、市场趋势或与烯烃合成中温度、压力和烷烃链长效应相关的热力学挑战的信息。
