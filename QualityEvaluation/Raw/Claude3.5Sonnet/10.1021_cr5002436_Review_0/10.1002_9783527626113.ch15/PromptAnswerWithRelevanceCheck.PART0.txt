[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[3] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3–0.5 atm and 823–923 K"

The literature does not directly address the applications and market trends of light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does provide some relevant information about their production:

Light olefins like propene (propylene) are produced via dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane. This process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited at lower temperatures, requiring temperatures above 1000 K for favorable equilibrium.

Chromia catalysts have been used commercially for over 60 years to produce light olefins. During WWII, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to butenes for aviation fuel production.

A key innovation was using sub-atmospheric pressure, which allowed higher per-pass conversion. Current commercial reactors typically operate at 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K.

The literature does not provide information on specific applications or market trends for light olefins beyond aviation fuel. It focuses mainly on the production process and its challenges, particularly the high temperatures and low pressures required due to thermodynamic limitations.

该文献没有直接提及轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯的应用和市场趋势。但是,它确实提供了一些关于它们生产的相关信息:

轻质烯烃如丙烯是通过轻质烷烃(如丙烷)的脱氢反应生产的。这个过程是高度吸热的,在较低温度下受到平衡限制,需要1000 K以上的温度才能达到有利的平衡。

铬基催化剂已经在商业上使用了60多年来生产轻质烯烃。在第二次世界大战期间,铬/氧化铝催化剂被用来使丁烷脱氢生成丁烯,用于生产高辛烷值航空燃料。

一个关键的创新是使用低于大气压的压力,这允许更高的单程转化率。目前的商业反应器通常在0.3-0.5气压和823-923 K下运行。

除了航空燃料外,该文献没有提供轻质烯烃的具体应用或市场趋势信息。它主要关注生产过程及其挑战,特别是由于热力学限制而需要的高温和低压条件。

The literature does not directly address the applications and market trends of light olefins. However, it does provide some insights into the production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis:

1. Light alkane dehydrogenation, which produces olefins like propylene, is highly endothermic. For example, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene requires 110 kJ/mol of energy input.

2. The reaction is equilibrium-limited at temperatures below 1000 K, necessitating high operating temperatures.

3. Commercial reactors typically operate at temperatures between 823-923 K (550-650°C) and low pressures of 0.3-0.5 atm to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

4. As the chain length increases, slightly higher temperatures are required. For example, isobutane dehydrogenation is typically carried out at 923 K (650°C).

5. The endothermic nature of the reaction causes temperature gradients in the reactor, with the inlet being hotter than the outlet. This requires careful heat management in industrial processes.

These factors highlight the significant thermodynamic challenges in olefin production via alkane dehydrogenation, necessitating high temperatures, low pressures, and sophisticated reactor designs to achieve viable yields.

文献并未直接讨论轻烯烃的应用和市场趋势。但是，它确实提供了一些关于其合成方法和热力学挑战的见解：

1. 轻烷烃脱氢生产烯烃（如丙烯）是一个高度吸热的过程。例如，丙烷脱氢生成丙烯需要110 kJ/mol的能量输入。

2. 在1000 K以下的温度下，反应受到平衡限制，因此需要高操作温度。

3. 商业反应器通常在823-923 K（550-650°C）的温度和0.3-0.5 atm的低压下运行，以克服热力学限制。

4. 随着碳链长度的增加，需要略高的温度。例如，异丁烷脱氢通常在923 K（650°C）下进行。

5. 反应的吸热性质导致反应器内存在温度梯度，入口温度高于出口温度。这要求在工业过程中进行仔细的热量管理。

这些因素突显了通过烷烃脱氢生产烯烃的显著热力学挑战，需要高温、低压和复杂的反应器设计来实现可行的产率。

The literature does not directly address the applications and market trends of light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does provide some insights into their production methods and thermodynamic challenges:

Light alkane dehydrogenation has been used to produce olefins since the 1930s. The process is highly endothermic, requiring significant energy input. For example, propane dehydrogenation to propene has an enthalpy change of +110 kJ/mol at 298 K.

The reaction is equilibrium-limited at temperatures below 1000 K, necessitating high operating temperatures. Commercial processes typically operate at 823-923 K.

Pressure also plays a key role. Lower pressures (0.3-0.5 atm) are used to achieve higher per-pass conversion, contrary to most industrial processes that use high pressure.

The literature mentions butane and isobutane dehydrogenation, suggesting that longer chain alkanes can also be used as feedstocks to produce corresponding olefins.

During World War II, butane dehydrogenation was used to produce butenes, which were further processed into high-octane aviation fuel, highlighting an early application of this technology.

While the document does not discuss current applications or market trends for light olefins, it demonstrates that their production via alkane dehydrogenation has been an important industrial process for nearly a century.

虽然文献没有直接讨论轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯的应用和市场趋势，但它确实提供了一些关于它们的生产方法和热力学挑战的见解：

轻质烷烃脱氢自20世纪30年代以来一直用于生产烯烃。这个过程是高度吸热的，需要大量的能量输入。例如，丙烷脱氢生成丙烯在298 K时的焓变为+110 kJ/mol。

在1000 K以下的温度下，反应受到平衡限制，因此需要高操作温度。商业工艺通常在823-923 K下运行。

压力也起着关键作用。与大多数使用高压的工业过程不同，这里使用较低的压力（0.3-0.5 atm）以实现更高的单程转化率。

文献提到了丁烷和异丁烷的脱氢，表明更长链的烷烃也可以用作原料来生产相应的烯烃。

在第二次世界大战期间，丁烷脱氢被用来生产丁烯，这些丁烯进一步被加工成高辛烷值航空燃料，突显了这项技术的早期应用。

虽然文档没有讨论轻质烯烃的当前应用或市场趋势，但它表明通过烷烃脱氢生产轻质烯烃近一个世纪以来一直是一个重要的工业过程。

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, used to produce a wide range of polymers, plastics, and other chemical products. Their production is economically significant and demand has been growing steadily.

The main production method for light olefins discussed in this text is catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This process faces significant thermodynamic challenges:

1. It is highly endothermic, requiring substantial energy input. For example, propane dehydrogenation to propene has a ΔH298o of +110 kJ mol−1.

2. It is equilibrium-limited at lower temperatures, necessitating high reaction temperatures (typically 823-923 K) to achieve reasonable conversions.

3. Low pressures (0.3-0.5 atm) are used to shift the equilibrium towards products.

The challenges increase with shorter alkane chain length, as implied by the use of higher temperatures for propane dehydrogenation compared to butane.

These thermodynamic constraints necessitate careful reactor and process design to achieve economically viable olefin production. Despite these challenges, dehydrogenation processes have been commercially important for decades, highlighting the value of light olefins in the chemical industry.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料,用于生产多种聚合物、塑料和其他化学产品。它们的生产具有重要的经济意义,需求一直稳步增长。

本文讨论的轻质烯烃主要生产方法是轻质烷烃的催化脱氢。这一过程面临着重大的热力学挑战:

1. 它是高度吸热的,需要大量能量输入。例如,丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的ΔH298o为+110 kJ mol−1。

2. 在较低温度下受平衡限制,需要高反应温度(通常为823-923 K)才能达到合理的转化率。

3. 使用低压(0.3-0.5 atm)来将平衡向产物方向移动。

随着烷烃链长的缩短,这些挑战会增加,这从丙烷脱氢比丁烷使用更高温度可以看出。

这些热力学限制需要仔细的反应器和工艺设计,以实现经济可行的烯烃生产。尽管存在这些挑战,脱氢工艺几十年来一直具有商业重要性,凸显了轻质烯烃在化工行业的价值。

Light olefins like propene (propylene) are produced via dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane. This process has been known since the 1930s and uses chromia catalysts. 

The dehydrogenation reaction is highly endothermic, requiring significant energy input. For propane to propene, the enthalpy change is +110 kJ/mol at 298 K. The reaction is also equilibrium-limited at temperatures below 1000 K.

To overcome these thermodynamic challenges, commercial reactors typically operate at high temperatures (823-923 K) and low pressures (0.3-0.5 atm). The low pressure helps shift the equilibrium toward products.

Historically, butane dehydrogenation was used to produce butenes for high-octane aviation fuel during World War II. This suggests light olefins have important applications as chemical intermediates and fuel components.

The text does not provide information on current market trends or the full range of applications for light olefins. More context would be needed to fully address that aspect of the question.

脱氢反应是高度吸热的,需要大量的能量输入。对于丙烷到丙烯,在298 K下焓变为+110 kJ/mol。该反应在1000 K以下的温度也受到平衡限制。
