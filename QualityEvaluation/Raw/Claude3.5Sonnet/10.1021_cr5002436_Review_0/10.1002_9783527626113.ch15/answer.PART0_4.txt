[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3−0.5 atm and 823−923 K"

The literature does not directly address the applications and market trends of light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does provide some relevant information about their production:

Light olefins like propene (propylene) are produced via dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane. This process has been known since the 1930s and uses chromia catalysts. 

The dehydrogenation reaction is highly endothermic, requiring significant energy input. For propane to propene, the enthalpy change is +110 kJ/mol at 298 K. The reaction is also equilibrium-limited at temperatures below 1000 K.

To overcome these thermodynamic challenges, commercial reactors typically operate at high temperatures (823-923 K) and low pressures (0.3-0.5 atm). The low pressure helps shift the equilibrium toward products.

Historically, butane dehydrogenation was used to produce butenes for high-octane aviation fuel during World War II. This suggests light olefins have important applications as chemical intermediates and fuel components.

The text does not provide information on current market trends or the full range of applications for light olefins. More context would be needed to fully address that aspect of the question.

文献没有直接讨论轻烯烃如丙烯和乙烯的应用和市场趋势。但是,它确实提供了一些关于它们生产的相关信息:

轻烯烃如丙烯是通过轻烷烃(如丙烷)的脱氢反应生产的。这个过程自20世纪30年代就已知,并使用铬催化剂。

脱氢反应是高度吸热的,需要大量的能量输入。对于丙烷到丙烯,在298 K下焓变为+110 kJ/mol。该反应在1000 K以下的温度也受到平衡限制。

为了克服这些热力学挑战,商业反应器通常在高温(823-923 K)和低压(0.3-0.5 atm)下运行。低压有助于将平衡向产物方向移动。

从历史上看,第二次世界大战期间曾使用丁烷脱氢生产丁烯,用于高辛烷值航空燃料。这表明轻烯烃作为化学中间体和燃料组分有重要的应用。

文本没有提供关于轻烯烃当前市场趋势或全面应用范围的信息。需要更多的背景来全面回答这个问题的这一方面。
