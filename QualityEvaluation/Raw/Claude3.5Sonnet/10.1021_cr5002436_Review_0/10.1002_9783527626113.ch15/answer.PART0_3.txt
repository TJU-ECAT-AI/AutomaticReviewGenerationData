[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298o = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[3] "Operation is generally at 823–873 K and ~0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm."

Light olefins like propylene and ethylene are crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, used to produce a wide range of polymers, plastics, and other chemical products. Their production is economically significant and demand has been growing steadily.

The main production method for light olefins discussed in this text is catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. This process faces significant thermodynamic challenges:

1. It is highly endothermic, requiring substantial energy input. For example, propane dehydrogenation to propene has a ΔH298o of +110 kJ mol−1.

2. It is equilibrium-limited at lower temperatures, necessitating high reaction temperatures (typically 823-923 K) to achieve reasonable conversions.

3. Low pressures (0.3-0.5 atm) are used to shift the equilibrium towards products.

The challenges increase with shorter alkane chain length, as implied by the use of higher temperatures for propane dehydrogenation compared to butane.

These thermodynamic constraints necessitate careful reactor and process design to achieve economically viable olefin production. Despite these challenges, dehydrogenation processes have been commercially important for decades, highlighting the value of light olefins in the chemical industry.

轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯是化工行业的重要原料,用于生产多种聚合物、塑料和其他化学产品。它们的生产具有重要的经济意义,需求一直稳步增长。

本文讨论的轻质烯烃主要生产方法是轻质烷烃的催化脱氢。这一过程面临着重大的热力学挑战:

1. 它是高度吸热的,需要大量能量输入。例如,丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的ΔH298o为+110 kJ mol−1。

2. 在较低温度下受平衡限制,需要高反应温度(通常为823-923 K)才能达到合理的转化率。

3. 使用低压(0.3-0.5 atm)来将平衡向产物方向移动。

随着烷烃链长的缩短,这些挑战会增加,这从丙烷脱氢比丁烷使用更高温度可以看出。

这些热力学限制需要仔细的反应器和工艺设计,以实现经济可行的烯烃生产。尽管存在这些挑战,脱氢工艺几十年来一直具有商业重要性,凸显了轻质烯烃在化工行业的价值。
