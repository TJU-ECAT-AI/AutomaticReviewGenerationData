[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Operation is generally at 823−873 K and ~0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm."

The literature does not directly address the applications and market trends of light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does provide some insights into their production methods and thermodynamic challenges:

Light alkane dehydrogenation has been used to produce olefins since the 1930s. The process is highly endothermic, requiring significant energy input. For example, propane dehydrogenation to propene has an enthalpy change of +110 kJ/mol at 298 K.

The reaction is equilibrium-limited at temperatures below 1000 K, necessitating high operating temperatures. Commercial processes typically operate at 823-923 K.

Pressure also plays a key role. Lower pressures (0.3-0.5 atm) are used to achieve higher per-pass conversion, contrary to most industrial processes that use high pressure.

The literature mentions butane and isobutane dehydrogenation, suggesting that longer chain alkanes can also be used as feedstocks to produce corresponding olefins.

During World War II, butane dehydrogenation was used to produce butenes, which were further processed into high-octane aviation fuel, highlighting an early application of this technology.

While the document does not discuss current applications or market trends for light olefins, it demonstrates that their production via alkane dehydrogenation has been an important industrial process for nearly a century.

虽然文献没有直接讨论轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯的应用和市场趋势，但它确实提供了一些关于它们的生产方法和热力学挑战的见解：

轻质烷烃脱氢自20世纪30年代以来一直用于生产烯烃。这个过程是高度吸热的，需要大量的能量输入。例如，丙烷脱氢生成丙烯在298 K时的焓变为+110 kJ/mol。

在1000 K以下的温度下，反应受到平衡限制，因此需要高操作温度。商业工艺通常在823-923 K下运行。

压力也起着关键作用。与大多数使用高压的工业过程不同，这里使用较低的压力（0.3-0.5 atm）以实现更高的单程转化率。

文献提到了丁烷和异丁烷的脱氢，表明更长链的烷烃也可以用作原料来生产相应的烯烃。

在第二次世界大战期间，丁烷脱氢被用来生产丁烯，这些丁烯进一步被加工成高辛烷值航空燃料，突显了这项技术的早期应用。

虽然文档没有讨论轻质烯烃的当前应用或市场趋势，但它表明通过烷烃脱氢生产轻质烯烃近一个世纪以来一直是一个重要的工业过程。
