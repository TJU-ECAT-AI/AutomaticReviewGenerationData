[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[3] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3–0.5 atm and 823–923 K"

The literature does not directly address the applications and market trends of light olefins like propylene and ethylene. However, it does provide some relevant information about their production:

Light olefins like propene (propylene) are produced via dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane. This process is highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited at lower temperatures, requiring temperatures above 1000 K for favorable equilibrium.

Chromia catalysts have been used commercially for over 60 years to produce light olefins. During WWII, chromia/alumina catalysts were used to dehydrogenate butane to butenes for aviation fuel production.

A key innovation was using sub-atmospheric pressure, which allowed higher per-pass conversion. Current commercial reactors typically operate at 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K.

The literature does not provide information on specific applications or market trends for light olefins beyond aviation fuel. It focuses mainly on the production process and its challenges, particularly the high temperatures and low pressures required due to thermodynamic limitations.

该文献没有直接提及轻质烯烃如丙烯和乙烯的应用和市场趋势。但是,它确实提供了一些关于它们生产的相关信息:

轻质烯烃如丙烯是通过轻质烷烃(如丙烷)的脱氢反应生产的。这个过程是高度吸热的,在较低温度下受到平衡限制,需要1000 K以上的温度才能达到有利的平衡。

铬基催化剂已经在商业上使用了60多年来生产轻质烯烃。在第二次世界大战期间,铬/氧化铝催化剂被用来使丁烷脱氢生成丁烯,用于生产高辛烷值航空燃料。

一个关键的创新是使用低于大气压的压力,这允许更高的单程转化率。目前的商业反应器通常在0.3-0.5气压和823-923 K下运行。

除了航空燃料外,该文献没有提供轻质烯烃的具体应用或市场趋势信息。它主要关注生产过程及其挑战,特别是由于热力学限制而需要的高温和低压条件。
