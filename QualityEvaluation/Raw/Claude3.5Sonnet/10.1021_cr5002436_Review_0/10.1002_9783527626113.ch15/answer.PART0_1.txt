[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes is highly endothermic (for example, propane to propene, C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298° = +110 kJ mol−1) and is equilibrium limited at temperatures below 1000 K."

[2] "Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3–0.5 atm and 823–923 K"

[3] "The classic process, the regenerating (heating) gas is fed in the same direction as the process gas, which leads initially to a higher temperature at the feed than the exit. With time on stream, a temperature front will move through the bed as the front of the bed is cooled by the endothermic reaction."

[4] "Operation is generally at 823–873 K and ~0.3 atm. CATOFIN is also used commercially for isobutane to isobutene. The reaction conditions are usually 923 K and 0.5 atm."

The literature does not directly address the applications and market trends of light olefins. However, it does provide some insights into the production methods and thermodynamic challenges associated with their synthesis:

1. Light alkane dehydrogenation, which produces olefins like propylene, is highly endothermic. For example, the dehydrogenation of propane to propene requires 110 kJ/mol of energy input.

2. The reaction is equilibrium-limited at temperatures below 1000 K, necessitating high operating temperatures.

3. Commercial reactors typically operate at temperatures between 823-923 K (550-650°C) and low pressures of 0.3-0.5 atm to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

4. As the chain length increases, slightly higher temperatures are required. For example, isobutane dehydrogenation is typically carried out at 923 K (650°C).

5. The endothermic nature of the reaction causes temperature gradients in the reactor, with the inlet being hotter than the outlet. This requires careful heat management in industrial processes.

These factors highlight the significant thermodynamic challenges in olefin production via alkane dehydrogenation, necessitating high temperatures, low pressures, and sophisticated reactor designs to achieve viable yields.

文献并未直接讨论轻烯烃的应用和市场趋势。但是，它确实提供了一些关于其合成方法和热力学挑战的见解：

1. 轻烷烃脱氢生产烯烃（如丙烯）是一个高度吸热的过程。例如，丙烷脱氢生成丙烯需要110 kJ/mol的能量输入。

2. 在1000 K以下的温度下，反应受到平衡限制，因此需要高操作温度。

3. 商业反应器通常在823-923 K（550-650°C）的温度和0.3-0.5 atm的低压下运行，以克服热力学限制。

4. 随着碳链长度的增加，需要略高的温度。例如，异丁烷脱氢通常在923 K（650°C）下进行。

5. 反应的吸热性质导致反应器内存在温度梯度，入口温度高于出口温度。这要求在工业过程中进行仔细的热量管理。

这些因素突显了通过烷烃脱氢生产烯烃的显著热力学挑战，需要高温、低压和复杂的反应器设计来实现可行的产率。
