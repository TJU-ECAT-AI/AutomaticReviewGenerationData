[1] "Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."

[2] "First principles studies have indicated the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface."

[3] "The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be well tuned by varying the size, composition and atomic ordering. Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts."

[4] "Coreshell NPs are in the frontier of advanced materials chemistry among the various bimetallic NPs and are of great importance and interest owing to their physical and chemical properties that are strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface, and also quite different from those of monometallic counterparts and alloys."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities than their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals.

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering. This allows for precise control over their catalytic performance.

3. Electronic structure modification: The synergistic effect on heterometallic nanocatalysts is closely related to surface electronic states, which are significantly altered by changes in geometric parameters, local strain, and effective atomic coordination numbers at the surface.

4. Distinct binding properties: Alloy materials possess unique binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts, potentially leading to enhanced catalytic performance.

5. Core-shell structures: Core-shell NPs represent a frontier in advanced materials chemistry, with physical and chemical properties strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface. These properties differ significantly from both monometallic and alloy counterparts.

By offering these unique characteristics, bimetallic catalysts help bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and practically relevant supported catalysts. They provide a means to study and optimize catalytic performance under conditions more closely resembling industrial applications while still maintaining the ability to control and understand fundamental properties at the nanoscale.

双金属催化剂自商业化引入以来在多相催化领域取得了显著的发展。它们独特的电子和化学性质有助于在模型表面和工业相关负载催化剂之间架起"材料鸿沟"和"压力鸿沟"，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 协同效应：具有合金和核壳结构的双金属纳米粒子由于两种金属之间的协同作用，表现出比单金属纳米粒子更高的催化活性。

2. 可调性能：合金纳米粒子的化学和物理性质可以通过调整其尺寸、组成和原子排列来精细调控。这使得可以精确控制其催化性能。

3. 电子结构修饰：异金属纳米催化剂的协同效应与表面电子态密切相关，而表面电子态又受到几何参数、局部应变和表面有效原子配位数变化的显著影响。

4. 独特的结合性质：与单金属催化剂相比，合金材料具有独特的与反应物的结合性质，可能导致催化性能的提高。

5. 核壳结构：核壳纳米粒子代表了先进材料化学的前沿，其物理和化学性质强烈依赖于核、壳和界面的结构。这些性质与单金属和合金纳米粒子都有显著不同。

通过提供这些独特的特性，双金属催化剂有助于弥合理想化模型表面和实际相关负载催化剂之间的差距。它们提供了一种在更接近工业应用条件下研究和优化催化性能的方法，同时仍然保持在纳米尺度上控制和理解基本性质的能力。
