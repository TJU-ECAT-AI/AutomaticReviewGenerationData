[1] "Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."

[2] "The properties of the catalyst surfaces are closely correlated with the catalytic activities, the precise modification of the catalyst surface by introducing another component or changing the morphology could facilitate the controlled tuning of the catalytic properties."

[3] "First principles studies have indicated the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals.

2. Precise surface modification: The introduction of a second metal component or changes in morphology allows for controlled tuning of catalytic properties through precise modification of the catalyst surface.

3. Altered electronic states: The synergistic effect in heterometallic nanocatalysts is largely influenced by surface electronic states, which are significantly modified by changes in geometric parameters such as local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.

4. Bridging the gaps: These unique properties of bimetallic catalysts help bridge the "materials gap" by providing more complex and realistic surface structures compared to simple model surfaces. They also address the "pressure gap" by offering enhanced stability and activity under industrially relevant conditions.

5. Fundamental research and practical applications: The ability to precisely control the composition, structure, and electronic properties of bimetallic catalysts allows researchers to systematically study structure-activity relationships. This fundamental understanding can then be applied to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for practical industrial applications.

双金属催化剂自商业引入以来在多相催化领域取得了显著的发展。它们独特的电子和化学性质有助于在模型表面和工业相关的负载型催化剂之间架起"材料差距"和"压力差距"的桥梁，具体表现在以下几个方面：

1. 协同效应：具有合金和核壳结构的双金属纳米粒子(NPs)由于两种金属之间的协同效应，表现出比单金属更高的催化活性。

2. 精确表面修饰：引入第二种金属组分或改变形貌可以通过精确修饰催化剂表面来控制调节催化性能。

3. 改变电子态：异金属纳米催化剂的协同效应很大程度上受表面电子态的影响，而表面电子态又显著地受到几何参数变化的影响，如局部应变和表面有效原子配位数。

4. 弥合差距：双金属催化剂的这些独特性质有助于弥合"材料差距"，因为它们提供了比简单模型表面更复杂和更真实的表面结构。它们还解决了"压力差距"问题，因为在工业相关条件下具有增强的稳定性和活性。

5. 基础研究和实际应用：精确控制双金属催化剂的成分、结构和电子性质的能力使研究人员能够系统地研究结构-活性关系。这种基础理解可以应用于开发更高效和选择性的催化剂，用于实际的工业应用。
