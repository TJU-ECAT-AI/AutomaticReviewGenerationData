[1] "Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."

[2] "Since the properties of the catalyst surfaces are closely correlated with the catalytic activities, the precise modification of the catalyst surface by introducing another component or changing the morphology could facilitate the controlled tuning of the catalytic properties."

[3] "First principles studies have indicated the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals.

2. Precise surface modification: The introduction of a second metal component or changes in morphology allows for controlled tuning of catalytic properties through precise modification of the catalyst surface.

3. Altered electronic states: The synergistic effect in heterometallic nanocatalysts is related to changes in surface electronic states, which are significantly influenced by geometric parameters such as local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.

4. Bridging the gaps: By combining different metals in various structures (alloys, core-shell), bimetallic catalysts can more closely mimic the complexity of industrial catalysts while still allowing for systematic study, thus helping to bridge the materials and pressure gaps between fundamental research and practical applications.

5. Tailored properties: The ability to control composition, structure, and electronic properties of bimetallic catalysts allows researchers to design catalysts that are more relevant to industrial conditions while still maintaining the ability to study fundamental aspects of catalysis.

These unique properties of bimetallic catalysts have enabled researchers to develop more efficient and selective catalysts for a wide range of industrial processes, while also providing valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of catalysis at the atomic and molecular levels.

双金属催化剂自商业引入以来在多相催化领域取得了显著的发展。它们独特的电子和化学性质有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关的负载型催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 协同效应：具有合金和核壳结构的双金属纳米粒子(NPs)由于两种金属之间的协同效应，表现出比单金属对应物更高的催化活性。

2. 精确的表面修饰：引入第二种金属组分或改变形貌可以通过精确修饰催化剂表面来实现对催化性能的可控调节。

3. 改变的电子态：异金属纳米催化剂的协同效应与表面电子态的变化有关，这些变化主要受到局部应变和表面有效原子配位数等几何参数的显著影响。

4. 弥合差距：通过在各种结构(合金、核壳)中结合不同的金属，双金属催化剂可以更接近地模拟工业催化剂的复杂性，同时仍然允许进行系统的研究，从而有助于弥合基础研究和实际应用之间的材料和压力差距。

5. 定制性能：控制双金属催化剂的成分、结构和电子性质的能力使研究人员能够设计出更贴近工业条件的催化剂，同时仍然保持研究催化基本方面的能力。

这些双金属催化剂的独特性质使研究人员能够为广泛的工业过程开发更高效和选择性的催化剂，同时还为在原子和分子水平上理解催化的基本机制提供了宝贵的见解。
