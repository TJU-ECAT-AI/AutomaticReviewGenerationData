[1] "Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."

[2] "The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be well tuned by varying the size, composition and atomic ordering. Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts."

[3] "The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."

[4] "Coreshell NPs are in the frontier of advanced materials chemistry among the various bimetallic NPs and are of great importance and interest owing to their physical and chemical properties that are strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface, and also quite different from those of monometallic counterparts and alloys."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals.

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering. This allows for precise control over their catalytic performance.

3. Enhanced binding properties: Alloy materials possess distinct binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions in bimetallic catalysts modify the bonding between catalyst surfaces and reactants.

4. Stabilization of transition states: Bimetallic catalysts offer extra stabilization of transition states compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to improved catalytic performance.

5. Core-shell structures: Core-shell nanoparticles represent an advanced form of bimetallic catalysts. Their physical and chemical properties are strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface, offering unique advantages over monometallic catalysts and alloys.

These properties allow bimetallic catalysts to bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and practical supported catalysts by providing a more realistic representation of industrially relevant catalytic systems while maintaining a high degree of control over structure and composition. This enables researchers to study catalytic processes under more realistic conditions and develop catalysts with improved performance for practical applications.

双金属催化剂自商业化引入以来在多相催化领域已经有了显著的发展。它们独特的电子和化学性质有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关的负载型催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 协同效应：具有合金和核壳结构的双金属纳米粒子(NPs)由于两种金属之间的协同作用，展现出比单金属对应物更高的催化活性。

2. 可调性能：合金纳米粒子的化学和物理性质可以通过调节其尺寸、成分和原子排列来精细调控。这使得可以精确控制其催化性能。

3. 增强的结合性能：与单金属催化剂相比，合金材料与反应物具有独特的结合性质。双金属催化剂中强烈的金属-金属相互作用改变了催化剂表面与反应物之间的结合。

4. 过渡态稳定化：与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂能够额外稳定过渡态，从而提高催化性能。

5. 核壳结构：核壳纳米粒子代表了双金属催化剂的一种先进形式。它们的物理和化学性质强烈依赖于核、壳和界面的结构，相比单金属催化剂和合金具有独特优势。

这些性质使双金属催化剂能够弥合理想化模型表面和实际负载型催化剂之间的差距，为工业相关的催化系统提供更真实的表征，同时保持对结构和成分的高度控制。这使研究人员能够在更接近实际的条件下研究催化过程，并开发出性能更优的实用催化剂。
