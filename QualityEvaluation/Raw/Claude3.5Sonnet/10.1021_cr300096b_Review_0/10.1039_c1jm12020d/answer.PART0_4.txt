[1] "Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."

[2] "The properties of the catalyst surfaces are closely correlated with the catalytic activities, the precise modification of the catalyst surface by introducing another component or changing the morphology could facilitate the controlled tuning of the catalytic properties."

[3] "First principles studies have indicated the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface."

[4] "The synergistic catalytic effect over heterometallic NPs based on the reports mentioned in this article could be tentatively ascribed to the following main aspects. 1) Improved activity results from microstructure changes of nanocatalyst upon introducing another metal species. 2) In many cases, electronic interaction among the different components along with geometric effects leads to appropriate modification of electronic structure, which benefits the catalytic activity enhancement."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals. This synergy arises from several factors:

1. Precise modification of catalyst surfaces by introducing a second metal component or altering morphology allows for controlled tuning of catalytic properties.

2. The synergistic effect is influenced by surface electronic states, which are significantly altered by changes in geometric parameters like local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface.

3. Improved activity results from microstructural changes upon introducing another metal species.

4. Electronic interactions between different components, along with geometric effects, lead to appropriate modifications of electronic structure, enhancing catalytic activity.

These unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts. By providing a more complex and realistic representation of catalytic surfaces, bimetallic systems help to better simulate industrial conditions while still allowing for fundamental research. This approach enables researchers to study more practically relevant catalytic systems, thereby facilitating the translation of fundamental insights into practical applications.

双金属催化剂自商业化引入以来在多相催化领域发展显著。与单金属催化剂相比，它们表现出更高的催化活性，这归因于两种金属之间的协同效应。这种协同效应源于几个因素：

1. 通过引入第二种金属组分或改变形态来精确修饰催化剂表面，可以实现对催化性能的可控调节。

2. 协同效应受表面电子态的影响，而表面电子态又显著受到几何参数变化的影响，如局部应变和表面有效原子配位数。

3. 引入另一种金属物种导致的微观结构变化改善了活性。

4. 不同组分之间的电子相互作用，以及几何效应，导致电子结构的适当修饰，从而增强催化活性。

双金属催化剂的这些独特电子和化学性质有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"。通过提供更复杂和真实的催化表面表示，双金属系统有助于更好地模拟工业条件，同时仍允许进行基础研究。这种方法使研究人员能够研究更具实际相关性的催化系统，从而促进基础见解向实际应用的转化。
