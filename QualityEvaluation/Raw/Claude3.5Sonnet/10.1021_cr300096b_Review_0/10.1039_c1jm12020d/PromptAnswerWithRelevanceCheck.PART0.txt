[1] "Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."

[2] "The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be well tuned by varying the size, composition and atomic ordering. Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts."

[3] "The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."

[4] "Coreshell NPs are in the frontier of advanced materials chemistry among the various bimetallic NPs and are of great importance and interest owing to their physical and chemical properties that are strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface, and also quite different from those of monometallic counterparts and alloys."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals.

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering. This allows for precise control over their catalytic performance.

3. Enhanced binding properties: Alloy materials possess distinct binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions in bimetallic catalysts modify the bonding between catalyst surfaces and reactants.

4. Stabilization of transition states: Bimetallic catalysts offer extra stabilization of transition states compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to improved catalytic performance.

5. Core-shell structures: Core-shell nanoparticles represent an advanced form of bimetallic catalysts. Their physical and chemical properties are strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface, offering unique advantages over monometallic catalysts and alloys.

These properties allow bimetallic catalysts to bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and practical supported catalysts by providing a more realistic representation of industrially relevant catalytic systems while maintaining a high degree of control over structure and composition. This enables researchers to study catalytic processes under more realistic conditions and develop catalysts with improved performance for practical applications.
