The given literature does not contain information about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, nor does it discuss how their unique properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. The document focuses on a specific AuAg alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous aluminosilicate and its preparation, characterization, and performance in CO oxidation. It does not provide a broad historical perspective or discuss the concepts mentioned in the question.
