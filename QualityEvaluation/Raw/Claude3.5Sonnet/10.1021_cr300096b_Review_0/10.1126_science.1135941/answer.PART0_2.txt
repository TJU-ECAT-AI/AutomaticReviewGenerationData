[1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does provide insights into how researchers are approaching the study of bimetallic catalysts to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts:

1. Researchers are using well-characterized surfaces of selected cathode materials to attribute catalytic mechanisms to specific atomic and molecular properties of the surface.

2. A combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations are being employed to study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt3Ni single-crystal surfaces. This approach allows researchers to identify surface properties governing reactivity and determine how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

3. These studies have led to significant advancements in catalyst performance, such as the Pt3Ni(111) surface demonstrating 10-fold higher activity for ORR compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

This approach of studying well-defined model surfaces and relating their properties to catalytic performance helps bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications by providing insights that can guide the development of more efficient industrial catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在非均相催化领域自商业引入以来的历史演变。然而，它确实提供了研究人员如何研究双金属催化剂以弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"的见解：

1. 研究人员正在使用精选阴极材料的表征良好的表面，将催化机理归因于表面的特定原子和分子性质。

2. 研究人员正在结合使用非原位和原位表面敏感探针以及密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来研究Pt3Ni单晶表面上的氧还原反应（ORR）。这种方法使研究人员能够识别控制反应活性的表面性质，并确定表面结构、偏析和金属间键合如何影响反应动力学。

3. 这些研究已经导致催化剂性能的显著提高，例如Pt3Ni(111)表面对ORR的活性比Pt(111)高10倍，比用于聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）的最先进Pt/C催化剂高90倍。

这种研究定义明确的模型表面并将其性质与催化性能联系起来的方法，有助于通过提供可以指导更高效工业催化剂开发的见解，来弥合基础研究和实际应用之间的差距。
