[1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their role in bridging the materials and pressure gaps. However, it does illustrate some key aspects of how bimetallic catalysts are studied and developed:

1. Researchers are moving beyond trial-and-error approaches to study well-characterized surfaces, allowing them to attribute catalytic activity to specific atomic and molecular properties.

2. A combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive techniques, along with theoretical calculations, are used to study bimetallic catalysts like Pt3Ni. This approach helps understand how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect catalytic performance.

3. The goal is to translate insights from model surfaces (like the highly active Pt3Ni(111)-skin) into practical nanocatalysts that can bridge the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the "materials gap" or "pressure gap," the research approach described aims to connect fundamental surface science with practical catalyst development, which is relevant to addressing these challenges in heterogeneous catalysis.

虽然文献没有直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变或它们在弥合材料差距和压力差距方面的作用，但它确实说明了双金属催化剂研究和开发的一些关键方面：

1. 研究人员正在超越试错方法，转而研究表征良好的表面，这使他们能够将催化活性归因于特定的原子和分子性质。

2. 结合使用非原位和原位表面敏感技术，以及理论计算，来研究像Pt3Ni这样的双金属催化剂。这种方法有助于理解表面结构、偏析和金属间键合如何影响催化性能。

3. 目标是将从模型表面（如高活性的Pt3Ni(111)-skin）获得的见解转化为实用的纳米催化剂，以弥合基础研究和工业应用之间的差距。

虽然文档没有明确讨论"材料差距"或"压力差距"，但所描述的研究方法旨在将基础表面科学与实际催化剂开发联系起来，这与解决多相催化中的这些挑战有关。
