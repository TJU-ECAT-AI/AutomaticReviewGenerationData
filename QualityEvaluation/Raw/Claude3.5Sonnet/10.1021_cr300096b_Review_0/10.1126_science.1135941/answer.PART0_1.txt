[1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "Well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces were formed and characterized with UHV methods for surface preparation and surface analysis. These surfaces were transferred into the electrochemical environment without airborne contamination, and the stability of the UHV-prepared surface was determined with a combination of in situ surface-sensitive probes with electrochemical methods so that activity relationships could be obtained in real time."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide insights into how researchers are using advanced techniques to study bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni systems, in ways that help connect fundamental research to practical applications:

1. The researchers use a targeted approach with well-characterized surfaces to link specific atomic and molecular properties to catalytic mechanisms, rather than trial-and-error methods.

2. They employ a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive techniques along with DFT calculations to study how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect catalytic activity.

3. The study involves preparing single-crystal electrode surfaces in ultra-high vacuum, then transferring them to electrochemical environments without contamination. This allows for real-time analysis of surface stability and activity relationships.

These methods help bridge the gap between model surfaces and practical catalysts by providing detailed insights into surface properties and behavior under relevant conditions. While not explicitly stated, this approach likely contributes to addressing both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.

这篇文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变，或它们在弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的作用。然而，它确实提供了研究人员如何使用先进技术来研究双金属催化剂（特别是Pt-Ni系统）的见解，这些方法有助于将基础研究与实际应用联系起来：

1. 研究人员使用有针对性的方法，研究具有明确特征的表面，以将特定的原子和分子属性与催化机理联系起来，而不是使用试错法。

2. 他们结合使用非原位和原位表面敏感技术以及密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，来研究表面结构、偏析和金属间键合如何影响催化活性。

3. 该研究涉及在超高真空中制备单晶电极表面，然后将其转移到电化学环境中而不受污染。这允许实时分析表面稳定性和活性关系。

这些方法通过提供表面属性和在相关条件下行为的详细见解，有助于弥合模型表面和实际催化剂之间的差距。虽然没有明确说明，但这种方法可能有助于解决异相催化研究中的材料和压力差距问题。
