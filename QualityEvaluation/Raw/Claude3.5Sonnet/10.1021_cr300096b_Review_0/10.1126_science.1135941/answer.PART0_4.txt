[1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "Well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces were formed and characterized with UHV methods for surface preparation and surface analysis. These surfaces were transferred into the electrochemical environment without airborne contamination, and the stability of the UHV-prepared surface was determined with a combination of in situ surface-sensitive probes with electrochemical methods so that activity relationships could be obtained in real time."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it does provide insights into how researchers are using well-characterized bimetallic surfaces to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and practical catalysts:

1. The researchers used a systematic approach with well-characterized cathode materials, allowing them to attribute catalytic mechanisms to specific surface properties at the atomic and molecular level.

2. They employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt3Ni single-crystal surfaces. This approach allowed them to identify surface properties governing reactivity and determine how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect ORR kinetics.

3. The researchers prepared well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces using ultra-high vacuum (UHV) methods, then transferred them to electrochemical environments without contamination. They used in situ surface-sensitive probes combined with electrochemical methods to determine surface stability and obtain real-time activity relationships.

These methods demonstrate how researchers are using advanced techniques to bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and practical catalysts, providing fundamental insights that can be applied to the development of more efficient industrial catalysts.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中的历史演变。然而，它确实提供了研究人员如何使用表征良好的双金属表面来弥合模型表面和实际催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"的见解：

1. 研究人员使用了一种系统的方法，采用表征良好的阴极材料，使他们能够将催化机理归因于表面在原子和分子水平上的特定性质。

2. 他们结合使用非原位和原位表面敏感探针以及密度泛函理论(DFT)计算，来研究Pt3Ni单晶表面上的氧还原反应(ORR)。这种方法使他们能够识别控制反应活性的表面性质，并确定表面结构、偏析和金属间键合如何影响ORR动力学。

3. 研究人员使用超高真空(UHV)方法制备了表征良好的PtNi单晶电极表面，然后将它们转移到电化学环境中，避免了污染。他们使用原位表面敏感探针结合电化学方法来确定表面稳定性，并获得实时活性关系。

这些方法展示了研究人员如何使用先进技术来弥合理想化模型表面和实际催化剂之间的差距，提供了可应用于开发更高效工业催化剂的基础见解。
