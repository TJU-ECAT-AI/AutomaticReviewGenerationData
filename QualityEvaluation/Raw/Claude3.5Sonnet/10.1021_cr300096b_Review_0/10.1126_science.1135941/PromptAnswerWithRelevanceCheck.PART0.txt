[1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "The results of the preparation and characterization of Pt3Ni(hkl) alloy surfaces in UHV are summarized in Fig. 1. The surface-sensitive techniques that were used included low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS)"

[4] "We next determined the stability of a surface after transfer from UHV into the electrochemical environment. Surface x-ray scattering (SXS) was used to characterize both the potential range of stability as well as the near-surface composition of the alloy in situ."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does provide insights into how researchers are using advanced techniques to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The researchers have moved beyond trial-and-error approaches to study well-characterized cathode materials, allowing them to attribute catalytic mechanisms to specific surface properties at the atomic and molecular level. They employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study oxygen reduction reactions on Pt3Ni single-crystal surfaces. This approach helps identify the surface properties governing reactivity variations and determines how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

The study utilized various surface-sensitive techniques in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, including LEED, AES, LEIS, and UPS, to characterize the Pt3Ni alloy surfaces. Additionally, they used surface x-ray scattering (SXS) to examine surface stability and composition after transferring from UHV to electrochemical environments.

These advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations allow researchers to bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and more complex, industrially relevant catalysts. By providing detailed insights into surface electronic structure, composition, and reactivity under various conditions, this approach contributes to both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide insights into how researchers are using advanced techniques to study bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni systems, in ways that help connect fundamental research to practical applications:

1. The researchers use a targeted approach with well-characterized surfaces to link specific atomic and molecular properties to catalytic mechanisms, rather than trial-and-error methods.

2. They employ a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive techniques along with DFT calculations to study how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect catalytic activity.

3. The study involves preparing single-crystal electrode surfaces in ultra-high vacuum, then transferring them to electrochemical environments without contamination. This allows for real-time analysis of surface stability and activity relationships.

These methods help bridge the gap between model surfaces and practical catalysts by providing detailed insights into surface properties and behavior under relevant conditions. While not explicitly stated, this approach likely contributes to addressing both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does provide insights into how researchers are approaching the study of bimetallic catalysts to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts:

1. Researchers are using well-characterized surfaces of selected cathode materials to attribute catalytic mechanisms to specific atomic and molecular properties of the surface.

2. A combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations are being employed to study the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt3Ni single-crystal surfaces. This approach allows researchers to identify surface properties governing reactivity and determine how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

3. These studies have led to significant advancements in catalyst performance, such as the Pt3Ni(111) surface demonstrating 10-fold higher activity for ORR compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs).

This approach of studying well-defined model surfaces and relating their properties to catalytic performance helps bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications by providing insights that can guide the development of more efficient industrial catalysts.

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their role in bridging the materials and pressure gaps. However, it does illustrate some key aspects of how bimetallic catalysts are studied and developed:

1. Researchers are moving beyond trial-and-error approaches to study well-characterized surfaces, allowing them to attribute catalytic activity to specific atomic and molecular properties.

2. A combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive techniques, along with theoretical calculations, are used to study bimetallic catalysts like Pt3Ni. This approach helps understand how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect catalytic performance.

3. The goal is to translate insights from model surfaces (like the highly active Pt3Ni(111)-skin) into practical nanocatalysts that can bridge the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the "materials gap" or "pressure gap," the research approach described aims to connect fundamental surface science with practical catalyst development, which is relevant to addressing these challenges in heterogeneous catalysis.
