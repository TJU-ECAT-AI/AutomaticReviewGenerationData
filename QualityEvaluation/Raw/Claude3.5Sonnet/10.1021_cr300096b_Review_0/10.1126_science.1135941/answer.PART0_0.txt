[1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "The results of the preparation and characterization of Pt3Ni(hkl) alloy surfaces in UHV are summarized in Fig. 1. The surface-sensitive techniques that were used included low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS)"

[4] "We next determined the stability of a surface after transfer from UHV into the electrochemical environment. Surface x-ray scattering (SXS) was used to characterize both the potential range of stability as well as the near-surface composition of the alloy in situ."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does provide insights into how researchers are using advanced techniques to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The researchers have moved beyond trial-and-error approaches to study well-characterized cathode materials, allowing them to attribute catalytic mechanisms to specific surface properties at the atomic and molecular level. They employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study oxygen reduction reactions on Pt3Ni single-crystal surfaces. This approach helps identify the surface properties governing reactivity variations and determines how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

The study utilized various surface-sensitive techniques in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, including LEED, AES, LEIS, and UPS, to characterize the Pt3Ni alloy surfaces. Additionally, they used surface x-ray scattering (SXS) to examine surface stability and composition after transferring from UHV to electrochemical environments.

These advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations allow researchers to bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and more complex, industrially relevant catalysts. By providing detailed insights into surface electronic structure, composition, and reactivity under various conditions, this approach contributes to both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中自商业化引入以来的历史演变。然而，它确实提供了研究人员如何使用先进技术来弥合模型表面与工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"的见解。

研究人员已经超越了试错方法，转而研究表征良好的阴极材料，使他们能够将催化机理归因于表面在原子和分子水平上的特定性质。他们结合使用非原位和原位表面敏感探针以及密度泛函理论(DFT)计算来研究Pt3Ni单晶表面上的氧还原反应。这种方法有助于识别控制反应性变化的表面性质，并确定表面结构、偏析和金属间键合如何影响反应动力学。

该研究在超高真空(UHV)条件下使用了各种表面敏感技术，包括LEED、AES、LEIS和UPS，来表征Pt3Ni合金表面。此外，他们使用表面X射线散射(SXS)来检查从UHV转移到电化学环境后的表面稳定性和组成。

这些先进的表征技术和理论计算使研究人员能够弥合理想化模型表面与更复杂的工业相关催化剂之间的差距。通过在各种条件下提供表面电子结构、组成和反应性的详细见解，这种方法为多相催化的基础研究和实际应用做出了贡献。
