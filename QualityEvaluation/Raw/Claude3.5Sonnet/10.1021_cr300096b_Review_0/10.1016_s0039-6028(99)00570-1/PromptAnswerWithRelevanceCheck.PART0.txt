<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, nor does it discuss how their properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. The document focuses on specific studies of metal films on tungsten surfaces, their structural and electronic properties, and some reactions on these surfaces. It does not provide a broader historical or industrial context for bimetallic catalysts.

The given literature does not contain information specifically about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, or how their properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. The document focuses on fundamental studies of faceting and surface properties of specific bimetallic systems like PdW and PtW, rather than discussing the broader historical development or industrial applications of bimetallic catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based solely on the information provided in the given text.

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". The document focuses on studies of metal films on tungsten surfaces, their structural changes, and some aspects of their reactivity. It does not discuss the commercial introduction or industrial applications of bimetallic catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

However, the document does contain some relevant information about bimetallic surfaces that could be extended to partially address the question:

1. The study investigates model bimetallic surfaces, such as Pd, Pt, and Au films on W substrates, which are relevant to understanding fundamental properties of bimetallic catalysts.

2. The research examines structural changes (like faceting), electronic properties, and reactivity of these bimetallic surfaces, which are important factors in catalysis.

3. The document mentions studying acetylene cyclization on PdW surfaces as an example of structure-sensitive reactions on bimetallic catalysts.

4. The formation of surface alloys in some bimetallic systems (like PdW and PtW) is discussed, which can affect catalytic properties.

5. The use of various surface science techniques (STM, LEED, AES, SXPS) to study these model bimetallic surfaces demonstrates efforts to bridge the "materials gap" by providing detailed understanding of surface properties.

While these points don't directly answer the question about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in industry, they illustrate ongoing fundamental research that contributes to understanding bimetallic catalysts at the atomic and molecular level, which is crucial for developing and improving industrial catalysts.

给定的科学文献并不包含专门讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中的演变或它们在弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的作用的信息。该文档主要关注钨表面上金属薄膜的研究、它们的结构变化以及一些反应性方面。它没有讨论双金属催化剂的商业引入或工业应用。因此，无法根据提供的文本直接回答这个问题。

然而，该文档确实包含一些关于双金属表面的相关信息，可以部分延伸来回答这个问题：

1. 该研究调查了模型双金属表面，如W基底上的Pd、Pt和Au薄膜，这与理解双金属催化剂的基本性质有关。

2. 研究考察了这些双金属表面的结构变化（如切面）、电子性质和反应性，这些都是催化中的重要因素。

3. 文档提到在PdW表面上研究乙炔环化作为双金属催化剂上结构敏感反应的例子。

4. 讨论了一些双金属系统（如PdW和PtW）中表面合金的形成，这可能影响催化性质。

5. 使用各种表面科学技术（STM、LEED、AES、SXPS）来研究这些模型双金属表面，表明了为弥合"材料差距"所做的努力，通过提供对表面性质的详细理解。

虽然这些要点不能直接回答关于双金属催化剂在工业中演变的问题，但它们说明了正在进行的基础研究，这些研究有助于在原子和分子水平上理解双金属催化剂，这对开发和改进工业催化剂至关重要。
