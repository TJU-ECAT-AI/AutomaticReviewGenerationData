          [1] "Near-surface alloys (NSAs) are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk"

          [2] "NSAs, in particular, have shown promise for catalyst design3,7,8, and single-crystal investigations have demonstrated some of their remarkable properties in a limited number of cases."

          [3] "To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20."

          [4] "We find, however, that selected NSAs offer an exciting exception to this rule by simultaneously allowing weak H binding and low H2 dissociation barriers."

          [5] "Many NSAs, however, have BEHs in this range, generating a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies."

          [6] "Near-surface alloys, however, escape from that rule by offering the exciting combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 activation."

          [7] "Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and in nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies for metals may not be far off"

          [8] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

          The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction. However, it focuses on near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique electronic and chemical properties that could contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

          NSAs are defined as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials have shown promise for catalyst design, with single-crystal studies demonstrating remarkable properties in some cases.

          The unique properties of NSAs that contribute to bridging these gaps include:

          1. Tunable binding energies: NSAs can generate a quasi-continuous spectrum of hydrogen binding energies, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

          2. Improved reaction kinetics: Some NSAs offer a combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is not typically observed in pure metals.

          3. Potential for practical synthesis: Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication suggest that practical methods for synthesizing NSAs may soon be available.

          4. Predictive power: Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs, bridging fundamental research with potential practical applications.

          These properties allow NSAs to potentially operate under conditions more relevant to industrial processes while maintaining the well-defined nature of model catalyst surfaces. This could help researchers better understand catalyst behavior under realistic conditions and design improved catalysts for practical applications.

          However, it's noted that real NSAs may differ from idealized models, as some solute metals may segregate more deeply into the host material.

          文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的历史演变。然而，它主要关注近表面合金（NSAs）作为一种有前景的新型双金属催化剂，具有独特的电子和化学性质，可能有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关支持型催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"。

          NSAs被定义为在宿主金属表面附近存在溶质金属，其浓度与体相不同的合金。这些材料在催化剂设计方面显示出了潜力，单晶研究在某些情况下展示了其显著的性能。

          NSAs有助于弥合这些差距的独特性质包括：

          1. 可调节的结合能：NSAs可以产生准连续的氢结合能谱，允许对催化性能进行精细调节。

          2. 改善的反应动力学：一些NSAs提供了弱氢结合和低H2解离能垒的组合，这在纯金属中通常不会观察到。

          3. 实际合成的潜力：最近在原子层沉积和纳米颗粒制造技术方面的创新表明，合成NSAs的实用方法可能很快就会出现。

          4. 预测能力：密度泛函理论计算被用来开发新的NSAs，将基础研究与潜在的实际应用联系起来。

          这些性质使NSAs能够在更接近工业过程的条件下运行，同时保持模型催化剂表面的明确定义性质。这可以帮助研究人员更好地了解催化剂在实际条件下的行为，并为实际应用设计改进的催化剂。

          然而，需要注意的是，实际的NSAs可能与理想化模型有所不同，因为一些溶质金属可能会更深地偏析到宿主材料中。
