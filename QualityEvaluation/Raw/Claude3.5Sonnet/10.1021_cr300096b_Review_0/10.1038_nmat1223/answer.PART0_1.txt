The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it does discuss near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that could help bridge the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts.

NSAs are described as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials exhibit electronic and chemical properties that differ from both the pure host and solute metals. 

The unique properties of NSAs contribute to bridging the materials and pressure gaps in several ways:

1. Tunable binding energies: NSAs can generate a quasi-continuous spectrum of hydrogen binding energies, including some that bind hydrogen more weakly than noble metals like copper and gold. This allows for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

2. Improved reaction kinetics: Despite weak hydrogen binding, many NSAs show lower transition-state energies for H2 dissociation compared to noble metals. This combination of weak binding and easy activation is not typically observed in pure metals.

3. Potential for practical synthesis: Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication suggest that practical methods for synthesizing NSAs may soon be available, potentially allowing the creation of catalysts that more closely resemble ideal model surfaces.

These properties allow NSAs to potentially operate under conditions more relevant to industrial processes while maintaining the well-defined nature of model catalyst surfaces. This could help researchers better understand catalyst behavior under realistic conditions and design improved catalysts for practical applications.

文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中的历史演变。但是，它确实讨论了近表面合金（NSAs）作为一种有前景的新型双金属催化剂，具有独特的性质，可以帮助弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的材料差距和压力差距。

NSAs被描述为溶质金属在宿主金属表面附近的浓度与体相不同的合金。这些材料表现出与纯宿主金属和溶质金属都不同的电子和化学性质。

NSAs的独特性质通过以下几种方式有助于弥合材料和压力差距：

1. 可调节的结合能：NSAs可以产生准连续的氢结合能谱，包括一些比铜和金等贵金属结合氢更弱的合金。这允许对催化性质进行精细调节。

2. 改善的反应动力学：尽管氢结合较弱，但许多NSAs显示出比贵金属更低的H2分解过渡态能量。这种弱结合和易活化的组合在纯金属中通常不会观察到。

3. 实际合成的潜力：最近在原子层沉积和纳米颗粒制造技术方面的创新表明，合成NSAs的实用方法可能很快就会出现，这可能允许创造出更接近理想模型表面的催化剂。

这些性质使NSAs能够在更接近工业过程的条件下运行，同时保持模型催化剂表面的明确定义性质。这可以帮助研究人员更好地了解催化剂在实际条件下的行为，并为实际应用设计改进的催化剂。
