The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their commercial introduction. However, it does discuss near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that could bridge some gaps between model surfaces and practical catalysts.

NSAs are defined as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials have shown promise in catalyst design, with single-crystal studies demonstrating some remarkable properties.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of NSAs contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in several ways:

1. They offer a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

2. NSAs can simultaneously provide weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, a combination not typically found in pure metals.

3. Density functional theory calculations are used to predict and design NSAs with specific properties, bridging fundamental research with potential practical applications.

4. NSAs exhibit behaviors that deviate from traditional correlations between binding energy and activation barriers, offering new possibilities for catalyst design.

These properties suggest that NSAs could potentially lead to improved catalysts for various applications, including low-temperature hydrogenation reactions and fuel cell anodes. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, the unique properties of NSAs and the ability to design them from first principles indicate their potential to contribute to this goal in both research and practical applications.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变或其商业引入。然而，它确实讨论了近表面合金（NSAs）作为一类有前景的新型双金属催化剂，具有独特的性质，可以弥合模型表面和实际催化剂之间的一些差距。

NSAs被定义为在主体金属表面附近存在溶质金属，其浓度与体相不同的合金。这些材料在催化剂设计中显示出了promise，单晶研究已经证明了它们的一些显著特性。

NSAs的独特电子和化学性质通过以下几种方式有助于弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"：

1. 它们提供了准连续的结合能谱，允许对催化性能进行精细调节。

2. NSAs可以同时提供弱氢结合和低H2解离障碍，这种组合在纯金属中通常找不到。

3. 密度泛函理论计算被用来预测和设计具有特定性质的NSAs，将基础研究与潜在的实际应用联系起来。

4. NSAs表现出偏离传统结合能与活化能障碍之间相关性的行为，为催化剂设计提供了新的可能性。

这些性质表明，NSAs可能会导致各种应用的改进催化剂，包括低温氢化反应和燃料电池阳极。虽然文献没有明确讨论弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，但NSAs的独特性质以及从第一原理设计它们的能力表明它们在研究和实际应用中都有潜力为这一目标做出贡献。
