The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their commercial introduction. However, it does discuss near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that could bridge some gaps between model surfaces and practical catalysts.

NSAs are defined as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials have shown promise in catalyst design, with single-crystal studies demonstrating some remarkable properties.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of NSAs contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in several ways:

1. They offer a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

2. NSAs can simultaneously provide weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, a combination not typically found in pure metals.

3. Density functional theory calculations are used to predict and design NSAs with specific properties, bridging fundamental research with potential practical applications.

4. NSAs exhibit behaviors that deviate from traditional correlations between binding energy and activation barriers, offering new possibilities for catalyst design.

These properties suggest that NSAs could potentially lead to improved catalysts for various applications, including low-temperature hydrogenation reactions and fuel cell anodes. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, the unique properties of NSAs and the ability to design them from first principles indicate their potential to contribute to this goal in both research and practical applications.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变或其商业引入。然而，它确实讨论了近表面合金（NSAs）作为一类有前景的新型双金属催化剂，具有独特的性质，可以弥合模型表面和实际催化剂之间的一些差距。

NSAs被定义为在主体金属表面附近存在溶质金属，其浓度与体相不同的合金。这些材料在催化剂设计中显示出了promise，单晶研究已经证明了它们的一些显著特性。

NSAs的独特电子和化学性质通过以下几种方式有助于弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"：

1. 它们提供了准连续的结合能谱，允许对催化性能进行精细调节。

2. NSAs可以同时提供弱氢结合和低H2解离障碍，这种组合在纯金属中通常找不到。

3. 密度泛函理论计算被用来预测和设计具有特定性质的NSAs，将基础研究与潜在的实际应用联系起来。

4. NSAs表现出偏离传统结合能与活化能障碍之间相关性的行为，为催化剂设计提供了新的可能性。

这些性质表明，NSAs可能会导致各种应用的改进催化剂，包括低温氢化反应和燃料电池阳极。虽然文献没有明确讨论弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，但NSAs的独特性质以及从第一原理设计它们的能力表明它们在研究和实际应用中都有潜力为这一目标做出贡献。

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it does discuss near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that could help bridge the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts.

NSAs are described as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials exhibit electronic and chemical properties that differ from both the pure host and solute metals. 

The unique properties of NSAs contribute to bridging the materials and pressure gaps in several ways:

1. Tunable binding energies: NSAs can generate a quasi-continuous spectrum of hydrogen binding energies, including some that bind hydrogen more weakly than noble metals like copper and gold. This allows for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

2. Improved reaction kinetics: Despite weak hydrogen binding, many NSAs show lower transition-state energies for H2 dissociation compared to noble metals. This combination of weak binding and easy activation is not typically observed in pure metals.

3. Potential for practical synthesis: Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication suggest that practical methods for synthesizing NSAs may soon be available, potentially allowing the creation of catalysts that more closely resemble ideal model surfaces.

These properties allow NSAs to potentially operate under conditions more relevant to industrial processes while maintaining the well-defined nature of model catalyst surfaces. This could help researchers better understand catalyst behavior under realistic conditions and design improved catalysts for practical applications.

文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中的历史演变。但是，它确实讨论了近表面合金（NSAs）作为一种有前景的新型双金属催化剂，具有独特的性质，可以帮助弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的材料差距和压力差距。

NSAs被描述为溶质金属在宿主金属表面附近的浓度与体相不同的合金。这些材料表现出与纯宿主金属和溶质金属都不同的电子和化学性质。

NSAs的独特性质通过以下几种方式有助于弥合材料和压力差距：

1. 可调节的结合能：NSAs可以产生准连续的氢结合能谱，包括一些比铜和金等贵金属结合氢更弱的合金。这允许对催化性质进行精细调节。

2. 改善的反应动力学：尽管氢结合较弱，但许多NSAs显示出比贵金属更低的H2分解过渡态能量。这种弱结合和易活化的组合在纯金属中通常不会观察到。

3. 实际合成的潜力：最近在原子层沉积和纳米颗粒制造技术方面的创新表明，合成NSAs的实用方法可能很快就会出现，这可能允许创造出更接近理想模型表面的催化剂。

这些性质使NSAs能够在更接近工业过程的条件下运行，同时保持模型催化剂表面的明确定义性质。这可以帮助研究人员更好地了解催化剂在实际条件下的行为，并为实际应用设计改进的催化剂。

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or explicitly discuss bridging materials and pressure gaps. However, it does describe near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that could contribute to bridging these gaps.

NSAs are defined as alloys where the concentration of a solute metal near the surface differs from the bulk. These materials exhibit electronic and chemical properties distinct from both pure metals and traditional alloys. Specifically, some NSAs demonstrate weak hydrogen binding comparable to noble metals, but with much lower activation barriers for H2 dissociation. This combination of properties is not observed in pure metals and could enable improved catalytic performance.

The unique behavior of NSAs stems from modified electronic interactions between metal layers and with adsorbates. This allows NSAs to bypass typical correlations between binding strength and activation barriers seen in pure metals. Such precise control over surface reactivity could help bridge the materials gap by creating model surfaces that more closely mimic the complex behavior of supported catalysts.

Regarding the pressure gap, while not explicitly addressed, the ability of NSAs to activate H2 at low temperatures suggests potential for improved performance under industrially relevant conditions. Additionally, advances in fabrication techniques like atomic layer deposition may soon enable precise control of NSA structures at the nanoscale, further bridging idealized models and practical catalysts.

Overall, while not providing a historical perspective, the literature suggests NSAs represent an important advancement in bimetallic catalysis with potential to address longstanding challenges in connecting fundamental studies to industrial applications.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变，也没有明确讨论如何弥合材料差距和压力差距。然而，它确实描述了近表面合金(NSAs)作为一种有前景的新型双金属催化剂，具有独特的性质，可能有助于弥合这些差距。

NSAs被定义为合金表面附近的溶质金属浓度与体相不同。这些材料表现出与纯金属和传统合金都不同的电子和化学性质。具体来说，一些NSAs表现出与贵金属相当的弱氢结合，但H2解离的活化能垒却低得多。这种性质组合在纯金属中是看不到的，可能会实现更好的催化性能。

NSAs的独特行为源于金属层之间以及与吸附质之间改变了的电子相互作用。这使得NSAs能够绕过纯金属中结合强度和活化能垒之间的典型相关性。这种对表面反应性的精确控制可能有助于弥合材料差距，创造出更接近支持型催化剂复杂行为的模型表面。

关于压力差距，虽然没有明确提及，但NSAs在低温下活化H2的能力表明它们有可能在工业相关条件下提高性能。此外，原子层沉积等制造技术的进步可能很快就能在纳米尺度上精确控制NSA结构，进一步弥合理想模型和实用催化剂之间的差距。

总的来说，虽然没有提供历史视角，但文献表明NSAs代表了双金属催化领域的重要进展，有潜力解决长期存在的将基础研究与工业应用联系起来的挑战。

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their specific contributions to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide insights into the development and properties of near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising class of bimetallic catalysts.

NSAs are defined as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials have shown potential for catalyst design, with single-crystal studies demonstrating remarkable properties in some cases.

The research described uses density functional theory calculations to develop new NSAs for hydrogen-related processes. Some NSAs have been found to exhibit a unique combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation, which could be beneficial for both H2 dissociation and subsequent reactions of adsorbed H with other surface species.

While the study focuses on idealized NSA models, it acknowledges that real NSAs may differ from these models. For instance, in some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host.

Although not explicitly stated, this research on NSAs contributes to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" by providing a theoretical framework for designing catalysts with specific properties. This approach allows for the exploration of a wide range of bimetallic compositions and structures, potentially leading to catalysts that better mimic industrially relevant conditions while still allowing for fundamental studies.
