[2] "NSAs, in particular, have shown promise for catalyst design3,7,8, and single-crystal investigations have demonstrated some of their remarkable properties in a limited number of cases."

[3] "To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20."

[4] "We find, among other results, that some NSAs produce a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation. These unusual characteristics could be beneficial both for H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does discuss near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique properties.

NSAs are defined as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials have shown promise for catalyst design, with single-crystal studies demonstrating remarkable properties in some cases.

The research uses density functional theory calculations to develop new NSAs for catalytic processes. Some NSAs have been found to exhibit a combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation, which could be beneficial for both H2 dissociation to produce adsorbed H and for subsequent reactions of H with other surface species.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, the unique properties of NSAs suggest they could potentially contribute to this goal by offering more precise control over surface composition and reactivity compared to traditional bimetallic catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变或它们在弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的作用。然而，它确实讨论了近表面合金（NSAs）作为一种具有独特性质的新型双金属催化剂。

NSAs被定义为在宿主金属表面附近存在溶质金属，其浓度与体相不同的合金。这些材料在催化剂设计方面显示出了潜力，单晶研究在某些情况下展示了其显著的性能。

该研究使用密度泛函理论计算来开发用于催化过程的新型NSAs。一些NSAs被发现具有弱氢键合和容易H2解离的组合特性，这可能有利于H2解离产生吸附H以及H与其他表面物种的后续反应。

虽然文献没有明确讨论弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，但NSAs的独特性质表明，与传统的双金属催化剂相比，它们可能通过提供对表面成分和反应性的更精确控制来促进这一目标的实现。
