The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or explicitly discuss bridging materials and pressure gaps. However, it does describe near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique properties that could contribute to bridging these gaps.

NSAs are defined as alloys where the concentration of a solute metal near the surface differs from the bulk. These materials exhibit electronic and chemical properties distinct from both pure metals and traditional alloys. Specifically, some NSAs demonstrate weak hydrogen binding comparable to noble metals, but with much lower activation barriers for H2 dissociation. This combination of properties is not observed in pure metals and could enable improved catalytic performance.

The unique behavior of NSAs stems from modified electronic interactions between metal layers and with adsorbates. This allows NSAs to bypass typical correlations between binding strength and activation barriers seen in pure metals. Such precise control over surface reactivity could help bridge the materials gap by creating model surfaces that more closely mimic the complex behavior of supported catalysts.

Regarding the pressure gap, while not explicitly addressed, the ability of NSAs to activate H2 at low temperatures suggests potential for improved performance under industrially relevant conditions. Additionally, advances in fabrication techniques like atomic layer deposition may soon enable precise control of NSA structures at the nanoscale, further bridging idealized models and practical catalysts.

Overall, while not providing a historical perspective, the literature suggests NSAs represent an important advancement in bimetallic catalysis with potential to address longstanding challenges in connecting fundamental studies to industrial applications.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变，也没有明确讨论如何弥合材料差距和压力差距。然而，它确实描述了近表面合金(NSAs)作为一种有前景的新型双金属催化剂，具有独特的性质，可能有助于弥合这些差距。

NSAs被定义为合金表面附近的溶质金属浓度与体相不同。这些材料表现出与纯金属和传统合金都不同的电子和化学性质。具体来说，一些NSAs表现出与贵金属相当的弱氢结合，但H2解离的活化能垒却低得多。这种性质组合在纯金属中是看不到的，可能会实现更好的催化性能。

NSAs的独特行为源于金属层之间以及与吸附质之间改变了的电子相互作用。这使得NSAs能够绕过纯金属中结合强度和活化能垒之间的典型相关性。这种对表面反应性的精确控制可能有助于弥合材料差距，创造出更接近支持型催化剂复杂行为的模型表面。

关于压力差距，虽然没有明确提及，但NSAs在低温下活化H2的能力表明它们有可能在工业相关条件下提高性能。此外，原子层沉积等制造技术的进步可能很快就能在纳米尺度上精确控制NSA结构，进一步弥合理想模型和实用催化剂之间的差距。

总的来说，虽然没有提供历史视角，但文献表明NSAs代表了双金属催化领域的重要进展，有潜力解决长期存在的将基础研究与工业应用联系起来的挑战。
