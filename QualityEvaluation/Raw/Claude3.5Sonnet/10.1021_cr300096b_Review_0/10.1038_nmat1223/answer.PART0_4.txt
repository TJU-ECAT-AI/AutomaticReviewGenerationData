The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their specific contributions to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide insights into the development and properties of near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising class of bimetallic catalysts.

NSAs are defined as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials have shown potential for catalyst design, with single-crystal studies demonstrating remarkable properties in some cases.

The research described uses density functional theory calculations to develop new NSAs for hydrogen-related processes. Some NSAs have been found to exhibit a unique combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 dissociation, which could be beneficial for both H2 dissociation and subsequent reactions of adsorbed H with other surface species.

While the study focuses on idealized NSA models, it acknowledges that real NSAs may differ from these models. For instance, in some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host.

Although not explicitly stated, this research on NSAs contributes to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" by providing a theoretical framework for designing catalysts with specific properties. This approach allows for the exploration of a wide range of bimetallic compositions and structures, potentially leading to catalysts that better mimic industrially relevant conditions while still allowing for fundamental studies.

文献并没有直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变，或它们在弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的具体贡献。然而，它确实提供了关于近表面合金（NSAs）作为一类有前途的双金属催化剂的发展和性质的见解。

NSAs被定义为溶质金属在宿主金属表面附近的浓度与体相不同的合金。这些材料在催化剂设计方面显示出潜力，单晶研究在一些情况下展示了它们的卓越性能。

所描述的研究使用密度泛函理论计算来开发用于氢相关过程的新型NSAs。研究发现，一些NSAs表现出弱氢结合和容易H2解离的独特组合，这可能对H2解离以及吸附H与其他表面物种的后续反应都有益处。

虽然这项研究主要关注理想化的NSA模型，但它承认实际的NSAs可能与这些模型有所不同。例如，在某些情况下，亚表面合金中的部分溶质可能会更深地偏析到宿主中。

虽然没有明确说明，但这项关于NSAs的研究通过提供一个设计具有特定性能的催化剂的理论框架，为弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"做出了贡献。这种方法允许探索广泛的双金属组成和结构，可能会导致开发出更好地模拟工业相关条件的催化剂，同时仍然允许进行基础研究。
