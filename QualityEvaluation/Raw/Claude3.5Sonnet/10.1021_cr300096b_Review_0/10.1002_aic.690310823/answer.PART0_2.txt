The literature provides limited information on the full evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction. However, it highlights some key aspects of their development and application:

Bimetallic catalysts have gained widespread use, particularly in the petroleum industry, due to their improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. This suggests an evolution towards more efficient and longer-lasting catalytic systems.

The research on bimetallic catalysts has progressed from studying basic selectivity aspects to more advanced characterization techniques. For example, the use of physical probes like EXAFS to obtain structural information on supported bimetallic clusters represents a significant advancement in understanding these catalysts at the molecular level.

The comparison between highly dispersed, supported catalysts and single crystal studies indicates efforts to bridge the "materials gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant catalysts. This approach combines fundamental surface science with practical catalyst development.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the "pressure gap," the focus on both fundamental research (e.g., single crystal studies) and industrial applications (e.g., petroleum reforming) suggests attempts to connect laboratory conditions with real-world applications.

The book's coverage of various bimetallic systems (ruthenium-copper, osmium-copper, platinum-iridium) demonstrates the diversity of combinations explored to exploit unique electronic and chemical properties of different metal pairs.

Overall, the evolution of bimetallic catalysts appears to involve a progression from basic concepts to more sophisticated understanding and characterization, with a constant focus on improving industrial applications, particularly in petroleum reforming.

文献对双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的完整演变提供了有限的信息。然而，它强调了它们发展和应用的一些关键方面：

双金属催化剂已广泛应用，特别是在石油行业，这是由于它们相比单金属催化剂具有更好的选择性和活性维持能力。这表明催化系统向更高效和更持久的方向演变。

双金属催化剂的研究已从研究基本选择性方面发展到更先进的表征技术。例如，使用EXAFS等物理探针获取支持的双金属簇的结构信息，代表了在分子水平上理解这些催化剂的重大进展。

高度分散的支持催化剂与单晶研究的比较表明，努力在模型表面和工业相关催化剂之间架起"材料差距"。这种方法将基础表面科学与实际催化剂开发相结合。

虽然文献没有明确讨论"压力差距"，但对基础研究（如单晶研究）和工业应用（如石油重整）的关注表明，试图将实验室条件与现实世界应用联系起来。

该书涵盖了各种双金属系统（钌-铜、锇-铜、铂-铱），展示了为利用不同金属对的独特电子和化学性质而探索的组合多样性。

总的来说，双金属催化剂的演变似乎涉及从基本概念到更复杂的理解和表征的进展，始终关注改进工业应用，特别是在石油重整方面。
