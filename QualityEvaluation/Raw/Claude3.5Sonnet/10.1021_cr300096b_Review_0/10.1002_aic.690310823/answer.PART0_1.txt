[1] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."

[2] "Special emphasis is placed on a description of how physical probes such as EXAFS can successfully be used to obtain structural information on well dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters."

[3] "The final chapter of the book concentrates on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for reforming of petroleum."

The literature provided does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does offer some insights into their properties and applications:

Bimetallic catalysts have found widespread use, particularly in the petroleum industry. Their key advantages over single-metal catalysts include improved selectivity and better activity maintenance. The book discusses research on various bimetallic systems, including ruthenium-copper, osmium-copper, and platinum-iridium catalysts.

Advanced physical characterization techniques like EXAFS have been crucial in understanding the structure of supported bimetallic clusters. This structural information is important for linking fundamental research to practical applications.

The major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts is in petroleum reforming, highlighting their practical importance. However, the literature does not provide specific details on how these catalysts bridge the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts.

提供的文献不包含足够的信息来全面回答关于双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的演变或它们在弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的作用的问题。但是，它确实提供了一些关于它们的性质和应用的见解：

双金属催化剂已广泛应用，特别是在石油工业中。与单金属催化剂相比，它们的主要优势包括提高选择性和更好的活性维持。该书讨论了对各种双金属系统的研究，包括钌-铜、锇-铜和铂-铱催化剂。

先进的物理表征技术，如EXAFS，对于理解负载型双金属簇的结构至关重要。这种结构信息对于将基础研究与实际应用联系起来非常重要。

双金属催化剂的主要工业应用是石油重整，突显了它们的实际重要性。然而，文献并未提供关于这些催化剂如何弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间差距的具体细节。
