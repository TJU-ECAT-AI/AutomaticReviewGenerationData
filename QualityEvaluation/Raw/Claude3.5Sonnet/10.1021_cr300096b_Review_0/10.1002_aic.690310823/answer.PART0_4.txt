[1] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."

[2] "Special emphasis is placed on a description of how physical probes such as EXAFS can successfully be used to obtain structural information on well dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters."

[3] "The final chapter of the book concentrates on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for reforming of petroleum."

The literature provides limited information on the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction. However, it highlights their importance in the petroleum industry, offering improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. The text mentions the use of physical probes like EXAFS to study the structure of supported bimetallic clusters, which contributes to bridging the "materials gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant catalysts. The major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts in petroleum reforming is also noted. The document does not specifically address the "pressure gap" or provide detailed information on the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts. Overall, the text suggests that bimetallic catalysts play a significant role in both fundamental research and practical applications, particularly in the petroleum industry.

这篇文献对双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的演变提供了有限的信息。然而，它强调了双金属催化剂在石油工业中的重要性，与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂提供了更好的选择性和活性维持能力。文中提到使用EXAFS等物理探针来研究负载型双金属簇的结构，这有助于缩小模型表面和工业相关催化剂之间的"材料差距"。还提到了双金属催化剂在石油重整中的主要工业应用。文档没有具体讨论"压力差距"或提供关于双金属催化剂独特电子和化学性质的详细信息。总的来说，文本表明双金属催化剂在基础研究和实际应用中都发挥着重要作用，特别是在石油工业中。
