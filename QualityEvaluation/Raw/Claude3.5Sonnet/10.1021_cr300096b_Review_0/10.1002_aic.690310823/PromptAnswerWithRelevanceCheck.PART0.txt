The literature provides some insights into the evolution and properties of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, though it does not directly address the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" concepts. 

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved to find wide applications, particularly in the petroleum industry. Their development has been driven by their potential for improved selectivity and better activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. The book reviewed in this literature covers 20 years of research at Exxon's catalysis laboratories, indicating significant advancements in understanding and developing bimetallic catalysts over this period.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts in several ways:

1. Improved performance: Their enhanced selectivity and activity maintenance make them more relevant to industrial applications than single-metal model catalysts.

2. Structural characterization: Advanced physical probes like EXAFS have been used to obtain structural information on well-dispersed, supported bimetallic clusters (e.g., ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper). This helps in understanding the structure of industrially relevant supported catalysts.

3. Industrial relevance: The book discusses the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts in petroleum reforming, demonstrating their practical importance.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap", the focus on both fundamental research (e.g., structural characterization) and practical applications (e.g., petroleum reforming) suggests that bimetallic catalysts play a role in connecting model studies with industrial reality.

这篇文献为我们提供了一些关于双金属催化剂在多相催化中的演变和性质的见解，尽管它并没有直接讨论"材料差距"和"压力差距"的概念。

双金属催化剂已经发展到在各个领域都有广泛应用，尤其是在石油工业中。它们的发展主要是由于相比单金属催化剂，它们具有提高选择性和更好的活性维持能力的潜力。这篇文献中评论的书籍涵盖了埃克森美孚催化实验室20年的研究，表明在这段时期内，对双金属催化剂的理解和开发取得了重大进展。

双金属催化剂的独特性质有助于桥接模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 性能提升：它们增强的选择性和活性维持能力使其比单金属模型催化剂更贴近工业应用。

2. 结构表征：先进的物理探针如EXAFS已被用于获取高度分散的、负载型双金属簇（如钌-铜和锇-铜）的结构信息。这有助于理解工业相关的负载型催化剂的结构。

3. 工业相关性：该书讨论了双金属催化剂在石油重整中的主要工业应用，展示了它们的实际重要性。

虽然这篇文献没有明确讨论如何桥接"材料差距"和"压力差距"，但它同时关注基础研究（如结构表征）和实际应用（如石油重整），这表明双金属催化剂在连接模型研究和工业现实之间扮演着重要角色。

The literature provides limited information on the full evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction. However, it highlights some key aspects of their development and application:

Bimetallic catalysts have gained widespread use, particularly in the petroleum industry, due to their improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. This suggests an evolution towards more efficient and longer-lasting catalytic systems.

The research on bimetallic catalysts has progressed from studying basic selectivity aspects to more advanced characterization techniques. For example, the use of physical probes like EXAFS to obtain structural information on supported bimetallic clusters represents a significant advancement in understanding these catalysts at the molecular level.

The comparison between highly dispersed, supported catalysts and single crystal studies indicates efforts to bridge the "materials gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant catalysts. This approach combines fundamental surface science with practical catalyst development.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the "pressure gap," the focus on both fundamental research (e.g., single crystal studies) and industrial applications (e.g., petroleum reforming) suggests attempts to connect laboratory conditions with real-world applications.

The book's coverage of various bimetallic systems (ruthenium-copper, osmium-copper, platinum-iridium) demonstrates the diversity of combinations explored to exploit unique electronic and chemical properties of different metal pairs.

Overall, the evolution of bimetallic catalysts appears to involve a progression from basic concepts to more sophisticated understanding and characterization, with a constant focus on improving industrial applications, particularly in petroleum reforming.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They have gained widespread use, particularly in the petroleum industry, due to their potential for improved selectivity and better activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. The development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts has been largely driven by research conducted at industrial laboratories, such as Exxon's, over the past decades.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Structural characterization: Advanced physical probes like EXAFS have enabled researchers to obtain structural information on well-dispersed, supported bimetallic clusters (e.g., ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper). This helps in understanding the relationship between the catalyst structure and its properties at the atomic level, bridging the gap between model surfaces and real catalysts.

2. Improved performance: The enhanced selectivity and activity maintenance of bimetallic catalysts make them more representative of industrially relevant catalysts, helping to narrow the gap between fundamental research and practical applications.

3. Industrial relevance: The major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts in petroleum reforming demonstrates their practical importance, further connecting fundamental research to real-world applications.

However, it's important to note that the literature provided does not explicitly discuss the "materials gap" or "pressure gap". The answer is based on interpreting the information given about bimetallic catalysts in the context of these concepts in heterogeneous catalysis research.
