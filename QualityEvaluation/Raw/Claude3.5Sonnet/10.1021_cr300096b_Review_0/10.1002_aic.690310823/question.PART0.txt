I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Heterogeneous Reactions: 
Analysis, Examples, and Reactor 
Design 
by L. K. Doraiswamy and M. M. Sharma, John 
Wiley and Sons, 1984, Volume 1: Gas-Solid and 
Solid-Solid Reactions, 
538 pp., 
$66.95; 
Volume 2: 
Fluid-Fluid-Solid Reactions, 374 pp., $59.95. 
These large volumes represent a major 
effort to integrate the theory and industrial 
examples 
of multiphax reaction engineering, 
with emphasis on interactions between mass 
and heat transport and chemical reaction. 
The result is the most comprehensive 
account 
o
f
 this subject, 
a valuable source of important 
results, and a useful entry into the literature. 
The authors deserve credit for attempting to 
unify the subject, but their success 
is limited 
by the state of development of reaction en- 
gineering. 
There are far too few experimental 
results available for in-depth, quantitative 
analyses 
of industrial 
processes; consequently, 
the connections 
between the theoretical and 
experimental results are not very deep or 
satisfying. This work highlights the need for 
more detailed industrial data to allow con- 
solidation of the theoretical progress and 
better guidance in reactor design. 
Some of the newer topics engaging reac- 
tion engineers are introduced in the book 
(e.g.. supported enzymes and metal complex 
catalysts), 
but the authors have not addressed 
molecular concepts; typical of books in re- 
action engineering, this one lacks a chemical 
orientation. The major technological oppor- 
tunities are offered by new chemical struc- 
tures, reaction pathways, and catalysts, not 
by new reactors or manipulation of interac- 
tions of transport and reaction processes; 
perhaps, this book will challenge future au- 
thors to integrate chemical concepts into re- 
action engineering. 
The Doraiswamy and Sharma volumes are 
well produced and fairly priced. They are a 
commendable advanced treatise, recom- 
mended to practicing engineers and as a 
supplementary reference for graduate 
courses in reaction engineering.

Bimetallic Catalvsts: 
Discoveries, Concepts, and 
Applications 
by John 
H. Sinfelt, 
John 
Wiley & Sons, 1983. XI + 
164 pp. 
Bimetallic 
catalysts find wide application, 
especially in the petroleum industry. They 
offer the potential of improved selectivity 
and better activity maintenance as 
compared 
to catalysts containing only one metal. John 
H. Sinfelts 
book, the first in a series 
of Exxon 
Monographs, gives a detailed and exciting 
account of research on bimetallic catalysts 
from the vantage point of one of the leading 
pioneers in this area. Although most of the 
work discussed in the book has already ap- 
peared in the open scientific literature, the 
book brings twenty years of research at 
Exxons catalysis 
laboratories 
into context and 
makes it easier for the reader to appreciate 
the development of concepts and ideas con- 
cerning bimetallic catalysts. 
The book starts with a review of selectivity 
aspects of bimetallic catalysts comprised of 
metals from Group VIII and Ib in hydrocar- 
bon reactions such as hydrogenolysis, hy- 
drogenation, dehydrogenation, and isomer- 
ization. Then, the question of bimetallic 
cluster formation in systems containing im- 
miscible metal components is addressed. 
Results on highly dispersed, supported 
ruthenium-copper catalysts are compared 
with ruthenium-copper single crystal studies 
carried out by G. Ertls group in Munich. 
Special 
emphasis is placed on a description of 
how physical probes such as EXAFS can 
successfully 
be used to obtain structural in- 
formation on well dispersed, supported 
ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper 
clusters. Subsequently, work on platinum- 
iridium is reviewed bringing Mossbauer 
spectroscopy 
into the picture as an additional 
physical characterization tool for bimetallic 
cluster catalysts. 
The final 
chapter of the book 
concentrates on the major industrial appli- 
cation of bimetallic catalysts for reforming 
o
f
 petroleum. 
This book 
makes interesting reading not 
only for the scientist or engineer directly in- 
volved in bimetallic catalysis, but Serves as 
an 
example of the scientific research endeavor 
in general, demonstrating how new concepts 
and insights are developed on the basis of 
carefully posed questions followed by key 
experiments, ultimately culminating in im- 
portant industrial applications.

<questions>


How have bimetallic catalysts evolved in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, and how do their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in both fundamental research and practical applications?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
