The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis or how they bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. The text focuses on the fundamental nature of metal-metal bonds in bimetallic surfaces and their electronic properties, rather than discussing the historical development or practical applications of bimetallic catalysts in industry. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided document.

This literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". The text focuses on fundamental studies of bimetallic surfaces, particularly the nature of metal-metal bonds and charge transfer between different metal elements. It does not discuss commercial catalysts or industrial applications.

However, the fundamental insights about bimetallic bonding and electronic properties described in the paper are relevant to understanding catalyst behavior. The authors show that forming heteronuclear metal-metal bonds on surfaces can significantly alter the electronic and chemical properties of both metals involved. This electronic perturbation affects the reactivity and bonding of adsorbates like CO. Such effects likely play an important role in the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic systems.

The paper demonstrates that the nature of metal-metal bonding on surfaces can be quite different from that in bulk alloys. This highlights the importance of studying model surface systems to understand catalysis. At the same time, the dramatic effects of coordination and geometry on bonding properties point to challenges in extrapolating results from idealized surfaces to real catalysts with complex structures.

While not explicitly discussing industrial catalysts, this fundamental work on well-defined bimetallic surfaces provides insights that can help bridge the gap between model studies and practical catalytic systems. Understanding electronic interactions between different metals is crucial for rationally designing bimetallic catalysts with tailored properties.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中的演变,或它们在弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的作用。文本主要集中在双金属表面的基础研究,特别是金属-金属键的性质以及不同金属元素之间的电荷转移。它没有讨论商业催化剂或工业应用。

然而,文中描述的关于双金属键合和电子性质的基本见解与理解催化剂行为有关。作者表明,在表面形成异核金属-金属键可以显著改变所涉及的两种金属的电子和化学性质。这种电子扰动影响了像CO这样的吸附质的反应性和键合。这些效应可能在双金属系统的独特催化性质中起着重要作用。

该论文证明,表面上的金属-金属键合性质可能与体相合金中的性质有很大不同。这突出了研究模型表面系统对理解催化的重要性。同时,配位和几何对键合性质的巨大影响表明,将理想化表面的结果外推到具有复杂结构的实际催化剂存在挑战。

虽然没有明确讨论工业催化剂,但这项关于明确定义的双金属表面的基础工作提供了可以帮助弥合模型研究和实际催化系统之间差距的见解。理解不同金属之间的电子相互作用对于理性设计具有量身定制性质的双金属催化剂至关重要。

This article does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis or their role in bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. The text focuses on fundamental studies of bimetallic surfaces, particularly the nature of metal-metal bonds and charge transfer between different metal elements. It does not discuss commercial catalysts or industrial applications.

However, the fundamental insights about bimetallic bonding and electronic properties described in the article are relevant to understanding bimetallic catalysts. The text shows that forming a surface metal-metal bond can significantly alter the electronic and chemical properties of both metals involved. This electronic perturbation can dramatically change catalytic behavior. The article demonstrates that charge transfer between metals depends on their relative valence band occupancies in ways that differ from bulk alloys. These electronic effects likely play important roles in the unique catalytic properties of bimetallic systems.

While not directly addressing the "materials gap" or "pressure gap", this fundamental research on well-defined bimetallic surfaces provides atomic-level insights into metal-metal interactions that are relevant for understanding more complex supported catalysts. The correlations found between electronic structure, bond strength, and chemical reactivity (e.g. for CO adsorption) offer principles that could guide the design of bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.
