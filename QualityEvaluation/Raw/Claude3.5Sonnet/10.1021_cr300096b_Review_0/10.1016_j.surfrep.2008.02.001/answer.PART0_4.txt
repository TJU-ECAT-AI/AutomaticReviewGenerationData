[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts"

[2] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis and electrocatalysis applications."

[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."

[4] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."

[5] "The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Their unique electronic and chemical properties, which differ from monometallic catalysts, have led to their widespread use in various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications.

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have studied bimetallic surfaces by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on single crystal substrates. This approach has enabled the use of various chemical, electronic, and physical probes to understand their properties. However, to fully bridge the materials gap, more systematic studies are needed on polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles to better represent industrially relevant supported catalysts.

Regarding the pressure gap, ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that the surface termination of bimetallic structures depends on the environment. However, to bridge this gap, further research is required to investigate the stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions. Specifically, studies are needed to determine how segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as during hydrogenation or reforming reactions.

By addressing these gaps, researchers aim to better understand the relationship between model surfaces studied in fundamental research and the behavior of bimetallic catalysts in practical industrial applications.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业化应用于烃类重整以来,在多相催化领域发展显著。它们独特的电子和化学性质与单金属催化剂不同,导致它们在各种催化和电催化应用中得到广泛使用。

为了弥合材料差距,研究人员通过在单晶基底上沉积亚单层到单层覆盖度的外加金属来研究双金属表面。这种方法能够使用各种化学、电子和物理探针来理解它们的性质。然而,为了完全弥合材料差距,还需要在多晶基底和双金属纳米粒子上进行更系统的研究,以更好地代表工业相关的负载型催化剂。

关于压力差距,超高真空(UHV)研究表明,双金属结构的表面终止取决于环境。然而,要弥合这个差距,需要进一步研究表面和亚表面双金属结构在反应条件下的稳定性。具体来说,需要研究在非UHV条件下,如在加氢或重整反应过程中,偏析和扩散是如何发生的。

通过解决这些差距,研究人员旨在更好地理解基础研究中所研究的模型表面与双金属催化剂在实际工业应用中的行为之间的关系。
