[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts"

[2] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis and electrocatalysis applications."

[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."

[4] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."

[5] "The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts led to widespread use in various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications. 

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have utilized model bimetallic surfaces created by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetals on single crystal substrates. This has enabled the use of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes to study their properties. However, to fully bridge the materials gap, more systematic studies are needed on equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and nanoparticles.

To address the pressure gap, the stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures needs further investigation under realistic reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum studies have shown how surface termination depends on the environment, more research is required to understand segregation and diffusion processes under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical catalytic applications.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces contribute significantly to bridging these gaps. By modifying electronic structures and binding energies, bimetallic systems enable tuning of catalytic properties in ways not possible with single metals. This allows researchers to correlate fundamental surface science studies with the behavior of industrial catalysts. However, challenges remain in fully translating insights from model surfaces to complex supported catalysts under reaction conditions.

自20世纪60年代商业化应用于碳氢化合物重整以来,双金属催化剂已经发展了很长时间。与单金属催化剂相比,它们独特的反应活性使其在各种催化和电催化应用中得到广泛使用。

为了弥合材料差距,研究人员利用在单晶衬底上沉积亚单层到单层覆盖度的添加金属来制备模型双金属表面。这使得可以使用广泛的化学、电子和物理探针来研究其性质。然而,要完全弥合材料差距,还需要在多晶衬底和纳米颗粒上对等效双金属结构进行更系统的研究。

为了解决压力差距问题,需要在实际反应条件下进一步研究表面和亚表面双金属结构的稳定性。虽然超高真空研究已经表明了表面终端如何依赖于环境,但还需要更多研究来了解在实际催化应用相关的非超高真空条件下的偏析和扩散过程。

双金属表面独特的电子和化学性质对弥合这些差距做出了重大贡献。通过修改电子结构和结合能,双金属系统能够以单金属无法实现的方式调节催化性质。这使研究人员能够将基础表面科学研究与工业催化剂的行为联系起来。然而,在将模型表面的见解完全转化为反应条件下复杂的负载催化剂方面仍然存在挑战。

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially, they gained interest for hydrocarbon reforming due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in several ways:

1. Novel properties: Bimetallic surfaces often exhibit properties not present in either parent metal, providing new opportunities for catalysis.

2. Model systems: Monolayer bimetallic surfaces (MBS) serve as well-defined model systems for studying fundamental properties and reactions.

3. Electronic structure modification: The formation of bimetallic surfaces modifies the electronic structure, often quantified by changes in the d-band center, which correlates with adsorption energies and reactivity.

4. Pressure gap studies: While most studies are conducted in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), there is growing recognition of the need to investigate MBS structures under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap.

5. Environment-dependent behavior: UHV studies have shown that the surface termination of MBS structures depends on the environment (vacuum, hydrogen, oxygen). This highlights the importance of studying these systems under more realistic conditions.

However, challenges remain in bridging these gaps:

1. Need for detailed studies on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions.
2. Investigation of MBS formation and properties on polycrystalline substrates and nanoparticles to bridge the materials gap.
3. Development of more sophisticated electronic structure descriptors beyond the d-band center.
4. Computational studies of activation barriers on bimetallic surfaces to better predict activity and selectivity.

These ongoing efforts in fundamental research contribute to developing more effective and selective bimetallic catalysts for practical applications, gradually bridging the gap between model surfaces and industrial catalysts.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业化以来,在多相催化领域经历了显著的发展。最初,它们因在碳氢化合物重整中表现出与单金属催化剂不同的反应活性而受到关注。随着时间推移,它们的应用已扩展到各种催化和电催化领域。

双金属表面独特的电子和化学性质在多方面有助于弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距":

1. 新颖性质:双金属表面常常表现出单一金属表面所没有的性质,为催化提供了新的机会。

2. 模型系统:单层双金属表面(MBS)作为定义明确的模型系统,用于研究基本性质和反应。

3. 电子结构修饰:双金属表面的形成改变了电子结构,通常通过d带中心的变化来量化,这与吸附能和反应活性相关。

4. 压力差距研究:虽然大多数研究是在超高真空(UHV)条件下进行的,但人们越来越认识到需要在反应条件下研究MBS结构以弥合压力差距。

5. 环境依赖行为:UHV研究表明,MBS结构的表面终止取决于环境(真空、氢气、氧气)。这突出了在更实际条件下研究这些系统的重要性。

然而,在弥合这些差距方面仍然存在挑战:

1. 需要对非UHV条件下的偏析和扩散进行详细研究。
2. 研究多晶基底和纳米粒子上MBS的形成和性质,以弥合材料差距。
3. 开发超越d带中心的更复杂的电子结构描述符。
4. 对双金属表面上的活化能垒进行计算研究,以更好地预测活性和选择性。

这些基础研究的持续努力有助于开发更有效和选择性的双金属催化剂,用于实际应用,逐步缩小模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距。
