[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts"

[2] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis and electrocatalysis applications."

[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."

[4] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."

[5] "The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts led to widespread use in various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications. 

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have utilized model bimetallic surfaces created by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetals on single crystal substrates. This has enabled the use of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes to study their properties. However, to fully bridge the materials gap, more systematic studies are needed on equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and nanoparticles.

To address the pressure gap, the stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures needs further investigation under realistic reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum studies have shown how surface termination depends on the environment, more research is required to understand segregation and diffusion processes under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical catalytic applications.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces contribute significantly to bridging these gaps. By modifying electronic structures and binding energies, bimetallic systems enable tuning of catalytic properties in ways not possible with single metals. This allows researchers to correlate fundamental surface science studies with the behavior of industrial catalysts. However, challenges remain in fully translating insights from model surfaces to complex supported catalysts under reaction conditions.

自20世纪60年代商业化应用于碳氢化合物重整以来,双金属催化剂已经发展了很长时间。与单金属催化剂相比,它们独特的反应活性使其在各种催化和电催化应用中得到广泛使用。

为了弥合材料差距,研究人员利用在单晶衬底上沉积亚单层到单层覆盖度的添加金属来制备模型双金属表面。这使得可以使用广泛的化学、电子和物理探针来研究其性质。然而,要完全弥合材料差距,还需要在多晶衬底和纳米颗粒上对等效双金属结构进行更系统的研究。

为了解决压力差距问题,需要在实际反应条件下进一步研究表面和亚表面双金属结构的稳定性。虽然超高真空研究已经表明了表面终端如何依赖于环境,但还需要更多研究来了解在实际催化应用相关的非超高真空条件下的偏析和扩散过程。

双金属表面独特的电子和化学性质对弥合这些差距做出了重大贡献。通过修改电子结构和结合能,双金属系统能够以单金属无法实现的方式调节催化性质。这使研究人员能够将基础表面科学研究与工业催化剂的行为联系起来。然而,在将模型表面的见解完全转化为反应条件下复杂的负载催化剂方面仍然存在挑战。
