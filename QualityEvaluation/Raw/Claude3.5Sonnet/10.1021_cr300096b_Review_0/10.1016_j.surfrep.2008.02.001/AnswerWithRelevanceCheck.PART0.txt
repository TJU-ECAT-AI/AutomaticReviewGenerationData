          [1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts"

[2] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis and electrocatalysis applications."

[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."

[4] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."

[5] "The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

          Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Initially, they gained interest due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in several ways:

1. Model surfaces: Bimetallic surfaces created by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on single crystal substrates allow for detailed studies using various chemical, electronic, and physical probes. This provides fundamental insights into their properties.

2. Materials gap: To bridge this gap, there is a need for systematic studies on the formation and chemical properties of equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and in nanoparticles. This would help translate findings from model surfaces to more industrially relevant supported catalysts.

3. Pressure gap: The stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures needs investigation under reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that surface termination depends on the environment, more research is needed on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical applications.

These efforts in fundamental research aim to better understand and exploit the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts, ultimately improving their performance in industrial applications. However, challenges remain in fully translating insights from model surfaces to complex supported catalysts under reaction conditions.

          双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业化应用于烃类重整以来经历了显著的发展。最初,它们因与单金属催化剂相比表现出独特的反应活性而受到关注。随着时间推移,它们的应用已扩展到各种催化和电催化领域。

双金属催化剂独特的电子和化学性质在多方面有助于弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距":

1. 模型表面：通过在单晶基底上沉积亚单层到单层的外加金属，可以创建双金属表面，从而进行各种化学、电子和物理探针的详细研究。这为深入了解其性质提供了基础。

2. 材料差距：为了缩小这一差距，需要对多晶基底和纳米颗粒中等效双金属结构的形成和化学性质进行系统研究。这有助于将模型表面的研究成果转化为更具工业相关性的负载型催化剂。

3. 压力差距：需要在反应条件下研究表面和亚表面双金属结构的稳定性。虽然超高真空(UHV)研究表明表面终止取决于环境，但还需要更多关于非UHV条件下分离和扩散的研究，这与实际应用更相关。

这些基础研究努力旨在更好地理解和利用双金属催化剂的独特性质，最终提高其在工业应用中的性能。然而，在将模型表面的见解完全转化为反应条件下复杂的负载催化剂方面仍然存在挑战。
