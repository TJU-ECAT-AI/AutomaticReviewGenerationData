[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts"

[2] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis and electrocatalysis applications."

[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."

[4] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."

[5] "The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. They displayed unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to their widespread use in various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications. 

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have studied bimetallic surfaces by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetals on single crystal substrates. This has allowed for detailed probing of their chemical, electronic and physical properties. However, to fully bridge the materials gap, more systematic studies are needed on polycrystalline substrates and bimetallic nanoparticles that better represent industrial catalysts.

For the pressure gap, most studies have been conducted under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. These have shown that the surface termination of bimetallic structures depends on the environment. To bridge the pressure gap, more detailed studies are required on the stability, segregation and diffusion of bimetallic structures under non-UHV, industrially relevant conditions like hydrogenation or reforming reaction environments.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts, such as modified surface d-band centers and binding energies, contribute significantly to understanding structure-property relationships. However, translating this fundamental knowledge to practical applications still requires addressing the materials and pressure gaps through targeted studies of more realistic catalyst systems under reaction conditions.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业化应用于烃类重整以来经历了显著的发展。与单金属催化剂相比,它们表现出独特的反应活性,导致其在各种催化和电催化应用中被广泛使用。

为了弥合材料差距,研究人员通过在单晶基底上沉积亚单层到单层的添加金属来研究双金属表面。这允许对其化学、电子和物理性质进行详细探测。然而,为了完全弥合材料差距,还需要对多晶基底和双金属纳米颗粒进行更系统的研究,以更好地代表工业催化剂。

对于压力差距,大多数研究都是在超高真空(UHV)条件下进行的。这些研究表明,双金属结构的表面终止取决于环境。为了弥合压力差距,需要对非UHV、工业相关条件下(如氢化或重整反应环境)双金属结构的稳定性、偏析和扩散进行更详细的研究。

双金属催化剂独特的电子和化学性质,如修饰的表面d带中心和结合能,对理解结构-性能关系做出了重大贡献。然而,将这些基础知识转化为实际应用仍然需要通过对更真实的催化剂系统在反应条件下进行有针对性的研究来解决材料和压力差距问题。
