[1] "We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters."

[2] "As the underlying surface affects the Au clusters, so the clusters can conversely be expected to alter the properties of the support surfaces. However, such effects have not yet been studied, despite considerable scientific and technological interest."

[3] "The structure of the Au-modified Pt/C catalyst was examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy."

[4] "To elucidate the origin of the observed stabilization effect of Au clusters, we determined by in situ x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) the oxidation state of Pt as a function of potential for the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C surfaces."

The literature provided does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis or their contribution to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does offer insights into a specific bimetallic catalyst system (Au/Pt) and its unique properties:

1. The study demonstrates a novel approach to stabilizing platinum oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold clusters. This represents an advancement in bimetallic catalyst design for practical applications, particularly in vehicle fuel cells.

2. The research explores the interaction between Au clusters and the Pt support surface, highlighting a previously understudied aspect of bimetallic catalysts. This investigation into the reciprocal effects between the two metals contributes to bridging the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

3. Advanced characterization techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and in situ x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) were employed to study the structure and oxidation state of the Au/Pt catalyst. These methods help in understanding the fundamental properties of bimetallic catalysts at the atomic and electronic levels, which is crucial for bridging the "materials gap".

4. The study provides insights into the unique electronic and chemical properties of the Au/Pt system, particularly how Au clusters affect the oxidation potential of Pt. This understanding of the electronic interactions between the two metals contributes to fundamental research on bimetallic catalysts.

While the document doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of bimetallic catalyst evolution, it illustrates ongoing research efforts to develop and understand complex catalyst systems that may have significant implications for both fundamental studies and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.
