[1] "As the underlying surface affects the Au clusters, so the clusters can conversely be expected to alter the properties of the support surfaces. However, such effects have not yet been studied, despite considerable scientific and technological interest."

[2] "The Au clusters were deposited on a Pt catalyst (carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles) through galvanic displacement by Au of a Cu monolayer on Pt (13)."

[3] "We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters."

[4] "The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt."

[5] "To elucidate the origin of the observed stabilization effect of Au clusters, we determined by in situ x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) the oxidation state of Pt as a function of potential for the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C surfaces."

The literature discusses the evolution of bimetallic catalysts, specifically focusing on Au clusters deposited on Pt catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in fuel cells. This research bridges the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. It demonstrates a novel synthesis method for bimetallic catalysts, using galvanic displacement to deposit Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles.

2. The study investigates the unique electronic and chemical properties of these Au/Pt catalysts, showing that Au clusters stabilize Pt against dissolution during potential cycling without decreasing ORR activity.

3. The research uses advanced characterization techniques like in situ XANES to elucidate the mechanism of stabilization, revealing that Au clusters raise the Pt oxidation potential.

4. The work addresses real-world industrial challenges, such as catalyst stability in fuel cells under stop-and-go driving conditions.

5. It explores the interplay between the Au clusters and the Pt support, demonstrating how the properties of both components are altered in the bimetallic system.

This research contributes to both fundamental understanding and practical applications by studying industrially relevant catalysts under realistic conditions, while also providing insights into the electronic and chemical interactions that govern their behavior.
