The literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or discuss bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide some insights into how bimetallic catalysts, specifically Au-Pt systems, demonstrate unique properties that contribute to improved performance in heterogeneous catalysis.

The discovery of catalytic activity in supported small Au clusters for CO oxidation led to investigations into the effects of oxide supports on this activity. The metal oxide/support interface boundary sites were found to be important for stabilizing oxygen-containing reaction intermediates on Au clusters. This highlights how the combination of two different materials (Au and oxide support) can create unique catalytic properties.

The literature also describes how Au clusters can alter the properties of underlying support surfaces, and vice versa. This mutual influence between the two materials in a bimetallic catalyst system demonstrates how their unique electronic and chemical properties can be harnessed for improved catalytic performance.

A specific example given is the stabilization of Pt oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution by modifying Pt nanoparticles with Au clusters. This bimetallic system shows how combining two metals can address practical challenges in catalyst stability, which is crucial for industrial applications.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, the described research on Au-Pt systems does represent efforts to develop more practical and stable catalysts for real-world applications, thereby contributing to narrowing these gaps in catalysis research and development.

发现负载的小型Au簇对CO氧化具有催化活性，这导致了对氧化物载体对这种活性影响的研究。金属氧化物/载体界面边界位点被发现对稳定Au簇上的含氧反应中间体很重要。这突出了两种不同材料（Au和氧化物载体）的组合如何能创造独特的催化性质。

文献还描述了Au簇如何改变底层载体表面的性质，反之亦然。这种双金属催化剂系统中两种材料之间的相互影响，展示了如何利用它们独特的电子和化学性质来改善催化性能。

给出的一个具体例子是通过用Au簇修饰Pt纳米粒子来稳定Pt氧还原燃料电池电催化剂，防止其溶解。这个双金属系统展示了如何通过结合两种金属来解决催化剂稳定性的实际挑战，这对工业应用至关重要。

虽然文献没有明确讨论弥合模型表面和工业相关负载催化剂之间的差距，但对Au-Pt系统的描述研究确实代表了开发更实用、更稳定的催化剂用于实际应用的努力，从而有助于缩小催化研究和开发中的这些差距。

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it does provide insights into how the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The study demonstrates that modifying platinum nanoparticles with gold clusters can stabilize platinum oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution under potential cycling regimes. This is a significant finding for vehicle applications, where catalyst stability is a major concern.

The research shows that the interaction between gold clusters and the platinum surface alters the properties of the support surface, leading to enhanced stability without compromising catalytic activity. This demonstrates how the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic systems can be leveraged to improve catalyst performance under realistic operating conditions.

The study uses accelerated stability tests that simulate industrial conditions, helping to bridge the "pressure gap" between laboratory experiments and practical applications. By examining the catalyst behavior under oxidizing conditions and potential cycling, the researchers are able to gain insights that are directly relevant to real-world fuel cell operation.

Furthermore, the research suggests that the stabilizing effect of gold clusters on platinum and the lack of inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction, despite partial blockage of platinum sites, may have applications beyond fuel cells. This indicates the potential for bimetallic catalysts to address challenges in other areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

Overall, while the document doesn't provide a historical perspective on bimetallic catalysts, it demonstrates how the unique properties of these systems can be utilized to create more stable and efficient catalysts that better bridge the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.
