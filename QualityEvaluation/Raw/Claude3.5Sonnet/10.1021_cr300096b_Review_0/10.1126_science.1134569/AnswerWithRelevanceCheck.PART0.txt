          [1] "We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters."

[2] "As the underlying surface affects the Au clusters, so the clusters can conversely be expected to alter the properties of the support surfaces. However, such effects have not yet been studied, despite considerable scientific and technological interest."

[3] "After Haruta's discovery (1) of the catalytic activity of supported small Au clusters for CO oxidation, there were several reports on the effects of the oxide supports in facilitating this activity (13)."

[4] "The metal oxide/support interface boundary sites are believed to be important for stabilizing oxygen-containing reaction intermediates on Au clusters (8)."

[5] "The Au clusters were deposited on a Pt catalyst (carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles) through galvanic displacement by Au of a Cu monolayer on Pt (13)."

[6] "We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters."

[7] "The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt."

[8] "To elucidate the origin of the observed stabilization effect of Au clusters, we determined by in situ x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) the oxidation state of Pt as a function of potential for the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C surfaces."

[9] "The mechanism of oxygen adsorption and activation necessary for rapid CO oxidation is controversial and opposite to the observed lack of O2 dissociation on Au single crystals (6)."

[10] "Our studies raise promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and for stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions."

          The literature provides insights into the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly focusing on Au-Pt systems, and how their unique properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts:

1. Historical context: The discovery of catalytic activity in supported small Au clusters for CO oxidation by Haruta sparked interest in the effects of oxide supports on catalytic activity.

2. Unique properties: Bimetallic catalysts demonstrate interactions between metals, where one metal can alter the properties of the other. For example, Au clusters can modify the properties of Pt surfaces, and the metal oxide/support interface is important for stabilizing reaction intermediates.

3. Synthesis methods: The study describes a novel method for creating bimetallic catalysts, using galvanic displacement to deposit Au clusters on carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles.

4. Practical applications: Au-Pt bimetallic catalysts have shown promise in stabilizing Pt oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution during potential cycling, addressing a significant challenge in vehicle applications.

5. Bridging the gaps: These bimetallic catalysts demonstrate unique properties that differ from both single-crystal model surfaces and traditional supported catalysts. The research uses accelerated stability tests and advanced characterization techniques like in situ XANES to study catalysts under conditions more relevant to industrial applications.

6. Ongoing research: The mechanism of oxygen adsorption and activation on Au clusters remains controversial, highlighting the need for continued fundamental research.

7. Future prospects: The research opens up possibilities for synthesizing improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and stabilizing platinum-group metals under oxidizing conditions, demonstrating how fundamental studies contribute to practical applications in catalysis.

While not providing a comprehensive history, the literature illustrates how ongoing research in bimetallic catalysts continues to reveal unique electronic and chemical properties that contribute to both fundamental understanding and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

3. 合成方法：研究描述了一种创建双金属催化剂的新方法，使用电镀置换法将Au簇沉积在碳载Pt纳米颗粒上。

4. 实际应用：Au-Pt双金属催化剂在稳定Pt氧还原燃料电池电催化剂方面表现出潜力，可以防止其在电位循环过程中溶解，解决了车辆应用中的一个重大挑战。

5. 弥合差距：这些双金属催化剂展示了不同于单晶模型表面和传统负载催化剂的独特性质。研究使用加速稳定性测试和先进的表征技术（如原位XANES）来研究更接近工业应用条件下的催化剂。

6. 持续研究：Au簇上氧气吸附和活化的机制仍然存在争议，凸显了继续进行基础研究的必要性。

7. 未来前景：研究为合成改进的氧还原反应（ORR）催化剂和在氧化条件下稳定铂族金属开辟了可能性，展示了基础研究如何为催化领域的实际应用做出贡献。

尽管没有提供全面的历史，但文献说明了双金属催化剂领域的持续研究如何继续揭示独特的电子和化学性质，这些性质对多相催化的基础理解和实际应用都有贡献。
