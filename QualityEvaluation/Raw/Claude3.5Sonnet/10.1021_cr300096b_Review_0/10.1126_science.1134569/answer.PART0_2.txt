[1] "We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters."

[2] "As the underlying surface affects the Au clusters, so the clusters can conversely be expected to alter the properties of the support surfaces. However, such effects have not yet been studied, despite considerable scientific and technological interest."

[3] "The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt."

[4] "This stabilizing effect of Au clusters and lack of ORR inhibition, despite blockage of approximately one-third of the Pt sites on Au/Pt/C by Au, are intriguing phenomena that may have additional applications beyond fuel cells."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. However, it does provide insights into how the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The study demonstrates that modifying platinum nanoparticles with gold clusters can stabilize platinum oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution under potential cycling regimes. This is a significant finding for vehicle applications, where catalyst stability is a major concern.

The research shows that the interaction between gold clusters and the platinum surface alters the properties of the support surface, leading to enhanced stability without compromising catalytic activity. This demonstrates how the unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic systems can be leveraged to improve catalyst performance under realistic operating conditions.

The study uses accelerated stability tests that simulate industrial conditions, helping to bridge the "pressure gap" between laboratory experiments and practical applications. By examining the catalyst behavior under oxidizing conditions and potential cycling, the researchers are able to gain insights that are directly relevant to real-world fuel cell operation.

Furthermore, the research suggests that the stabilizing effect of gold clusters on platinum and the lack of inhibition of the oxygen reduction reaction, despite partial blockage of platinum sites, may have applications beyond fuel cells. This indicates the potential for bimetallic catalysts to address challenges in other areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

Overall, while the document doesn't provide a historical perspective on bimetallic catalysts, it demonstrates how the unique properties of these systems can be utilized to create more stable and efficient catalysts that better bridge the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中的历史演变。然而，它确实提供了关于双金属催化剂的独特性质如何有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关的负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"的见解。

研究表明，用金簇修饰铂纳米颗粒可以稳定铂氧还原燃料电池电催化剂，防止其在电位循环过程中溶解。这对于车辆应用来说是一个重要发现，因为催化剂的稳定性是一个主要问题。

研究显示，金簇与铂表面之间的相互作用改变了支撑表面的性质，导致稳定性增强而不影响催化活性。这证明了如何利用双金属系统的独特电子和化学性质来改善催化剂在实际操作条件下的性能。

该研究使用了模拟工业条件的加速稳定性测试，有助于弥合实验室实验与实际应用之间的"压力差距"。通过研究催化剂在氧化条件和电位循环下的行为，研究人员能够获得与实际燃料电池运行直接相关的见解。

此外，研究表明，金簇对铂的稳定作用以及在部分铂位点被阻塞的情况下氧还原反应没有受到抑制，可能在燃料电池之外还有其他应用。这表明双金属催化剂有潜力解决多相催化其他领域的挑战。

总的来说，虽然该文档没有提供双金属催化剂的历史视角，但它展示了如何利用这些系统的独特性质来创造更稳定、更高效的催化剂，从而更好地弥合模型表面与工业相关的负载催化剂之间的差距。
