[1] "After Haruta's discovery (1) of the catalytic activity of supported small Au clusters for CO oxidation, there were several reports on the effects of the oxide supports in facilitating this activity (13)."

[2] "As the underlying surface affects the Au clusters, so the clusters can conversely be expected to alter the properties of the support surfaces."

[3] "We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters."

[4] "The mechanism of oxygen adsorption and activation necessary for rapid CO oxidation is controversial and opposite to the observed lack of O2 dissociation on Au single crystals (6)."

[5] "Our studies raise promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and for stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions."

The literature does not directly address the full evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. However, it does provide insights into some recent developments and unique properties of bimetallic catalysts, particularly focusing on gold-platinum systems:

1. The discovery of catalytic activity in supported small gold clusters for CO oxidation sparked interest in the effects of oxide supports on this activity.

2. Bimetallic catalysts demonstrate unique interactions between the metals, where one metal can alter the properties of the other. For example, gold clusters can modify the properties of platinum surfaces.

3. Gold-platinum bimetallic catalysts have shown promise in stabilizing platinum oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution during potential cycling, addressing a significant challenge in vehicle applications.

4. The mechanism of oxygen adsorption and activation on gold clusters remains controversial, highlighting the complexity of these systems and the ongoing need for fundamental research.

5. These bimetallic catalysts bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" by demonstrating unique properties that differ from both single-crystal model surfaces and traditional supported catalysts. For instance, the gold clusters on platinum nanoparticles exhibit behavior distinct from bulk gold or single-crystal surfaces.

6. The research on gold-platinum bimetallic catalysts opens up possibilities for synthesizing improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts and stabilizing platinum-group metals under oxidizing conditions, demonstrating the practical applications of these fundamental studies.

While the literature doesn't provide a comprehensive history of bimetallic catalysts, it illustrates how ongoing research in this field continues to reveal unique electronic and chemical properties that contribute to both fundamental understanding and practical applications in catalysis.
