Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Initially, they gained interest due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications, with a particular focus on improving selectivity, activity, and stability [10.1021/cr300096b_0].

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been characterized by several key developments that contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts:

1. Advanced synthesis methods: Researchers have developed techniques such as galvanic displacement to deposit metal clusters on supported nanoparticles, allowing for more precise control over catalyst structure [10.1126/science.1134569].

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of bimetallic catalysts can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering. This allows for precise control over catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

3. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

4. Advanced characterization techniques: The use of surface-sensitive probes such as LEED, AES, LEIS, and UPS in ultra-high vacuum conditions, along with in situ techniques like surface x-ray scattering (SXS), has enabled detailed studies of bimetallic catalyst structures and properties [10.1126/science.1135941].

5. Theoretical modeling: The integration of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling with experimental approaches has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems [10.1038/nchem.626].

6. Bridging the materials gap: Researchers have established correlations between the activity of single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for certain reactions, helping to translate fundamental research to more industrially relevant systems [10.1038/nchem.626].

7. Addressing the pressure gap: Studies now investigate the stability of bimetallic structures under reaction conditions, moving beyond ultra-high vacuum environments to understand catalyst behavior in more realistic settings [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

These advancements have led to significant improvements in catalyst performance. For example, Pt3Ni(111) surfaces have demonstrated 10-fold higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells [10.1126/science.1135941].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly narrowed the gap between fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Looking forward, several promising avenues for future research and development emerge:

1. Rational design of nanocatalysts: The challenge lies in creating nanocatalysts that mimic the properties of highly active model surfaces, such as the Pt3Ni(111) surface [10.1126/science.1135941]. This could lead to a new generation of industrial catalysts with unprecedented activity and selectivity.

2. In situ and operando studies: Further development of advanced characterization techniques that can probe catalyst structures and properties under realistic reaction conditions will be crucial for understanding the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts during catalysis.

3. Machine learning and high-throughput screening: The integration of machine learning algorithms with computational modeling and experimental data could accelerate the discovery and optimization of novel bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

4. Sustainable catalysis: Future research may focus on developing bimetallic catalysts that use earth-abundant elements or reduce the reliance on precious metals, addressing sustainability concerns in industrial catalysis.

5. Multifunctional catalysts: The unique properties of bimetallic systems could be exploited to design catalysts capable of performing multiple reactions in one step, potentially revolutionizing chemical synthesis processes.

6. Bridging multiple gaps: While progress has been made in addressing the materials and pressure gaps, future research could focus on bridging additional gaps, such as the complexity gap between simple model reactions and industrial processes involving multiple components and side reactions.

By continuing to integrate fundamental surface science, advanced characterization techniques, and practical catalyst development, the field of bimetallic catalysis is poised to make significant contributions to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes across various industries.

自20世纪60年代用于碳氢化合物重整的商业应用以来，双金属催化剂在多相催化领域已经发展了很长时间。最初，它们因与单金属催化剂相比具有独特的反应性而受到关注 [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]。随着时间的推移，它们的应用已扩展到各种催化和电催化领域，特别关注提高选择性、活性和稳定性 [10.1021/cr300096b_0]。
