Review of Pt-Based Bimetallic Catalysis: From Model Surfaces to Supported Catalysts

1 Introduction
1.1 Unique Properties of Bimetallic Surfaces and Catalysts
The field of heterogeneous catalysis, specifically catalysis on bimetallic alloys, has seen many advances over the past few decades. Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability. Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts. (1-3) The findings of these unexpected properties of bimetallic catalysts have inspired many extensive investigations on their possible applications. Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalytic (4) and electrocatalytic (5, 6) applications.
To understand the origins of the novel catalytic properties, bimetallic surfaces have also gained a considerable amount of interest for fundamental surface science research, as summarized in several earlier reviews. (7-9) It is now well-known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces. (7, 8, 10-23) The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime. However, it is difficult to know a priori how the electronic and chemical properties of a particular bimetallic surface will be modified relative to the parent metals. For this reason, the study of bimetallic surfaces in the field of catalysis has gained considerable interest. There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of a metal in a bimetallic surface. First, the formation of heteroatom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g., the average metal&ndash;metal bond lengths change, resulting in the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap. (16)
In the past decade there have been significant efforts in density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments on bimetallic surfaces. One of the new findings is that, depending on experimental conditions, the monolayer admetal can interact with the host metal substrate in one of the three structures: occupying the topmost surface sites to produce the surface monolayer, diffusing into the subsurface region to form the subsurface monolayer, and alloying with the surface to produce intermixed bimetallic surfaces. DFT modeling results clearly indicate that the modification on the surface d-band center is significantly different for the three types of bimetallic structures. Surface science results, using several probe molecules, also confirm the different chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces with surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures. In addition, the combination of DFT modeling and experimental results reveal a general correlation between the position of the surface d-band center and the adsorption energy for various bimetallic structures, making it possible to predict bimetallic structures with desirable chemical properties.
1.2 Scope of the Current Review
Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support. The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the “materials gap” between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the “pressure gap” between UHV environment and reaction environment. We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis. We will also use other reactions to point out the challenges in applying fundamental surface science studies to predict stable bimetallic structures for catalysis.
Because of the enormous volumes of work in bimetallic catalysis, in the current review we will focus on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces and catalysts. The reasons for choosing Pt-based bimetallic systems are primarily 2-fold: (i) they are the most well-studied bimetallic surfaces using both DFT calculations and surface science experiments, and (ii) they are among the most commonly used bimetallic catalysts in both catalytic and electrocatalytic applications. In addition, other bimetallic catalysts without Pt also have interesting properties and important applications. In many cases, the benefits of Pt-free bimetallic alloys are similar to those achieved with Pt. These bimetallic combinations also have similarly modified electronic properties that lead to increased activity and selectivity. (24) For example, Au&ndash;Ag catalysts are active for CO oxidation because the synergistic interaction between the two metals improves the catalytic performance. In this case, Au adsorbs CO molecules and the neighboring Ag adsorbs reactive oxygen species. (25) Non-noble metal bimetallic catalysts are also of interest because of the potential savings in material cost. The Ni&ndash;Cu system is one example that has been previously studied for the hydrolysis of NaBH4 to release hydrogen. (26) Although non-Pt-containing systems have important applications, the scope of this review article is limited to Pt-based catalysts to provide a focused and in-depth review of bimetallic catalysis. In section 2 we will utilize one of the most thoroughly studied bimetallic systems, Ni/Pt, to introduce the preparation procedures and common characterization techniques for both bimetallic surfaces and supported catalysts. This will be followed in section 3 by DFT calculations and experimental verification of stable bimetallic structures under different reaction conditions. In section 4 we will summarize the unique properties and general trends of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts for different types of reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation reactions. The review will conclude by pointing out challenges and research opportunities for further advancing bimetallic catalysis.

Bimetallic catalysts have undergone significant evolution in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Initially, they gained interest due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability [10.1021/cr300096b\_0].

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering. This allows for precise control over their catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

3. Model surfaces: Bimetallic surfaces created by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on single crystal substrates allow for detailed studies using various chemical, electronic, and physical probes. This provides fundamental insights into their properties [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

4. Materials gap: To bridge this gap, systematic studies on the formation and chemical properties of equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and in nanoparticles are needed. This helps translate findings from model surfaces to more industrially relevant supported catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

5. Pressure gap: The stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures needs investigation under reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that surface termination depends on the environment, more research is needed on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical applications [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

6. Advanced characterization: Researchers have employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study reactions on bimetallic surfaces. This approach helps identify the surface properties governing reactivity variations and determines how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics [10.1126/science.1135941].

7. Practical applications: Bimetallic catalysts have shown promise in various applications, such as stabilizing Pt oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution during potential cycling, addressing significant challenges in vehicle applications [10.1126/science.1134569].

8. Computational screening: The development of computational frameworks that combine DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling allows for rapid evaluation and screening of complex bimetallic catalysts, bridging fundamental research with practical applications [10.1038/nchem.626].

These advancements have enhanced the ability to design, predict, and understand the behavior of bimetallic catalysts, bringing model studies closer to practical applications and helping to bridge both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis represents a significant advancement in bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications. The unique properties of these catalysts, such as synergistic effects, tunable electronic structures, and enhanced stability, offer promising avenues for developing more efficient and selective catalytic processes.

Looking forward, several key areas of research and development may further advance the field:

1. In situ and operando characterization: Developing more advanced techniques for studying bimetallic catalysts under realistic reaction conditions could provide deeper insights into their behavior and stability during catalytic processes.

2. Nano-engineering: Precise control over the size, shape, and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles could lead to catalysts with optimized performance for specific reactions.

3. Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Integrating these tools with computational modeling and experimental data could accelerate the discovery and optimization of new bimetallic catalyst compositions.

4. Sustainable catalysis: Focusing on developing bimetallic catalysts for green chemistry applications, such as CO2 reduction or hydrogen production, could contribute to addressing global environmental challenges.

5. Multifunctional catalysts: Exploring the potential of bimetallic catalysts in tandem or cascade reactions could lead to more efficient and simplified industrial processes.

By continuing to bridge the materials and pressure gaps, researchers can develop bimetallic catalysts that more closely mimic industrial conditions while maintaining the precision and control of model systems. This integrated approach will likely lead to more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for a wide range of applications in the future.
