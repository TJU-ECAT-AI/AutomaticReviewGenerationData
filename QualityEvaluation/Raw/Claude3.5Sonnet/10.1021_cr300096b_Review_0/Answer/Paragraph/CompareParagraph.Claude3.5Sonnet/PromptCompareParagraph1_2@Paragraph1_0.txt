Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts, they have since expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. This evolution has been characterized by the development of unique electronic and chemical properties that contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts that contribute to bridging these gaps include:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering, allowing for precise control over their catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

3. Enhanced binding properties: Alloy materials possess distinct binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions in bimetallic catalysts modify the bonding between catalyst surfaces and reactants [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

4. Stabilization of transition states: Bimetallic catalysts offer extra stabilization of transition states compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to improved catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

5. Core-shell structures: Core-shell nanoparticles represent an advanced form of bimetallic catalysts, with physical and chemical properties strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

6. Precise surface modification: The introduction of a second metal component or changes in morphology allows for controlled tuning of catalytic properties through precise modification of the catalyst surface [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have developed monolayer bimetallic catalysts, which can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. This allows for more accurate modeling of real catalyst systems and study of more complex and realistic catalyst structures [10.1038/nchem.626].

To address the pressure gap, researchers study bimetallic catalysts in both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments and realistic reaction conditions. For example, studies have demonstrated that the surface-termination of bimetallic structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum or in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations have played a crucial role in bridging these gaps. Researchers have employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study reactions on bimetallic surfaces [10.1126/science.1135941]. These methods provide detailed insights into surface electronic structure, composition, and reactivity under various conditions, contributing to both fundamental research and practical applications.

The integration of theoretical and experimental approaches has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems, especially when surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals [10.1038/nchem.626]. This has led to the development of computational frameworks that combine DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling, allowing for rapid evaluation and screening of complex bimetallic catalysts [10.1038/nchem.626].

These advancements have resulted in significant improvements in catalyst performance. For example, the Pt3Ni(111) surface has demonstrated 10-fold higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells [10.1126/science.1135941].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly contributed to bridging the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis. Looking forward, several promising directions emerge:

1. Rational design of nanocatalysts: The challenge lies in creating nanocatalysts that mimic the properties of highly active model surfaces, such as the Pt3Ni(111) surface. This could lead to revolutionary improvements in catalyst performance for various applications.

2. In situ and operando studies: Further development of advanced characterization techniques that allow for real-time observation of catalyst behavior under realistic operating conditions will be crucial for understanding and optimizing catalyst performance.

3. Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Integrating these tools with existing computational methods could accelerate the discovery and optimization of new bimetallic catalysts, potentially uncovering novel combinations with unexpected properties.

4. Sustainability focus: Future research may emphasize developing bimetallic catalysts that use more abundant, less expensive metals while maintaining or improving catalytic performance, addressing both economic and environmental concerns.

5. Multifunctional catalysts: Exploring bimetallic systems that can catalyze multiple reactions simultaneously or in sequence could lead to more efficient and integrated catalytic processes.

These future directions highlight the potential for bimetallic catalysts to continue revolutionizing the field of heterogeneous catalysis, further narrowing the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Initially, they gained interest due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications, particularly in the petroleum industry [10.1002/aic.690310823].

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts is characterized by:

1. Unique properties: Bimetallic catalysts display novel electronic and chemical properties distinct from their parent metals, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability [10.1021/cr300096b\_0]. These properties are often attributed to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Structural diversity: Bimetallic catalysts have evolved from simple alloys to more complex structures, including core-shell nanoparticles and near-surface alloys (NSAs) [10.1038/nmat1223]. These advanced structures allow for precise tuning of catalytic properties.

3. Advanced characterization techniques: The development of sophisticated surface-sensitive probes and in-situ characterization methods has enabled researchers to gain deeper insights into the structure and behavior of bimetallic catalysts under realistic conditions [10.1126/science.1135941].

4. Theoretical modeling: The integration of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems [10.1038/nchem.626].

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of bimetallic catalysts can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering [10.1039/c1jm12020d]. This allows researchers to create catalysts that more closely mimic industrially relevant systems while maintaining the well-defined nature of model surfaces.

2. Bridging the materials gap: Studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insights, while industrial applications use nanoparticles on high-surface-area supports. Research aims to correlate these two forms, bridging the gap between idealized models and practical supported catalysts [10.1021/cr300096b\_0].

3. Addressing the pressure gap: Researchers study bimetallic catalysts in both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments and realistic reaction conditions to understand their behavior across different pressure regimes [10.1021/cr300096b\_0]. The stability of surface and subsurface structures under reaction conditions is crucial for bridging this gap [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

4. Enhanced performance: Bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. For example, the Pt3Ni(111) surface has shown 90-fold higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts [10.1126/science.1135941].

5. Practical applications: The development of bimetallic catalysts has led to improvements in industrially relevant processes, such as hydrocarbon reforming and fuel cell electrocatalysts [10.1126/science.1134569].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly advanced our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis and brought us closer to bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrially relevant catalysts. However, challenges remain in fully translating insights from model systems to complex supported catalysts under reaction conditions.

Future research efforts may focus on:

1. Development of more sophisticated in-situ and operando characterization techniques to study bimetallic catalysts under realistic reaction conditions.

2. Advanced computational methods that can more accurately predict the behavior of complex bimetallic systems, including the effects of support materials and reaction environments.

3. Novel synthesis methods for creating bimetallic catalysts with precisely controlled structures and compositions at the nanoscale.

4. Exploration of new bimetallic combinations and structures, such as multi-metallic catalysts or catalysts with engineered interfaces between metal and support.

5. Integration of machine learning and high-throughput screening techniques to accelerate the discovery and optimization of bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

These advancements could lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes, with potential applications in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and fine chemical synthesis.
