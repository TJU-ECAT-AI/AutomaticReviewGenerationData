Bimetallic catalysts have emerged as a significant advancement in heterogeneous catalysis, bridging the gap between fundamental research on model surfaces and practical applications in industrial processes. These catalysts, composed of two distinct metal elements, have evolved from simple alloys to sophisticated nanostructures with tunable properties. Their unique characteristics, such as synergistic effects between the two metals and enhanced selectivity, have led to improved catalytic performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been driven by advancements in synthesis techniques, allowing for precise control over composition, structure, and morphology at the nanoscale. This has enabled researchers to tailor catalysts for specific reactions, optimizing activity, selectivity, and stability. Applications of bimetallic catalysts span a wide range of industries, including petrochemicals, fine chemicals, and environmental remediation, where they have demonstrated superior performance in processes such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and reforming reactions. As the field continues to progress, the design of increasingly complex and efficient bimetallic catalysts promises to revolutionize industrial catalysis, offering more sustainable and economically viable solutions to chemical production challenges.
