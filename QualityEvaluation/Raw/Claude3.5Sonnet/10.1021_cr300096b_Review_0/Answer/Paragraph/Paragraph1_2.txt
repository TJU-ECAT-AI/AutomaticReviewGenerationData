Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts, they have since expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. This evolution has been characterized by the development of unique electronic and chemical properties that contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts that contribute to bridging these gaps include:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering, allowing for precise control over their catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

3. Enhanced binding properties: Alloy materials possess distinct binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions in bimetallic catalysts modify the bonding between catalyst surfaces and reactants [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

4. Stabilization of transition states: Bimetallic catalysts offer extra stabilization of transition states compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to improved catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

5. Core-shell structures: Core-shell nanoparticles represent an advanced form of bimetallic catalysts, with physical and chemical properties strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

6. Precise surface modification: The introduction of a second metal component or changes in morphology allows for controlled tuning of catalytic properties through precise modification of the catalyst surface [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have developed monolayer bimetallic catalysts, which can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. This allows for more accurate modeling of real catalyst systems and study of more complex and realistic catalyst structures [10.1038/nchem.626].

To address the pressure gap, researchers study bimetallic catalysts in both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments and realistic reaction conditions. For example, studies have demonstrated that the surface-termination of bimetallic structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum or in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations have played a crucial role in bridging these gaps. Researchers have employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study reactions on bimetallic surfaces [10.1126/science.1135941]. These methods provide detailed insights into surface electronic structure, composition, and reactivity under various conditions, contributing to both fundamental research and practical applications.

The integration of theoretical and experimental approaches has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems, especially when surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals [10.1038/nchem.626]. This has led to the development of computational frameworks that combine DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling, allowing for rapid evaluation and screening of complex bimetallic catalysts [10.1038/nchem.626].

These advancements have resulted in significant improvements in catalyst performance. For example, the Pt3Ni(111) surface has demonstrated 10-fold higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells [10.1126/science.1135941].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly contributed to bridging the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis. Looking forward, several promising directions emerge:

1. Rational design of nanocatalysts: The challenge lies in creating nanocatalysts that mimic the properties of highly active model surfaces, such as the Pt3Ni(111) surface. This could lead to revolutionary improvements in catalyst performance for various applications.

2. In situ and operando studies: Further development of advanced characterization techniques that allow for real-time observation of catalyst behavior under realistic operating conditions will be crucial for understanding and optimizing catalyst performance.

3. Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Integrating these tools with existing computational methods could accelerate the discovery and optimization of new bimetallic catalysts, potentially uncovering novel combinations with unexpected properties.

4. Sustainability focus: Future research may emphasize developing bimetallic catalysts that use more abundant, less expensive metals while maintaining or improving catalytic performance, addressing both economic and environmental concerns.

5. Multifunctional catalysts: Exploring bimetallic systems that can catalyze multiple reactions simultaneously or in sequence could lead to more efficient and integrated catalytic processes.

These future directions highlight the potential for bimetallic catalysts to continue revolutionizing the field of heterogeneous catalysis, further narrowing the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.

自20世纪60年代商业化引入以来，双金属催化剂在多相催化领域已经取得了显著的发展。最初由于其与单金属催化剂相比独特的反应性而在碳氢化合物重整中引起兴趣，现已扩展到各种催化和电催化应用中 [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]。这种演变的特点是发展出独特的电子和化学性质，有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关支持催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"。

双金属催化剂的独特性质有助于弥合这些差距，包括：

1. 协同效应：具有合金和核壳结构的双金属纳米颗粒（NPs）由于两种金属之间的协同效应，表现出比单金属对应物更高的催化活性 [10.1039/c1jm12020d]。

2. 可调性能：合金NPs的化学和物理性质可以通过调整其尺寸、组成和原子排列来精细调节，从而精确控制其催化性能 [10.1039/c1jm12020d]。

3. 增强的结合性质：与单金属催化剂相比，合金材料具有不同的反应物结合性质。双金属催化剂中的强金属-金属相互作用改变了催化剂表面与反应物之间的结合 [10.1039/c1jm12020d]。

4. 过渡态的稳定化：与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂为过渡态提供了额外的稳定性，从而提高了催化性能 [10.1039/c1jm12020d]。

5. 核壳结构：核壳纳米颗粒代表了双金属催化剂的一种高级形式，其物理和化学性质强烈依赖于核心、壳层和界面的结构 [10.1039/c1jm12020d]。

6. 精确的表面修饰：引入第二种金属组分或改变形态可以通过精确修饰催化剂表面来控制调节催化性能 [10.1039/c1jm12020d]。

为了弥合材料差距，研究人员开发了单层双金属催化剂，可以代表分离的合金表面或模拟核壳纳米颗粒。这允许对真实催化剂系统进行更准确的建模，并研究更复杂和真实的催化剂结构 [10.1038/nchem.626]。

先进的表征技术和理论计算在弥合这些差距方面发挥了关键作用。研究人员结合了非原位和原位表面敏感探针以及密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来研究双金属表面上的反应 [10.1126/science.1135941]。这些方法在各种条件下提供了表面电子结构、组成和反应性的详细见解，为基础研究和实际应用做出了贡献。

理论和实验方法的结合对于识别和筛选理想的双金属系统变得至关重要，尤其是当表面性质不是父金属的线性函数时 [10.1038/nchem.626]。这导致了结合DFT计算和微观动力学建模的计算框架的发展，允许对复杂的双金属催化剂进行快速评估和筛选 [10.1038/nchem.626]。

这些进展已经带来了催化剂性能的显著改善。例如，Pt3Ni(111)表面对氧还原反应的活性比Pt(111)高10倍，比聚合物电解质膜燃料电池中使用的最先进的Pt/C催化剂高90倍 [10.1126/science.1135941]。

综合理解与未来展望：双金属催化剂的发展显著地弥合了多相催化中的材料和压力差距。展望未来，几个有前景的方向浮现：

1. 纳米催化剂的理性设计：挑战在于创造能模仿高活性模型表面（如Pt3Ni(111)表面）性质的纳米催化剂。这可能导致各种应用中催化剂性能的革命性改进。

2. 原位和操作中研究：进一步发展允许在真实运行条件下实时观察催化剂行为的先进表征技术，将对理解和优化催化剂性能至关重要。

3. 机器学习和人工智能：将这些工具与现有的计算方法结合，可能加速新双金属催化剂的发现和优化，潜在地发现具有意外性质的新组合。

4. 可持续性重点：未来研究可能强调开发使用更丰富、更便宜的金属的双金属催化剂，同时保持或改善催化性能，解决经济和环境问题。

5. 多功能催化剂：探索能同时或依次催化多个反应的双金属系统，可能导致更高效和集成的催化过程。

这些未来方向突出了双金属催化剂继续革新多相催化领域的潜力，进一步缩小基础研究和工业应用之间的差距。
