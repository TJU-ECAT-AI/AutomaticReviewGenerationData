Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Initially, they gained interest due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications, particularly in the petroleum industry [10.1002/aic.690310823].

The evolution of bimetallic catalysts is characterized by:

1. Unique properties: Bimetallic catalysts display novel electronic and chemical properties distinct from their parent metals, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability [10.1021/cr300096b_0]. These properties are often attributed to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Structural diversity: Bimetallic catalysts have evolved from simple alloys to more complex structures, including core-shell nanoparticles and near-surface alloys (NSAs) [10.1038/nmat1223]. These advanced structures allow for precise tuning of catalytic properties.

3. Advanced characterization techniques: The development of sophisticated surface-sensitive probes and in-situ characterization methods has enabled researchers to gain deeper insights into the structure and behavior of bimetallic catalysts under realistic conditions [10.1126/science.1135941].

4. Theoretical modeling: The integration of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems [10.1038/nchem.626].

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of bimetallic catalysts can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering [10.1039/c1jm12020d]. This allows researchers to create catalysts that more closely mimic industrially relevant systems while maintaining the well-defined nature of model surfaces.

2. Bridging the materials gap: Studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insights, while industrial applications use nanoparticles on high-surface-area supports. Research aims to correlate these two forms, bridging the gap between idealized models and practical supported catalysts [10.1021/cr300096b_0].

3. Addressing the pressure gap: Researchers study bimetallic catalysts in both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments and realistic reaction conditions to understand their behavior across different pressure regimes [10.1021/cr300096b_0]. The stability of surface and subsurface structures under reaction conditions is crucial for bridging this gap [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

4. Enhanced performance: Bimetallic catalysts often demonstrate improved activity, selectivity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts. For example, the Pt3Ni(111) surface has shown 90-fold higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts [10.1126/science.1135941].

5. Practical applications: The development of bimetallic catalysts has led to improvements in industrially relevant processes, such as hydrocarbon reforming and fuel cell electrocatalysts [10.1126/science.1134569].

※※※
Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has significantly advanced our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis and brought us closer to bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrially relevant catalysts. However, challenges remain in fully translating insights from model systems to complex supported catalysts under reaction conditions.

Future research efforts may focus on:

1. Development of more sophisticated in-situ and operando characterization techniques to study bimetallic catalysts under realistic reaction conditions.

2. Advanced computational methods that can more accurately predict the behavior of complex bimetallic systems, including the effects of support materials and reaction environments.

3. Novel synthesis methods for creating bimetallic catalysts with precisely controlled structures and compositions at the nanoscale.

4. Exploration of new bimetallic combinations and structures, such as multi-metallic catalysts or catalysts with engineered interfaces between metal and support.

5. Integration of machine learning and high-throughput screening techniques to accelerate the discovery and optimization of bimetallic catalysts for specific applications.

These advancements could lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable catalytic processes, with potential applications in energy conversion, environmental remediation, and fine chemical synthesis.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have since found wide applications in various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes [10.1021/cr300096b_0]. Their evolution and unique properties have contributed significantly to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts that contribute to bridging these gaps include:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering, allowing for precise control over catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

3. Enhanced binding properties: Alloy materials possess distinct binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions in bimetallic catalysts modify the bonding between catalyst surfaces and reactants [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

4. Stabilization of transition states: Bimetallic catalysts offer extra stabilization of transition states compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to improved catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

5. Core-shell structures: Core-shell nanoparticles represent an advanced form of bimetallic catalysts, with physical and chemical properties strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have developed monolayer bimetallic catalysts, which can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. This allows for more accurate modeling of real catalyst systems and the study of more complex and realistic catalyst structures [10.1038/nchem.626]. Additionally, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are being conducted [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

To address the pressure gap, researchers are investigating the stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that surface termination depends on the environment, more research is needed on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical applications [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations have played a crucial role in bridging these gaps. Researchers have employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to study reactions on bimetallic surfaces [10.1126/science.1135941]. These methods allow for the identification of surface properties governing reactivity variations and determination of how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

The integration of theoretical and experimental approaches has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems, especially when surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals [10.1038/nchem.626]. Advanced computational screening frameworks combining DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling allow for rapid evaluation of complex bimetallic catalysts, further bridging fundamental research with practical applications [10.1038/nchem.626].

These advancements have led to significant improvements in catalyst performance. For example, the Pt3Ni(111) surface has demonstrated 10-fold higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells [10.1126/science.1135941]. The challenge now is to create nanocatalysts that mimic the properties of these highly active model surfaces, further bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has demonstrated their potential to bridge the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis. Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing more sophisticated synthesis methods to create bimetallic nanostructures that closely mimic the properties of highly active model surfaces.

2. Expanding in situ and operando characterization techniques to study bimetallic catalysts under realistic reaction conditions, providing deeper insights into their behavior in industrial settings.

3. Advancing computational models to more accurately predict the properties and performance of complex bimetallic systems, enabling more efficient catalyst design.

4. Exploring new combinations of metals and novel nanostructures to further enhance catalytic performance and stability.

5. Investigating the long-term stability and deactivation mechanisms of bimetallic catalysts under industrial conditions to improve their practical applicability.

These efforts will continue to narrow the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications, potentially leading to breakthroughs in catalyst design for various processes, including energy conversion, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis.

Bimetallic catalysts have undergone significant evolution in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Initially, they gained interest due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability [10.1021/cr300096b_0].

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

This provides fundamental insights into their properties [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

4. Materials gap: To bridge this gap, systematic studies on the formation and chemical properties of equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and in nanoparticles are needed. This helps translate findings from model surfaces to more industrially relevant supported catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

5. Pressure gap: The stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures needs investigation under reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that surface termination depends on the environment, more research is needed on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical applications [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

6. Advanced characterization: Researchers have employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study reactions on bimetallic surfaces. This approach helps identify the surface properties governing reactivity variations and determines how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics [10.1126/science.1135941].

7. Practical applications: Bimetallic catalysts have shown promise in various applications, such as stabilizing Pt oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts against dissolution during potential cycling, addressing significant challenges in vehicle applications [10.1126/science.1134569].

8. Computational screening: The development of computational frameworks that combine DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling allows for rapid evaluation and screening of complex bimetallic catalysts, bridging fundamental research with practical applications [10.1038/nchem.626].

These advancements have enhanced the ability to design, predict, and understand the behavior of bimetallic catalysts, bringing model studies closer to practical applications and helping to bridge both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.
