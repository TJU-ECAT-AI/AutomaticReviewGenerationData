Bimetallic catalysts have undergone significant evolution in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Initially, they gained interest due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001]. Over time, their use has expanded to various catalysis and electrocatalysis applications, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability [10.1021/cr300096b\_0].

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering. This allows for precise control over their catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

3. Enhanced binding properties: Alloy materials possess distinct binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions in bimetallic catalysts modify the bonding between catalyst surfaces and reactants [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

4. Model surfaces: Bimetallic surfaces created by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on single crystal substrates allow for detailed studies using various chemical, electronic, and physical probes. This provides fundamental insights into their properties [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

5. Advanced characterization techniques: Researchers have employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study reactions on bimetallic surfaces. These include LEED, AES, LEIS, UPS, and SXS, which help in understanding surface electronic structure, composition, and reactivity under various conditions [10.1126/science.1135941].

6. Bridging the materials gap: Systematic studies on the formation and chemical properties of equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and in nanoparticles help translate findings from model surfaces to more industrially relevant supported catalysts [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

7. Addressing the pressure gap: The stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures is investigated under reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that surface termination depends on the environment, more research is needed on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical applications [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

8. Computational screening: The development of computational frameworks that combine DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling allows for rapid evaluation and screening of complex bimetallic catalysts, bridging fundamental research with practical applications [10.1038/nchem.626].

These advancements have significantly improved our ability to design, predict, and understand the behavior of bimetallic catalysts, bringing model studies closer to practical applications and helping to bridge both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has demonstrated their potential to bridge the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Looking forward, several key areas emerge for future research and development:

1. Advanced synthesis methods: Further development of techniques like atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication could lead to more precise control over bimetallic catalyst structures, potentially allowing for the creation of catalysts that mimic highly active model surfaces like Pt3Ni(111) [10.1126/science.1135941].

2. In situ and operando characterization: Continued advancement in characterization techniques that can probe catalyst structure and behavior under realistic reaction conditions will be crucial for fully understanding and optimizing bimetallic catalysts [10.1126/science.1135941].

3. Machine learning and artificial intelligence: Integration of these technologies with existing computational methods could accelerate the discovery and optimization of new bimetallic catalysts, potentially uncovering unexpected combinations with superior properties.

4. Multifunctional catalysts: Exploring bimetallic catalysts that can perform multiple reactions in tandem could lead to more efficient and economical industrial processes.

5. Sustainability focus: Developing bimetallic catalysts that use earth-abundant metals or reduce the use of precious metals while maintaining or improving performance could address resource scarcity concerns.

6. Novel applications: Expanding the use of bimetallic catalysts into emerging fields such as artificial photosynthesis, CO2 reduction, and hydrogen production could contribute to addressing global energy and environmental challenges.

By continuing to bridge the materials and pressure gaps, future research in bimetallic catalysts has the potential to revolutionize industrial catalytic processes, leading to more efficient, sustainable, and economical chemical production.
