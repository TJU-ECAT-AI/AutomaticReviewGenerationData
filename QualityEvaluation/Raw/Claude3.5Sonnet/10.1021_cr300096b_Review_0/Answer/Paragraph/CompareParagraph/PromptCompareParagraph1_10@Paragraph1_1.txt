Bimetallic catalysts have emerged as a significant advancement in heterogeneous catalysis, bridging the gap between fundamental research on model surfaces and practical applications in industrial processes. These catalysts, composed of two distinct metal elements, have evolved from simple alloys to sophisticated nanostructures with tunable properties. Their unique characteristics, such as synergistic effects between the two metals and enhanced selectivity, have led to improved catalytic performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has been driven by advancements in synthesis techniques, allowing for precise control over composition, structure, and morphology at the nanoscale. This has enabled researchers to tailor catalysts for specific reactions, optimizing activity, selectivity, and stability. Applications of bimetallic catalysts span a wide range of industries, including petrochemicals, fine chemicals, and environmental remediation, where they have demonstrated superior performance in processes such as hydrogenation, oxidation, and reforming reactions. As the field continues to progress, the design of increasingly complex and efficient bimetallic catalysts promises to revolutionize industrial catalysis, offering more sustainable and economically viable solutions to chemical production challenges.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming due to their unique reactivities compared to monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have since found wide applications in various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes [10.1021/cr300096b\_0]. Their evolution and unique properties have contributed significantly to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts that contribute to bridging these gaps include:

1. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with alloyed and core-shell structures exhibit higher catalytic activities compared to their monometallic counterparts due to synergistic effects between the two metals [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

2. Tunable properties: The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be finely tuned by adjusting their size, composition, and atomic ordering, allowing for precise control over catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

3. Enhanced binding properties: Alloy materials possess distinct binding properties with reactants compared to monometallic catalysts. The strong metal-metal interactions in bimetallic catalysts modify the bonding between catalyst surfaces and reactants [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

4. Stabilization of transition states: Bimetallic catalysts offer extra stabilization of transition states compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to improved catalytic performance [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

5. Core-shell structures: Core-shell nanoparticles represent an advanced form of bimetallic catalysts, with physical and chemical properties strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface [10.1039/c1jm12020d].

To bridge the materials gap, researchers have developed monolayer bimetallic catalysts, which can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. This allows for more accurate modeling of real catalyst systems and the study of more complex and realistic catalyst structures [10.1038/nchem.626]. Additionally, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent bimetallic structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are being conducted [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

To address the pressure gap, researchers are investigating the stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that surface termination depends on the environment, more research is needed on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical applications [10.1016/j.surfrep.2008.02.001].

Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations have played a crucial role in bridging these gaps. Researchers have employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to study reactions on bimetallic surfaces [10.1126/science.1135941]. These methods allow for the identification of surface properties governing reactivity variations and determination of how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

The integration of theoretical and experimental approaches has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems, especially when surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals [10.1038/nchem.626]. Advanced computational screening frameworks combining DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling allow for rapid evaluation of complex bimetallic catalysts, further bridging fundamental research with practical applications [10.1038/nchem.626].

These advancements have led to significant improvements in catalyst performance. For example, the Pt3Ni(111) surface has demonstrated 10-fold higher activity for oxygen reduction reactions compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells [10.1126/science.1135941]. The challenge now is to create nanocatalysts that mimic the properties of these highly active model surfaces, further bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of bimetallic catalysts has demonstrated their potential to bridge the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis. Future research directions may focus on:

1. Developing more sophisticated synthesis methods to create bimetallic nanostructures that closely mimic the properties of highly active model surfaces.

2. Expanding in situ and operando characterization techniques to study bimetallic catalysts under realistic reaction conditions, providing deeper insights into their behavior in industrial settings.

3. Advancing computational models to more accurately predict the properties and performance of complex bimetallic systems, enabling more efficient catalyst design.

4. Exploring new combinations of metals and novel nanostructures to further enhance catalytic performance and stability.

5. Investigating the long-term stability and deactivation mechanisms of bimetallic catalysts under industrial conditions to improve their practical applicability.

These efforts will continue to narrow the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications, potentially leading to breakthroughs in catalyst design for various processes, including energy conversion, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis.
