          Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. They have gained widespread use, particularly in the petroleum industry, due to their potential for improved selectivity and better activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. The development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts has been largely driven by research conducted at industrial laboratories, such as Exxon's, over the past decades.

          The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

          1. Structural characterization: Advanced physical probes like EXAFS have enabled researchers to obtain structural information on well-dispersed, supported bimetallic clusters (e.g., ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper). This helps in understanding the relationship between the catalyst structure and its properties at the atomic level, bridging the gap between model surfaces and real catalysts.

          2. Improved performance: The enhanced selectivity and activity maintenance of bimetallic catalysts make them more representative of industrially relevant catalysts, helping to narrow the gap between fundamental research and practical applications.

          3. Industrial relevance: The major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts in petroleum reforming demonstrates their practical importance, further connecting fundamental research to real-world applications.

          4. Comparison studies: Research has compared highly dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper catalysts with ruthenium-copper single crystal studies, indicating efforts to bridge the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant catalysts.

          The evolution of bimetallic catalysts appears to involve a progression from basic concepts to more sophisticated understanding and characterization, with a constant focus on improving industrial applications, particularly in petroleum reforming. However, it's important to note that the literature provided does not explicitly discuss the "materials gap" or "pressure gap". The answer is based on interpreting the information given about bimetallic catalysts in the context of these concepts in heterogeneous catalysis research.

          双金属催化剂自商业化引入以来，在多相催化领域已经发生了显著的演变。由于它们在选择性和活性维持方面相比单金属催化剂具有潜在的改进，它们已在石油工业等领域得到广泛应用。关于双金属催化剂的概念和思想的发展，在过去几十年里主要由埃克森等工业实验室的研究推动。

          双金属催化剂独特的电子和化学性质有助于缩小模型表面与工业相关的负载型催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"，具体表现在以下几个方面：

          1. 结构表征：先进的物理探针技术（如EXAFS）使研究人员能够获得高度分散的、负载型双金属簇（如钌-铜和锇-铜）的结构信息。这有助于在原子水平上理解催化剂结构与其性能之间的关系，从而缩小模型表面和实际催化剂之间的差距。

          2. 性能改善：双金属催化剂提高的选择性和活性维持能力使其更能代表工业相关的催化剂，有助于缩小基础研究和实际应用之间的差距。

          3. 工业相关性：双金属催化剂在石油重整中的主要工业应用展示了它们的实际重要性，进一步将基础研究与现实世界的应用联系起来。

          4. 对比研究：研究对高度分散的、负载型钌-铜催化剂与钌-铜单晶研究进行了比较，表明努力缩小模型表面与工业相关催化剂之间的差距。

          双金属催化剂的演变似乎涉及从基本概念到更复杂的理解和表征的进展，始终关注改进工业应用，特别是在石油重整方面。然而，需要注意的是，所提供的文献并未明确讨论"材料差距"或"压力差距"。这个回答是基于在多相催化研究的这些概念背景下对双金属催化剂信息的解释。
