          [1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "Well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces were formed and characterized with UHV methods for surface preparation and surface analysis. These surfaces were transferred into the electrochemical environment without airborne contamination, and the stability of the UHV-prepared surface was determined with a combination of in situ surface-sensitive probes with electrochemical methods so that activity relationships could be obtained in real time."

[4] "We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC."

[5] "Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface."

[6] "The results of the preparation and characterization of Pt3Ni(hkl) alloy surfaces in UHV are summarized in Fig. 1. The surface-sensitive techniques that were used included low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS)"

[7] "We next determined the stability of a surface after transfer from UHV into the electrochemical environment. Surface x-ray scattering (SXS) was used to characterize both the potential range of stability as well as the near-surface composition of the alloy in situ."

          While the literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, it provides valuable insights into how researchers are using advanced techniques to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The researchers have moved beyond trial-and-error approaches to study well-characterized cathode materials, allowing them to attribute catalytic mechanisms to specific surface properties at the atomic and molecular level. They employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study oxygen reduction reactions on Pt3Ni single-crystal surfaces. This approach helps identify the surface properties governing reactivity variations and determines how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

The study utilized various surface-sensitive techniques in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, including LEED, AES, LEIS, and UPS, to characterize the Pt3Ni alloy surfaces. Additionally, they used surface x-ray scattering (SXS) to examine surface stability and composition after transferring from UHV to electrochemical environments.

These advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations allow researchers to bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and more complex, industrially relevant catalysts. By providing detailed insights into surface electronic structure, composition, and reactivity under various conditions, this approach contributes to both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

The research has led to significant advancements in catalyst performance, such as the Pt3Ni(111) surface demonstrating 10-fold higher activity for ORR compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The challenge now is to create nanocatalysts that mimic the properties of these highly active model surfaces, further bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.

          虽然文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂在多相催化中自商业化引入以来的历史演变，但它提供了研究人员如何使用先进技术来弥合模型表面与工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"的宝贵见解。

研究人员已经超越了试错方法，转而研究表征良好的阴极材料，使他们能够将催化机理归因于表面在原子和分子水平上的特定性质。他们结合使用非原位和原位表面敏感探针以及密度泛函理论(DFT)计算来研究Pt3Ni单晶表面上的氧还原反应。这种方法有助于识别控制反应性变化的表面性质，并确定表面结构、偏析和金属间键合如何影响反应动力学。

该研究在超高真空(UHV)条件下使用了各种表面敏感技术，包括LEED、AES、LEIS和UPS，来表征Pt3Ni合金表面。此外，他们使用表面X射线散射(SXS)来检查从UHV转移到电化学环境后的表面稳定性和组成。

这些先进的表征技术和理论计算使研究人员能够弥合理想化模型表面与更复杂的工业相关催化剂之间的差距。通过在各种条件下提供表面电子结构、组成和反应性的详细见解，这种方法为多相催化的基础研究和实际应用做出了贡献。

研究已经导致催化剂性能的显著提高，例如Pt3Ni(111)表面对ORR的活性比Pt(111)高10倍，比用于聚合物电解质膜燃料电池（PEMFCs）的最先进Pt/C催化剂高90倍。现在的挑战是创造模仿这些高活性模型表面性质的纳米催化剂，进一步弥合基础研究与工业应用之间的差距。
