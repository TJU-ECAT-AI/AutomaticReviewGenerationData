          [1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."

[2] "It is now well-known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."

[3] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."

[4] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."

[5] "We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis."

[6] "Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."

          Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. Their evolution is characterized by:

1. Unique properties: Bimetallic catalysts display novel electronic and chemical properties distinct from their parent metals, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability.

2. Bridging the materials gap: Studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insights, while industrial applications use nanoparticles on high-surface-area supports. Research aims to correlate these two forms, bridging the gap between idealized models and practical supported catalysts.

3. Addressing the pressure gap: Researchers study bimetallic catalysts in both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments and realistic reaction conditions to understand their behavior across different pressure regimes.

4. Expanding applications: Initially used for hydrocarbon reforming, bimetallic catalysts have since found applications in various catalytic and electrocatalytic processes.

5. Fundamental understanding: The study of bimetallic surfaces has provided insights into phenomena like the ligand effect and strain effect, which modify the electronic structure and chemical properties of the metals.

6. Practical demonstrations: Successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis.

These advancements contribute to narrowing the gap between fundamental research on model surfaces and the practical applications of supported catalysts in industrial settings, advancing both our theoretical understanding and the development of more efficient catalytic processes.

3. 解决压力差距：研究人员在超高真空（UHV）环境和实际反应条件下研究双金属催化剂，以了解它们在不同压力范围内的行为。

4. 扩展应用：最初用于碳氢化合物重整，双金属催化剂后来在各种催化和电催化过程中找到了应用。

5. 基础理解：对双金属表面的研究提供了对诸如配体效应和应变效应等现象的洞察，这些效应修改了金属的电子结构和化学性质。

6. 实际示范：成功的例子，如氢化反应，证明了可以弥合模型表面和实际催化之间的材料和压力差距。

这些进展有助于缩小模型表面基础研究与工业环境中负载催化剂实际应用之间的差距，推进了我们的理论理解和更高效催化过程的开发。
