[1] "Rather than use a trial-and-error or combinatorial approach, we have examined selected cathode materials with well-characterized surfaces so that the mechanism of action can be attributed to a specific property (at the atomic and molecular level) of the surface under study."

[2] "We have used a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the ORR on Pt3Ni(hkl) single-crystal surfaces, identify which surface properties govern the variations in reactivity of PtNi catalysts, and determine how surface structures, surface segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect the ORR kinetics."

[3] "Well-characterized PtNi single-crystal electrode surfaces were formed and characterized with UHV methods for surface preparation and surface analysis. These surfaces were transferred into the electrochemical environment without airborne contamination, and the stability of the UHV-prepared surface was determined with a combination of in situ surface-sensitive probes with electrochemical methods so that activity relationships could be obtained in real time."

[4] "We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC."

[5] "Considering that the Pt3Ni(111)-skin surface exhibits the highest catalytic activity that has ever been detected, the challenge would be to create a nanocatalyst with electronic and morphological properties that mimic the Pt3Ni(111) surface."

[6] "The results of the preparation and characterization of Pt3Ni(hkl) alloy surfaces in UHV are summarized in Fig. 1. The surface-sensitive techniques that were used included low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS)"

[7] "We next determined the stability of a surface after transfer from UHV into the electrochemical environment. Surface x-ray scattering (SXS) was used to characterize both the potential range of stability as well as the near-surface composition of the alloy in situ."

[1] "Near-surface alloys (NSAs) are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk"

          [2] "NSAs, in particular, have shown promise for catalyst design3,7,8, and single-crystal investigations have demonstrated some of their remarkable properties in a limited number of cases."

          [3] "To develop new NSAs for such processes, we use periodic, self-consistent density functional theory calculations that have shown considerable predictive power for catalysis20."

          [4] "We find, however, that selected NSAs offer an exciting exception to this rule by simultaneously allowing weak H binding and low H2 dissociation barriers."

          [5] "Many NSAs, however, have BEHs in this range, generating a quasi-continuous spectrum of binding energies."

          [6] "Near-surface alloys, however, escape from that rule by offering the exciting combination of weak hydrogen binding and easy H2 activation."

          [7] "Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and in nanoparticle fabrication technologies for metals suggest that practical nanofabrication strategies for metals may not be far off"

          [8] "Real NSAs may, nonetheless, differ in certain ways from our idealized NSA models. In some cases, a portion of the solute in a subsurface alloy may segregate more deeply into the host."

[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."

          [2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."

          [3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts find wide application, especially in the petroleum industry. They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."

          [2] "The book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."

          [3] "Special emphasis is placed on a description of how physical probes such as EXAFS can successfully be used to obtain structural information on well dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters."

          [4] "The final chapter of the book concentrates on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for reforming of petroleum."

          [5] "Results on highly dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper catalysts are compared with ruthenium-copper single crystal studies carried out by G. Ertls group in Munich."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed reactivities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts"

[2] "Currently bimetallic catalysts are widely utilized in many catalysis and electrocatalysis applications."

[3] "Bimetallic surfaces, produced by depositing submonolayer to monolayer coverages of admetal on a single crystal substrate, have allowed the utilization of a wide range of chemical, electronic and physical probes."

[4] "In order to bridge the materials gap, systematic studies of the formation and chemical properties of equivalent MBS structures on polycrystalline substrates and in bimetallic nanoparticles are needed."

[5] "The stability of the surface and subsurface MBS structures needs to be investigated under reaction conditions to bridge the pressure gap. The UHV studies have clearly demonstrated that the surface-termination of the MBS structures depends on the environment, such as in vacuum, and in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and oxygen. However, detailed studies are needed to determine whether and how the segregation and diffusion occur under non-UHV conditions, such as in the environment and hydrogenation or reforming reactions."

[1] "We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters."

[2] "As the underlying surface affects the Au clusters, so the clusters can conversely be expected to alter the properties of the support surfaces. However, such effects have not yet been studied, despite considerable scientific and technological interest."

[3] "After Haruta's discovery (1) of the catalytic activity of supported small Au clusters for CO oxidation, there were several reports on the effects of the oxide supports in facilitating this activity (13)."

[4] "The metal oxide/support interface boundary sites are believed to be important for stabilizing oxygen-containing reaction intermediates on Au clusters (8)."

[5] "The Au clusters were deposited on a Pt catalyst (carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles) through galvanic displacement by Au of a Cu monolayer on Pt (13)."

[6] "We found that the Pt nanoparticles retain their ORR activity crucial for fuel-cell catalysts after the deposition of Au clusters."

[7] "The stabilizing effect of Au clusters on Pt was determined in an accelerated stability test by continuously applying linear potential sweeps from 0.6 to 1.1 V, which caused surface oxidation/reduction cycles of Pt."

[8] "To elucidate the origin of the observed stabilization effect of Au clusters, we determined by in situ x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) the oxidation state of Pt as a function of potential for the Au/Pt/C and Pt/C surfaces."

[9] "The mechanism of oxygen adsorption and activation necessary for rapid CO oxidation is controversial and opposite to the observed lack of O2 dissociation on Au single crystals (6)."

[10] "Our studies raise promising possibilities for synthesizing improved ORR Pt-based catalysts and for stabilizing Pt and other Pt-group metals under oxidizing conditions."

[1] "Bimetallic NPs with alloyed and coreshell structures have higher activities than monometallic counterparts in catalysis due to the synergistic effects between the two metals."

[2] "The chemical and physical properties of alloy NPs can be well tuned by varying the size, composition and atomic ordering. Generally speaking, alloy materials have distinct binding properties with reactants in contrast to those for monometallic metal catalysts."

[3] "The strong metalmetal interactions tune the bonding between the catalyst surfaces and the reactants, where the extra stabilization of the transition state on the alloy catalysts in comparison to the corresponding interaction on the monometallic catalyst surface is an additional benefit."

[4] "Coreshell NPs are in the frontier of advanced materials chemistry among the various bimetallic NPs and are of great importance and interest owing to their physical and chemical properties that are strongly dependent on the structure of the core, shell, and interface, and also quite different from those of monometallic counterparts and alloys."

[5] "The properties of the catalyst surfaces are closely correlated with the catalytic activities, the precise modification of the catalyst surface by introducing another component or changing the morphology could facilitate the controlled tuning of the catalytic properties."

[6] "First principles studies have indicated the synergistic effect on the performance of heterometallic nanocatalysts is subject to surface electronic states, which are greatly altered by the change of catalysts for geometric parameters, particularly related to local strain and effective atomic coordination number at the surface."

[7] "The synergistic catalytic effect over heterometallic NPs based on the reports mentioned in this article could be tentatively ascribed to the following main aspects. 1) Improved activity results from microstructure changes of nanocatalyst upon introducing another metal species. 2) In many cases, electronic interaction among the different components along with geometric effects leads to appropriate modification of electronic structure, which benefits the catalytic activity enhancement."

[1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

          [2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."

          [3] "Because the activity is highly dependent on the location of the Ni atoms, the stability of the surface is very important. Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate."

          [4] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation."

          [5] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

          [6] "The CoMo bimetallic catalyst for the synthesis reaction was predicted through the concept of Periodic Table interpolation, in which the binding energy of a mixed metal (alloyed) surface is taken as a linear combination of the binding energies of the parent metals."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."

[2] "It is now well-known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."

[3] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."

[4] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."

[5] "We will utilize successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, to demonstrate the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis."

[6] "Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."
