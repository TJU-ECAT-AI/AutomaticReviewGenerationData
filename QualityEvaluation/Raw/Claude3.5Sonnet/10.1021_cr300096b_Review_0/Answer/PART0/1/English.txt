While the literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction, it provides valuable insights into how researchers are using advanced techniques to bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

The researchers have moved beyond trial-and-error approaches to study well-characterized cathode materials, allowing them to attribute catalytic mechanisms to specific surface properties at the atomic and molecular level. They employed a combination of ex situ and in situ surface-sensitive probes along with DFT calculations to study oxygen reduction reactions on Pt3Ni single-crystal surfaces. This approach helps identify the surface properties governing reactivity variations and determines how surface structures, segregation, and inter-metallic bonding affect reaction kinetics.

The study utilized various surface-sensitive techniques in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, including LEED, AES, LEIS, and UPS, to characterize the Pt3Ni alloy surfaces. Additionally, they used surface x-ray scattering (SXS) to examine surface stability and composition after transferring from UHV to electrochemical environments.

These advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations allow researchers to bridge the gap between idealized model surfaces and more complex, industrially relevant catalysts. By providing detailed insights into surface electronic structure, composition, and reactivity under various conditions, this approach contributes to both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

The research has led to significant advancements in catalyst performance, such as the Pt3Ni(111) surface demonstrating 10-fold higher activity for ORR compared to Pt(111) and 90-fold higher activity than state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The challenge now is to create nanocatalysts that mimic the properties of these highly active model surfaces, further bridging the gap between fundamental research and industrial applications.

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction. However, it focuses on near-surface alloys (NSAs) as a promising new class of bimetallic catalysts with unique electronic and chemical properties that could contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts.

          NSAs are defined as alloys where a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk. These materials have shown promise for catalyst design, with single-crystal studies demonstrating remarkable properties in some cases.

          The unique properties of NSAs that contribute to bridging these gaps include:

          1. Tunable binding energies: NSAs can generate a quasi-continuous spectrum of hydrogen binding energies, allowing for fine-tuning of catalytic properties.

          2. Improved reaction kinetics: Some NSAs offer a combination of weak hydrogen binding and low H2 dissociation barriers, which is not typically observed in pure metals.

          3. Potential for practical synthesis: Recent innovations in atomic layer deposition and nanoparticle fabrication suggest that practical methods for synthesizing NSAs may soon be available.

          4. Predictive power: Density functional theory calculations are used to develop new NSAs, bridging fundamental research with potential practical applications.

          These properties allow NSAs to potentially operate under conditions more relevant to industrial processes while maintaining the well-defined nature of model catalyst surfaces. This could help researchers better understand catalyst behavior under realistic conditions and design improved catalysts for practical applications.

          However, it's noted that real NSAs may differ from idealized models, as some solute metals may segregate more deeply into the host material.

The provided literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or how they specifically bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it offers insights into the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts:

          Bimetallic catalysts, consisting of monolayer coverages of one metal on another, exhibit chemical behavior significantly different from their individual metallic components. These systems show altered chemisorption and catalytic properties, which are sometimes linked to changes in their structural and electronic properties. 

          While the text doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, it implies that studying these bimetallic systems can provide valuable insights into the special properties of certain bimetallic catalysts. This suggests that research on these model surfaces could contribute to understanding more complex, industrially relevant catalysts.

          The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts over time, their commercial introduction, or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in heterogeneous catalysis research and applications.

This would help translate findings from model surfaces to more industrially relevant supported catalysts.

3. Pressure gap: The stability of surface and subsurface bimetallic structures needs investigation under reaction conditions. While ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies have shown that surface termination depends on the environment, more research is needed on segregation and diffusion under non-UHV conditions relevant to practical applications.

These efforts in fundamental research aim to better understand and exploit the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts, ultimately improving their performance in industrial applications. However, challenges remain in fully translating insights from model surfaces to complex supported catalysts under reaction conditions.
