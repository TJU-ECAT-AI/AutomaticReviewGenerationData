Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming, they have since demonstrated unique electronic and chemical properties not present in their parent metals. These novel properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. They offer enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts, making them more applicable to real-world conditions.

2. The study of bimetallic surfaces in fundamental research has provided insights into the ligand effect and strain effect, which modify the electronic structure and chemical properties of the metals.

3. Researchers are using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments to understand the different structures and properties of bimetallic surfaces, which can help predict desirable chemical properties for practical applications.

4. The review aims to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for various catalytic reactions, demonstrating the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps through examples such as hydrogenation reactions.

These advancements in understanding and applying bimetallic catalysts have significantly contributed to narrowing the gap between fundamental research on model surfaces and the practical applications of supported catalysts in industrial settings.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业引入以来，在多相催化领域发展显著。最初因碳氢化合物重整而受到关注，它们后来展现出了父体金属所不具备的独特电子和化学性质。这些新颖的性质有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 与单金属催化剂相比，它们提供了更高的选择性、活性和稳定性，使其更适用于实际条件。

2. 在基础研究中对双金属表面的研究提供了对配体效应和应变效应的深入了解，这些效应修改了金属的电子结构和化学性质。

3. 研究人员正在使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和超高真空（UHV）实验来理解双金属表面的不同结构和性质，这有助于预测实际应用中所需的化学性质。

4. 该综述旨在为各种催化反应提供模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性，通过氢化反应等例子展示了弥合材料和压力差距的可行性。

这些在理解和应用双金属催化剂方面的进展，显著地缩小了模型表面基础研究与工业环境中负载催化剂实际应用之间的差距。
