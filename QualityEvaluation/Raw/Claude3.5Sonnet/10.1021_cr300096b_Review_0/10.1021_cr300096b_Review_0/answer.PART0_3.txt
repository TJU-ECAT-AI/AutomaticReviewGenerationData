[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."

[3] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming, they have since expanded to various catalytic and electrocatalytic applications due to their unique properties. These catalysts often exhibit electronic and chemical characteristics distinct from their parent metals, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. They provide a link between fundamental surface science research and practical applications by displaying novel properties not present in either parent metal.

2. Their distinct electronic and chemical properties allow researchers to study correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for various reaction types.

3. Successful examples, such as hydrogenation reactions, demonstrate the feasibility of bridging these gaps between model surfaces and real-world catalysis.

4. The study of bimetallic surfaces in both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments and reaction conditions helps researchers understand how these catalysts behave under different pressures, addressing the pressure gap.

By offering a platform to study both fundamental properties and practical applications, bimetallic catalysts serve as a crucial link in advancing our understanding of heterogeneous catalysis across different scales and conditions.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业化引入以来，在多相催化领域发展显著。最初因在碳氢化合物重整中的应用而受到关注，之后由于其独特性质，已扩展到各种催化和电催化应用。这些催化剂通常表现出与其母体金属不同的电子和化学特性，提供了更高的选择性、活性和稳定性。

双金属催化剂的独特性质在以下几个方面有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"：

1. 它们通过展示单一母体金属不具备的新颖性质，为基础表面科学研究和实际应用之间提供了联系。

2. 其独特的电子和化学性质使研究人员能够研究各种反应类型中模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性。

3. 成功的例子，如氢化反应，证明了可以弥合模型表面和实际催化之间的差距。

4. 在超高真空（UHV）环境和反应条件下研究双金属表面，有助于研究人员了解这些催化剂在不同压力下的行为，从而解决压力差距问题。

通过提供研究基础性质和实际应用的平台，双金属催化剂在推进我们对不同尺度和条件下多相催化的理解方面起着至关重要的作用。
