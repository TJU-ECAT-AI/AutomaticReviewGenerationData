[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."

[2] "It is now well-known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."

[3] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."

[4] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming, they have since been recognized for their unique properties that differ from monometallic catalysts. These catalysts often exhibit novel electronic and chemical properties not present in either of their parent metals.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. They provide a link between fundamental research on model surfaces and practical applications on supported catalysts.

2. Bimetallic surfaces studied in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions offer insights into the novel catalytic properties that can be applied to real-world catalysis.

3. The study of bimetallic nanoparticles on high-surface-area supports helps translate findings from model surfaces to industrially relevant catalysts.

4. Research on bimetallic catalysts aims to correlate results from model surfaces to supported catalysts across various reaction types, helping to bridge both the materials and pressure gaps.

By studying these catalysts in both fundamental and applied contexts, researchers can better understand how the unique properties observed in idealized conditions translate to practical, industrial applications. This approach helps to narrow the divide between model systems and real-world catalysis, advancing both our fundamental understanding and the development of more efficient catalytic processes.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业引入以来，在多相催化领域发展显著。最初因碳氢化合物重整而受到关注，现在已被认识到具有与单金属催化剂不同的独特性质。这些催化剂经常表现出其父体金属所没有的新颖电子和化学性质。

双金属催化剂的独特性质有助于缩小模型表面与工业相关支持催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它们为模型表面的基础研究和支持催化剂的实际应用之间提供了联系。

2. 在超高真空（UHV）条件下研究的双金属表面为实际催化过程中的新颖催化性质提供了见解。

3. 对高比表面积载体上双金属纳米颗粒的研究有助于将模型表面的发现转化为工业相关催化剂。

4. 双金属催化剂的研究旨在将模型表面的结果与各种反应类型的支持催化剂相关联，有助于缩小材料和压力差距。

通过在基础和应用背景下研究这些催化剂，研究人员可以更好地理解理想条件下观察到的独特性质如何转化为实际的工业应用。这种方法有助于缩小模型系统和实际催化过程之间的差距，推进我们的基础认知和更高效催化过程的开发。
