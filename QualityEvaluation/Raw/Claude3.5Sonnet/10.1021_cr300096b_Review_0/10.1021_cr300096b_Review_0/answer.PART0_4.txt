[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts, which often show electronic and chemical properties that are distinct from those of their parent metals, offer the opportunity to obtain new catalysts with enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability."

[3] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."

[4] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly since their commercial introduction in the 1960s for hydrocarbon reforming. They have gained importance due to their unique electronic and chemical properties that differ from their parent metals, offering enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. They provide a link between fundamental research on model surfaces and practical applications on supported catalysts.

2. They allow researchers to study the correlation between the structure and properties of bimetallic surfaces in controlled environments (like UHV) and their behavior in real-world reaction conditions.

3. The study of bimetallic catalysts helps in understanding how the active metal behaves when present as nanoparticles on high-surface-area supports, which is closer to industrial catalysts.

4. By comparing the properties and behavior of model bimetallic surfaces with supported bimetallic catalysts, researchers can develop more accurate predictions and design better catalysts for practical applications.

These aspects collectively contribute to advancing both fundamental research and practical applications in heterogeneous catalysis, helping to bridge the gap between idealized model systems and real-world catalytic processes.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代用于碳氢化合物重整的商业应用以来，已经发展了很长时间。由于它们独特的电子和化学性质与其母体金属不同，提供了增强选择性、活性和稳定性的新型催化剂，因此变得越来越重要。

双金属催化剂的独特性质有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"，主要体现在以下几个方面：

1. 它们为模型表面的基础研究和负载催化剂的实际应用之间提供了联系。

2. 它们使研究人员能够研究受控环境（如超高真空）中双金属表面的结构和性质与实际反应条件下的行为之间的相关性。

3. 对双金属催化剂的研究有助于理解活性金属以纳米颗粒形式存在于高比表面积载体上时的行为，这更接近于工业催化剂。

4. 通过比较模型双金属表面与负载双金属催化剂的性质和行为，研究人员可以开发出更准确的预测，并为实际应用设计更好的催化剂。

这些方面共同推动了多相催化领域的基础研究和实际应用的进展，有助于弥合理想化模型系统与现实世界催化过程之间的差距。
