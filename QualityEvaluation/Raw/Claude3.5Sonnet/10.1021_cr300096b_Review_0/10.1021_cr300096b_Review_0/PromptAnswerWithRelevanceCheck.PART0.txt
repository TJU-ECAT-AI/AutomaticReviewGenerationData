Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming, they have since demonstrated unique electronic and chemical properties not present in their parent metals. These novel properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. They offer enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability compared to monometallic catalysts, making them more applicable to real-world conditions.

2. The study of bimetallic surfaces in fundamental research has provided insights into the ligand effect and strain effect, which modify the electronic structure and chemical properties of the metals.

3. Researchers are using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) experiments to understand the different structures and properties of bimetallic surfaces, which can help predict desirable chemical properties for practical applications.

4. The review aims to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for various catalytic reactions, demonstrating the feasibility of bridging the materials and pressure gaps through examples such as hydrogenation reactions.

These advancements in understanding and applying bimetallic catalysts have significantly contributed to narrowing the gap between fundamental research on model surfaces and the practical applications of supported catalysts in industrial settings.

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming, they have since demonstrated unique electronic and chemical properties not present in their parent metals. These novel properties have led to enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability in various catalytic applications.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Fundamental research: Studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide insights into the novel catalytic properties, which can then be applied to understand the behavior of supported catalysts.

2. Practical applications: In industrial settings, the active metal in supported catalysts exists as nanoparticles on high-surface-area supports, which differs from model surfaces. Understanding the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts helps in translating fundamental research findings to practical applications.

3. Bridging the gaps: Research efforts focus on providing correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for various types of catalytic reactions. This approach aims to bridge both the materials gap (between model surfaces and supported catalysts) and the pressure gap (between ultra-high vacuum environments used in research and actual reaction environments).

By studying these correlations and understanding the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts, researchers can better predict and design catalysts with desirable properties for specific industrial applications, effectively bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical use.
