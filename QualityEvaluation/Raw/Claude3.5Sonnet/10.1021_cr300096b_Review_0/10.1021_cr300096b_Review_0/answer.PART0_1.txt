[1] "Bimetallic catalysts started to gain considerable commercial interest in the 1960s for their use in hydrocarbon reforming because they displayed activities unlike those of the monometallic catalysts."

[2] "It is now well-known that bimetallic surfaces often show novel properties that are not present on either of the parent metal surfaces."

[3] "Although studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide fundamental insight into the novel catalytic properties, in an industrially relevant supported catalyst the active metal will be present in the form of nanoparticles on a high-surface-area support."

[4] "The primary objective of the current review is to provide correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for several types of catalytic reactions. In particular, we will attempt to bridge the materials gap between model surfaces and supported catalysts and the pressure gap between UHV environment and reaction environment."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction in the 1960s. Initially gaining interest for hydrocarbon reforming, they have since demonstrated unique electronic and chemical properties not present in their parent metals. These novel properties have led to enhanced selectivity, activity, and stability in various catalytic applications.

The unique properties of bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Fundamental research: Studies on model bimetallic surfaces provide insights into the novel catalytic properties, which can then be applied to understand the behavior of supported catalysts.

2. Practical applications: In industrial settings, the active metal in supported catalysts exists as nanoparticles on high-surface-area supports, which differs from model surfaces. Understanding the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts helps in translating fundamental research findings to practical applications.

3. Bridging the gaps: Research efforts focus on providing correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts for various types of catalytic reactions. This approach aims to bridge both the materials gap (between model surfaces and supported catalysts) and the pressure gap (between ultra-high vacuum environments used in research and actual reaction environments).

By studying these correlations and understanding the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts, researchers can better predict and design catalysts with desirable properties for specific industrial applications, effectively bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical use.

双金属催化剂自20世纪60年代商业引入以来，在多相催化领域发展显著。最初因其在碳氢化合物重整中的应用而受到关注，此后它们展现出了在其父体金属中不存在的独特电子和化学性质。这些新颖的性质导致了各种催化应用中选择性、活性和稳定性的提高。

双金属催化剂的独特性质通过以下几种方式有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"：

1. 基础研究：对模型双金属表面的研究提供了对新型催化性质的洞察，这些洞察可以用于理解负载催化剂的行为。

2. 实际应用：在工业环境中，负载催化剂中的活性金属以纳米颗粒形式存在于高比表面积的载体上，这与模型表面不同。理解模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性有助于将基础研究成果转化为实际应用。

3. 弥合差距：研究努力集中于为各种类型的催化反应提供模型表面和负载催化剂之间的相关性。这种方法旨在弥合材料差距（模型表面和负载催化剂之间）和压力差距（研究中使用的超高真空环境和实际反应环境之间）。

通过研究这些相关性并理解双金属催化剂的独特性质，研究人员可以更好地预测和设计具有特定工业应用所需性质的催化剂，有效地弥合了基础研究和实际应用之间的差距。
