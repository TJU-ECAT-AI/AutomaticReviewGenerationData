[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."

[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."

[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or how they specifically bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide some relevant information about bimetallic catalysts:

Bimetallic catalysts, consisting of monolayer coverages of one metal on another, exhibit chemical behavior significantly different from their individual metallic components. These systems show alterations in chemisorption and catalytic properties, which are sometimes linked to changes in their structural and electronic properties. The literature suggests that these unique properties of bimetallic catalysts are of special interest in catalysis research.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss bridging gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, the focus on monolayer systems and their distinct properties implies that such studies could contribute to understanding more complex, industrially relevant catalysts. However, the literature does not provide specific information on how these bimetallic systems relate to practical applications or fundamental research challenges in heterogeneous catalysis.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的演变，或它们如何具体地弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"。然而，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂的相关信息：

双金属催化剂，由一种金属在另一种金属表面上的单层覆盖物组成，表现出与其各自金属组分显著不同的化学行为。这些系统在化学吸附和催化性质上显示出变化，有时这些变化与其结构和电子性质的改变有关。文献表明，双金属催化剂的这些独特性质在催化研究中具有特殊意义。

虽然文本没有明确讨论如何弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，但对单层系统及其独特性质的关注暗示这些研究可能有助于理解更复杂的、与工业相关的催化剂。然而，该文献并未提供关于这些双金属系统如何与实际应用或多相催化基础研究挑战相关的具体信息。
