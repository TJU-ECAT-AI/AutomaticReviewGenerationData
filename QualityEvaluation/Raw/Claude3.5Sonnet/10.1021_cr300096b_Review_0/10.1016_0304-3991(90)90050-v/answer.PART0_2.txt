[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."

[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."

[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The provided literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or discuss the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in detail. However, it does offer some insights into the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts.

The document highlights that monolayer coverages of one metal on another exhibit dramatically different chemical behavior compared to the individual metallic components. These bimetallic systems show altered chemisorption and catalytic properties, which are sometimes linked to changes in their structural and electronic properties. 

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, it implies that studying these bimetallic systems can provide valuable insights into the special properties of certain bimetallic catalysts. This suggests that research on these model surfaces could contribute to understanding more complex, industrially relevant catalysts.

However, the document does not provide specific information about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts over time, their commercial introduction, or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in heterogeneous catalysis research and applications.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的演变，也没有详细讨论"材料差距"和"压力差距"。然而，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂独特性质的见解。

文档强调，一种金属在另一种金属表面上的单层覆盖层展现出与单个金属组分截然不同的化学行为。这些双金属系统显示出改变的化学吸附和催化性质，有时这些变化与其结构和电子性质的改变相关联。

虽然文献没有明确讨论如何弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，但它暗示研究这些双金属系统可以为某些双金属催化剂的特殊性质提供有价值的见解。这表明，对这些模型表面的研究可能有助于理解更复杂的、与工业相关的催化剂。

然而，该文档并未提供关于双金属催化剂随时间演变、商业引入或在多相催化研究和应用中弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的具体信息。
