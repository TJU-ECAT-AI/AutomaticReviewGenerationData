[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."

[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."

[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or how they specifically bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide some insights into the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts:

Bimetallic catalysts, formed by monolayer coverages of one metal on another, exhibit chemical behavior significantly different from their individual metallic components. These catalysts show altered chemisorption and catalytic properties, which in some cases are linked to changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system. The literature suggests that these special properties are relevant to certain bimetallic catalysts, implying potential applications in both fundamental research and practical industrial contexts.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss bridging gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, the unique properties of bimetallic systems could potentially contribute to this area of research. However, more specific information would be needed to fully answer the question about their evolution and role in addressing the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in heterogeneous catalysis.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的演变，也没有具体说明它们如何弥合模型表面与工业相关负载催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"。然而，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂独特性质的见解：

由一种金属在另一种金属表面上形成的单层覆盖物构成的双金属催化剂，其化学行为与各自的金属组分显著不同。这些催化剂表现出改变的化学吸附和催化性质，在某些情况下，这些变化与双金属系统的结构和电子性质的改变有关。文献暗示这些特殊性质与某些双金属催化剂相关，这意味着它们在基础研究和实际工业应用中都有潜在的应用。

虽然文本没有明确讨论弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，但双金属系统的独特性质可能会对这一研究领域有所贡献。然而，要全面回答关于它们在解决多相催化中的"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的演变和作用的问题，还需要更具体的信息。

The provided literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or discuss the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in detail. However, it does offer some insights into the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts.

The document highlights that monolayer coverages of one metal on another exhibit dramatically different chemical behavior compared to the individual metallic components. These bimetallic systems show altered chemisorption and catalytic properties, which are sometimes linked to changes in their structural and electronic properties. 

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, it implies that studying these bimetallic systems can provide valuable insights into the special properties of certain bimetallic catalysts. This suggests that research on these model surfaces could contribute to understanding more complex, industrially relevant catalysts.

However, the document does not provide specific information about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts over time, their commercial introduction, or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in heterogeneous catalysis research and applications.
