[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."

[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."

[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or how they bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does offer some insights into the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts:

Bimetallic catalysts, consisting of monolayer coverages of one metal on another, exhibit dramatically different chemical behavior compared to their individual metallic components. These catalysts show altered chemisorption and catalytic properties, which are related to changes in their structural and electronic properties. The literature suggests that these special properties of bimetallic catalysts are being studied and reviewed, indicating ongoing research in this field.

While the text doesn't directly address the "materials gap" or "pressure gap", the focus on monolayer coverages and their unique properties suggests that these systems may serve as intermediates between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, potentially contributing to bridging these gaps in catalysis research.

The literature does not provide information on the commercial introduction or long-term evolution of bimetallic catalysts, nor does it discuss specific practical applications or fundamental research approaches beyond mentioning representative studies.

该文献并未全面回答关于双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的演变，或它们如何桥接"材料差距"和"压力差距"的问题。然而，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂独特特性的见解：

双金属催化剂，由一种金属在另一种金属表面上的单层覆盖物组成，展现出与其各自金属组分截然不同的化学行为。这些催化剂表现出改变的化学吸附和催化性质，这些性质与其结构和电子性质的变化相关。文献表明，这些双金属催化剂的特殊性质正在被研究和评述，表明该领域正在进行持续的研究。

虽然文本没有直接提及"材料差距"或"压力差距"，但对单层覆盖物及其独特性质的关注表明，这些系统可能作为模型表面和工业相关支撑催化剂之间的中间体，潜在地有助于桥接催化研究中的这些差距。

文献没有提供关于双金属催化剂商业引入或长期演变的信息，也没有讨论具体的实际应用或基础研究方法，除了提到代表性研究外。
