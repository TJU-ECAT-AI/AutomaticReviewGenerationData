          [1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."

          [2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."

          [3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

          The provided literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or how they specifically bridge the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it offers insights into the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts:

          Bimetallic catalysts, consisting of monolayer coverages of one metal on another, exhibit chemical behavior significantly different from their individual metallic components. These systems show altered chemisorption and catalytic properties, which are sometimes linked to changes in their structural and electronic properties. 

          While the text doesn't explicitly discuss bridging the gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts, it implies that studying these bimetallic systems can provide valuable insights into the special properties of certain bimetallic catalysts. This suggests that research on these model surfaces could contribute to understanding more complex, industrially relevant catalysts.

          The literature does not provide specific information about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts over time, their commercial introduction, or their role in bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" in heterogeneous catalysis research and applications.

          所提供的文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的演变，也没有具体说明它们如何弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"。然而，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂独特性质的见解：

          双金属催化剂，由一种金属在另一种金属表面上的单层覆盖物组成，表现出与其各自金属组分显著不同的化学行为。这些系统在化学吸附和催化性质上显示出变化，有时这些变化与其结构和电子性质的改变有关。

          虽然文本没有明确讨论如何弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距，但它暗示研究这些双金属系统可以为某些双金属催化剂的特殊性质提供有价值的见解。这表明，对这些模型表面的研究可能有助于理解更复杂的、与工业相关的催化剂。

          该文献并未提供关于双金属催化剂随时间演变、商业引入或在多相催化研究和应用中弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的具体信息。
