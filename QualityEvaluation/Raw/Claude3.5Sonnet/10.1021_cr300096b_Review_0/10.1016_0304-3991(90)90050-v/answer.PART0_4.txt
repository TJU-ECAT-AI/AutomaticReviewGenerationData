[1] "The chemical behavior of monolayer coverages of one metal on the surface of another, e.g., Ni/W, Fe/W, Pd/W, Cu/Re, Ni/Mo, etc., has recently been shown to be dramatically different from that seen for either of the metallic components separately."

[2] "These chemical alterations, which modify the chemisorption and catalytic properties of the overlayers, have, in certain cases, been correlated with changes in the structural and electronic properties of the bimetallic system."

[3] "Representative studies are reviewed and discussed as to their relevance to the special properties observed for certain bimetallic catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction or their specific contributions to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap". However, it does provide some relevant insights into the unique properties of bimetallic catalysts.

The document indicates that bimetallic systems, consisting of monolayer coverages of one metal on another, exhibit chemical behavior significantly different from their individual metallic components. These bimetallic systems show altered chemisorption and catalytic properties, which in some cases have been linked to changes in their structural and electronic properties.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the "materials gap" or "pressure gap", it suggests that studying these bimetallic systems could provide insights into the special properties observed in certain bimetallic catalysts. This implies that such research could potentially contribute to bridging the gap between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts, though this connection is not directly stated in the text.

The document does not provide information on the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or their specific applications in fundamental research and practical industrial settings.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业化引入以来的演变，或它们在弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"方面的具体贡献。但是，它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂独特性质的相关见解。

文档指出，由一种金属在另一种金属表面上形成单层覆盖的双金属系统，展现出与各自金属组分显著不同的化学行为。这些双金属系统显示出改变的化学吸附和催化性质，在某些情况下，这些变化已经与其结构和电子性质的改变联系起来。

虽然文献没有明确讨论"材料差距"或"压力差距"，但它暗示研究这些双金属系统可能会为某些双金属催化剂观察到的特殊性质提供见解。这意味着这种研究可能有助于弥合模型表面和工业相关支持催化剂之间的差距，尽管文本中没有直接陈述这种联系。

该文档没有提供关于双金属催化剂历史演变的信息，也没有提供它们在基础研究和实际工业应用中的具体应用。
