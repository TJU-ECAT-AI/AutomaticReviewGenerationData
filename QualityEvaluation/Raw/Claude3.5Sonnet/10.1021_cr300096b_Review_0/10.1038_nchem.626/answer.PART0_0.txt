[1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

[2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."

[3] "Because the activity is highly dependent on the location of the Ni atoms, the stability of the surface is very important. Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate."

[4] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Monolayer bimetallic catalysts have emerged as a way to represent segregated alloy surfaces and model core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles. This allows for more accurate modeling of real catalyst systems.

2. The combination of theoretical and experimental approaches has become crucial for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems, especially when surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals. This integrated approach helps bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications.

3. Understanding the stability of bimetallic surfaces under different conditions (e.g., adsorbate coverage, electronegativity) has improved, allowing for better prediction of catalyst behavior under industrial conditions.

4. Studies have shown strong correlations between activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for certain reactions. This helps translate fundamental research on model surfaces to more industrially relevant supported catalysts.

These developments have enhanced our ability to design and predict the behavior of bimetallic catalysts, bringing model studies closer to practical applications and helping to bridge both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.

双金属催化剂自商业化以来在多相催化领域经历了显著的发展。它们独特的电子和化学性质在以下几个方面有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关的负载型催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"：

1. 单层双金属催化剂的出现可以用来表示分离的合金表面和模拟核壳双金属纳米粒子。这使得对实际催化剂系统的建模更加准确。

2. 理论和实验方法的结合对于识别理想的单层双金属系统变得至关重要，特别是当表面性质不是母体金属的线性函数时。这种综合方法有助于弥合基础研究和实际应用之间的差距。

3. 对双金属表面在不同条件下（如吸附剂覆盖度、电负性）稳定性的理解有所提高，使得能更好地预测工业条件下催化剂的行为。

4. 研究表明，对于某些反应，单晶表面、多晶薄膜和负载型双金属催化剂的活性之间存在很强的相关性。这有助于将模型表面上的基础研究转化为更具工业相关性的负载型催化剂。

这些发展提高了我们设计和预测双金属催化剂行为的能力，使模型研究更接近实际应用，并有助于弥合多相催化研究中的材料和压力差距。
