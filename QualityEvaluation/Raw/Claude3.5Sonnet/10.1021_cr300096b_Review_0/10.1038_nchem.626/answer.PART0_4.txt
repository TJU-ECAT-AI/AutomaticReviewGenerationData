[1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

[2] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

[3] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight some key aspects of how bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap":

1. Monolayer bimetallic catalysts can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles, allowing researchers to study more complex and realistic catalyst structures.

2. A computational framework combining DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling enables effective screening of complex bimetallic catalysts, bridging fundamental research with practical applications.

3. Studies have shown correlations between single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for certain reactions, helping to connect model surfaces with industrially relevant catalysts.

These approaches allow researchers to study more realistic catalyst structures and predict their performance, thus helping to bridge the gaps between fundamental surface science and industrial applications. However, the document does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of bimetallic catalyst development or their full impact on heterogeneous catalysis research.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业化引入以来的历史演变。但是，它确实强调了双金属催化剂如何有助于弥合"材料差距"和"压力差距"的一些关键方面：

1. 单层双金属催化剂可以代表分离的合金表面或模拟核壳纳米颗粒，使研究人员能够研究更复杂和更真实的催化剂结构。

2. 结合DFT计算和微观动力学建模的计算框架能够有效筛选复杂的双金属催化剂，从而将基础研究与实际应用联系起来。

3. 研究表明，对于某些反应，单晶表面、多晶薄膜和负载型双金属催化剂之间存在相关性，有助于将模型表面与工业相关催化剂联系起来。

这些方法允许研究人员研究更真实的催化剂结构并预测其性能，从而有助于弥合基础表面科学和工业应用之间的差距。然而，该文档并未提供双金属催化剂发展的全面历史概述或它们对多相催化研究的全面影响。
