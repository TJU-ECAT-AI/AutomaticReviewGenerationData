[1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

[2] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

[3] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or explicitly discuss bridging material and pressure gaps. However, it does provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts are being studied and developed:

Bimetallic catalysts are being investigated as monolayer structures on host metals, which can model both segregated alloy surfaces and core-shell nanoparticles. This allows researchers to study well-defined bimetallic surfaces.

A computational framework combining DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling is being used to screen potential bimetallic catalysts. This approach enables rapid evaluation of complex bimetallic systems.

Studies have shown correlations between the activity of single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for some reactions. This suggests that fundamental studies on model surfaces can provide insights relevant to practical supported catalysts.

While not explicitly stated, these approaches likely contribute to bridging material and pressure gaps by enabling systematic study of well-defined bimetallic surfaces and relating their properties to realistic catalyst systems. The computational screening also allows rapid exploration of diverse bimetallic combinations.

虽然文献没有直接讨论双金属催化剂的历史演变或明确讨论材料差距和压力差距的桥接,但它确实提供了关于双金属催化剂如何被研究和开发的见解:

双金属催化剂正在被研究作为宿主金属上的单层结构,这可以模拟分离的合金表面和核壳纳米粒子。这使研究人员能够研究明确定义的双金属表面。

正在使用结合DFT计算和微观动力学建模的计算框架来筛选潜在的双金属催化剂。这种方法能够快速评估复杂的双金属系统。

研究表明,对于某些反应,单晶表面、多晶薄膜和负载型双金属催化剂的活性之间存在相关性。这表明在模型表面上的基础研究可以为实际的负载型催化剂提供相关见解。

虽然没有明确说明,但这些方法可能通过实现对明确定义的双金属表面的系统研究,并将其性质与实际催化剂系统联系起来,从而有助于桥接材料差距和压力差距。计算筛选还允许快速探索多样化的双金属组合。
