[1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

[2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."

[3] "Because the activity is highly dependent on the location of the Ni atoms, the stability of the surface is very important. Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate."

[4] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation."

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved significantly in heterogeneous catalysis since their commercial introduction. Their unique electronic and chemical properties contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts in several ways:

1. Monolayer bimetallic catalysts have emerged as a way to represent segregated alloy surfaces and model core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles. This allows for more accurate modeling of real catalyst systems.

2. The combination of theoretical and experimental approaches has become crucial for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems, especially when surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals. This integrated approach helps bridge the gap between fundamental research and practical applications.

3. Understanding the stability of bimetallic surfaces under different conditions (e.g., adsorbate coverage, electronegativity) has improved, allowing for better prediction of catalyst behavior under industrial conditions.

4. Studies have shown strong correlations between activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for certain reactions. This helps translate fundamental research on model surfaces to more industrially relevant supported catalysts.

These developments have enhanced our ability to design and predict the behavior of bimetallic catalysts, bringing model studies closer to practical applications and helping to bridge both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or explicitly discuss bridging material and pressure gaps. However, it does provide insights into how bimetallic catalysts are being studied and developed:

Bimetallic catalysts are being investigated as monolayer structures on host metals, which can model both segregated alloy surfaces and core-shell nanoparticles. This allows researchers to study well-defined bimetallic surfaces.

A computational framework combining DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling is being used to screen potential bimetallic catalysts. This approach enables rapid evaluation of complex bimetallic systems.

Studies have shown correlations between the activity of single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for some reactions. This suggests that fundamental studies on model surfaces can provide insights relevant to practical supported catalysts.

While not explicitly stated, these approaches likely contribute to bridging material and pressure gaps by enabling systematic study of well-defined bimetallic surfaces and relating their properties to realistic catalyst systems. The computational screening also allows rapid exploration of diverse bimetallic combinations.

The literature does not directly address the full historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or explicitly discuss bridging materials and pressure gaps. However, it does provide some insights into how bimetallic catalysts have developed and their unique properties:

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved from simple alloyed surfaces to more complex structures like monolayer bimetallic catalysts, which can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. This allows for more precise control of surface properties.

Their unique electronic and chemical properties arise from the combination of two metals, which can produce binding energies and catalytic activities different from either parent metal alone. This non-linear behavior enables the design of catalysts with optimal properties for specific reactions.

Computational methods like DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling, combined with experimental validation, now allow for rational design and screening of bimetallic catalysts. This approach bridges fundamental surface science with practical catalyst development by enabling prediction of catalytic activity based on calculated surface properties.

While not explicitly stated, these advancements in bimetallic catalyst design and understanding likely contribute to bridging materials and pressure gaps by providing more realistic models of practical catalysts and enabling prediction of performance under industrial conditions.
