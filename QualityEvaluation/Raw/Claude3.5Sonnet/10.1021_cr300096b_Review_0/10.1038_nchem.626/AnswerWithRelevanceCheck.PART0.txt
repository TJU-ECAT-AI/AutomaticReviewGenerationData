          [1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

          [2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."

          [3] "Because the activity is highly dependent on the location of the Ni atoms, the stability of the surface is very important. Menning and Chen have shown that the relative thermodynamic stability of the surface and subsurface structures depends on the adsorbate coverage and the Pauling electronegativity of the adsorbate."

          [4] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation."

          [5] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

          [6] "The CoMo bimetallic catalyst for the synthesis reaction was predicted through the concept of Periodic Table interpolation, in which the binding energy of a mixed metal (alloyed) surface is taken as a linear combination of the binding energies of the parent metals."

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction, it highlights several key developments in their evolution and how they contribute to bridging the "materials gap" and "pressure gap" between model surfaces and industrially relevant supported catalysts:

          1. Development of monolayer bimetallic catalysts: These can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles, allowing for more accurate modeling of real catalyst systems and study of more complex and realistic catalyst structures.

          2. Integration of theoretical and experimental approaches: The combination of computational methods (DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling) with experimental validation has become crucial for identifying and screening desirable bimetallic systems, especially when surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals.

          3. Understanding surface stability: Research has shown that the stability of bimetallic surfaces depends on factors such as adsorbate coverage and electronegativity, improving predictions of catalyst behavior under industrial conditions.

          4. Correlations across different catalyst forms: Studies have demonstrated strong correlations between activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for certain reactions, helping to translate fundamental research to more industrially relevant systems.

          5. Advanced computational screening: The development of computational frameworks that combine DFT calculations with microkinetic modeling allows for rapid evaluation and screening of complex bimetallic catalysts, bridging fundamental research with practical applications.

          6. Predictive design: Concepts like Periodic Table interpolation have been used to predict bimetallic catalyst properties, enabling more rational design of catalysts with optimal properties for specific reactions.

          These advancements have enhanced the ability to design, predict, and understand the behavior of bimetallic catalysts, bringing model studies closer to practical applications and helping to bridge both the materials and pressure gaps in heterogeneous catalysis research.

          虽然文献没有提供双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的全面历史概述，但它强调了它们演变的几个关键发展，以及它们如何有助于弥合模型表面与工业相关的负载型催化剂之间的"材料差距"和"压力差距"：

          1. 单层双金属催化剂的发展：这些可以代表分离的合金表面或模拟核-壳纳米粒子，允许对实际催化剂系统进行更准确的建模，并研究更复杂和更真实的催化剂结构。

          2. 理论和实验方法的结合：计算方法（DFT计算、微观动力学建模）与实验验证的结合对于识别和筛选理想的双金属系统变得至关重要，特别是当表面性质不是母体金属的线性函数时。

          3. 理解表面稳定性：研究表明，双金属表面的稳定性取决于吸附剂覆盖度和电负性等因素，改善了对工业条件下催化剂行为的预测。

          4. 不同催化剂形式之间的相关性：研究表明，对于某些反应，单晶表面、多晶薄膜和负载型双金属催化剂的活性之间存在很强的相关性，有助于将基础研究转化为更具工业相关性的系统。

          5. 先进的计算筛选：结合DFT计算和微观动力学建模的计算框架的发展允许快速评估和筛选复杂的双金属催化剂，将基础研究与实际应用联系起来。

          6. 预测性设计：周期表插值等概念已被用于预测双金属催化剂性质，使得能够更理性地设计具有特定反应最佳性质的催化剂。

          这些进展提高了设计、预测和理解双金属催化剂行为的能力，使模型研究更接近实际应用，并有助于弥合多相催化研究中的材料和压力差距。
