[1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

[2] "The CoMo bimetallic catalyst for the synthesis reaction was predicted through the concept of Periodic Table interpolation, in which the binding energy of a mixed metal (alloyed) surface is taken as a linear combination of the binding energies of the parent metals."

[3] "Our experimental findings support the proposed computational framework in which potential (complex) bimetallic catalysts can effectively be screened using a library of binding energies of bimetallic catalysts from DFT calculations guided from full, first-principles-based microkinetic models."

The literature does not directly address the full historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts or explicitly discuss bridging materials and pressure gaps. However, it does provide some insights into how bimetallic catalysts have developed and their unique properties:

Bimetallic catalysts have evolved from simple alloyed surfaces to more complex structures like monolayer bimetallic catalysts, which can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles. This allows for more precise control of surface properties.

Their unique electronic and chemical properties arise from the combination of two metals, which can produce binding energies and catalytic activities different from either parent metal alone. This non-linear behavior enables the design of catalysts with optimal properties for specific reactions.

Computational methods like DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling, combined with experimental validation, now allow for rational design and screening of bimetallic catalysts. This approach bridges fundamental surface science with practical catalyst development by enabling prediction of catalytic activity based on calculated surface properties.

While not explicitly stated, these advancements in bimetallic catalyst design and understanding likely contribute to bridging materials and pressure gaps by providing more realistic models of practical catalysts and enabling prediction of performance under industrial conditions.

虽然文献并未直接阐述双金属催化剂的完整历史演变,也没有明确讨论材料差距和压力差距的问题,但它确实提供了一些关于双金属催化剂如何发展及其独特性质的见解:

双金属催化剂已从简单的合金表面发展到更复杂的结构,如单层双金属催化剂,这可以代表分离的合金表面或模拟核-壳纳米颗粒。这允许更精确地控制表面性质。

它们独特的电子和化学性质源于两种金属的组合,这可以产生与任一母体金属都不同的结合能和催化活性。这种非线性行为使得可以设计出具有特定反应最佳性质的催化剂。

结合实验验证的计算方法,如密度泛函理论(DFT)计算和微观动力学建模,现在允许对双金属催化剂进行理性设计和筛选。这种方法通过基于计算的表面性质预测催化活性,将基础表面科学与实际催化剂开发联系起来。

虽然没有明确说明,但这些在双金属催化剂设计和理解方面的进展可能有助于弥合材料差距和压力差距,因为它们提供了更现实的实用催化剂模型,并能够预测工业条件下的性能。
