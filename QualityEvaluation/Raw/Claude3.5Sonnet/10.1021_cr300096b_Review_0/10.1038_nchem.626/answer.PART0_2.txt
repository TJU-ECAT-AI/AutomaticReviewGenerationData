[1] "Monolayer bimetallic catalysts consist of a monolayer of an admetal in the top layers of a host metal. These surfaces can be used to represent the segregated surface of an alloy or can be used to model coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles."

[2] "The results reported here provide a framework for complex catalyst discovery. They also demonstrate the critical importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches for identifying desirable monolayer bimetallic systems when the surface properties are not a linear function of the parent metals."

[3] "Previous studies within our group have shown a remarkable correlation between the activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films and supported bimetallic catalysts for reactions such as cyclohexene hydrogenation."

The literature does not directly address the historical evolution of bimetallic catalysts since their commercial introduction. However, it does highlight some key aspects of how bimetallic catalysts contribute to bridging gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts:

1. Monolayer bimetallic catalysts can represent segregated alloy surfaces or model core-shell nanoparticles, allowing study of more complex and realistic catalyst structures.

2. The research demonstrates the importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches to identify desirable bimetallic systems, especially when their properties are not simply a linear combination of the parent metals. This integrated approach helps bridge fundamental studies with practical applications.

3. Studies have shown correlations between activity on single-crystal surfaces, polycrystalline films, and supported bimetallic catalysts for some reactions. This indicates that insights from model surfaces can translate to more industrially relevant supported catalysts, helping bridge the materials and pressure gaps.

While the text does not provide a comprehensive historical overview, it illustrates how bimetallic catalysts allow for more complex and realistic catalyst models, and how combining theory and experiments on various catalyst forms can provide insights relevant to both fundamental research and practical applications.

该文献并未直接讨论双金属催化剂自商业引入以来的历史演变。但是，它确实强调了双金属催化剂如何有助于弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间差距的一些关键方面：

1. 单层双金属催化剂可以代表分离的合金表面或模拟核壳纳米粒子，允许研究更复杂和现实的催化剂结构。

2. 该研究表明，结合理论和实验方法对于识别理想的双金属系统非常重要，特别是当它们的性质不是父金属的简单线性组合时。这种综合方法有助于将基础研究与实际应用联系起来。

3. 研究表明，对于某些反应，单晶表面、多晶薄膜和负载型双金属催化剂的活性之间存在相关性。这表明从模型表面获得的洞察可以转化为更具工业相关性的负载型催化剂，有助于弥合材料和压力差距。

虽然文本没有提供全面的历史概述，但它说明了双金属催化剂如何允许更复杂和现实的催化剂模型，以及如何将理论和实验结合在各种催化剂形式上可以为基础研究和实际应用提供相关见解。
