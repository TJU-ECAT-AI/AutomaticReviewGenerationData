The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, their unique properties, or how they contribute to bridging gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. The text primarily focuses on the fundamental surface chemistry of bimetallic systems and does not discuss their practical applications in catalysis or their development over time. Without additional relevant information, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.
