Unfortunately, this literature does not contain any information directly relevant to answering the question about the evolution of bimetallic catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, their unique properties, or how they bridge gaps between model surfaces and industrial catalysts. The document appears to be mostly bibliographic information and citations rather than substantive content about bimetallic catalysts. Without access to the full text of the article or additional sources, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this specific question based solely on the given literature.

遗憾的是,这篇文献并不包含任何与回答问题直接相关的信息,即双金属催化剂在多相催化中的演变、它们的独特性质,或它们如何弥合模型表面和工业催化剂之间的差距。该文档似乎主要是参考文献信息和引用,而不是关于双金属催化剂的实质性内容。在没有获得文章全文或额外资料的情况下,我无法仅根据给出的文献准确回答这个具体问题。
