[1] "The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the ever-increasing demand."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable"

[3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over-oxidation of propane"

[4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient production to meet growing demand from conventional methods like catalytic and steam cracking.

2. Low conversion and yields in direct catalytic dehydrogenation due to equilibrium limitations and unfavorable thermodynamics.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an exothermic, non-thermodynamically limited reaction when using oxygen as an oxidant.

2. Potentially utilizing greenhouse gas CO2 as a soft oxidant.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
- Higher conversion potential
- More favorable thermodynamics
- Possibility of using CO2 as an oxidant, addressing environmental concerns

Limitations:
- Over-oxidation of propane when using oxygen, leading to poor propylene selectivity
- Need for developing effective catalysts, especially for CO2-PDH

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include maintaining high propylene selectivity while preventing over-oxidation of the desired product. This highlights the need for careful oxidant selection and catalyst development to optimize the ODHP process.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统方法如催化裂解和蒸汽裂解的产量无法满足不断增长的需求。

2. 由于平衡限制和不利的热力学条件，直接催化脱氢的转化率和产率较低。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，提供放热且不受热力学限制的反应。

2. 可能利用温室气体CO2作为温和氧化剂。

然而，ODHP也有自己的优势和局限性：

优势：
- 更高的转化潜力
- 更有利的热力学条件
- 可能使用CO2作为氧化剂，解决环境问题

局限性：
- 使用氧气时会导致丙烷过度氧化，降低丙烯选择性
- 需要开发有效的催化剂，尤其是用于CO2-PDH

使用氧气的具体挑战包括在保持高丙烯选择性的同时防止目标产物过度氧化。这突显了需要仔细选择氧化剂和开发催化剂以优化ODHP过程。

- Utilization of greenhouse gases (when using CO2)

Limitations:
- Over-oxidation of propane leading to low propylene selectivity when using oxygen
- Need for development of more efficient catalysts, especially for CO2-based ODHP

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include achieving high propylene selectivity while avoiding over-oxidation of the desired product. The use of CO2 as an alternative oxidant addresses this issue to some extent but requires further research to develop more effective catalysts and overcome rapid deactivation problems.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统方法如催化裂解和蒸汽裂解的产量无法满足日益增长的需求。

2. 由于平衡限制和不利的热力学条件，直接催化脱氢的转化率和产率较低。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，提供放热和非热力学限制的反应。

2. 潜在地利用温室气体CO2作为温和的氧化剂替代品。

然而，ODHP也有其自身的优势和局限性：

优势：
- 更高的转化潜力
- 利用温室气体（使用CO2时）

局限性：
- 使用氧气时丙烷过度氧化导致丙烯选择性低
- 需要开发更高效的催化剂，特别是对于基于CO2的ODHP

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括在避免所需产物过度氧化的同时实现高丙烯选择性。使用CO2作为替代氧化剂在一定程度上解决了这个问题，但需要进一步研究以开发更有效的催化剂并克服快速失活的问题。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply to meet increasing demand from conventional methods like catalytic and steam cracking.

2. Low conversion and yields in direct catalytic dehydrogenation due to equilibrium limitations and unfavorable thermodynamics.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production route specifically targeted at propylene.

2. Overcoming equilibrium limitations, as it is not thermodynamically limited.

3. Being exothermic, unlike endothermic direct dehydrogenation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
- Higher conversion potential
- More favorable energy requirements

Limitations:
- When using oxygen as an oxidant, propylene selectivity is low due to over-oxidation.

In the context of oxidant selection, carbon dioxide emerges as a potential alternative to oxygen. Using CO2 as an oxidant offers the additional benefit of utilizing a greenhouse gas. However, the specific challenges associated with using oxygen (mainly over-oxidation leading to poor selectivity) are not fully addressed by the literature for CO2 as an oxidant.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统方法如催化裂解和蒸汽裂解作为副产品生产的丙烯无法满足日益增长的需求。

2. 由于平衡限制和不利的热力学条件，直接催化脱氢的转化率和产率较低。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门针对丙烯的替代生产路线。

2. 克服平衡限制，因为它不受热力学限制。

3. 为放热反应，不同于吸热的直接脱氢。

然而，ODHP也有其自身的优势和局限性：

优势：
- 更高的转化潜力
- 更有利的能量需求

局限性：
- 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，由于过度氧化导致丙烯选择性低。

在氧化剂选择方面，二氧化碳成为氧气的潜在替代品。使用CO2作为氧化剂还有利用温室气体的额外好处。然而，文献中并未完全阐述使用CO2作为氧化剂是否能解决与使用氧气相关的特定挑战(主要是过度氧化导致的选择性差)。
