[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the ever-increasing demand."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable"

[3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over-oxidation of propane"

[4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Insufficient supply to meet growing demand from conventional manufacturing methods like catalytic and steam cracking that produce propylene as a byproduct.

2. Low conversion and yields in direct catalytic dehydrogenation due to equilibrium limitations and unfavorable thermodynamics.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative dedicated process for propylene production.

2. Overcoming equilibrium limitations as an exothermic, non-thermodynamically limited reaction when using oxygen as the oxidant.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges:

1. When using oxygen as the oxidant, propylene selectivity is low due to over-oxidation of propane.

2. Using carbon dioxide as a "soft oxidant" is being explored as an alternative that can utilize greenhouse gases, but likely has its own limitations in activity and selectivity that need to be overcome.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 传统的催化裂解和蒸汽裂解等制造方法作为副产品生产丙烯，无法满足不断增长的需求。

2. 直接催化脱氢由于平衡限制和不利的热力学，转化率和产率较低。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了一种专门生产丙烯的替代工艺。

2. 当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，作为放热和非热力学限制反应，克服了平衡限制。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，由于丙烷过度氧化，丙烯选择性低。

2. 正在探索使用二氧化碳作为"软氧化剂"的替代方案，可以利用温室气体，但可能在活性和选择性方面存在需要克服的局限性。
