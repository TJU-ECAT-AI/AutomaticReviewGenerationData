[1] "The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the ever-increasing demand."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable"

[3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over-oxidation of propane"

[4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply to meet increasing demand from conventional methods like catalytic and steam cracking.

2. Low conversion and yields in direct catalytic dehydrogenation due to equilibrium limitations and unfavorable thermodynamics.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production route specifically targeted at propylene.

2. Overcoming equilibrium limitations, as it is not thermodynamically limited.

3. Being exothermic, unlike endothermic direct dehydrogenation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
- Higher conversion potential
- More favorable energy requirements

Limitations:
- When using oxygen as an oxidant, propylene selectivity is low due to over-oxidation.

In the context of oxidant selection, carbon dioxide emerges as a potential alternative to oxygen. Using CO2 as an oxidant offers the additional benefit of utilizing a greenhouse gas. However, the specific challenges associated with using oxygen (mainly over-oxidation leading to poor selectivity) are not fully addressed by the literature for CO2 as an oxidant.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统方法如催化裂解和蒸汽裂解作为副产品生产的丙烯无法满足日益增长的需求。

2. 由于平衡限制和不利的热力学条件，直接催化脱氢的转化率和产率较低。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门针对丙烯的替代生产路线。

2. 克服平衡限制，因为它不受热力学限制。

3. 为放热反应，不同于吸热的直接脱氢。

然而，ODHP也有其自身的优势和局限性：

优势：
- 更高的转化潜力
- 更有利的能量需求

局限性：
- 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，由于过度氧化导致丙烯选择性低。

在氧化剂选择方面，二氧化碳成为氧气的潜在替代品。使用CO2作为氧化剂还有利用温室气体的额外好处。然而，文献中并未完全阐述使用CO2作为氧化剂是否能解决与使用氧气相关的特定挑战(主要是过度氧化导致的选择性差)。
