[1] "The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the ever-increasing demand."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable"

[3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over-oxidation of propane"

[4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient production to meet growing demand from conventional methods like catalytic and steam cracking.

2. Low conversion and yields from direct catalytic dehydrogenation due to equilibrium limitations and unfavorable thermodynamics.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an exothermic, non-thermodynamically limited reaction, potentially improving yields.

2. Providing an alternative production route to meet increasing demand.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges:

1. When using oxygen as an oxidant, over-oxidation of propane reduces propylene selectivity.

2. To address this, softer oxidants like carbon dioxide are being explored as alternatives.

Using CO2 as an oxidant has the added benefit of utilizing a greenhouse gas, but likely comes with its own set of challenges in terms of catalyst development and process optimization.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统方法如催化裂解和蒸汽裂解无法满足不断增长的需求。

2. 由于平衡限制和不利的热力学条件，直接催化脱氢转化率低、产率低。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供放热、非热力学限制的反应，可能提高产率。

2. 提供替代生产路线以满足不断增长的需求。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，丙烷过度氧化会降低丙烯选择性。

2. 为解决这个问题，正在探索使用二氧化碳等较温和的氧化剂作为替代品。

使用CO2作为氧化剂具有利用温室气体的额外好处，但在催化剂开发和工艺优化方面可能会面临一系列新的挑战。
