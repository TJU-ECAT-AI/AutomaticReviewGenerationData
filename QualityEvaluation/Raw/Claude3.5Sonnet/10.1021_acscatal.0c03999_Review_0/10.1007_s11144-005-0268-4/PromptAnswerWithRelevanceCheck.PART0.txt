[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other methods. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation, which can be considered a form of ODHP.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation offers several advantages:

1. Increased equilibrium conversion: CO2 dilutes propane, shifting the equilibrium towards products.

2. Improved catalyst activity maintenance: CO2 inhibits coke formation on the catalyst surface, preventing deactivation.

3. Enhanced propane conversion: CO2 reduces H2 concentration through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, pushing the equilibrium towards propylene formation.

4. Reduced carbon deposition: When CO2 is present, no carbon deposits are observed on the catalysts, unlike when N2 is used.

These advantages address some challenges in propane dehydrogenation, such as thermodynamic limitations, catalyst deactivation, and carbon deposition. However, the study does not discuss limitations of using CO2 as an oxidant or compare it to other oxidants like oxygen.

The literature focuses on CO2 as an oxidant and does not provide information on challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP. Therefore, a comprehensive comparison of oxidant selection and specific challenges related to oxygen use cannot be made based on this document alone.

该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂在丙烷脱氢中的一些优势，这可以被视为ODHP的一种形式。

使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂提供了几个优势：

1. 提高平衡转化率：CO2稀释丙烷，使平衡向产物方向移动。

2. 改善催化剂活性维持：CO2抑制催化剂表面的积碳形成，防止失活。

3. 增强丙烷转化：CO2通过逆水气变换反应减少H2浓度，推动平衡向丙烯形成方向移动。

4. 减少碳沉积：当存在CO2时，催化剂上没有观察到碳沉积，而使用N2时则会有碳沉积。

这些优势解决了丙烷脱氢中的一些挑战，如热力学限制、催化剂失活和碳沉积。然而，该研究并未讨论使用CO2作为氧化剂的局限性，也没有将其与其他氧化剂（如氧气）进行比较。

该文献主要关注CO2作为氧化剂，并未提供关于在ODHP中使用氧气的相关挑战信息。因此，仅基于这份文档无法对氧化剂的选择和使用氧气相关的具体挑战进行全面比较。
