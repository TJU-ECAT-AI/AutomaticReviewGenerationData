[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other methods. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

The paper focuses on the use of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane, which can be considered a form of ODHP. Some advantages of using CO2 in this process include:

1. Increased equilibrium conversion by diluting propane
2. Maintained catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation
3. Enhanced propane conversion by reducing H2 concentration through the reversed water-gas shift reaction

The study demonstrates that using CO2 as an oxidant leads to higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to using N2. It also shows that CO2 helps prevent carbon deposition on catalysts, which is a common issue in dehydrogenation reactions.

While the paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of using CO2 or compare it to other oxidants like oxygen, it does highlight some of the benefits of CO2 in addressing challenges such as catalyst deactivation and coke formation.

The study does not provide information on the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP or a comprehensive comparison of different oxidants.

该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实讨论了在丙烷脱氢成丙烯过程中使用CO2作为氧化剂的一些优势。

论文重点关注在丙烷脱氢过程中使用CO2，这可以被视为ODHP的一种形式。在这个过程中使用CO2的一些优势包括：

1. 通过稀释丙烷来增加平衡转化率
2. 通过抑制积碳形成来维持催化剂活性
3. 通过逆水气变换反应减少H2浓度来增强丙烷转化率

研究表明，与使用N2相比，使用CO2作为氧化剂可以导致更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。它还显示CO2有助于防止催化剂上的碳沉积，这是脱氢反应中的一个常见问题。

虽然论文没有明确讨论使用CO2的局限性或将其与其他氧化剂如氧气进行比较，但它确实强调了CO2在解决催化剂失活和积碳形成等挑战方面的一些优势。

该研究没有提供关于在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战信息，也没有对不同氧化剂进行全面比较。
