          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits."

          The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other methods. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation, which can be considered a form of ODHP:

1. Improved conversion and selectivity: The use of CO2 enhances both propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to using an inert gas like N2.

2. Reduced catalyst deactivation: CO2 helps maintain catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, which is a common issue in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Thermodynamic advantages: CO2 increases equilibrium conversion by diluting propane and enhances propane conversion by reducing H2 concentration through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

4. Utilization of low-cost feedstock: The process allows for the use of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) to produce more valuable alkenes (propylene).

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the limitations of using CO2 or compare it to oxygen as an oxidant, it implies that CO2 offers advantages over traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation methods. The study focuses on the benefits of using CO2 rather than addressing specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP.

          该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）与其他方法。然而，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂在丙烷脱氢中的一些优势，这可以被视为ODHP的一种形式：

1. 提高转化率和选择性：与使用惰性气体如N2相比，使用CO2可以提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

2. 减少催化剂失活：CO2有助于通过抑制积碳形成来维持催化剂活性，这是脱氢反应中的常见问题。

3. 热力学优势：CO2通过稀释丙烷来增加平衡转化率，并通过逆水气变换反应减少H2浓度来增强丙烷转化。

4. 利用低成本原料：该过程允许使用低成本的饱和烃（丙烷）来生产更有价值的烯烃（丙烯）。

虽然文档没有明确讨论使用CO2的局限性或将其与氧气作为氧化剂进行比较，但它暗示CO2比传统的非氧化脱氢方法具有优势。该研究侧重于使用CO2的好处，而不是解决使用氧气作为ODHP中的氧化剂所带来的具体挑战。
