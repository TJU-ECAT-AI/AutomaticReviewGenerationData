[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other methods. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation, which can be inferred to address certain challenges in propylene production:

1. Improved conversion and selectivity: The use of CO2 enhances both propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to using an inert gas like N2.

2. Coke inhibition: CO2 helps maintain catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, which is a common issue in hydrocarbon reactions.

3. Thermodynamic advantages: CO2 increases equilibrium conversion by diluting propane and enhances propane conversion by reducing H2 concentration through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

4. Catalyst stability: The presence of CO2 improves catalyst stability, preventing rapid deactivation observed when using N2.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss limitations of using CO2 or compare it to oxygen as an oxidant, it implies that CO2 offers advantages in terms of reaction control and catalyst longevity. The study focuses on CO2 as an oxidant and does not provide information on challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实讨论了在丙烷脱氢中使用CO2作为氧化剂的一些优点，这可以推断为解决了丙烯生产中的某些挑战：

1. 提高转化率和选择性：与使用惰性气体如N2相比，使用CO2可以同时提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

2. 抑制积碳：CO2有助于通过抑制积碳形成来维持催化剂活性，这是碳氢化合物反应中的一个常见问题。

3. 热力学优势：CO2通过稀释丙烷来增加平衡转化率，并通过逆水煤气变换反应降低H2浓度来增强丙烷转化。

4. 催化剂稳定性：CO2的存在改善了催化剂稳定性，防止了使用N2时观察到的快速失活。

虽然文档没有明确讨论使用CO2的局限性或将其与氧气作为氧化剂进行比较，但它暗示CO2在反应控制和催化剂寿命方面具有优势。该研究重点关注CO2作为氧化剂，没有提供有关在ODHP中使用氧气相关挑战的信息。
