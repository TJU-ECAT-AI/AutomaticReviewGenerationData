[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other methods. However, it does discuss some advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene.

The study focuses on the use of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane, which can be considered a form of ODHP. The advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant include:

1. Increased equilibrium conversion by diluting propane
2. Maintained catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation
3. Enhanced propane conversion by reducing H2 concentration through the reversed water-gas shift reaction

The research demonstrates that the presence of CO2 improves both propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to using N2 as a diluent. Additionally, CO2 helps prevent carbon deposition on the catalysts, which is a common issue in dehydrogenation reactions.

However, the study does not discuss the limitations of using CO2 or compare it to other oxidants like oxygen. It also does not address the broader challenges associated with current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive overview of ODHP advantages and limitations.

该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实讨论了在丙烷脱氢生产丙烯过程中使用CO2作为氧化剂的一些优势。

研究重点关注了在丙烷脱氢中使用CO2，这可以被视为ODHP的一种形式。使用CO2作为氧化剂的优势包括：

1. 通过稀释丙烷来增加平衡转化率
2. 通过抑制积碳形成来维持催化剂活性
3. 通过逆水煤气变换反应降低H2浓度来提高丙烷转化率

研究表明，与使用N2作为稀释剂相比，CO2的存在可以同时提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。此外，CO2有助于防止催化剂上的碳沉积，这是脱氢反应中的一个常见问题。

然而，该研究并未讨论使用CO2的局限性，也没有将其与其他氧化剂（如氧气）进行比较。它也没有涉及当前丙烯生产方法的更广泛挑战，或提供ODHP优势和局限性的全面概述。
