[1] "C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O"

[2] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with CO2 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2. This catalyst is also effective for ethane transformation. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 °C 3600 h-1 and CO2/C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion and the ratio CO/(C2H4 + C3H6) = 1.4."

[3] "With increase of conversion of considerable olefin selectivity decrease is observed. Such a characteristic is explained by a higher degree of hydrocarbon conversion and by obtaining a more reduced mixture than in the case of ethane"

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or compare oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other methods. However, it does discuss the use of CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, which can be considered a form of ODHP.

The main advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, based on the information provided, include:

1. High conversion rates: Up to 96% propane conversion is achieved.

2. Good selectivity: 73% yield of C2-C3 olefins is reported at high conversion rates.

3. Utilization of CO2: This process could potentially help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using CO2 as a reactant.

4. Stable catalysts: Manganese-containing catalysts are described as effective and stable for this reaction.

Limitations and challenges of this process include:

1. Decreasing selectivity at higher conversion rates: As conversion increases, olefin selectivity decreases.

2. Formation of by-products: CO is formed alongside the desired olefins.

3. High temperature requirements: The process operates at 830°C, which implies high energy input.

4. Catalyst complexity: The best catalyst described is a multi-component system (K-Cr-Mn-O/SiO2), which may be complex to prepare and optimize.

The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, so a comparison between CO2 and O2 as oxidants for ODHP cannot be made based on this information.

该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有将丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法进行比较。然而，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂，这可以被视为ODHP的一种形式。

根据所提供的信息，使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢氧化剂的主要优势包括：

1. 高转化率：可达到96%的丙烷转化率。

2. 良好的选择性：在高转化率下报告了73%的C2-C3烯烃产率。

3. CO2的利用：这一过程可能通过使用CO2作为反应物来帮助减少温室气体排放。

4. 稳定的催化剂：含锰催化剂被描述为对这种反应有效且稳定。

这一过程的局限性和挑战包括：

1. 在更高转化率下选择性下降：随着转化率的增加，烯烃选择性下降。

2. 副产品的形成：除了所需的烯烃外，还形成了CO。

3. 高温要求：该过程在830°C下进行，这意味着需要高能量输入。

4. 催化剂复杂性：描述的最佳催化剂是一个多组分系统（K-Cr-Mn-O/SiO2），可能在制备和优化方面比较复杂。

文献没有讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战，因此无法基于这些信息比较CO2和O2作为ODHP氧化剂的优劣。

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or compare oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other processes. However, it does provide information on using CO2 as an oxidant for propane conversion.

The document describes a process for converting propane to propylene and other olefins using CO2 as the oxidant over manganese-containing catalysts. This process appears to offer high conversion rates and selectivity towards olefins. The best catalyst reported is 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2, which achieved 73% yield of C2-C3 olefins at 96% propane conversion.

Using CO2 as an oxidant may address some challenges associated with using oxygen, such as safety concerns and over-oxidation. However, the process still faces limitations, including the production of CO as a byproduct and the need for high temperatures (830 °C reported).

The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of this method to other propylene production processes or a detailed discussion of its advantages and limitations. More information would be needed to fully address the question's scope.

该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有将丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他工艺进行比较。然而，它确实提供了使用CO2作为氧化剂进行丙烷转化的信息。

文件描述了一个使用CO2作为氧化剂，在含锰催化剂上将丙烷转化为丙烯和其他烯烃的过程。这一过程似乎提供了较高的转化率和对烯烃的选择性。报告中最佳的催化剂是1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2，在96%的丙烷转化率下实现了73%的C2-C3烯烃产率。

使用CO2作为氧化剂可能解决了一些与使用氧气相关的挑战，如安全问题和过度氧化。然而，该过程仍面临一些限制，包括CO作为副产品的生成，以及需要高温（报告中为830°C）。

文件并未对这种方法与其他丙烯生产工艺进行全面比较，也没有详细讨论其优势和局限性。需要更多信息才能全面回答问题的范围。

2. The process can achieve high propane conversion (96%) and good selectivity to C2-C3 olefins (73% yield) using a K-Cr-Mn-O/SiO2 catalyst.

3. The reaction produces CO as a by-product, which could be a limitation or an opportunity depending on the desired end-products.

4. The process operates at high temperatures (830°C), which may present energy efficiency challenges.

5. The use of CO2 as an oxidant may help prevent deep oxidation of hydrocarbons, which is a common issue with oxygen as an oxidant.

However, the document does not provide information on how this method compares to traditional propylene production methods or other ODHP processes using different oxidants, nor does it discuss specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant.

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or compare oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other methods. However, it does discuss the use of CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, which is an alternative to traditional oxygen-based ODHP.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation presents several advantages:

1. It allows for high conversion rates of propane (up to 96%) with good selectivity towards C2-C3 olefins (73% yield).

2. It utilizes CO2, potentially helping to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

3. It avoids the use of oxygen as an oxidant, which can lead to over-oxidation and safety concerns in traditional ODHP processes.

4. The process can be carried out at relatively high temperatures (830 °C) without apparent issues.

5. The catalyst (K-Cr-Mn oxide supported on silica) appears to be effective and stable.

However, there are potential limitations:

1. The high temperature required (830 °C) may lead to high energy costs.

2. The process still produces CO as a by-product, which may need to be managed or utilized.

3. The catalyst contains chromium, which could pose environmental concerns.

4. The long-term stability and deactivation of the catalyst are not discussed in the given excerpt.

Overall, while this CO2-based propane dehydrogenation process shows promise, more information would be needed to fully compare it to current propylene production methods and oxygen-based ODHP in terms of efficiency, cost, and environmental impact.

虽然文献没有直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，或将丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法进行比较，但它确实讨论了使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂，这是传统氧基ODHP的一种替代方法。

使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂具有以下几个优点：

1. 它允许高转化率的丙烷（高达96%），并对C2-C3烯烃具有良好的选择性（73%的产率）。

2. 它利用了CO2，可能有助于减少温室气体排放。

3. 它避免了使用氧气作为氧化剂，在传统的ODHP过程中，氧气可能导致过度氧化和安全问题。

4. 该过程可以在相对高的温度（830°C）下进行，而没有明显的问题。

5. 催化剂（在二氧化硅上负载的K-Cr-Mn氧化物）似乎是有效和稳定的。

然而，也存在潜在的限制：

1. 所需的高温（830°C）可能导致高能耗。

2. 该过程仍然产生CO作为副产品，可能需要管理或利用。

3. 催化剂含有铬，可能会引起环境问题。

4. 在给出的摘录中没有讨论催化剂的长期稳定性和失活问题。

总的来说，虽然这种基于CO2的丙烷脱氢过程显示出前景，但还需要更多信息来全面比较它与当前丙烯生产方法和基于氧气的ODHP在效率、成本和环境影响方面的差异。
