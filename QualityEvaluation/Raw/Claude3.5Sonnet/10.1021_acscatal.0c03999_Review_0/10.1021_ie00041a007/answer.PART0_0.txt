[1] "C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O"

[2] "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with CO2 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2. This catalyst is also effective for ethane transformation. The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 °C 3600 h-1 and CO2/C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion and the ratio CO/(C2H4 + C3H6) = 1.4."

[3] "With increase of conversion of considerable olefin selectivity decrease is observed. Such a characteristic is explained by a higher degree of hydrocarbon conversion and by obtaining a more reduced mixture than in the case of ethane"

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or compare oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other methods. However, it does discuss the use of CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, which can be considered a form of ODHP.

The main advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, based on the information provided, include:

1. High conversion rates: Up to 96% propane conversion is achieved.

2. Good selectivity: 73% yield of C2-C3 olefins is reported at high conversion rates.

3. Utilization of CO2: This process could potentially help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using CO2 as a reactant.

4. Stable catalysts: Manganese-containing catalysts are described as effective and stable for this reaction.

Limitations and challenges of this process include:

1. Decreasing selectivity at higher conversion rates: As conversion increases, olefin selectivity decreases.

2. Formation of by-products: CO is formed alongside the desired olefins.

3. High temperature requirements: The process operates at 830°C, which implies high energy input.

4. Catalyst complexity: The best catalyst described is a multi-component system (K-Cr-Mn-O/SiO2), which may be complex to prepare and optimize.

The literature does not discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, so a comparison between CO2 and O2 as oxidants for ODHP cannot be made based on this information.

该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有将丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法进行比较。然而，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢的氧化剂，这可以被视为ODHP的一种形式。

根据所提供的信息，使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢氧化剂的主要优势包括：

1. 高转化率：可达到96%的丙烷转化率。

2. 良好的选择性：在高转化率下报告了73%的C2-C3烯烃产率。

3. CO2的利用：这一过程可能通过使用CO2作为反应物来帮助减少温室气体排放。

4. 稳定的催化剂：含锰催化剂被描述为对这种反应有效且稳定。

这一过程的局限性和挑战包括：

1. 在更高转化率下选择性下降：随着转化率的增加，烯烃选择性下降。

2. 副产品的形成：除了所需的烯烃外，还形成了CO。

3. 高温要求：该过程在830°C下进行，这意味着需要高能量输入。

4. 催化剂复杂性：描述的最佳催化剂是一个多组分系统（K-Cr-Mn-O/SiO2），可能在制备和优化方面比较复杂。

文献没有讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战，因此无法基于这些信息比较CO2和O2作为ODHP氧化剂的优劣。
