[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."

[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."

[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."

[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A serious supply deficit due to increased demand for propylene derivatives.

2. Traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking are costly due to high capital investment and feedstock costs, and produce more ethylene than propylene.

3. Propane dehydrogenation yields high propylene but is only cost-effective during limited periods, restricting production.

4. FCC units generate propylene but with relatively low yield.

5. Metathesis of ethylene and butylenes consumes high-value ethylene, making it unattractive.

The document does not mention oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or discuss its advantages, limitations, or challenges related to oxidant selection. Instead, it suggests catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins as a potential solution to address these challenges by using less valuable feedstock in existing refinery or petrochemical plants.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于丙烯衍生物需求增加，导致严重供应短缺。

2. 传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解成本高昂，因为需要巨额资本投资和高昂的原料成本，且生产的乙烯比丙烯多。

3. 丙烷脱氢法产率高，但仅在一年中有限的时间内具有成本效益，限制了生产。

4. FCC装置可以生产丙烯，但产率相对较低。

5. 乙烯和丁烯的复分解消耗高价值乙烯，使其缺乏吸引力。

该文档未提及丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）或讨论其优势、局限性，或与氧化剂选择相关的挑战。相反，它建议通过在现有炼油厂或石化厂中使用较低价值的原料进行混合C4或更高碳烯烃的催化裂解，作为解决这些挑战的潜在方案。
