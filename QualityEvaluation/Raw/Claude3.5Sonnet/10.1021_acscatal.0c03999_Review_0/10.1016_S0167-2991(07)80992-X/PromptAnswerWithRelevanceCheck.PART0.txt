<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."

[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."

[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."

[5] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A serious supply deficit due to growing demand for propylene derivatives.

2. Naphtha steam cracking is costly due to high capital investment and feedstock costs, and produces more ethylene than propylene.

3. Propane dehydrogenation has high yield but is only cost-effective during limited periods, making it expensive.

4. FCC units produce relatively low yields of propylene.

5. Metathesis of ethylene and butylenes consumes high-value ethylene as feedstock, making it unattractive.

The document does not mention oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or discuss its advantages, limitations, or oxidant selection challenges. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于丙烯衍生物需求增长，导致供应严重短缺。

2. 石脑油蒸汽裂解成本高昂，因为需要大量资本投资和高昂的原料成本，而且生产的乙烯比丙烯多。

3. 丙烷脱氢产率高，但只有在一年中有限的时期内才具有成本效益，使得这个过程昂贵。

4. FCC装置生产的丙烯产量相对较低。

5. 乙烯和丁烯的复分解生产丙烯的方法不具吸引力，因为它会消耗同样高价值的乙烯作为主要原料。

该文献没有提到丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）或讨论其优势、局限性或氧化剂选择的挑战。因此，基于给定的文献无法回答问题的这一部分。
