[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."

[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."

[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."

[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A serious supply deficit due to increasing demand for propylene derivatives.

2. Traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking are costly due to high capital investment and feedstock costs, and produce more ethylene than propylene.

3. Propane dehydrogenation yields high propylene but is only cost-effective during limited periods, restricting production.

4. FCC units generate low yields of propylene.

5. Metathesis of ethylene and butylenes consumes high-value ethylene feedstock, making it unattractive.

The literature does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or its advantages, limitations, oxidant selection, or specific challenges associated with using oxygen. The document instead suggests catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins as a more reasonable process for high propylene yield, integrating it into refinery or petrochemical plants using less valuable feedstock.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于丙烯衍生物需求增加，导致严重的供应短缺。

2. 传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解成本高昂，因为需要大量资本投资和高昂的原料成本，而且生产的乙烯比丙烯多。

3. 丙烷脱氢法产率高，但只在一年中有限的时间内具有成本效益，限制了生产。

4. FCC装置产生的丙烯产量低。

5. 乙烯和丁烯的复分解法消耗高价值的乙烯原料，使其缺乏吸引力。

文献中没有讨论丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）及其优势、局限性、氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关的具体挑战。相反，文档建议将混合C4或更高碳烯烃的催化裂解作为一种更合理的高产丙烯工艺，将其整合到炼油厂或石化厂中，使用较低价值的原料。
