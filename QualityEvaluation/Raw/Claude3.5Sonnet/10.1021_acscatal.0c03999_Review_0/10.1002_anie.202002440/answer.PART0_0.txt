[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

[2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

[3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements and potential for coking in steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane. ODHP addresses these issues by offering thermodynamic favorability, allowing for lower reaction temperatures and reducing coking. 

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly in the context of using oxygen as an oxidant. The main challenge is the tendency for runaway over-oxidation of olefins, which leads to the formation of significant amounts of carbon oxides (COx). This over-oxidation problem has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process.

The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen enables the thermodynamic advantages, it also introduces the risk of unwanted complete oxidation. Finding catalysts and reaction conditions that can selectively activate propane while limiting oxidation to the desired propylene product remains a key challenge in developing commercially viable ODHP processes.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢过程中的高能耗需求和可能的结焦问题。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供热力学优势来解决这些问题，允许在较低的反应温度下进行，并减少结焦。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂的背景下。主要挑战是烯烃容易发生失控过度氧化，导致大量一氧化碳和二氧化碳(COx)的形成。这个过度氧化问题阻碍了ODHP过程的商业化。

在ODHP中，选择适当的氧化剂至关重要。虽然氧气能够提供热力学优势，但它也带来了不想要的完全氧化风险。找到能够选择性活化丙烷同时将氧化限制在所需丙烯产物的催化剂和反应条件，仍然是开发商业可行的ODHP过程的关键挑战。
