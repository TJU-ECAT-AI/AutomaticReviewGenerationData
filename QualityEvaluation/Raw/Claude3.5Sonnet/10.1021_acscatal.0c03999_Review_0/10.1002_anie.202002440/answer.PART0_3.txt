[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

[2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

[3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements and coking issues associated with steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane. ODHP addresses these issues by offering thermodynamic favorability, which allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coking. 

The main advantage of ODHP is its ability to operate at lower temperatures while suppressing coke formation, which can potentially lead to more energy-efficient and sustainable propylene production. However, ODHP faces a significant limitation in the form of runaway over-oxidation of olefins, resulting in the formation of substantial amounts of carbon oxides (COx). This over-oxidation problem has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process.

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents both advantages and challenges. While oxygen enables the thermodynamically favorable reaction conditions, it also introduces the risk of over-oxidation, leading to unwanted COx formation. The challenge lies in controlling the oxidation process to selectively produce propylene while minimizing the formation of fully oxidized products.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢所需的高能耗以及结焦问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供热力学有利条件来解决这些问题，允许在较低的反应温度下进行，并减少结焦。

ODHP的主要优势在于它能够在较低温度下运行，同时抑制焦炭形成，这可能导致更加节能和可持续的丙烯生产。然而，ODHP面临着烯烃失控过度氧化的重大限制，导致大量碳氧化物（COx）的形成。这种过度氧化问题阻碍了ODHP工艺的商业化。

在ODHP中选择氧气作为氧化剂既有优势也有挑战。虽然氧气能够实现热力学有利的反应条件，但它也引入了过度氧化的风险，导致不希望的COx形成。挑战在于控制氧化过程，以选择性地生产丙烯，同时最小化完全氧化产物的形成。
