[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

[2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

[3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements and potential for coking in steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane. ODHP addresses these issues by offering lower reaction temperatures and suppressing coking, due to its thermodynamic favorability. 

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly in the context of using oxygen as an oxidant. The main challenge is the runaway over-oxidation of olefins, which leads to significant formation of carbon oxides (COx). This over-oxidation problem has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process.

The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen enables the thermodynamically favorable reaction conditions, it also introduces the risk of over-oxidation. This creates a delicate balance between achieving sufficient conversion and maintaining high selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢过程中的高能耗和可能的结焦问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供较低的反应温度和抑制结焦来解决这些问题，这得益于其热力学有利性。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一些限制，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂的情况下。主要挑战是烯烃的失控过度氧化，导致大量一氧化碳和二氧化碳（COx）的形成。这个过度氧化问题阻碍了ODHP工艺的商业化。

在ODHP中选择适当的氧化剂至关重要。虽然氧气能够实现热力学有利的反应条件，但它也带来了过度氧化的风险。这就产生了在实现足够转化率和保持高选择性之间的微妙平衡。
