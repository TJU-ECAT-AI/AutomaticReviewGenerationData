[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

[2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

[3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements and potential for coking in steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane. ODHP addresses these issues by offering lower reaction temperatures and suppressing coking, making it thermodynamically favorable. However, ODHP presents its own limitation, primarily the challenge of controlling the oxidation process. The use of oxygen as an oxidant leads to the risk of over-oxidation, resulting in the formation of significant amounts of carbon oxides (COx). This undesired side reaction has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process, as it reduces the selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢过程中的高能耗需求和结焦潜在问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更低的反应温度和抑制结焦来解决这些问题，使其在热力学上更有优势。然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，主要是控制氧化过程的挑战。使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致过度氧化的风险，产生大量的碳氧化物（COx）。这种不期望的副反应阻碍了ODHP过程的商业化，因为它降低了目标产物丙烯的选择性。
