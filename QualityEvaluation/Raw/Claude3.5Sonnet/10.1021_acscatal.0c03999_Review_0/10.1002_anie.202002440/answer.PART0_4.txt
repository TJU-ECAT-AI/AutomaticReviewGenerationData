[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

[2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

[3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

[4] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy consumption: Steam cracking of naphtha and direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) require high temperatures.

2. Coking: Traditional methods suffer from carbon deposition on catalysts, reducing efficiency and catalyst lifetime.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower reaction temperatures, which reduces energy consumption.
2. Suppressing coking, which improves catalyst longevity and process efficiency.

Advantages of ODHP:
1. Thermodynamically favorable
2. Lower energy requirements
3. Reduced coking

Limitations of ODHP:
1. Over-oxidation of olefins, leading to significant COx formation

The main challenge associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is controlling its reactivity to prevent excessive oxidation of the desired products. This has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process.

Recent advancements using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst have shown promise in addressing the over-oxidation issue, producing olefins with minimal COx formation. This development may help overcome the primary limitation of ODHP and bring it closer to commercial viability.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：石脑油蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）需要高温。

2. 结焦：传统方法会导致催化剂上发生碳沉积，降低效率和催化剂寿命。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低的反应温度下运行，减少能源消耗。
2. 抑制结焦，提高催化剂寿命和过程效率。

ODHP的优势：
1. 热力学有利
2. 能源需求较低
3. 减少结焦

ODHP的局限性：
1. 烯烃过度氧化，导致大量COx形成

在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂的主要挑战是控制其反应性，以防止所需产物过度氧化。这阻碍了ODHP工艺的商业化。

最近使用六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂的进展显示出解决过度氧化问题的希望，可以生产出COx形成量很少的烯烃。这一发展可能有助于克服ODHP的主要限制，使其更接近商业可行性。
