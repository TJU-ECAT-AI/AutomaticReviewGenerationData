          [1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

          [2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

          [3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

          [4] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and coking issues associated with steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH). ODHP addresses these issues by offering thermodynamic favorability, which allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coking. 

          The main advantages of ODHP are:
          1. Lower energy requirements due to lower reaction temperatures
          2. Suppression of coking, improving catalyst longevity and process efficiency
          3. Thermodynamically favorable conditions

          However, ODHP faces significant limitations, particularly in the context of using oxygen as an oxidant:
          1. Runaway over-oxidation of olefins, leading to significant formation of carbon oxides (COx)
          2. Difficulty in controlling the oxidation process to selectively produce propylene while minimizing fully oxidized products

          The challenge of over-oxidation has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process. The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial, as oxygen enables thermodynamically favorable conditions but also introduces the risk of over-oxidation.

          Recent advancements using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst have shown promise in addressing the over-oxidation issue, producing olefins with minimal COx formation. This development may help overcome the primary limitation of ODHP and bring it closer to commercial viability.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）所需的高能耗以及结焦问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供热力学有利条件来解决这些问题，允许在较低的反应温度下进行，并减少结焦。

          ODHP的主要优势是：
          1. 由于反应温度较低，能源需求降低
          2. 抑制结焦，提高催化剂寿命和过程效率
          3. 热力学有利条件

          然而，ODHP面临着重大限制，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂的情况下：
          1. 烯烃的失控过度氧化，导致大量碳氧化物（COx）的形成
          2. 难以控制氧化过程，以选择性地生产丙烯，同时最小化完全氧化产物的形成

          过度氧化的挑战阻碍了ODHP工艺的商业化。选择适当的氧化剂至关重要，因为氧气能够实现热力学有利的条件，但也引入了过度氧化的风险。

          最近使用六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂的进展显示出解决过度氧化问题的希望，可以生产出COx形成量很少的烯烃。这一发展可能有助于克服ODHP的主要限制，使其更接近商业可行性。
