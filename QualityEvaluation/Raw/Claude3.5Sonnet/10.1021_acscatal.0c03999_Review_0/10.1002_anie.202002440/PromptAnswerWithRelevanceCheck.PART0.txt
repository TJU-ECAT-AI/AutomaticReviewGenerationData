[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

[2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

[3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements and potential for coking in steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane. ODHP addresses these issues by offering thermodynamic favorability, allowing for lower reaction temperatures and reducing coking. 

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly in the context of using oxygen as an oxidant. The main challenge is the tendency for runaway over-oxidation of olefins, which leads to the formation of significant amounts of carbon oxides (COx). This over-oxidation problem has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process.

The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen enables the thermodynamic advantages, it also introduces the risk of unwanted complete oxidation. Finding catalysts and reaction conditions that can selectively activate propane while limiting oxidation to the desired propylene product remains a key challenge in developing commercially viable ODHP processes.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢过程中的高能耗需求和可能的结焦问题。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供热力学优势来解决这些问题，允许在较低的反应温度下进行，并减少结焦。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂的背景下。主要挑战是烯烃容易发生失控过度氧化，导致大量一氧化碳和二氧化碳(COx)的形成。这个过度氧化问题阻碍了ODHP过程的商业化。

在ODHP中，选择适当的氧化剂至关重要。虽然氧气能够提供热力学优势，但它也带来了不想要的完全氧化风险。找到能够选择性活化丙烷同时将氧化限制在所需丙烯产物的催化剂和反应条件，仍然是开发商业可行的ODHP过程的关键挑战。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements and potential for coking in steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane. ODHP addresses these issues by offering lower reaction temperatures and suppressing coking, making it thermodynamically favorable. However, ODHP presents its own limitation, primarily the challenge of controlling the oxidation process. The use of oxygen as an oxidant leads to the risk of over-oxidation, resulting in the formation of significant amounts of carbon oxides (COx). This undesired side reaction has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process, as it reduces the selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements and coking issues associated with steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane. ODHP addresses these issues by offering thermodynamic favorability, which allows for lower reaction temperatures and reduced coking. 

The main advantage of ODHP is its ability to operate at lower temperatures while suppressing coke formation, which can potentially lead to more energy-efficient and sustainable propylene production. However, ODHP faces a significant limitation in the form of runaway over-oxidation of olefins, resulting in the formation of substantial amounts of carbon oxides (COx). This over-oxidation problem has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process.

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents both advantages and challenges. While oxygen enables the thermodynamically favorable reaction conditions, it also introduces the risk of over-oxidation, leading to unwanted COx formation. The challenge lies in controlling the oxidation process to selectively produce propylene while minimizing the formation of fully oxidized products.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢所需的高能耗以及结焦问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供热力学有利条件来解决这些问题，允许在较低的反应温度下进行，并减少结焦。

ODHP的主要优势在于它能够在较低温度下运行，同时抑制焦炭形成，这可能导致更加节能和可持续的丙烯生产。然而，ODHP面临着烯烃失控过度氧化的重大限制，导致大量碳氧化物（COx）的形成。这种过度氧化问题阻碍了ODHP工艺的商业化。

在ODHP中选择氧气作为氧化剂既有优势也有挑战。虽然氧气能够实现热力学有利的反应条件，但它也引入了过度氧化的风险，导致不希望的COx形成。挑战在于控制氧化过程，以选择性地生产丙烯，同时最小化完全氧化产物的形成。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy consumption: Steam cracking of naphtha and direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) require high temperatures.

2. Coking: Traditional methods suffer from carbon deposition on catalysts, reducing efficiency and catalyst lifetime.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower reaction temperatures, which reduces energy consumption.
2. Suppressing coking, which improves catalyst longevity and process efficiency.

Advantages of ODHP:
1. Thermodynamically favorable
2. Lower energy requirements
3. Reduced coking

Limitations of ODHP:
1. Over-oxidation of olefins, leading to significant COx formation

The main challenge associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is controlling its reactivity to prevent excessive oxidation of the desired products. This has hindered the commercialization of the ODHP process.

Recent advancements using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst have shown promise in addressing the over-oxidation issue, producing olefins with minimal COx formation. This development may help overcome the primary limitation of ODHP and bring it closer to commercial viability.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：石脑油蒸汽裂解和丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）需要高温。

2. 结焦：传统方法会导致催化剂上发生碳沉积，降低效率和催化剂寿命。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低的反应温度下运行，减少能源消耗。
2. 抑制结焦，提高催化剂寿命和过程效率。

ODHP的优势：
1. 热力学有利
2. 能源需求较低
3. 减少结焦

ODHP的局限性：
1. 烯烃过度氧化，导致大量COx形成

在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂的主要挑战是控制其反应性，以防止所需产物过度氧化。这阻碍了ODHP工艺的商业化。

最近使用六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂的进展显示出解决过度氧化问题的希望，可以生产出COx形成量很少的烯烃。这一发展可能有助于克服ODHP的主要限制，使其更接近商业可行性。
