          [1] "Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene."

[2] "There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking."

[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene."

[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide."

[5] "The answer to this problem may be oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2."

[6] "The use of oxygen can overcome the thermodynamic limitations, but leads to significant loss of styrene selectivity due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Heavy reliance on fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, coal) for production.
2. High global demand for propylene as a key petrochemical feedstock.
3. Limited efficiency and selectivity of traditional production methods.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative technology that can potentially reduce reliance on fossil fuel cracking.
2. Providing a more direct route to produce propylene from propane.
3. Potentially improving efficiency compared to traditional methods.
4. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative routes.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

1. When using oxygen as an oxidant:
   - There are issues with over-oxidation of products to carbon dioxide, reducing selectivity for the desired propylene.
   - Safety concerns due to the use of oxygen at high temperatures.
   - Significant loss of selectivity due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates.

2. Finding the right balance between reactivity and selectivity is crucial for ODHP to be commercially viable.

3. Catalyst development is essential for:
   - Effectively activating propane while controlling the oxidation process.
   - Improving selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions.

4. Process control and optimization are necessary to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation.

To address some of these challenges, alternative oxidants like CO2 are being explored:

1. CO2 as an oxidant may offer milder oxidation conditions and potentially improve selectivity.
2. It provides an opportunity for CO2 utilization, addressing greenhouse gas concerns.
3. Reduced risk of over-oxidation compared to using oxygen.

However, CO2-based ODHP also faces challenges:
1. Lower oxidizing power compared to oxygen, requiring more active catalysts.
2. Potential competition from reverse water-gas shift reactions.
3. Need for further research and development to achieve commercially viable conversions and selectivities.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 生产过程严重依赖化石燃料（石油、天然气、煤炭）。
2. 作为关键的石化原料，丙烯的全球需求量很大。
3. 传统生产方法的效率和选择性有限。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供一种可能减少对化石燃料裂解依赖的替代技术。
2. 为从丙烷生产丙烯提供更直接的路线。
3. 与传统方法相比，可能提高效率。
4. 克服非氧化路线的热力学限制。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时：
   - 产品过度氧化成二氧化碳的问题会降低目标产物丙烯的选择性。
   - 由于在高温下使用氧气而产生安全隐患。
   - 由于产生碳氧化物和含氧化合物导致选择性显著降低。

2. 找到反应性和选择性之间的正确平衡对ODHP的商业可行性至关重要。

3. 催化剂开发对以下方面至关重要：
   - 有效活化丙烷同时控制氧化过程。
   - 提高选择性并减少不需要的副反应。

4. 需要进行过程控制和优化，以最大化丙烯产率同时最小化副产物形成。

为解决部分挑战，正在探索使用CO2等替代氧化剂：

1. CO2作为氧化剂可能提供更温和的氧化条件，并可能提高选择性。
2. 提供了CO2利用的机会，解决温室气体问题。
3. 与使用氧气相比，过度氧化的风险降低。

然而，基于CO2的ODHP也面临挑战：
1. 与氧气相比氧化能力较低，需要更活跃的催化剂。
2. 可能与逆水气变换反应产生竞争。
3. 需要进一步的研究和开发才能实现商业可行的转化率和选择性。
