          [1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[2] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption"

[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[5] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites. However, even after decades of research propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A gap between propylene demand and supply due to the shift towards using shale gas in steam cracking, which produces more ethene but less propylene.
2. High energy consumption in conventional production methods.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reaction, lower temperatures).
2. Enhancing catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition.
3. Potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45% compared to conventional methods.

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

1. The main challenge is preventing the over-oxidation of propene to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (COx), which are more thermodynamically stable products.
2. Low propene selectivity, even with the most promising catalysts like supported vanadium oxide, remains a significant issue.

The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP, while beneficial for the reaction's thermodynamics and efficiency, introduces the significant challenge of controlling selectivity to prevent over-oxidation of the desired propene product.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于转向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解（产生更多乙烯但较少丙烯），导致丙烯供需出现差距。
2. 传统生产方法能源消耗高。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 由于热力学有利（放热反应，较低温度），提供了更高的反应效率。
2. 通过防止积碳沉积提高催化剂稳定性。
3. 与传统方法相比，有可能将能源消耗减少高达45%。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 主要挑战是防止丙烯过度氧化成更热力学稳定的一氧化碳和二氧化碳（COx）。
2. 即使使用最有前景的催化剂（如负载型钒氧化物），丙烯选择性仍然较低，这仍然是一个重大问题。

在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂，虽然有利于反应的热力学和效率，但也带来了控制选择性以防止所需丙烯产物过度氧化的重大挑战。
