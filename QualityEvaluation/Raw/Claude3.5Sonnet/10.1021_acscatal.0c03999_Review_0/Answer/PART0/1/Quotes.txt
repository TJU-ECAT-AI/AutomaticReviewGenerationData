[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."

[5] "More exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

[6] "Indeed, the use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."

[7] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry. However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[1] "As an improved reaction of the dehydrogenation of C3H8, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[2] "In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse water gas shift (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), and hence, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the product side."

[3] "Moreover, CO2 may also reduce the coking effect of catalyst by coke gasification (C + CO2 → 2CO)."

[4] "In an attempt to ameliorate the burgeoning growth in greenhouse gas emissions, there are currently intense efforts, world-wide, aimed at the utilisation of CO2, particularly in its conversion to fuels and high-value chemical products"

"C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O"
          "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with CO2 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2."
          "The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 °C 3600 h-1 and CO2/C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion and the ratio CO/(C2H4 + C3H6) = 1.4."
          "With increase of conversion of considerable olefin selectivity decrease is observed. Such a characteristic is explained by a higher degree of hydrocarbon conversion and by obtaining a more reduced mixture than in the case of ethane"

[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."

          [2] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

          [3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

          [4] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex."

          [5] "The presence of COz, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO."

[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

          [2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."

          [3] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

          [4] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction"

          [5] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

          [6] "the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand."

[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields."

[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures."

[4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS)"

[5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

[6] "Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."

[1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."

[2] "Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct. The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand"

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits."

[1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "It is expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxidation."

[4] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

[5] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control."

[1] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[3] "The attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[4] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

[1] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."

          [2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."

          [3] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."

          [4] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."

          [5] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, catalytic oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."

[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."

[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."

[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."

[1] "Catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1]."

[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."

[3] "Another way to increase the efficiency of dehydrogenation of light paraffins is to carry out the process in the presence of oxidizing additives, which remove hydrogen from the reaction and remove coke."

[4] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas [1]."

[5] "With respect to the dehydrogenation of paraffins, gallium catalysts have been studied relatively recently. These systems are less active, but they are characterized by high selectivity and stability [1, 1013], which can be very important for their industrial implementation."

[6] "Studies of the effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reactions of C2C4 paraffins on chromium oxide catalysts are promising lines in the development of these processes because they have shown a positive effect of CO2 on both the activity and the yield of olefins [39]."

[1] "Conventionally the production of olefins and diolefins has been carried out by thermal dehydrogenation using suitable catalysts. In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low per-pass yields are obtained."

          [2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."

          [3] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

          [4] "A significant advance was made in the oxidative dehydrogenation technology when the Shell group of companies achieved success in the iodine promoted dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene"

[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[2] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption"

[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[5] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites. However, even after decades of research propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

          [2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

          [3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

          [4] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

[4] "Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

[5] "Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

[6] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

[1] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield"

[2] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention"

[3] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[4] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%"

[2] "This process provides an attractive alternate route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."

[3] "Vanadia- and molybdena-based oxide catalyst systems have been found to be effective for this reaction, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities"

[4] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."

[5] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention"

          [2] "So far, a major part of the propylene demand has been supplied by conventional crackers"

          [3] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene"

          [4] "As a result, the new technologies of dehydrogenation of propane for propylene have been developed."

          [5] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation"

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC). However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[3] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[4] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

[4] "This is most likely due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and especially butane (Figure 1), which renders selectivity control a great challenge."

[5] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

          [2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

          [3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."

          [2] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."

          [3] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."

          [4] "Additionally, dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking of the feed."

          [5] "The LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 system with twice the stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for applicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."

[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products."

          [2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."

          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

          [4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

          [5] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."

[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."

[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."

[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

[5] "Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions, suitable conversion of paraffins, which often is limited by maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition, and suitable selectivity to olefins."

[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[2] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."

[3] "With air as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA increases with Cr content and reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8. The selectivity toward propene lies in the range of 42–53% for Cr content of 1–3.4 wt %"

[4] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."

[5] "In contrast, the selectivity toward propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

[1] "Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene."

[2] "There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking."

[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene."

[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide."

[5] "The answer to this problem may be oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2."

[6] "The use of oxygen can overcome the thermodynamic limitations, but leads to significant loss of styrene selectivity due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates."

[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3) Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

[4] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

[5] "Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation."

[1] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic"

[5] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

[1] "Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and fastest growing in demand petrochemicals. Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."

[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere"

[3] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[4] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[5] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide"

[6] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant"

[1] "The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the ever-increasing demand."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable"

[3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over-oxidation of propane"

[4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2"

[1] "Propylene is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation"
          
          [2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations"
          
          [3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity"
          
          [4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
          
          [5] "However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."

[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."

[5] "More exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

[6] "Indeed, the use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."

[7] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry. However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[1] "As an improved reaction of the dehydrogenation of C3H8, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[2] "In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse water gas shift (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), and hence, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the product side."

[3] "Moreover, CO2 may also reduce the coking effect of catalyst by coke gasification (C + CO2 → 2CO)."

[4] "In an attempt to ameliorate the burgeoning growth in greenhouse gas emissions, there are currently intense efforts, world-wide, aimed at the utilisation of CO2, particularly in its conversion to fuels and high-value chemical products"

"C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O"
          "The best catalyst for selective propane conversion with CO2 is also 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiO2."
          "The yield of C2-C3 olefins at 830 °C 3600 h-1 and CO2/C3H8 = 1.5 is 73% at 96% propane conversion and the ratio CO/(C2H4 + C3H6) = 1.4."
          "With increase of conversion of considerable olefin selectivity decrease is observed. Such a characteristic is explained by a higher degree of hydrocarbon conversion and by obtaining a more reduced mixture than in the case of ethane"

[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."

          [2] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

          [3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

          [4] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex."

          [5] "The presence of COz, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO."

[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

          [2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."

          [3] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

          [4] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction"

          [5] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

          [6] "the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand."

[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields."

[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures."

[4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS)"

[5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

[6] "Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."

[1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."

[2] "Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct. The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand"

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits."

[1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "It is expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxidation."

[4] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

[5] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control."

[1] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[3] "The attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[4] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

[1] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."

          [2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."

          [3] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."

          [4] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."

          [5] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, catalytic oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."

[2] "However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."

[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."

[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."

[1] "Catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1]."

[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."

[3] "Another way to increase the efficiency of dehydrogenation of light paraffins is to carry out the process in the presence of oxidizing additives, which remove hydrogen from the reaction and remove coke."

[4] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas [1]."

[5] "With respect to the dehydrogenation of paraffins, gallium catalysts have been studied relatively recently. These systems are less active, but they are characterized by high selectivity and stability [1, 1013], which can be very important for their industrial implementation."

[6] "Studies of the effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reactions of C2C4 paraffins on chromium oxide catalysts are promising lines in the development of these processes because they have shown a positive effect of CO2 on both the activity and the yield of olefins [39]."

[1] "Conventionally the production of olefins and diolefins has been carried out by thermal dehydrogenation using suitable catalysts. In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low per-pass yields are obtained."

          [2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."

          [3] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

          [4] "A significant advance was made in the oxidative dehydrogenation technology when the Shell group of companies achieved success in the iodine promoted dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene"

[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[2] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption"

[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[5] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites. However, even after decades of research propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."

[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."

          [2] "As a promising alternative, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), has gathered significant attention owing to its thermodynamic favorability characterized by low reaction temperatures and suppression of coking."

          [3] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."

          [4] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

[4] "Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

[5] "Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

[6] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

[1] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield"

[2] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention"

[3] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[4] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%"

[2] "This process provides an attractive alternate route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."

[3] "Vanadia- and molybdena-based oxide catalyst systems have been found to be effective for this reaction, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities"

[4] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."

[5] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention"

          [2] "So far, a major part of the propylene demand has been supplied by conventional crackers"

          [3] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene"

          [4] "As a result, the new technologies of dehydrogenation of propane for propylene have been developed."

          [5] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation"

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC). However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[3] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[4] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

[4] "This is most likely due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and especially butane (Figure 1), which renders selectivity control a great challenge."

[5] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

          [2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

          [3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."

          [2] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."

          [3] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."

          [4] "Additionally, dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking of the feed."

          [5] "The LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 system with twice the stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for applicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."

[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products."

          [2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."

          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

          [4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

          [5] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."

[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."

[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."

[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

[5] "Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions, suitable conversion of paraffins, which often is limited by maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition, and suitable selectivity to olefins."

[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[2] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."

[3] "With air as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA increases with Cr content and reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8. The selectivity toward propene lies in the range of 42–53% for Cr content of 1–3.4 wt %"

[4] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."

[5] "In contrast, the selectivity toward propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

[1] "Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene."

[2] "There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking."

[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene."

[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide."

[5] "The answer to this problem may be oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2."

[6] "The use of oxygen can overcome the thermodynamic limitations, but leads to significant loss of styrene selectivity due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates."

[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3) Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

[4] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

[5] "Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation."

[1] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic"

[5] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

[1] "Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and fastest growing in demand petrochemicals. Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."

[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere"

[3] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[4] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[5] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide"

[6] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant"

[1] "The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the ever-increasing demand."

[2] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation. The process is endothermic and the thermodynamic equilibrium is unfavorable"

[3] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and non-thermodynamically limited reaction. However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over-oxidation of propane"

[4] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives. The PDH in the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2-PDH) is also of interest because it utilizes the greenhouse gas CO2"

[1] "Propylene is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation"
          
          [2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations"
          
          [3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity"
          
          [4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
          
          [5] "However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."
