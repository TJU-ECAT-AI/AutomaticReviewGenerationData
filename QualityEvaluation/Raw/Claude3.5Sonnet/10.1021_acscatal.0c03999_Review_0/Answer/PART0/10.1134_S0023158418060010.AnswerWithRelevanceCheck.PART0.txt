          [1] "Catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1]."

[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."

[3] "Another way to increase the efficiency of dehydrogenation of light paraffins is to carry out the process in the presence of oxidizing additives, which remove hydrogen from the reaction and remove coke."

[4] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas [1]."

[5] "With respect to the dehydrogenation of paraffins, gallium catalysts have been studied relatively recently. These systems are less active, but they are characterized by high selectivity and stability [1, 1013], which can be very important for their industrial implementation."

[6] "Studies of the effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reactions of C2C4 paraffins on chromium oxide catalysts are promising lines in the development of these processes because they have shown a positive effect of CO2 on both the activity and the yield of olefins [39]."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly for chromium-based catalysts, include high coke deposition during operation, which reduces catalyst activity and requires frequent regeneration. This leads to decreased process efficiency and increased operational costs.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing an oxidizing agent, such as CO2, which helps to:
1. Remove hydrogen from the reaction
2. Remove coke from the catalyst surface
3. Maintain catalyst activity and stability

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages:
1. It avoids deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is used
2. It allows for efficient utilization of CO2, a greenhouse gas
3. It has shown positive effects on both catalyst activity and olefin yield

However, ODHP with CO2 also presents its own set of challenges:
1. CO2 can compete with propane for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially reducing propane conversion
2. Balancing the oxidative and dehydrogenation reactions to maximize propylene yield
3. Potential oxidation of reduced catalyst species necessary for dehydrogenation

The selection of oxidant is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen (O2) is a more reactive oxidant, it presents specific challenges:
1. Higher risk of deep oxidation, leading to the formation of COx instead of propylene
2. Reduced selectivity towards propylene formation
3. Potential safety concerns due to the explosive nature of hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures

Recent studies on gallium catalysts for dehydrogenation show promise in terms of high selectivity and stability, although they are less active than traditional chromium-based catalysts. This highlights the ongoing research efforts to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for propylene production.

In summary, while ODHP with CO2 addresses some of the major challenges in propylene production, such as coking and catalyst deactivation, it introduces new complexities related to reaction kinetics and catalyst design that need to be optimized for industrial implementation.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是对于铬基催化剂，包括运行期间的高焦炭沉积，这降低了催化剂活性并需要频繁再生。这导致工艺效率降低和运营成本增加。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化剂（如CO2）来解决这些问题，有助于：
1. 从反应中去除氢气
2. 从催化剂表面去除焦炭
3. 维持催化剂活性和稳定性

在ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂具有以下几个优点：
1. 避免了使用O2时发生的深度氧化反应
2. 允许高效利用CO2这种温室气体
3. 对催化剂活性和烯烃产率都显示出积极影响

然而，使用CO2的ODHP也带来了一系列挑战：
1. CO2可能与丙烷竞争催化剂表面的吸附位点，可能降低丙烷转化率
2. 平衡氧化和脱氢反应以最大化丙烯产率
3. 可能氧化脱氢所需的还原态催化剂物种

氧化剂的选择在ODHP中至关重要。虽然氧气（O2）是一种更具反应性的氧化剂，但它存在以下具体挑战：
1. 深度氧化风险更高，导致形成COx而不是丙烯
2. 对丙烯形成的选择性降低
3. 由于碳氢化合物-氧气混合物的爆炸性，存在潜在的安全隐患

最近对镓催化剂在脱氢反应中的研究显示出高选择性和稳定性的前景，尽管它们的活性低于传统的铬基催化剂。这突显了正在进行的研究努力，以开发更高效和稳定的丙烯生产催化剂。

总之，虽然使用CO2的ODHP解决了丙烯生产中的一些主要挑战，如结焦和催化剂失活，但它也引入了与反应动力学和催化剂设计相关的新复杂性，这些需要为工业实施进行优化。
