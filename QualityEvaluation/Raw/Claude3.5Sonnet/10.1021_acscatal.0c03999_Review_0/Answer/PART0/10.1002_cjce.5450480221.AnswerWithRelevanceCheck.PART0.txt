          [1] "Conventionally the production of olefins and diolefins has been carried out by thermal dehydrogenation using suitable catalysts. In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low per-pass yields are obtained."

          [2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."

          [3] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

          [4] "A significant advance was made in the oxidative dehydrogenation technology when the Shell group of companies achieved success in the iodine promoted dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene"

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

          1. Equilibrium limitations in conventional thermal dehydrogenation, resulting in low per-pass yields.
          2. While oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is not equilibrium limited, using oxygen alone as an oxidant leads to low product yields due to uncontrolled combustion reactions forming CO and CO2.

          Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

          1. Overcoming equilibrium limitations, as it produces water (a thermodynamically stable product) along with the olefinic product.
          2. Potentially increasing yields compared to thermal dehydrogenation.

          However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

          1. Using oxygen alone can lead to uncontrolled combustion and low product yields.
          2. The need to find suitable catalysts and reaction conditions to minimize unwanted side reactions and optimize propylene production.
          3. Balancing reactivity and selectivity to maximize propylene production while minimizing complete oxidation to CO and CO2.

          The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include:

          1. Controlling the oxygen concentration to avoid over-oxidation of the desired products.
          2. Managing the highly exothermic nature of the reaction, which can lead to hotspots and potential safety concerns.
          3. Developing catalysts that can selectively activate propane while suppressing complete oxidation pathways.
          4. Difficulty in controlling the reaction to prevent over-oxidation.
          5. Formation of undesired byproducts like CO and CO2.
          6. Potential safety concerns due to the flammable nature of hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures.

          To address these issues, researchers have explored using promoters like iodine or other halogens to improve the selectivity and yield of the ODH process.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

          1. 传统热脱氢法存在平衡限制，导致单程产率低。
          2. 虽然氧化脱氢(ODH)不受平衡限制，但单独使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致不受控制的燃烧反应，从而降低产品产率。

          丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

          1. 克服平衡限制，因为它在生成烯烃产品的同时也生成了水(一种热力学稳定的产物)。
          2. 与热脱氢相比，潜在地提高产率。

          然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

          1. 单独使用氧气时，可能发生不受控制的燃烧反应，导致产品产率低。
          2. 需要找到合适的催化剂和反应条件，以最小化不需要的副反应并优化丙烯产率。
          3. 平衡反应性和选择性，以最大化丙烯产量，同时最小化完全氧化为CO和CO2的情况。

          在ODHP中使用氧气的具体挑战包括：

          1. 控制氧气浓度，避免目标产物过度氧化。
          2. 管理反应的高度放热性，这可能导致热点和潜在的安全问题。
          3. 开发能够选择性活化丙烷同时抑制完全氧化途径的催化剂。
          4. 难以控制反应以防止过度氧化。
          5. 形成不需要的副产品如CO和CO2。
          6. 由于烃类-氧气混合物的易燃性而带来潜在的安全隐患。

          为解决这些问题，研究人员已经探索使用碘或其他卤素等促进剂来提高ODH过程的选择性和产率。
