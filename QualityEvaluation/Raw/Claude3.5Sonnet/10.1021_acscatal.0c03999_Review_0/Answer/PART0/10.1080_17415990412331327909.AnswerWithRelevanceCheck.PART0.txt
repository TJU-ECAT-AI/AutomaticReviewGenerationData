          [1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%"

[2] "This process provides an attractive alternate route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."

[3] "Vanadia- and molybdena-based oxide catalyst systems have been found to be effective for this reaction, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities"

[4] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."

[5] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low propylene yields (below 30%) due to selectivity losses at higher conversions.
2. Propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2).
3. Coke formation in non-oxidative routes.
4. Unselective combustion reactions limiting alkene selectivities in conventional catalyst systems.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower temperatures, which is thermodynamically favorable.
2. Using oxygen to inhibit coke formation common in non-oxidative routes.

ODHP advantages:
- Improved thermodynamics at lower temperatures
- Reduced coke formation

ODHP limitations and challenges:
1. Unselective combustion reactions still occur, limiting alkene selectivities.
2. Balancing conversion and selectivity remains difficult.
3. Using oxygen can lead to over-oxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing selectivity.

Oxidant selection challenges:
1. Oxygen use can result in undesired complete oxidation of hydrocarbons to CO and CO2.
2. Finding the right balance between conversion and selectivity is challenging.

The study introduces a novel approach using H2S as a gas-phase promoter in ODHP, which had not been previously investigated. This addition significantly reduces the formation of undesired products (COx, C2H4, and CH4) and increases propene selectivity, especially at short residence times. This innovative use of H2S as an oxidant offers a promising solution to improve propylene yields while mitigating the limitations associated with conventional oxygen-based ODHP.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于在高转化率下选择性损失，导致丙烯产率低（低于30%）。
2. 丙烯再吸附和随后氧化为碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。
3. 非氧化路线中的积碳形成。
4. 传统催化剂系统中非选择性燃烧反应限制了烯烃的选择性。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低温度下操作，这在热力学上更有利。
2. 使用氧气抑制非氧化路线中常见的积碳形成。

ODHP的优点：
- 在较低温度下热力学性能更好
- 减少积碳形成

ODHP的局限性和挑战：
1. 非选择性燃烧反应仍然存在，限制了烯烃选择性。
2. 平衡转化率和选择性仍然困难。
3. 使用氧气可能导致碳氢化合物过度氧化，降低选择性。

氧化剂选择的挑战：
1. 使用氧气可能导致碳氢化合物不希望的完全氧化为CO和CO2。
2. 在转化率和选择性之间找到适当的平衡仍然困难。

该研究引入了一种新方法，即在ODHP中使用H2S作为气相促进剂，这在之前未被研究过。这种添加显著减少了不需要产物（COx、C2H4和CH4）的形成，并增加了丙烯的选择性，尤其是在短停留时间内。这种创新性地使用H2S作为氧化剂为提高丙烯产率提供了一个有前景的解决方案，同时缓解了与传统的基于氧气的ODHP相关的限制。
