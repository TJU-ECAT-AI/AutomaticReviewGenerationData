          [1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."

          [2] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

          [3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

          [4] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex."

          [5] "The presence of COz, among other products, suggests that either the initial propane reaction may be unselective or some of the propylene product may be oxidised to C02 and HzO."

          The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitation of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by introducing an oxidative process, which removes these limitations and allows for higher conversion rates.

          ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates. However, it also comes with its own set of limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in this process, with various options being explored including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide.

          The specific challenges associated with using oxidants like sulphur dioxide include:
          1. Decreased selectivity to propylene formation, despite increased overall conversion rates.
          2. Complex reaction mechanisms that are not fully understood.
          3. Potential for unselective initial reactions or subsequent oxidation of the propylene product to CO2 and H2O.

          While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, it's important to note that oxygen's high reactivity could potentially lead to over-oxidation, forming undesired products like CO2 and water, which could affect selectivity and yield.

          These challenges highlight the need for further research to optimize the ODHP process, particularly in terms of improving selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates, oxidant selection, and understanding the complex reaction mechanisms involved.

          传统丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢反应的热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化过程来解决这个问题，消除了这些限制，并允许更高的转化率。

          ODHP具有提高整体转化率等优势。然而，它也带来了自身的一系列限制，特别是在选择性方面。在这个过程中，氧化剂的选择至关重要，正在探索的各种选项包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。

          使用诸如二氧化硫等氧化剂相关的具体挑战包括：
          1. 尽管整体转化率增加，但丙烯形成的选择性降低。
          2. 反应机理复杂，尚未完全理解。
          3. 可能发生不选择性的初始反应或丙烯产物随后被氧化成CO2和H2O。

          虽然文档没有明确讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，但值得注意的是，氧气的高反应性可能导致过度氧化，形成不需要的产物如CO2和水，这可能影响选择性和产率。

          这些挑战凸显了需要进行进一步研究以优化ODHP过程，特别是在提高选择性的同时保持高转化率、氧化剂选择和理解复杂反应机理方面。
