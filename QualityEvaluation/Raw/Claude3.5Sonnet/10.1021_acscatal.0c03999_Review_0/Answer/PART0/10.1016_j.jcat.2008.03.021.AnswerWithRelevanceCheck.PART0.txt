          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

          [2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

          [3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:
          
          1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.
          2. Environmental and practical concerns with chromium-based catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation.
          3. The need to utilize low-cost saturated feedstocks more efficiently.

          Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:
          
          1. Providing an alternative route to obtain propylene from low-cost propane feedstock.
          2. Offering potential for chromium-free catalysts, which are more environmentally friendly.

          However, the literature does not specifically discuss oxidant selection or challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP. The focus is primarily on non-oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 or in the absence of additional oxidants.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

          1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解满足不断增长的丙烯需求的能力有限。
          2. 用于丙烷脱氢的铬基催化剂存在环境和实际应用方面的问题。
          3. 需要更有效地利用低成本的饱和原料。

          丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

          1. 提供了一种从低成本丙烷原料获得丙烯的替代路线。
          2. 为无铬催化剂提供了潜力，这些催化剂更加环保。

          然而，文献并未具体讨论ODHP中的氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关的挑战。重点主要放在使用二氧化碳或在无额外氧化剂条件下的非氧化脱氢上。
