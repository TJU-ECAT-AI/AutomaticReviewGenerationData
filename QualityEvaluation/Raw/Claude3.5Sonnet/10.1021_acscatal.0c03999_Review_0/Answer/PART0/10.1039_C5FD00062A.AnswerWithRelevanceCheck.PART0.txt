          [1] "As an improved reaction of the dehydrogenation of C3H8, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[2] "In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse water gas shift (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), and hence, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the product side."

[3] "Moreover, CO2 may also reduce the coking effect of catalyst by coke gasification (C + CO2 → 2CO)."

[4] "In an attempt to ameliorate the burgeoning growth in greenhouse gas emissions, there are currently intense efforts, world-wide, aimed at the utilisation of CO2, particularly in its conversion to fuels and high-value chemical products"

          While the literature does not directly address all aspects of the question, it provides insights into an alternative approach to propylene production using CO2 as an oxidant in the dehydrogenation of propane. This method addresses some challenges in current propylene production:

1. Equilibrium limitations: CO2 shifts the equilibrium towards products by combining propane dehydrogenation with the reverse water gas shift reaction.
2. Catalyst coking: CO2 can reduce catalyst coking through gasification of carbon deposits.
3. Environmental concerns: The process utilizes CO2, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant include:
1. Milder reaction conditions compared to using oxygen
2. Improved catalyst stability due to reduced coking
3. Potential for CO2 utilization and reduction of emissions

Limitations and challenges may include:
1. Lower oxidizing power compared to oxygen, potentially resulting in lower conversion rates
2. Need for effective catalysts that can activate both propane and CO2
3. Potential for reverse water-gas shift reaction, which may affect product selectivity

The document does not specifically discuss challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP, so that part of the question cannot be directly answered based on the given information.

          虽然文献没有直接回答问题的所有方面，但它提供了使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢氧化剂的替代丙烯生产方法的见解。这种方法解决了当前丙烯生产中的一些挑战：

1. 平衡限制：CO2通过将丙烷脱氢与逆水气变换反应相结合，将平衡向产物方向移动。
2. 催化剂结焦：CO2可以通过碳沉积物的气化来减少催化剂结焦。
3. 环境问题：该过程利用CO2，可能减少温室气体排放。

使用CO2作为氧化剂的优势包括：
1. 与使用氧气相比，反应条件更温和
2. 由于结焦减少，催化剂稳定性得到改善
3. CO2利用和减排的潜力

局限性和挑战可能包括：
1. 与氧气相比氧化能力较弱，可能导致较低的转化率
2. 需要能够同时活化丙烷和CO2的有效催化剂
3. 可能发生逆水气变换反应，影响产物选择性

文献中没有具体讨论使用氧气作为ODHP氧化剂的挑战，因此无法根据给定信息直接回答该部分问题。
