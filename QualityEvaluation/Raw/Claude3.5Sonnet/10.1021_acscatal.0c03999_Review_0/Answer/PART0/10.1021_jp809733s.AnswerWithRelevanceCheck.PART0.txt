          [1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[2] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."

[3] "With air as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA increases with Cr content and reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8. The selectivity toward propene lies in the range of 42–53% for Cr content of 1–3.4 wt %"

[4] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."

[5] "In contrast, the selectivity toward propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

          The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is developing active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to alkenes. ODHP addresses this issue by offering a potential alternative route to produce propylene directly from propane.

The choice of oxidant is a critical factor in ODHP, presenting both advantages and limitations:

1. Air as oxidant:
   - Advantage: Higher propane conversion, increasing with chromium content and temperature.
   - Limitation: Lower selectivity towards propene (42-53% range).

2. N2O as oxidant:
   - Advantage: Higher selectivity towards propene.
   - Limitation: Much lower propane conversion compared to air.

The difference in performance between oxidants is attributed to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen formed.

Challenges associated with using oxygen (in air) include:
- Lower selectivity to propene compared to N2O.
- Potential over-oxidation, leading to the formation of undesired products.

The main advantage of ODHP is the potential for higher selectivity towards propene, especially when using N2O as an oxidant. However, limitations include lower conversion rates, particularly with N2O, and the need to balance conversion and selectivity.

Optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions to achieve industrially viable propylene yields remains an ongoing challenge in ODHP development.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是开发用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)制烯烃的活性和选择性催化剂。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种潜在的替代路线，直接从丙烷生产丙烯来解决这个问题。

氧化剂的选择是ODHP中的一个关键因素，呈现出优势和局限性：

1. 空气作为氧化剂：
   - 优势：更高的丙烷转化率，随铬含量和温度增加而增加。
   - 局限性：对丙烯的选择性较低（42-53%范围）。

2. N2O作为氧化剂：
   - 优势：对丙烯的选择性更高。
   - 局限性：与空气相比，丙烷转化率大大降低。

氧化剂性能差异归因于反应条件下铬的还原程度以及形成的表面氧的性质。

使用氧气（空气中）相关的挑战包括：
- 与N2O相比，对丙烯的选择性较低。
- 可能导致过度氧化，形成不需要的产物。

ODHP的主要优势是对丙烯有潜在的更高选择性，特别是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时。然而，局限性包括较低的转化率，特别是使用N2O时，以及需要平衡转化率和选择性。

优化催化剂和反应条件以达到工业可行的丙烯产率仍然是ODHP发展中的一个持续挑战。
