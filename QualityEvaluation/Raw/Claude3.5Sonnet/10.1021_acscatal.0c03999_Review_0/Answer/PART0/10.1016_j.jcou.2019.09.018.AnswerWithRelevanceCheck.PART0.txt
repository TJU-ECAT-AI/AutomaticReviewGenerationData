          [1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products."

          [2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."

          [3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH). A shared characteristic of all the aforementioned processes is utilising a co-reagent that either removes PDH thermodynamic limits or increases production through hydrogen binding in consecutive reactions."

          [4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

          [5] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

          1. Insufficient production capacity to meet growing demand. Current main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking) cannot satisfy the projected demand of 130 million tonnes by 2023.

          2. Attempts to increase propylene production through optimizing existing processes negatively impact the production of other important co-products.

          Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

          1. Providing a selective process dedicated solely to propylene synthesis.

          2. Utilizing a co-reagent (O2 or CO2) to remove thermodynamic limitations of traditional propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or increase production through hydrogen binding.

          3. Achieving higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propylene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

          Advantages of ODHP, particularly CO2-PDH:

          1. It can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilization.
          2. In addition to propylene, it produces valuable by-products like hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas).

          The literature does not specifically discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant or compare different oxidants in detail. Therefore, the specific advantages and limitations related to oxidant selection cannot be fully addressed based on the given information.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

          1. 生产能力不足以满足不断增长的需求。目前的主要来源（蒸汽裂解和催化裂解）无法满足预计到2023年达到1.3亿吨的需求。

          2. 通过优化现有流程来增加丙烯产量的尝试会对其他重要副产品的生产产生负面影响。

          丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

          1. 提供专门用于丙烯合成的选择性工艺。

          2. 利用共反应物（O2或CO2）来消除传统丙烷脱氢（PDH）的热力学限制或通过氢结合增加产量。

          3. 与商业非氧化脱氢相比，实现更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

          ODHP的优势，特别是CO2-PDH：

          1. 它可以成为化学CO2利用的一种有吸引力的方式。
          2. 除了丙烯，还能生产有价值的副产品，如氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）。

          文献并未具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，也没有详细比较不同氧化剂。因此，基于给定的信息，无法全面地讨论与氧化剂选择相关的具体优势和限制。
