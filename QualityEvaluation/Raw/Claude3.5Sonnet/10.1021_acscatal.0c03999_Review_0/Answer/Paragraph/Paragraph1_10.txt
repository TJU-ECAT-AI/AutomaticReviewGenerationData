Propylene production faces significant challenges due to increasing global demand and limitations of traditional production methods. The conventional steam cracking process is energy-intensive and produces unwanted by-products, while propane dehydrogenation (PDH) suffers from thermodynamic constraints and rapid catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has emerged as a promising alternative, offering several advantages such as lower energy requirements, improved atom economy, and the potential for higher propylene yields. ODHP operates at lower temperatures, reducing coke formation and extending catalyst lifetime. However, this process is not without limitations, including the need for precise control of oxidant concentration to prevent over-oxidation and the formation of undesired products like CO and CO2. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in ODHP, with oxygen being the most common but presenting safety concerns due to its explosive nature when mixed with hydrocarbons. Alternative oxidants like N2O and CO2 have been explored to address these issues, though they present their own challenges in terms of availability and reactivity. Despite these hurdles, ongoing research in catalyst development and process optimization continues to drive progress in ODHP technology, making it an increasingly viable option for sustainable propylene production in the future.
