[1] "Conventionally the production of olefins and diolefins has been carried out by thermal dehydrogenation using suitable catalysts. In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low per-pass yields are obtained."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."

[3] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Equilibrium limitations in conventional thermal dehydrogenation, resulting in low per-pass yields.

2. When using oxygen alone as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, uncontrolled combustion reactions occur, leading to the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which results in low product yields.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Overcoming equilibrium limitations, as it forms water, a thermodynamically stable product, along with the olefinic product.

2. Potentially improving yields compared to thermal dehydrogenation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. Using oxygen alone can lead to uncontrolled combustion reactions, reducing selectivity and yield.

2. The need to find suitable catalysts and reaction conditions to minimize unwanted side reactions and optimize propylene production.

While the document does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation, the principles discussed for butane and butene dehydrogenation can be applied to propane as well. The challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant highlight the need for alternative or modified approaches, such as the use of halogens or sulfur as promoters, to improve selectivity and yield in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 常规热脱氢的平衡限制，导致单程产率低。

2. 在氧化脱氢中单独使用氧气作为氧化剂时，会发生不受控制的燃烧反应，导致一氧化碳和二氧化碳的形成，从而降低产品产率。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 克服平衡限制，因为它在生成烯烃产品的同时形成热力学稳定的水。

2. 与热脱氢相比，有可能提高产率。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 单独使用氧气可能导致不受控制的燃烧反应，降低选择性和产率。

2. 需要寻找合适的催化剂和反应条件，以最大程度地减少不必要的副反应并优化丙烯生产。

虽然该文档没有特别讨论丙烷脱氢，但对丁烷和丁烯脱氢讨论的原理也可以应用于丙烷。使用氧气作为氧化剂所面临的挑战突显了需要替代或改进方法的必要性，例如使用卤素或硫作为促进剂，以提高氧化脱氢过程的选择性和产率。
