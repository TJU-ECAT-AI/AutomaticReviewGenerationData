[1] "Conventionally the production of olefins and diolefins has been carried out by thermal dehydrogenation using suitable catalysts. In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low per-pass yields are obtained."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."

[3] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Equilibrium limitations in conventional thermal dehydrogenation, resulting in low per-pass yields.

2. Uncontrolled combustion reactions when using oxygen alone as an oxidant, leading to low product yields and formation of undesired carbon oxides.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Overcoming equilibrium limitations, as it produces thermodynamically stable water along with the olefinic product.

2. Potentially improving yields compared to thermal dehydrogenation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. Using oxygen alone can lead to uncontrolled combustion and low selectivity.

2. There is a need to find suitable alternatives or promoters to oxygen that can improve selectivity and yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include controlling the reaction to prevent over-oxidation and optimizing catalyst design to promote selective oxidative dehydrogenation while suppressing complete combustion.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统热脱氢的平衡限制，导致单程产率低。

2. 单独使用氧气作为氧化剂时，会发生不受控制的燃烧反应，导致产品产率低和不良碳氧化物的形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 克服平衡限制，因为它在生成烯烃产品的同时产生热力学稳定的水。

2. 与热脱氢相比，可能提高产率。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 单独使用氧气可能导致不受控制的燃烧和低选择性。

2. 需要寻找合适的氧气替代品或促进剂，以提高选择性和产率，同时最大限度地减少不必要的副反应。

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括控制反应以防止过度氧化，以及优化催化剂设计以促进选择性氧化脱氢，同时抑制完全燃烧。
