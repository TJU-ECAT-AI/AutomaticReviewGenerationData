[1] "Conventionally the production of olefins and diolefins has been carried out by thermal dehydrogenation using suitable catalysts. In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low per-pass yields are obtained."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product. However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Equilibrium limitations in conventional thermal dehydrogenation, resulting in low per-pass yields.

2. While oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is not equilibrium limited, using oxygen alone as an oxidant leads to low product yields due to uncontrolled combustion reactions.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses the equilibrium limitation issue by forming water, a thermodynamically stable product, along with the olefinic product. This shifts the equilibrium towards product formation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. When using oxygen as the oxidant, there is a risk of uncontrolled combustion reactions, leading to the formation of undesired products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.

2. These side reactions result in low selectivity towards the desired propylene product.

The main advantage of ODHP is its potential to achieve higher yields compared to thermal dehydrogenation. However, the challenge lies in controlling the reactivity of oxygen to maximize propylene selectivity while minimizing complete oxidation to COx products.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统热脱氢法存在平衡限制，导致单程产率低。

2. 虽然氧化脱氢(ODH)不受平衡限制，但单独使用氧气作为氧化剂会导致产品收率低，这是由于存在不受控制的燃烧反应。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过形成水(一种热力学稳定的产物)和烯烃产物来解决平衡限制问题。这使平衡向产物形成方向移动。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在不受控制的燃烧反应风险，导致形成一氧化碳和二氧化碳等不需要的产物。

2. 这些副反应导致目标产物丙烯的选择性降低。

ODHP的主要优势是有潜力实现比热脱氢更高的产率。然而，挑战在于控制氧气的反应性，以最大化丙烯的选择性，同时最小化完全氧化为COx产物的副反应。
