          [1] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[3] "The attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[4] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks
2. Energy-intensive processes (endothermic reactions) such as steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation
3. Complex processing steps

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering a more energy-efficient process (exothermic reaction)
2. Simplifying the production process
3. Potential for using more sustainable feedstocks

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. Using O2 as an oxidant limits selectivity due to over-oxidation of both reactants and products to carbon oxides
2. CO2 has emerged as a promising alternative oxidant, offering milder oxidation conditions

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include:
1. Lower selectivity towards desired olefins
2. Formation of unwanted carbon oxides
3. Potential safety concerns due to the use of pure oxygen in hydrocarbon processes

The choice of oxidant significantly impacts the process efficiency, product selectivity, and overall sustainability of the ODHP method. While oxygen offers high reactivity, it poses challenges in controlling selectivity. CO2 as an oxidant may provide better selectivity but could have lower reactivity. Balancing these factors is crucial in developing an effective and economically viable ODHP process.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 依赖石油基原料
2. 能源密集型工艺（吸热反应），如蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢
3. 复杂的加工步骤

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供更高能效的工艺（放热反应）
2. 简化生产流程
3. 有潜力使用更可持续的原料

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用O2作为氧化剂会由于反应物和产物的过度氧化成碳氧化物而限制选择性
2. CO2作为一种有前景的替代氧化剂出现，提供了更温和的氧化条件

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括：
1. 对目标烯烃的选择性较低
2. 形成不需要的碳氧化物
3. 在碳氢化合物工艺中使用纯氧可能带来安全隐患

氧化剂的选择对ODHP方法的工艺效率、产品选择性和整体可持续性有显著影响。虽然氧气具有高反应性，但它在控制选择性方面带来了挑战。二氧化碳作为氧化剂可能提供更好的选择性，但反应性可能较低。平衡这些因素对于开发有效和经济可行的ODHP工艺至关重要。
