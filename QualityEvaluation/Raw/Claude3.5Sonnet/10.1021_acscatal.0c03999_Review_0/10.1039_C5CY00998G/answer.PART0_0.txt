[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[4] "The attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Reliance on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, which are energy-intensive and less sustainable.

2. The use of endothermic processes like steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation, which require significant energy input.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering higher energy efficiency as an exothermic process.
2. Providing process simplicity compared to current methods.
3. Presenting a more sustainable alternative to petroleum-based production.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. When using O2 as an oxidant, there is a risk of over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides from both the propane feedstock and the desired propylene product. This limits the selectivity towards olefins.

2. To address this limitation, CO2 has been explored as a milder oxidant. Its use in ODHP builds on successful applications in other partial oxidation reactions, such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane.

The selection of the appropriate oxidant is crucial in balancing reactivity and selectivity in the ODHP process, aiming to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and over-oxidation.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 依赖于石油基材料的非氧化加工，这些方法能源密集且可持续性较差。

2. 使用蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢等吸热过程，需要大量能量输入。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 作为放热过程提供更高的能源效率。
2. 相比当前方法提供更简单的工艺。
3. 为石油基生产提供更可持续的替代方案。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用O2作为氧化剂时，存在过度氧化的风险，导致丙烷原料和所需的丙烯产品都形成碳氧化物。这限制了对烯烃的选择性。

2. 为了解决这一限制，CO2被探索作为一种更温和的氧化剂。它在ODHP中的应用建立在其他部分氧化反应（如干重整和甲烷氧化偶联）的成功应用基础之上。

在ODHP过程中，选择适当的氧化剂对平衡反应性和选择性至关重要，旨在最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和过度氧化。
