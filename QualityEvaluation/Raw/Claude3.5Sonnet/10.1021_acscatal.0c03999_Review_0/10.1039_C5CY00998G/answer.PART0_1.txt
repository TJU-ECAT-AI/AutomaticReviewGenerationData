[1] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[3] "In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[4] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks and energy-intensive processes like steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency as an exothermic process and greater process simplicity.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there is a limitation in achieving high selectivity to olefins due to over-oxidation of both the feed (paraffins) and products (olefins) to carbon oxides. This has led to interest in using CO2 as a milder oxidant, which has shown promise in other partial oxidation reactions. The selection of oxidant significantly impacts the process efficiency, product selectivity, and overall viability of ODHP as an alternative propylene production method.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括依赖石油基原料和能源密集型工艺,如蒸汽裂解和催化脱氢。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更高的能源效率(作为放热过程)和更大的工艺简单性来解决这些问题。

然而,ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战,特别是在氧化剂选择方面。在使用氧气作为氧化剂时,由于原料(烷烃)和产品(烯烃)都会过度氧化成碳氧化物,因此在获得高选择性烯烃方面存在局限性。这导致了人们对使用CO2作为更温和氧化剂的兴趣,CO2在其他部分氧化反应中已显示出前景。氧化剂的选择显著影响了ODHP作为替代丙烯生产方法的工艺效率、产品选择性和整体可行性。
