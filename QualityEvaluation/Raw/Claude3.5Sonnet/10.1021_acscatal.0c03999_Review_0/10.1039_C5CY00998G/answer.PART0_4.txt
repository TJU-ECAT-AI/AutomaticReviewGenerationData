[1] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[3] "In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[4] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements and reliance on petroleum-based materials. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency as an exothermic process, compared to the endothermic nature of traditional methods. It also provides process simplicity and the potential for more sustainable alternatives.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there is a limitation in achieving high selectivity to olefins due to over-oxidation, which produces carbon oxides from both the feed paraffins and the desired olefin products. To address this issue, CO2 has been explored as a milder oxidant alternative, drawing on its successful application in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane.

The choice of oxidant significantly impacts the process efficiency, product selectivity, and overall sustainability of the ODHP method. While oxygen offers high reactivity, it poses challenges in controlling selectivity. CO2 as an oxidant may provide better selectivity but could have lower reactivity. Balancing these factors is crucial in developing an effective and economically viable ODHP process.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和对石油基材料的依赖。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更高的能源效率来解决这些问题,因为它是放热过程,而传统方法是吸热的。它还提供了工艺简单性和更可持续替代方案的潜力。

然而,ODHP也面临着自身的一系列挑战,特别是在氧化剂选择方面。在使用氧气作为氧化剂时,由于过度氧化会从原料烷烃和所需的烯烃产品中产生碳氧化物,因此在获得高烯烃选择性方面存在限制。为了解决这个问题,二氧化碳被探索作为一种更温和的氧化剂替代品,借鉴了它在其他部分氧化反应(如干重整和甲烷氧化偶联)中的成功应用。

氧化剂的选择对ODHP方法的工艺效率、产品选择性和整体可持续性有显著影响。虽然氧气具有高反应性,但它在控制选择性方面带来了挑战。二氧化碳作为氧化剂可能提供更好的选择性,但反应性可能较低。平衡这些因素对于开发有效和经济可行的ODHP工艺至关重要。
