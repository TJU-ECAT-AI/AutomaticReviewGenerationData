[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[2] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[3] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[4] "The attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[5] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Reliance on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, which are energy-intensive and less sustainable.

2. The use of endothermic processes like steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation, which require significant energy input.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering higher energy efficiency as an exothermic process.
2. Providing process simplicity compared to current methods.
3. Presenting a more sustainable alternative to petroleum-based production.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. When using O2 as an oxidant, there is a risk of over-oxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides from both the propane feedstock and the desired propylene product. This limits the selectivity towards olefins.

2. To address this limitation, CO2 has been explored as a milder oxidant. Its use in ODHP builds on successful applications in other partial oxidation reactions, such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane.

The selection of the appropriate oxidant is crucial in balancing reactivity and selectivity in the ODHP process, aiming to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and over-oxidation.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 依赖于石油基材料的非氧化加工，这些方法能源密集且可持续性较差。

2. 使用蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢等吸热过程，需要大量能量输入。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 作为放热过程提供更高的能源效率。
2. 相比当前方法提供更简单的工艺。
3. 为石油基生产提供更可持续的替代方案。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用O2作为氧化剂时，存在过度氧化的风险，导致丙烷原料和所需的丙烯产品都形成碳氧化物。这限制了对烯烃的选择性。

2. 为了解决这一限制，CO2被探索作为一种更温和的氧化剂。它在ODHP中的应用建立在其他部分氧化反应（如干重整和甲烷氧化偶联）的成功应用基础之上。

在ODHP过程中，选择适当的氧化剂对平衡反应性和选择性至关重要，旨在最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和过度氧化。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include their reliance on petroleum-based materials and energy-intensive processes like steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. These methods are endothermic and require high energy inputs.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and potentially more sustainable alternative. ODHP is an exothermic process, which means it releases heat rather than requiring it, leading to better energy efficiency. It also offers process simplicity compared to current methods.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in terms of oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there is a significant limitation in achieving high selectivity to olefins. This is due to the over-oxidation of both the propane feedstock and the produced olefins to carbon oxides, which reduces the yield of the desired products.

To address this limitation, researchers have explored the use of CO2 as a milder oxidant. CO2 has shown promise in other partial oxidation reactions and could potentially offer better selectivity in ODHP. However, using CO2 as an oxidant comes with its own challenges, such as the need for efficient catalysts that can activate CO2 and the potential for coking on the catalyst surface.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括依赖石油基原料和能源密集型工艺,如蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢。这些方法是吸热的,需要高能量输入。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更高能效和潜在更可持续的替代方案来解决这些问题。ODHP是一个放热过程,这意味着它释放热量而不是需要热量,从而提高能源效率。与现有方法相比,它还提供了工艺简单性。

然而,ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战,特别是在氧化剂选择方面。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时,在获得高烯烃选择性方面存在显著限制。这是由于丙烷原料和生成的烯烃都会过度氧化成碳氧化物,从而降低了所需产品的产率。

为了解决这一限制,研究人员探索了使用CO2作为更温和的氧化剂。CO2在其他部分氧化反应中表现出良好的效果,可能在ODHP中提供更好的选择性。然而,使用CO2作为氧化剂也带来了自身的挑战,例如需要能够活化CO2的高效催化剂,以及催化剂表面可能发生结焦的问题。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements and reliance on petroleum-based materials. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency as an exothermic process, compared to the endothermic nature of traditional methods. It also provides process simplicity and the potential for more sustainable alternatives.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there is a limitation in achieving high selectivity to olefins due to over-oxidation, which produces carbon oxides from both the feed paraffins and the desired olefin products. To address this issue, CO2 has been explored as a milder oxidant alternative, drawing on its successful application in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane.

The choice of oxidant significantly impacts the process efficiency, product selectivity, and overall sustainability of the ODHP method. While oxygen offers high reactivity, it poses challenges in controlling selectivity. CO2 as an oxidant may provide better selectivity but could have lower reactivity. Balancing these factors is crucial in developing an effective and economically viable ODHP process.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和对石油基材料的依赖。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更高的能源效率来解决这些问题,因为它是放热过程,而传统方法是吸热的。它还提供了工艺简单性和更可持续替代方案的潜力。

然而,ODHP也面临着自身的一系列挑战,特别是在氧化剂选择方面。在使用氧气作为氧化剂时,由于过度氧化会从原料烷烃和所需的烯烃产品中产生碳氧化物,因此在获得高烯烃选择性方面存在限制。为了解决这个问题,二氧化碳被探索作为一种更温和的氧化剂替代品,借鉴了它在其他部分氧化反应(如干重整和甲烷氧化偶联)中的成功应用。

氧化剂的选择对ODHP方法的工艺效率、产品选择性和整体可持续性有显著影响。虽然氧气具有高反应性,但它在控制选择性方面带来了挑战。二氧化碳作为氧化剂可能提供更好的选择性,但反应性可能较低。平衡这些因素对于开发有效和经济可行的ODHP工艺至关重要。
