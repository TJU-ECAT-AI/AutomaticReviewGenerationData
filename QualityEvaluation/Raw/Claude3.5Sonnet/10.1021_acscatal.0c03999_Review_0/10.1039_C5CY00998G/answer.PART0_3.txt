[1] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[3] "In this respect, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over-oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."

[4] "On such a basis, the use of CO2 as mild oxidant has attracted attention after the successful use in other partial oxidation reactions such as dry reforming and oxidative coupling of methane."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include their reliance on petroleum-based materials and energy-intensive processes like steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. These methods are endothermic and require high energy inputs.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and potentially more sustainable alternative. ODHP is an exothermic process, which means it releases heat rather than requiring it, leading to better energy efficiency. It also offers process simplicity compared to current methods.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in terms of oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there is a significant limitation in achieving high selectivity to olefins. This is due to the over-oxidation of both the propane feedstock and the produced olefins to carbon oxides, which reduces the yield of the desired products.

To address this limitation, researchers have explored the use of CO2 as a milder oxidant. CO2 has shown promise in other partial oxidation reactions and could potentially offer better selectivity in ODHP. However, using CO2 as an oxidant comes with its own challenges, such as the need for efficient catalysts that can activate CO2 and the potential for coking on the catalyst surface.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括依赖石油基原料和能源密集型工艺,如蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂解和催化脱氢。这些方法是吸热的,需要高能量输入。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更高能效和潜在更可持续的替代方案来解决这些问题。ODHP是一个放热过程,这意味着它释放热量而不是需要热量,从而提高能源效率。与现有方法相比,它还提供了工艺简单性。

然而,ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战,特别是在氧化剂选择方面。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时,在获得高烯烃选择性方面存在显著限制。这是由于丙烷原料和生成的烯烃都会过度氧化成碳氧化物,从而降低了所需产品的产率。

为了解决这一限制,研究人员探索了使用CO2作为更温和的氧化剂。CO2在其他部分氧化反应中表现出良好的效果,可能在ODHP中提供更好的选择性。然而,使用CO2作为氧化剂也带来了自身的挑战,例如需要能够活化CO2的高效催化剂,以及催化剂表面可能发生结焦的问题。
