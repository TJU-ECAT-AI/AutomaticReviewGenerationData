[1] "Propylene is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation [1,2,3]. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]."

[2] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]."

[3] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. This reaction thus provides a promising option to serve as a great example for CO2 utilization."

[4] "However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements and thermodynamic limitations associated with steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower energy requirements, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, the process faces challenges such as flammability risks and poor selectivity due to over-oxidation, resulting in the production of carbon oxides.

To address these issues, carbon dioxide has been proposed as a safer and milder alternative oxidant. This approach not only solves the problems associated with using oxygen but also provides an opportunity for CO2 utilization, making it an environmentally friendly option.

Despite these advantages, ODHP still faces challenges in designing catalytic systems that can achieve high product yields and good propylene selectivity. This is primarily due to the tendency of the formed alkenes to undergo further oxidation, which can reduce the overall efficiency of the process.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷脱氢过程中的高能耗和热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供较低的能量需求、消除催化剂再生的需要以及克服热力学限制来解决这些问题。

然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面也存在自身的优势和局限性。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，该过程面临着易燃风险和由于过度氧化导致的选择性差的挑战，从而产生碳氧化物。

为了解决这些问题，二氧化碳被提出作为一种更安全、更温和的替代氧化剂。这种方法不仅解决了使用氧气相关的问题，还提供了CO2利用的机会，使其成为一个环保的选择。

尽管有这些优势，ODHP在设计能够实现高产品产率和良好丙烯选择性的催化系统方面仍面临挑战。这主要是由于生成的烯烃容易进一步氧化，这可能会降低整个过程的整体效率。
