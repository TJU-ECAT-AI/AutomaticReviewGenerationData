[1] "Propylene is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation"

[2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations"

[3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity"

[4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements and thermodynamic limitations associated with steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower energy requirements, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic constraints.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there are risks of flammability and over-oxidation, leading to the production of carbon oxides and poor selectivity. To address these limitations, carbon dioxide has been proposed as a safer and milder alternative oxidant for ODHP. This approach aims to improve process safety and selectivity while maintaining the advantages of oxidative dehydrogenation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷脱氢过程中的高能耗需求和热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供较低的能源需求、无需催化剂再生以及克服热力学限制来解决这些问题。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在易燃性和过度氧化的风险，导致产生碳氧化物和较差的选择性。为了解决这些限制，二氧化碳被提出作为ODHP的一种更安全、更温和的替代氧化剂。这种方法旨在提高工艺安全性和选择性，同时保持氧化脱氢的优势。
