[1] "Propylene is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation [1,2,3]. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations [4, 5]."

[2] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity [6, 7]."

[3] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. This reaction thus provides a promising option to serve as a great example for CO2 utilization."

[4] "However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements, the need for catalyst regeneration, and thermodynamic limitations associated with steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower energy requirements, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there are risks of process flammability and over-oxidation, leading to the production of carbon oxides and poor selectivity towards propylene.

To address these limitations, carbon dioxide has been proposed as a safer and milder alternative oxidant. This approach not only solves the safety and selectivity issues associated with oxygen but also provides an opportunity for CO2 utilization, addressing environmental concerns.

Despite these advantages, designing an effective catalytic system for ODHP remains challenging. The main difficulty lies in achieving high product yield and good propylene selectivity while preventing the further oxidation of the formed alkenes. This balance is crucial for making the process commercially viable and competitive with existing production methods.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、催化剂再生的需求以及蒸汽裂解和丙烷脱氢过程中的热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更低的能耗、消除催化剂再生的需求以及克服热力学限制来解决这些问题。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在过程易燃性和过度氧化的风险，导致产生碳氧化物和丙烯选择性较差。

为了解决这些限制，二氧化碳被提出作为一种更安全、更温和的替代氧化剂。这种方法不仅解决了与氧气相关的安全和选择性问题，还提供了二氧化碳利用的机会，从而解决环境问题。

尽管有这些优势，设计有效的ODHP催化系统仍然具有挑战性。主要难点在于在防止生成的烯烃进一步氧化的同时，实现高产品产率和良好的丙烯选择性。这种平衡对于使该工艺具有商业可行性和与现有生产方法的竞争力至关重要。
