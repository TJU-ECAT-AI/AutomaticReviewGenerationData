[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feed stocks in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation"

[2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations"

[3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity"

[4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements and thermodynamic limitations associated with steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower energy requirements, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations. These advantages make ODHP a more favorable alternative to traditional methods.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there are concerns about process flammability and over-oxidation, which can lead to the production of carbon oxides and poor selectivity towards propylene.

To address the limitations associated with using oxygen, carbon dioxide has been proposed as a safer and milder alternative oxidant. This approach aims to solve the flammability and selectivity issues while maintaining the benefits of ODHP.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷脱氢过程中的高能耗需求和热力学限制。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更低的能量需求、消除催化剂再生的需要以及克服热力学限制来解决这些问题。这些优势使ODHP成为比传统方法更有利的替代方案。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在着工艺易燃性和过度氧化的担忧，这可能导致碳氧化物的产生和对丙烯的选择性降低。

为了解决使用氧气相关的限制，二氧化碳被提出作为一种更安全、更温和的替代氧化剂。这种方法旨在解决易燃性和选择性问题，同时保持ODHP的优势。
