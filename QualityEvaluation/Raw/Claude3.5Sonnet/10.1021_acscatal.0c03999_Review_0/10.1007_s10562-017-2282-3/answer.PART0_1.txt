[1] "Propylene is produced mostly by steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation"

[2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations"

[3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity"

[4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements and the need for frequent catalyst regeneration in steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower energy requirements, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and removing thermodynamic limitations.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there are risks of flammability and over-oxidation, leading to the formation of undesired carbon oxides and poor selectivity towards propylene. To overcome these limitations, carbon dioxide is proposed as a safer and milder alternative oxidant, which can potentially improve process safety and selectivity.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和丙烷脱氢过程中的高能耗需求和频繁的催化剂再生需求。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更低的能源需求、消除催化剂再生需求以及消除热力学限制来解决这些问题。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在易燃性和过度氧化的风险，导致形成不需要的碳氧化物和较差的丙烯选择性。为了克服这些限制，二氧化碳被提出作为一种更安全、更温和的替代氧化剂，有潜力提高工艺安全性和选择性。
