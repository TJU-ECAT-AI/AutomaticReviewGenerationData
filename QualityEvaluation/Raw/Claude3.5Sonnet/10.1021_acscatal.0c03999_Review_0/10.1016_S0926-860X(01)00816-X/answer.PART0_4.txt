[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."

[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."

[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

[5] "Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions, suitable conversion of paraffins, which often is limited by maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition, and suitable selectivity to olefins."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving high propane conversion while maintaining high propylene selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more efficient route to propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
1. ODHP can potentially overcome thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation.
2. It may operate at lower temperatures compared to thermal cracking processes.

Limitations:
1. Propylene is more easily oxidized than propane, leading to declining selectivity at higher conversions.
2. At temperatures above 700°C, propane cracking becomes significant, producing unwanted by-products.
3. Handling mixtures of propane and oxygen can be dangerous due to potential explosions.
4. Maintaining a safe propane-oxygen composition often limits the achievable conversion.

The selection of oxidant (oxygen) presents specific challenges:
1. Safety concerns due to the explosive nature of propane-oxygen mixtures.
2. Difficulty in controlling the oxidation process to stop at propylene rather than proceeding to carbon oxides.
3. Balancing the oxygen concentration to achieve high conversion while maintaining selectivity and safety.

To address these challenges, researchers are exploring various approaches, including developing more selective catalysts for both low and high-temperature operations, using membrane reactors to control reactant distribution, and implementing cyclic-operation reactors to separate the oxidation and reduction steps.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在实现高丙烷转化率的同时保持高丙烯选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种潜在的更高效的丙烯生产路线来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也存在其自身的优势和局限性：

优势：
1. ODHP可能克服常规脱氢的热力学限制。
2. 与热裂解过程相比，可能在较低的温度下运行。

局限性：
1. 丙烯比丙烷更容易被氧化，导致在高转化率下选择性下降。
2. 在700°C以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，产生不需要的副产品。
3. 处理丙烷和氧气的混合物可能因潜在的爆炸而危险。
4. 维持安全的丙烷-氧气组成常常限制了可实现的转化率。

氧化剂（氧气）的选择带来了特定的挑战：
1. 由于丙烷-氧气混合物的爆炸性，存在安全隐患。
2. 难以控制氧化过程在丙烯阶段停止，而不是继续进行到碳氧化物。
3. 平衡氧气浓度以实现高转化率，同时保持选择性和安全性。

为了应对这些挑战，研究人员正在探索各种方法，包括开发适用于低温和高温操作的更高选择性催化剂，使用膜反应器控制反应物分布，以及实施循环操作反应器以分离氧化和还原步骤。
