[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."

[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."

[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

[5] "Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions, suitable conversion of paraffins, which often is limited by maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition, and suitable selectivity to olefins."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving high propane conversion while maintaining high propylene selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering the potential for higher conversions and yields compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges:

1. Selectivity issues: Propylene is more easily oxidized than propane, leading to declining selectivity as conversion increases.

2. Temperature limitations: At temperatures above 700°C, propane cracking becomes significant, producing unwanted byproducts.

3. Safety concerns: Handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen can be dangerous due to the risk of explosions at certain compositions.

4. Conversion limitations: Maintaining safe paraffin-oxygen compositions often restricts the achievable conversion levels.

5. Catalyst development: There is an ongoing need for more selective catalysts that can operate effectively at both low and high temperatures.

The selection of oxidants in ODHP is crucial, with oxygen being the primary choice. However, using oxygen presents specific challenges:

1. Safety: The explosive nature of paraffin-oxygen mixtures necessitates careful control of compositions and process conditions.

2. Selectivity control: Oxygen's high reactivity can lead to over-oxidation of propylene, reducing selectivity.

3. Heat management: The highly exothermic nature of oxidation reactions requires efficient heat removal systems.

To address these challenges, researchers are exploring alternative approaches such as membrane reactors and cyclic-operation reactors, which aim to improve selectivity and safety by controlling the contact between propane and oxygen.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在实现高丙烷转化率的同时保持高丙烯选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供比传统脱氢方法更高的转化率和产率潜力来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战：

1. 选择性问题：丙烯比丙烷更容易被氧化，导致随着转化率的增加，选择性下降。

2. 温度限制：在700°C以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，产生不需要的副产品。

3. 安全问题：处理烷烃和氧气的混合物可能很危险，因为在某些成分下存在爆炸风险。

4. 转化率限制：维持安全的烷烃-氧气成分比例往往限制了可达到的转化水平。

5. 催化剂开发：需要开发能在低温和高温下有效运行的更具选择性的催化剂。

在ODHP中，氧化剂的选择至关重要，氧气是主要选择。然而，使用氧气带来了特定的挑战：

1. 安全性：烷烃-氧气混合物的爆炸性质需要仔细控制成分和工艺条件。

2. 选择性控制：氧气的高反应性可能导致丙烯过度氧化，降低选择性。

3. 热量管理：氧化反应的高放热性质需要高效的热量去除系统。

为了应对这些挑战，研究人员正在探索替代方法，如膜反应器和循环操作反应器，这些方法旨在通过控制丙烷和氧气之间的接触来提高选择性和安全性。
