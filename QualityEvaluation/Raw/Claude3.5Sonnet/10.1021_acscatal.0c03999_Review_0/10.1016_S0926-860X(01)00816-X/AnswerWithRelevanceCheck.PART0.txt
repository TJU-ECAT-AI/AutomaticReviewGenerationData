          [1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."

[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."

[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

[5] "Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions, suitable conversion of paraffins, which often is limited by maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition, and suitable selectivity to olefins."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more efficient route to propylene production, but it comes with its own set of advantages and limitations.

Advantages of ODHP:
1. Potential to overcome thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation.
2. Possibly operate at lower temperatures compared to thermal cracking processes.
3. Higher conversion rates and yields compared to traditional dehydrogenation methods.

Challenges and limitations of ODHP:
1. Selectivity issues: Propylene is more easily oxidized than propane, leading to declining selectivity as conversion increases.
2. Temperature constraints: At temperatures above 700°C, propane cracking becomes significant, producing various unwanted byproducts.
3. Safety concerns: Handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen can be dangerous due to the risk of explosive compositions.
4. Conversion limitations: Maintaining safe paraffin-oxygen compositions often restricts the achievable conversion rates.
5. Catalyst development: There is an ongoing need for more selective catalysts that can operate effectively at various temperature ranges.

The selection of oxidants, particularly oxygen, in ODHP presents specific challenges:
1. Safety: Oxygen can form explosive mixtures with propane, requiring careful control of reaction conditions.
2. Selectivity control: Oxygen's high reactivity can lead to over-oxidation, producing undesired products like CO and CO2.
3. Process control: Maintaining the right balance of oxygen to achieve high conversion while ensuring safety and selectivity is challenging.
4. Heat management: The highly exothermic nature of oxidation reactions requires efficient heat removal systems.

To address these issues, researchers are exploring alternative approaches such as:
1. Developing more selective catalysts for both low and high-temperature operations.
2. Using membrane reactors to separate propane and oxygen feeds and control reactant distribution.
3. Implementing cyclic-operation reactors to separate the oxidation and reduction steps.
4. Exploring alternative oxidants or oxygen carriers to mitigate safety concerns and improve selectivity.

Despite these efforts, propane oxydehydrogenation still faces significant hurdles before it can be commercially viable for propylene production.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供潜在的更高效丙烯生产路线来解决这些问题，但它也带来了自身的一系列优势和局限性。

ODHP的优势：
1. 有潜力克服传统脱氢的热力学限制。
2. 可能比热裂解过程在较低的温度下运行。
3. 与传统脱氢方法相比，具有更高的转化率和产率。

ODHP的挑战和局限性：
1. 选择性问题：丙烯比丙烷更容易被氧化，导致随着转化率的增加，选择性下降。
2. 温度限制：在700°C以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，产生各种不需要的副产品。
3. 安全隐患：处理烷烃和氧气的混合物可能因爆炸性成分而产生危险。
4. 转化率限制：维持安全的烷烃-氧气成分比例常常限制了可实现的转化率。
5. 催化剂开发：需要开发在各种温度范围内都能有效运作的更具选择性的催化剂。

ODHP中选择氧化剂（特别是氧气）带来的特定挑战：
1. 安全性：氧气可能与丙烷形成爆炸性混合物，需要仔细控制反应条件。
2. 选择性控制：氧气的高反应性可能导致过度氧化，产生不期望的产品如CO和CO2。
3. 过程控制：维持适当的氧气平衡以实现高转化率，同时确保安全性和选择性是具有挑战性的。
4. 热量管理：氧化反应的高放热性质需要高效的热量去除系统。

为解决这些问题，研究人员正在探索替代方法，如：
1. 开发适用于低温和高温操作的更高选择性催化剂。
2. 使用膜反应器分离丙烷和氧气进料，控制反应物分布。
3. 实施循环操作反应器，以分离氧化和还原步骤。
4. 探索替代氧化剂或氧载体，以减轻安全隐患并提高选择性。

尽管做出了这些努力，丙烷氧化脱氢在成为丙烯生产的商业可行方法之前仍面临着重大障碍。
