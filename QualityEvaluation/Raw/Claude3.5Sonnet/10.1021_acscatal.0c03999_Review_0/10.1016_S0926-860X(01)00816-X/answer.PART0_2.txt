[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."

[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion. Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

[3] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

[4] "Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions, suitable conversion of paraffins, which often is limited by maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition, and suitable selectivity to olefins."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Achieving high propane conversion while maintaining high propylene selectivity.

2. Propylene's higher susceptibility to oxidation compared to propane, leading to declining selectivity at higher conversions.

3. Propane cracking at temperatures above 700°C, resulting in various undesired products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:

1. Potentially allowing for lower operating temperatures, which could reduce unwanted side reactions.

2. Offering the possibility of higher conversion rates due to the presence of oxygen.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges:

1. Safety concerns related to handling explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen.

2. Difficulty in maintaining safe paraffin-oxygen compositions while achieving suitable conversion rates.

3. Achieving high selectivity to olefins in the presence of oxygen.

The selection of oxidant (typically oxygen) in ODHP is crucial, as it directly impacts safety, conversion rates, and selectivity. While oxygen enables higher conversion rates, it also introduces significant safety risks and selectivity challenges. Researchers are exploring various approaches to address these issues, including developing more selective catalysts, using membrane reactors, and implementing cyclic-operation reactors.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 在保持高丙烯选择性的同时实现高丙烷转化率。

2. 与丙烷相比，丙烯更容易被氧化，导致在高转化率下选择性下降。

3. 在700°C以上温度下丙烷发生裂解，产生各种不期望的产物。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了一些问题：

1. 可能允许在较低的操作温度下进行，从而减少不需要的副反应。

2. 由于存在氧气，可能提供更高的转化率。

然而，ODHP也带来了自己的一系列挑战：

1. 处理易爆的烷烃和氧气混合物带来的安全问题。

2. 在实现适当转化率的同时维持安全的烷烃-氧气组成的难度。

3. 在氧气存在的情况下实现对烯烃的高选择性。

ODHP中氧化剂（通常是氧气）的选择至关重要，因为它直接影响安全性、转化率和选择性。虽然氧气能够实现更高的转化率，但它也带来了显著的安全风险和选择性挑战。研究人员正在探索各种方法来解决这些问题，包括开发更具选择性的催化剂、使用膜反应器和实施循环操作反应器。
