[1] "Propane oxydehydrogenation combining high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity has proved an elusive goal, and propane oxydehydrogenation as a route to propylene appears to be far from realizing its commercialization potential."

[2] "One difficulty is that propylene is more easily oxidized than is propane, so that selectivity tends to decline rapidly with conversion."

[3] "Another is that at temperatures above about 700 C, propane cracking becomes significant, and a variety of products other than propylene are produced."

[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective catalysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving both high propane conversion and high propylene selectivity simultaneously. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more direct and energy-efficient route to propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges:

1. Selectivity issues: Propylene is more easily oxidized than propane, leading to a rapid decline in selectivity as conversion increases.

2. Temperature limitations: At temperatures above 700°C, propane cracking becomes significant, producing a variety of undesired products.

3. Catalyst development: There is a need for more selective catalysts that can operate effectively at both low and high temperatures.

4. Reactor design: Novel approaches such as membrane reactors and cyclic-operation reactors are being explored to improve propylene yields.

The selection of oxidant, particularly oxygen, presents additional challenges in ODHP:

1. Safety concerns: Handling mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen can be potentially explosive.

2. Conversion limitations: Maintaining safe paraffin-oxygen compositions often restricts the achievable propane conversion.

3. Over-oxidation: The use of oxygen can lead to the formation of undesired carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which are thermodynamically more stable than propylene.

Despite these challenges, ODHP continues to be an area of active research due to its potential advantages in energy efficiency and direct propylene production. However, significant improvements in catalysts, reactor designs, and process control are still needed for ODHP to become a commercially viable alternative to current propylene production methods.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种更直接和能源效率更高的丙烯生产路线来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也带来了自己的一系列挑战：

1. 选择性问题：丙烯比丙烷更容易被氧化，导致随着转化率的增加，选择性迅速下降。

2. 温度限制：在700°C以上的温度下，丙烷裂解变得显著，产生各种不需要的产物。

3. 催化剂开发：需要开发在低温和高温下都能有效运行的更具选择性的催化剂。

4. 反应器设计：正在探索诸如膜反应器和循环操作反应器等新方法来提高丙烯产率。

在ODHP中选择氧化剂，特别是氧气，带来了额外的挑战：

1. 安全问题：处理烃类和氧气的混合物可能具有爆炸性。

2. 转化限制：保持安全的烷烃-氧气组成通常会限制可实现的丙烷转化率。

3. 过度氧化：使用氧气可能导致形成不需要的碳氧化物（CO和CO2），这些物质在热力学上比丙烯更稳定。

尽管存在这些挑战，由于ODHP在能源效率和直接丙烯生产方面的潜在优势，它仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。然而，要使ODHP成为当前丙烯生产方法的商业可行替代品，仍然需要在催化剂、反应器设计和过程控制方面取得重大改进。
