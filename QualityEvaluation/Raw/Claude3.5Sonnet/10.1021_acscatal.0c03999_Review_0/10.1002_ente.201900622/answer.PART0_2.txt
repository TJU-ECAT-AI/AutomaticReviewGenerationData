[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

[4] "This is most likely due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and especially butane (Figure 1), which renders selectivity control a great challenge."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. High energy intensity: Steam cracking, the predominant method, is extremely energy-demanding.

2. Low yields for propane and butane: While ethane-to-ethylene processes can achieve yields up to 75%, propane and butane conversion is limited to around 30% yield due to side reactions.

3. Selectivity control: The weaker C-H and C-C bonds in propane and butane make it challenging to control selectivity.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Being less energy-intensive than steam cracking.

2. Potentially offering higher yields and selectivity for propylene production.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges:

1. Oxygen selection: The choice of oxidant is crucial for balancing reactivity and selectivity.

2. Over-oxidation: The presence of oxygen can lead to unwanted combustion reactions, reducing selectivity.

3. Catalyst development: Finding catalysts that can activate propane selectively while minimizing side reactions remains a significant challenge.

4. Temperature control: ODHP is exothermic, requiring careful temperature management to prevent hot spots and maintain selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 高能耗：蒸汽裂解作为主要方法，能耗极高。

2. 丙烷和丁烷的低产率：虽然乙烷制乙烯的过程可以达到75%的产率，但丙烷和丁烷转化的产率由于副反应的存在而限制在30%左右。

3. 选择性控制：丙烷和丁烷中较弱的C-H和C-C键使得控制选择性成为一个巨大的挑战。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 比蒸汽裂解的能耗更低。

2. 有潜力为丙烯生产提供更高的产率和选择性。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战：

1. 氧气选择：氧化剂的选择对于平衡反应性和选择性至关重要。

2. 过度氧化：氧气的存在可能导致不需要的燃烧反应，降低选择性。

3. 催化剂开发：寻找能够选择性活化丙烷同时最小化副反应的催化剂仍然是一个重大挑战。

4. 温度控制：ODHP是放热反应，需要仔细管理温度以防止热点并保持选择性。
