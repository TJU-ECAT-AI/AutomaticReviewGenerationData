[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

[4] "This is most likely due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and especially butane (Figure 1), which renders selectivity control a great challenge."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity, especially for steam cracking which is the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.

2. Limited yields for propane and butane conversion (around 30%) compared to ethane conversion (up to 75%).

3. Significant side reactions like cracking and combustion, especially for propane and butane.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:

1. Being an exothermic process, potentially reducing energy consumption compared to endothermic steam cracking.

2. Offering the possibility of higher selectivity and yields for propylene production.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges:

1. Selectivity control remains difficult due to the weaker C-H and C-C bonds in propane compared to ethane.

2. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, resulting in unwanted combustion products.

3. Catalyst design is crucial to minimize side reactions and improve propylene selectivity.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include managing its high reactivity to prevent complete oxidation of propane to CO2, and balancing the oxygen concentration to achieve optimal propylene yield while avoiding safety hazards associated with flammable mixtures.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗，特别是蒸汽裂解，它是化工行业中能耗最高的工艺。

2. 与乙烷转化率（高达75%）相比，丙烷和丁烷的转化率有限（约30%）。

3. 特别是对于丙烷和丁烷，存在显著的副反应，如裂解和燃烧。

丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了其中一些问题：

1. 作为一种放热过程，与吸热的蒸汽裂解相比，可能降低能耗。

2. 为丙烯生产提供更高的选择性和产率的可能性。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战：

1. 由于丙烷的C-H和C-C键比乙烷更弱，选择性控制仍然困难。

2. 使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致过度氧化，产生不需要的燃烧产物。

3. 催化剂设计对于最小化副反应和提高丙烯选择性至关重要。

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括控制其高反应性以防止丙烷完全氧化成CO2，以及平衡氧气浓度以达到最佳丙烯产率，同时避免与易燃混合物相关的安全隐患。
