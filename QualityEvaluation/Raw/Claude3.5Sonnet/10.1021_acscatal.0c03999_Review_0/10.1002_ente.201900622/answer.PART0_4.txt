[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

[4] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity: Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are extremely energy-demanding processes.

2. Limited yields for propane and butane: While ethane-to-ethylene processes can achieve yields up to 75%, propane and butane conversion typically results in yields of only 30% due to side reactions.

3. Over-reactivity of higher alkanes: Propane and butane are more reactive than ethane, leading to undesired cracking and combustion pathways.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Potentially reducing energy requirements compared to steam cracking.

2. Enabling more selective activation of light hydrocarbons under milder conditions.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges, particularly related to oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation and combustion products, reducing selectivity to propylene. The higher reactivity of propane compared to ethane makes controlling selectivity even more challenging when using oxygen.

Halogen-based routes, such as oxychlorination, are presented as an alternative approach that may offer better selectivity control under milder conditions. However, the literature does not provide specific details on the advantages or limitations of oxygen use in ODHP compared to other oxidants.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解是极其耗能的工艺。

2. 丙烷和丁烷的有限产率：虽然乙烷制乙烯工艺可以达到75%的产率，但丙烷和丁烷转化的产率通常只有30%，这是由于副反应所致。

3. 高级烷烃的过度反应性：丙烷和丁烷比乙烷更具反应性，导致不希望的裂解和燃烧途径。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 与蒸汽裂解相比，可能降低能源需求。

2. 在较温和的条件下实现轻烃的更选择性活化。

然而，ODHP面临自身的挑战，特别是与氧化剂选择有关。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致过度氧化和燃烧产物，降低丙烯的选择性。与乙烷相比，丙烷的反应性更高，这使得在使用氧气时控制选择性变得更具挑战性。

基于卤素的路线，如氧氯化，被提出作为一种可能在较温和条件下提供更好选择性控制的替代方法。然而，文献并未提供关于ODHP中使用氧气相比其他氧化剂的具体优势或限制的详细信息。
