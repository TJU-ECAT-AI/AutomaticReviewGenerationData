          [1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

[4] "This is most likely due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and especially butane (Figure 1), which renders selectivity control a great challenge."

[5] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity: Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are extremely energy-demanding processes, with steam cracking being the most energy-intensive process in the chemical industry.

2. Limited yields for propane and butane: While ethane-to-ethylene processes can achieve yields up to 75%, propane and butane conversion is limited to around 30% yields due to side reactions like cracking and combustion.

3. Selectivity control: The weaker C-H and C-C bonds in propane and butane make it challenging to control selectivity, leading to undesired side reactions.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Potentially reducing energy requirements compared to steam cracking, as it is an exothermic process.

2. Offering the possibility of higher selectivity and yields for propylene production under milder conditions.

3. Enabling more selective activation of light hydrocarbons.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges:

1. Oxidant selection: The choice of oxidant is crucial for balancing reactivity and selectivity. Using oxygen can lead to over-oxidation and unwanted combustion products.

2. Selectivity control: Due to the weaker bonds in propane, preventing complete oxidation and controlling selectivity remains challenging.

3. Catalyst development: Finding catalysts that can selectively activate C-H bonds without promoting complete oxidation is difficult.

4. Temperature control: The exothermic nature of ODHP requires careful temperature management to prevent hot spots and maintain selectivity.

5. Safety concerns: Working with mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen requires careful process design to avoid explosion risks.

The literature suggests that halogen-based routes, such as oxychlorination, may offer advantages in selectively activating light hydrocarbons under milder conditions, potentially addressing some of the challenges faced by ODHP with oxygen.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解是极其耗能的工艺，其中蒸汽裂解是化工行业中能耗最高的工艺。

2. 丙烷和丁烷的有限产率：虽然乙烷制乙烯的过程可以达到75%的产率，但丙烷和丁烷的转化率仅限于30%左右，这是由于裂解和燃烧等副反应造成的。

3. 选择性控制：丙烷和丁烷中较弱的C-H和C-C键使得控制选择性成为一个巨大的挑战，导致不希望的副反应。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 作为放热反应，可能比蒸汽裂解降低能源需求。

2. 在较温和的条件下为丙烯生产提供更高的选择性和产率的可能性。

3. 实现轻烃的更选择性活化。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战：

1. 氧化剂选择：氧化剂的选择对于平衡反应性和选择性至关重要。使用氧气可能导致过度氧化和不需要的燃烧产物。

2. 选择性控制：由于丙烷中键的较弱，防止完全氧化和控制选择性仍然具有挑战性。

3. 催化剂开发：寻找能够选择性活化C-H键同时不促进完全氧化的催化剂很困难。

4. 温度控制：ODHP的放热性质需要仔细管理温度以防止热点并保持选择性。

5. 安全考虑：使用烃类和氧气的混合物需要谨慎的工艺设计以避免爆炸风险。

文献表明，基于卤素的路线（如氧氯化）可能在温和条件下选择性活化轻烃方面具有优势，有可能解决ODHP使用氧气面临的一些挑战。
