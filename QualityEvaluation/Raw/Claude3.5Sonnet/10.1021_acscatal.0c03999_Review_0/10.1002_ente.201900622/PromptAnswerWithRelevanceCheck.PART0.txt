[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."

[4] "Although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity: Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are extremely energy-demanding processes.

2. Limited yields for propane and butane: While ethane-to-ethylene processes can achieve yields up to 75%, propane and butane conversion is limited to around 30% yields.

3. Side reactions: Cracking and combustion pathways reduce selectivity, especially for propane and butane.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Potentially operating at milder conditions: Halogen-based routes like oxychlorination enable selective activation of light hydrocarbons at lower temperatures and pressures.

2. Improved selectivity: By using oxygen as an oxidant, ODHP aims to improve selectivity compared to thermal processes.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges:

1. Oxidant selection: While oxygen improves selectivity, it also increases the risk of over-oxidation.

2. Catalyst development: Finding catalysts that can selectively activate C-H bonds without promoting complete oxidation remains challenging.

3. Temperature control: The exothermic nature of the reaction requires careful temperature management to prevent hotspots and maintain selectivity.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解是极其耗能的过程。

2. 丙烷和丁烷的有限产率：虽然乙烷制乙烯的过程可以达到75%的产率，但丙烷和丁烷的转化率仅限于30%左右。

3. 副反应：裂解和燃烧途径降低了选择性，尤其是对丙烷和丁烷而言。

丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 可能在较温和的条件下操作：像氧氯化这样的卤素基路线能在较低的温度和压力下选择性地活化轻烃。

2. 提高选择性：通过使用氧气作为氧化剂，ODHP旨在提高选择性，相比于热过程。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战：

1. 氧化剂的选择：虽然氧气提高了选择性，但也增加了过度氧化的风险。

2. 催化剂开发：找到能够选择性活化C-H键而不促进完全氧化的催化剂仍然具有挑战性。

3. 温度控制：反应的放热性质需要谨慎的温度管理，以防止热点并保持选择性。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity, especially for steam cracking which is the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.

2. Limited yields for propane and butane conversion (around 30%) compared to ethane conversion (up to 75%).

3. Significant side reactions like cracking and combustion, especially for propane and butane.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:

1. Being an exothermic process, potentially reducing energy consumption compared to endothermic steam cracking.

2. Offering the possibility of higher selectivity and yields for propylene production.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges:

1. Selectivity control remains difficult due to the weaker C-H and C-C bonds in propane compared to ethane.

2. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, resulting in unwanted combustion products.

3. Catalyst design is crucial to minimize side reactions and improve propylene selectivity.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include managing its high reactivity to prevent complete oxidation of propane to CO2, and balancing the oxygen concentration to achieve optimal propylene yield while avoiding safety hazards associated with flammable mixtures.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗，特别是蒸汽裂解，它是化工行业中能耗最高的工艺。

2. 与乙烷转化率（高达75%）相比，丙烷和丁烷的转化率有限（约30%）。

3. 特别是对于丙烷和丁烷，存在显著的副反应，如裂解和燃烧。

丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了其中一些问题：

1. 作为一种放热过程，与吸热的蒸汽裂解相比，可能降低能耗。

2. 为丙烯生产提供更高的选择性和产率的可能性。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战：

1. 由于丙烷的C-H和C-C键比乙烷更弱，选择性控制仍然困难。

2. 使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致过度氧化，产生不需要的燃烧产物。

3. 催化剂设计对于最小化副反应和提高丙烯选择性至关重要。

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括控制其高反应性以防止丙烷完全氧化成CO2，以及平衡氧气浓度以达到最佳丙烯产率，同时避免与易燃混合物相关的安全隐患。
