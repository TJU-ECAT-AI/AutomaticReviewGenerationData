[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."

[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

[4] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity: Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are extremely energy-demanding processes.

2. Limited yields for propane and butane: While ethane-to-ethylene processes can achieve yields up to 75%, propane and butane conversion to olefins is limited to around 30% yields due to side reactions like cracking and combustion.

3. Over-reactivity of higher alkanes: Propane and butane are more reactive than ethane, making selectivity control challenging.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Potentially lower energy requirements: As an exothermic process, ODHP may require less energy input than endothermic cracking processes.

2. Improved selectivity: By using oxygen as an oxidant, ODHP aims to achieve higher selectivity to propylene.

3. Milder reaction conditions: ODHP can operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to thermal cracking.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges:

1. Oxygen management: Controlling the oxygen concentration is crucial to prevent over-oxidation to CO and CO2.

2. Catalyst development: Finding catalysts that can selectively activate C-H bonds without promoting complete combustion is challenging.

3. Safety concerns: Working with mixtures of hydrocarbons and oxygen requires careful process design to avoid explosion risks.

The literature suggests that halogen-based routes, such as oxychlorination, may offer advantages in selectively activating light hydrocarbons under milder conditions, potentially addressing some of the challenges faced by ODHP with oxygen.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解是极其耗能的过程。

2. 丙烷和丁烷的有限产率：虽然乙烷制乙烯的过程可以达到75%的产率，但丙烷和丁烷转化为烯烃的产率仅限于30%左右，这是由于副反应如裂解和燃烧造成的。

3. 高级烷烃的过度反应性：丙烷和丁烷比乙烷更具反应性，使选择性控制变得具有挑战性。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 潜在的较低能耗：作为一个放热过程，ODHP可能比吸热裂解过程需要更少的能量输入。

2. 提高选择性：通过使用氧气作为氧化剂，ODHP旨在实现更高的丙烯选择性。

3. 更温和的反应条件：与热裂解相比，ODHP可以在较低的温度和压力下运行。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战：

1. 氧气管理：控制氧气浓度对防止过度氧化成CO和CO2至关重要。

2. 催化剂开发：找到能选择性活化C-H键而不促进完全燃烧的催化剂具有挑战性。

3. 安全考虑：使用烃类和氧气的混合物需要谨慎的工艺设计以避免爆炸风险。

文献表明，基于卤素的路线（如氧氯化）可能在温和条件下选择性活化轻烃方面具有优势，有可能解决ODHP使用氧气面临的一些挑战。
