<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide information about the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or details about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The text only contains the title and author information for a scientific paper on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over an alumina-supported vanadia catalyst, along with some publication details. It does not discuss the advantages, limitations, or challenges of ODHP or oxidant selection. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献没有提供关于目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战或丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的详细信息。文本仅包含一篇关于氧化铝负载钒催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢的科学论文的标题和作者信息，以及一些出版细节。它没有讨论ODHP或氧化剂选择的优势、局限性或挑战。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide information about the primary challenges in current propylene production methods, the advantages and limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), or the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. The abstract focuses on a study of alumina-supported vanadia catalysts for ODHP, mentioning the effects of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives, but does not address the broader context of propylene production methods or compare ODHP to other techniques.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献并未提供关于当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战、丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的优势和局限性，或使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战等信息。文摘主要聚焦于研究氧化铝负载的钒催化剂用于ODHP，提到了二氧化碳和二次表面金属氧化物添加剂的影响，但并未涉及丙烯生产方法的更广泛背景或将ODHP与其他技术进行比较。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature excerpt does not contain information about the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or details about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The title and author information provided do not offer sufficient context to answer the specific questions about ODHP advantages, limitations, oxidant selection, or challenges associated with using oxygen. To accurately address these questions, more comprehensive information from the full text of the article or additional sources would be required.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所给的文献摘录并未包含关于当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战或丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的详细信息。提供的标题和作者信息不足以回答有关ODHP优势、局限性、氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关挑战的具体问题。要准确回答这些问题，需要文章全文或其他来源的更全面信息。
