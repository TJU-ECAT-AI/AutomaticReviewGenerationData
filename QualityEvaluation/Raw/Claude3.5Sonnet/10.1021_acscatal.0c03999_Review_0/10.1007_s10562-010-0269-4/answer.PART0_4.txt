[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention"

[2] "So far, a major part of the propylene demand has been supplied by conventional crackers"

[3] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene"

[4] "As a result, the new technologies of dehydrogenation of propane for propylene have been developed."

[5] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Conventional crackers are unable to meet the increasing demand for propylene.

2. New technologies like propane dehydrogenation have been developed to address this supply gap.

3. However, propane dehydrogenation faces its own challenges:
   - It is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures.
   - High temperatures lead to unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking.
   - These side reactions produce coke and light alkanes, decreasing propylene yield and deactivating catalysts.

The literature does not specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or the selection of oxidants. Therefore, I cannot provide information on how ODHP addresses these issues or its specific advantages and limitations in the context of oxidant selection and challenges associated with using oxygen.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统的裂解装置无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 开发了新技术如丙烷脱氢来解决这一供应缺口。

3. 然而，丙烷脱氢也面临自身的挑战：
   - 这是一个需要高温的吸热过程。
   - 高温会导致不希望的副反应，如热裂解。
   - 这些副反应产生焦炭和轻烷烃，降低丙烯产率并使催化剂失活。

文献中没有具体讨论丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）或氧化剂的选择。因此，我无法提供关于ODHP如何解决这些问题，或其在氧化剂选择和使用氧气相关挑战方面的具体优势和局限性的信息。
