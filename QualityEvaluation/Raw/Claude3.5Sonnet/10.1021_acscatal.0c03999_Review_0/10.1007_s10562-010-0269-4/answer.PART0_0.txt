[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention"

[2] "So far, a major part of the propylene demand has been supplied by conventional crackers"

[3] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene"

[4] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Increasing demand that conventional crackers are struggling to meet
2. High temperatures required for propane dehydrogenation, which leads to:
   - Thermal cracking reactions producing coke and light alkanes
   - Decreased product yield
   - Increased catalyst deactivation

The document does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or its advantages, limitations, oxidant selection, or specific challenges associated with using oxygen. Therefore, this part of the question cannot be answered based on the given literature.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统裂解装置难以满足不断增长的需求
2. 丙烷脱氢需要高温，这导致：
   - 热裂解反应产生焦炭和轻烷烃
   - 产品产率降低
   - 催化剂失活加速

文献中没有讨论丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)及其优势、局限性、氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关的具体挑战。因此，无法根据给定的文献回答问题的这一部分。
