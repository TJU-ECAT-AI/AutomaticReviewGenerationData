[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention"

[2] "So far, a major part of the propylene demand has been supplied by conventional crackers"

[3] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene"

[4] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Conventional crackers are failing to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. High temperatures required for propane dehydrogenation lead to thermal cracking, coke formation, and catalyst deactivation.

The document does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or its advantages and limitations. It focuses on non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation using platinum-based catalysts. The paper does not address oxidant selection or challenges associated with using oxygen. Therefore, the full scope of the question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in this literature.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统的裂解装置无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 丙烷脱氢需要高温，这会导致热裂解、焦炭形成和催化剂失活。

该文档没有讨论丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)或其优缺点。它主要关注使用铂基催化剂的非氧化丙烷脱氢。文章没有涉及氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关的挑战。因此，仅根据本文献中提供的信息，无法全面回答该问题。
