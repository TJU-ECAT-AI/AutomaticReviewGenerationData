[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention"

[2] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene"

[3] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation"

The document does not directly discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. It focuses on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using platinum-based catalysts.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods mentioned are:

1. Conventional crackers are unable to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Propane dehydrogenation requires high temperatures, which leads to:
   - Thermal cracking reactions producing coke and light alkanes
   - Decreased product yield 
   - Increased catalyst deactivation

The document does not provide information on how ODHP addresses these issues or its specific advantages and limitations. It also does not discuss oxidant selection or challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP.

该文档并未直接讨论丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）或使用氧气作为氧化剂所带来的挑战。它主要关注使用铂基催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的过程。

文中提到的当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统的裂解装置无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 丙烷脱氢需要高温，这会导致：
   - 热裂解反应产生焦炭和轻烷烃
   - 产品收率下降
   - 催化剂失活加剧

文档没有提供关于ODHP如何解决这些问题或其具体优势和局限性的信息。它也没有讨论氧化剂的选择或在ODHP中使用氧气所带来的具体挑战。
