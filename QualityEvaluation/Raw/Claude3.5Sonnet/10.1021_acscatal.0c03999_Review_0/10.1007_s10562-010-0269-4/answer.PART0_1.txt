[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention [1]. So far, a major part of the propylene demand has been supplied by conventional crackers [24]. Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene [5]."

[2] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation [5]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Conventional crackers are failing to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Propane dehydrogenation requires high temperatures, which leads to:
   - Thermal cracking reactions producing coke and light alkanes
   - Decreased product yield 
   - Increased catalyst deactivation

The literature does not discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) or its advantages and limitations. It also does not mention oxidant selection or specific challenges associated with using oxygen. The focus is on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using platinum-based catalysts modified with additives like potassium.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统裂解装置无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 丙烷脱氢需要高温，这会导致：
   - 热裂解反应产生焦炭和轻烷烃
   - 产品产率下降
   - 催化剂失活加剧

文献中没有讨论丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)及其优缺点。也没有提到氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关的具体挑战。重点是使用经钾等添加剂改性的铂基催化剂进行丙烷催化脱氢。
