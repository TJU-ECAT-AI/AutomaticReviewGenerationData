The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy intensity, especially in steam cracking, which is considered the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry. Additionally, these processes primarily yield ethylene, creating a gap between propylene production and demand.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, one-step, and selective process for propylene production. This approach could result in substantial economic benefits compared to traditional methods.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about the advantages and limitations of ODHP, particularly regarding oxidant selection and challenges associated with using oxygen. The document focuses more on propane oxychlorination as an alternative method for propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗，特别是蒸汽裂解，被认为是化工行业中能耗最高的工艺。此外，这些工艺主要产出乙烯，造成了丙烯产量和需求之间的差距。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供潜在的更高能效、一步法和选择性工艺来解决这些问题，用于丙烯生产。与传统方法相比，这种方法可能带来显著的经济效益。

然而，文献并未提供关于ODHP的优势和局限性的具体信息，特别是关于氧化剂选择和使用氧气相关的挑战。该文档更多地关注丙烷氧氯化作为丙烯生产的替代方法。
