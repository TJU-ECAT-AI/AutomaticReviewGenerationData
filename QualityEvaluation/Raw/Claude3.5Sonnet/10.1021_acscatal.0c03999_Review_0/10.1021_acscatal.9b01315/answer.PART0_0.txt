The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity, especially for steam cracking which is considered the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.

2. Production of mainly ethylene rather than propylene, leading to a gap between propylene supply and demand.

3. Lack of selectivity and efficiency in current processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, one-step, and selective process for propylene production. This could result in substantial economic benefits compared to traditional methods.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about the advantages and limitations of ODHP, particularly regarding oxidant selection and challenges associated with using oxygen. Therefore, these aspects cannot be directly addressed based on the given text.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 能源密集度高，尤其是蒸汽裂解被认为是化工行业中最耗能的工艺。

2. 主要生产乙烯而非丙烯，导致丙烯供需之间存在差距。

3. 当前工艺缺乏选择性和效率。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供潜在的更节能、一步法和选择性工艺来解决这些问题，从而生产丙烯。与传统方法相比，这可能带来巨大的经济效益。

然而，文献中并未提供关于ODHP的优势和局限性的具体信息，特别是关于氧化剂选择和使用氧气相关的挑战。因此，基于给定的文本无法直接讨论这些方面。
