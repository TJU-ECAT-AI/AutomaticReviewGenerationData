[1] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."

[3] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."

[4] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."

[5] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, catalytic oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity: Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid-catalytic cracking are extremely energy-demanding processes.

2. Yield mismatch: These processes primarily produce ethylene, leading to a gap between propylene production and market demand.

3. Economic inefficiency: The high energy requirements and yield mismatch result in economic disadvantages.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering:

1. Lower energy requirements: As a one-step, selective alkane oxidation process, ODHP is less energy-intensive than traditional methods.

2. Targeted production: ODHP specifically aims to produce propylene, helping to bridge the gap between supply and demand.

3. Economic benefits: The more efficient process and targeted production can lead to substantial economic advantages.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. The literature doesn't provide specific information about the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP. Instead, it mentions catalytic oxychlorination using HCl and O2 as an attractive alternative route for propane-to-propylene transformation. This suggests that while oxygen-based ODHP may have limitations, the use of HCl alongside oxygen in oxychlorination could potentially overcome some of these challenges.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解是极其耗能的过程。

2. 产量不匹配：这些过程主要生产乙烯，导致丙烯生产与市场需求之间存在差距。

3. 经济效率低：高能耗和产量不匹配导致经济劣势。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了这些问题：

1. 能耗更低：作为一步法、选择性烷烃氧化过程，ODHP比传统方法能耗更低。

2. 定向生产：ODHP专门针对丙烯生产，有助于弥合供需差距。

3. 经济效益：更高效的过程和定向生产可带来巨大的经济优势。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。文献中没有提供关于在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战信息。相反，它提到了使用HCl和O2的催化氧氯化作为丙烷转化为丙烯的一种有吸引力的替代路线。这表明，虽然基于氧气的ODHP可能有局限性，但在氧氯化中使用HCl和氧气的组合可能会克服一些这些挑战。
