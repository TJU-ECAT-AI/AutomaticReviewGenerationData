[1] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."

[3] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity, especially for steam cracking which is considered the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.

2. Production of mainly ethylene rather than propylene, leading to a gap between propylene supply and demand.

3. Lack of selectivity and efficiency in current processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, one-step, and selective process for propylene production. This could result in substantial economic benefits compared to traditional methods.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about the advantages and limitations of ODHP, particularly regarding oxidant selection and challenges associated with using oxygen. Therefore, these aspects cannot be directly addressed based on the given text.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 能源密集度高，尤其是蒸汽裂解被认为是化工行业中最耗能的工艺。

2. 主要生产乙烯而非丙烯，导致丙烯供需之间存在差距。

3. 当前工艺缺乏选择性和效率。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供潜在的更节能、一步法和选择性工艺来解决这些问题，从而生产丙烯。与传统方法相比，这可能带来巨大的经济效益。

然而，文献中并未提供关于ODHP的优势和局限性的具体信息，特别是关于氧化剂选择和使用氧气相关的挑战。因此，基于给定的文本无法直接讨论这些方面。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy intensity and lack of selectivity. Steam cracking and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane, the main current methods, are extremely energy-demanding processes. They also produce a mixture of products, with ethylene as the main product rather than propylene.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient, one-step process that can be more selective towards propylene production. It has the potential to provide substantial economic benefits compared to traditional methods.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about oxidant selection challenges or limitations of ODHP using oxygen. Instead, it mentions catalytic oxychlorination as an attractive alternative route, which uses HCl and O2 as reactants with propane. This suggests that while ODHP with oxygen may have its own set of challenges, researchers are also exploring other oxidative routes to improve propylene production.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和选择性不足。蒸汽裂解和石脑油或乙烷的流化催化裂解是目前的主要方法，是极其耗能的过程。它们还会产生混合产物，主要产品是乙烯而非丙烯。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能、单步且更具选择性的丙烯生产过程来解决这些问题。与传统方法相比，它有潜力带来可观的经济效益。

然而，文献并未提供关于氧化剂选择挑战或使用氧气进行ODHP的局限性的具体信息。相反，它提到了催化氧氯化作为一种有吸引力的替代路线，该路线使用HCl和O2作为与丙烷反应的原料。这表明，虽然使用氧气的ODHP可能有自己的一系列挑战，但研究人员也在探索其他氧化路线以改进丙烯生产。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity: Traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid-catalytic cracking are extremely energy-demanding processes.

2. Yield mismatch: These processes primarily produce ethylene, leading to a gap between propylene production and market demand.

3. Economic inefficiency: The high energy requirements and yield mismatch result in economic disadvantages.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering:

1. Lower energy requirements: As a one-step, selective alkane oxidation process, ODHP is less energy-intensive than traditional methods.

2. Targeted production: ODHP specifically aims to produce propylene, helping to bridge the gap between supply and demand.

3. Economic benefits: The more efficient process and targeted production can lead to substantial economic advantages.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. The literature doesn't provide specific information about the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP. Instead, it mentions catalytic oxychlorination using HCl and O2 as an attractive alternative route for propane-to-propylene transformation. This suggests that while oxygen-based ODHP may have limitations, the use of HCl alongside oxygen in oxychlorination could potentially overcome some of these challenges.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解是极其耗能的过程。

2. 产量不匹配：这些过程主要生产乙烯，导致丙烯生产与市场需求之间存在差距。

3. 经济效率低：高能耗和产量不匹配导致经济劣势。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了这些问题：

1. 能耗更低：作为一步法、选择性烷烃氧化过程，ODHP比传统方法能耗更低。

2. 定向生产：ODHP专门针对丙烯生产，有助于弥合供需差距。

3. 经济效益：更高效的过程和定向生产可带来巨大的经济优势。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。文献中没有提供关于在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战信息。相反，它提到了使用HCl和O2的催化氧氯化作为丙烷转化为丙烯的一种有吸引力的替代路线。这表明，虽然基于氧气的ODHP可能有局限性，但在氧氯化中使用HCl和氧气的组合可能会克服一些这些挑战。

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in terms of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, potentially reducing selectivity to propylene and forming unwanted byproducts like carbon oxides. Controlling the reaction to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions remains a significant challenge in ODHP development.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 能源强度高，特别是蒸汽裂解被认为是化工行业中能耗最高的过程。

2. 主要生产乙烯而非丙烯，导致丙烯供需之间存在差距。

3. 当前工艺缺乏选择性和效率。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供潜在的更节能、一步法工艺来解决这些问题，可以选择性地生产丙烯。与传统方法相比，这种方法可能带来可观的经济效益。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致过度氧化，潜在地降低丙烯的选择性并形成不需要的副产品，如碳氧化物。在ODHP开发中，控制反应以最大化丙烯产率同时最小化不需要的副反应仍然是一个重大挑战。
