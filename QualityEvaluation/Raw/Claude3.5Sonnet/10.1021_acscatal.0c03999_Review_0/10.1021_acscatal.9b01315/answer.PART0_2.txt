[1] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."

[3] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."

[4] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, catalytic oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy intensity and lack of selectivity. Steam cracking and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane, the main current methods, are extremely energy-demanding processes. They also produce a mixture of products, with ethylene as the main product rather than propylene.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient, one-step process that can be more selective towards propylene production. It has the potential to provide substantial economic benefits compared to traditional methods.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about oxidant selection challenges or limitations of ODHP using oxygen. Instead, it mentions catalytic oxychlorination as an attractive alternative route, which uses HCl and O2 as reactants with propane. This suggests that while ODHP with oxygen may have its own set of challenges, researchers are also exploring other oxidative routes to improve propylene production.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和选择性不足。蒸汽裂解和石脑油或乙烷的流化催化裂解是目前的主要方法，是极其耗能的过程。它们还会产生混合产物，主要产品是乙烯而非丙烯。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更节能、单步且更具选择性的丙烯生产过程来解决这些问题。与传统方法相比，它有潜力带来可观的经济效益。

然而，文献并未提供关于氧化剂选择挑战或使用氧气进行ODHP的局限性的具体信息。相反，它提到了催化氧氯化作为一种有吸引力的替代路线，该路线使用HCl和O2作为与丙烷反应的原料。这表明，虽然使用氧气的ODHP可能有自己的一系列挑战，但研究人员也在探索其他氧化路线以改进丙烯生产。
