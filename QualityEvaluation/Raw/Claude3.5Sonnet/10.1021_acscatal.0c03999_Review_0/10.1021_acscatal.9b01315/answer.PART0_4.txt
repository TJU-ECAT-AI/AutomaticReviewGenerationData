[1] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."

[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."

[3] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."

[4] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy intensity, particularly for steam cracking which is considered the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.

2. Production of mainly ethylene rather than propylene, leading to a gap between propylene supply and demand.

3. Lack of selectivity and efficiency in current processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, one-step process that can selectively produce propylene. This approach could result in substantial economic benefits compared to traditional methods.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in terms of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant can lead to over-oxidation, potentially reducing selectivity to propylene and forming unwanted byproducts like carbon oxides. Controlling the reaction to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions remains a significant challenge in ODHP development.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 能源强度高，特别是蒸汽裂解被认为是化工行业中能耗最高的过程。

2. 主要生产乙烯而非丙烯，导致丙烯供需之间存在差距。

3. 当前工艺缺乏选择性和效率。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供潜在的更节能、一步法工艺来解决这些问题，可以选择性地生产丙烯。与传统方法相比，这种方法可能带来可观的经济效益。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致过度氧化，潜在地降低丙烯的选择性并形成不需要的副产品，如碳氧化物。在ODHP开发中，控制反应以最大化丙烯产率同时最小化不需要的副反应仍然是一个重大挑战。
