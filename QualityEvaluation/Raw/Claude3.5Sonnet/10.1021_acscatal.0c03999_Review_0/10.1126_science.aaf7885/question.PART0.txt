 Selective oxidation technology plays a pivotal role in the 
modern chemical industry (1). The scientific challenge for 
partial oxidations is the prevention of consecutive over-
oxidation of the desired product which is often more 
reactive 
than 
the 
parent 
substrate. 
The 
oxidative 
dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary 
example of such a challenging reaction. While propene is 
conventionally produced via steam cracking of large 
hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use 
shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases 
the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap 
between demand and supply of propene, as well as other 
higher olefins (2, 3). This disparity motivates the exploration 
of on-purpose propene technologies. Despite non-oxidative 
propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology 
used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction 
efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of 
favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction 
temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of 
coke deposition on the catalyst surface). It is estimated that 
the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be 
around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5). This gain in 
reaction efficiency, coupled with the fact that demand for 
propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes 
around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of 
ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale. The key 
scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, 
however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of 
propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO 
and CO2 (COx). 
To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show 
the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favora-
ble redox properties of the active vanadium sites (6, 7). 
However, even after decades of research propene selectivity 
remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion. As 
an example, at 10% propane conversion, the propene selec-
tivity typically drops to less than 60% for such conventional 
catalysts. The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for 
the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to bet-
ter control this partial oxidation (8). 
Here, we present both hexagonal boron nitride (h-
BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free 
materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction. While gra-
phene and fullerene materials are emerging as catalysts for 
partial alkane oxidations (911), BN materials, one of the 
inorganic analogues of graphene, have yet to be explored 
for their own catalytic activity. A supported vanadia on sili-
ca catalyst (V/SiO2) was used in this work to make direct 
comparisons to the catalytic performance of BN. These ma-
terials were loaded into a quartz tube reactor heated to 460-
500 C under flowing propane, oxygen and nitrogen as an 
inert carrier gas. Reaction parameters such as temperature, 
catalyst mass, total gas flow-rate, and partial pressures of 
propane (PC3H8) and oxygen (PO2) were varied to observe 
changes to product distributions by sampling the reactor 
exhaust stream via online gas chromatography and mass 
spectrometry. Gas contact time with the catalyst is repre-
sented in this work as the inverse-weight-hour-space-

The exothermic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reaction to generate propene has the potential to 
be a game-changing technology in the chemical industry. However, even after decades of research, 
selectivity to propene remains too low to be commercially attractive because of overoxidation of propene 
to thermodynamically favored CO2. Here, we report that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride 
nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibit unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great 
selectivity to olefins. As an example, at 14% propane conversion, we obtain selectivity of 79% propene 
and 12% ethene, another desired alkene. Based on catalytic experiments, spectroscopic insights and ab 
initio modeling, we put forward a mechanistic hypothesis in which oxygen-terminated armchair BN edges 
are proposed to be the catalytic active sites.

ied primarily by altering the total gas flow-rate. 
Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selec-
tivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP 
conditions. For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to 
propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A). Meanwhile, 
the traditional V/SiO2 allows for a modest 61% propene se-
lectivity at only 9% propane conversion (12). The obtained 
selectivities using state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (11, 13-19) 
are compared in Fig. 1A. The decrease in propene selectivity 
with increasing propane conversion is indicative of the fac-
ile over-oxidation of propene to COx. Comparisons between 
key reaction parameters of the referenced catalysts are in-
cluded in table S1. 
The entire product distribution further distin-
guishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia 
catalysts (Fig. 1B). When using the supported vanadia cata-
lyst the main byproducts are COx, accounting for 33% of 
total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion. Con-
versely, when using BN materials, the main byproduct is 
ethene, a highly valuable olefin itself, rather than COx. The 
combined propene and ethene selectivity is 91% at 14% pro-
pane conversion using h-BN (fig. S1). We furthermore veri-
fied that the catalytic activity of the BN material remains 
stable for at least 32 hours on stream (fig. S2), validating the 
catalyst stability. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) 
images of the h-BN material before and after the ODHP re-
action did not reveal any changes to the morphology of the 
material (fig. S3). Carbon balances for all reactions close 
within >98%. 
The analogous product distributions for both h-BN 
and BNNTs suggest a similar reaction mechanism for these 
BN materials. However, BNNTs exhibit a rate of propane 
consumption [mol C3H8 kg-cat1 s1] more than one order-of-
magnitude higher than observed with h-BN (fig. S4). The 
higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher 
surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT: 975 m2 g1 
versus h-BN: 161 m2 g1) (20); however, the rate of propane 
consumption is more than three times higher with BNNT 
than with h-BN when normalized for surface area (BNNT: 
3.6 ×107 mol C3H8 s1 m2 versus h-BN: 1.1 × 107 mol C3H8 s1 
m2). This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results 
in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene 
productivity [kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1] (Fig. 1C), comparable to 
values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of 
this "on-purpose" propene technology (15, 21). 
Further kinetic insights were obtained by studying 
the influence of reactant concentrations (PO2, PC3H8) on the 
reaction rate. The inclusion of oxygen as a reactant is re-
quired for propane conversion using BN materials. The rate 
of propane consumption using h-BN indicates oxygen acti-
vation on the BN surface (Fig. 2A) and second-order de-
pendence with respect to PC3H8 (Fig. 2B). This kinetic 
behavior clearly distinguishes boron nitride from traditional 
supported vanadia catalysts, which follow a Mars van 
Krevelen mechanism (rate-determining substrate oxidation, 
followed by fast re-oxidation of the surface by oxygen) that 
typically leads to zero-order rate dependence with respect to 
PO2 and first order in PC3H8 (22). 
It is surprising that BN, a material known for its 
high stability under oxidative conditions (23, 24), is catalyti-
cally active at all. So far it has been explored for its unique 
electronic, thermoelectric and mechanical properties (25
28). The combination of the interesting observations out-
lined in this work (i.e., improved selectivity to olefins and 
different reaction kinetics) points towards a novel, funda-
mentally different reaction mechanism in conjunction with 
a different active site compared to other, previously studied 
and better understood catalysts for this reaction. Indeed, 
boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing 
different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic 
performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said 
metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a signif-
icant role. 
To better understand the catalytically active parts of 
the material and to provide evidence for oxygen functionali-
zation of the BN surface when exposed to ODHP reaction 
conditions, we used a combination of X-ray Photoelectron 
Spectroscopy (XPS), Attenuated Total Reflectance IR (ATR-
IR), and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform 
Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements to characterize the 
material before (fresh) and after (spent) exposure to the 
ODHP reaction mixture. As a first step we used XPS to mon-
itor the surface concentrations of boron, nitrogen and oxy-
gen of h-BN (table S1) and observed an increase in the 
amount of surface oxygen in spent h-BN material, signaling 
oxygen functionalization. The same increase in surface oxy-
gen content was not observed for h-BN exposed only to air 
at 490C, indicating the hydrocarbon must be present for 
oxygen to functionalize the surface of h-BN. This observa-
tion was corroborated with ATR-IR measurements, which 
showed the emergence of a broad feature around 3200 cm1 
and a sharp signal 1190 cm1 for spent h-BN (fig. S8A), as-
signed to OH-stretching and B-O stretching vibrations, re-
spectively (29, 30). These spectroscopic features were absent 
with fresh h-BN, as well as h-BN treated only under air at 
490C. Using DRIFTS, we saw more-resolved features ap-
pear at 3420 and 3250 cm1 with spent h-BN (fig. S8B). 
BNNT show a similar behavior, only with a significant in-
tensity in the given spectral range already present for the

fresh samples and a corresponding increased intensity for 
the spent materials (fig. S9). 
The appearance and change of the different spec-
troscopic features furthermore indicates that a site is creat-
ed by exposure of the material to propane and oxygen and 
that, in line with the higher intensity of this feature, a larger 
amount of these sites is present in the BNNT sample and 
the exposure to both propane and oxygen leads to the crea-
tion of those sites. To elucidate the origin of these vibrations 
we performed ab-initio DFT calculations using the Vienna 
Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) (31, 32). All computa-
tional details are given in the Supporting Information. We 
focused on a single BN-sheet and calculated vibrational fre-
quencies for a set of OH-terminated zig-zag and armchair 
edges. All structures and corresponding vibrational frequen-
cies over 3000 cm1 are given in fig. S10. When comparing 
the modeled wavenumbers to the experimental measure-
ments we find that especially the armchair edge leads to 
features in the studied range, the feature around 3420 cm1 
corresponding to a single OH-stretch, displayed in movie S1 
and the feature around 3250 cm1 associated with a concert-
ed stretching vibration, displayed in movie S2. 
Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, 
spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with 
the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we there-
fore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and 
one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-
N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction. This site 
shows similarities to work in the semiconductor literature 
focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (28), 
as well as the proposed active sites of graphene and fuller-
ene materials for similar oxidations (10, 11). These >B-O-O-
N< sites can be viewed as inorganic peroxide species, able to 
perform oxidation reactions. Starting from our modeled ac-
tive site (viz., >B-O-O-N<), we then calculated key interme-
diates for the ODHP reaction. We suggest that the 
dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen 
atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >B-O-O-
N< sites, breaking the O-O bond while forming a B-OH spe-
cies and one nitroxyl-radical (Fig. 3C). This reaction is remi-
niscent of an alkyl hydroperoxide reaction proposed earlier 
to explain the formation of radicals in homogeneous autoxi-
dation systems (RO-OH + H-R 
 RO
• + HOH + •R) (33). 
However, in the case of the surface catalyzed reaction, we 
anticipate a rebound step where the secondary-propyl radi-
cal reacts rapidly with the nitroxyl-radical, forming a sur-
face-stabilized propyl intermediate (viz., >N-O-CH(CH3)2) 
(Fig. 3D). 
We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may 
largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by 
the nitroxyl-radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional nature 
of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl 
radical (typical of zero-dimensional single site catalysts) 
(34), and also the over-oxidation of the adsorbed species 
(typical of two-dimensional surface catalysts) is suppressed 
(35). The proposed intermediate structures and energies of 
the overall catalytic cycle are included in fig. S11. We envi-
sion a second abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a prima-
ry carbon follows another radical rebound, creating a di-
propoxyl intermediate. Desorption of propene and the reor-
ganization of hydrogen atoms along the edge forms water as 
a side-product. The desorption of water is followed by oxy-
gen addition to regenerate the >B-O-O-N< active site. Simi-
lar surface reorganization of hydroxyl groups in the 
presence of oxygen was proposed for related carbon nano-
filament catalysts for ODH of ethylbenzene to form styrene 
(36). All steps in this process, except for desorption of pro-
pene, are exothermic. The second order rate dependence 
with respect to PC3H8 suggests that two propane molecules 
are required to generate two molecules of water, in line with 
the overall stoichiometry of the reaction. The desorption of 
these water molecules forms BN edge vacancies allowing for 
unique O2 activation, explaining the influence that the sur-
face coverage of adsorbed oxygen has on the rate of propane 
consumption.
