[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[2] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[3] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

[4] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites. However, even after decades of research propene selectivity remains too low, even at moderate propane conversion."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A gap between propylene demand and supply due to the shift towards using shale gas in steam cracking, which produces more ethene but less propylene.

2. Inefficiency and high energy consumption in conventional production methods.

ODHP addresses these issues by:

1. Offering improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reaction, lower temperatures).
2. Enhancing catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition.
3. Potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45%.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly:

1. The prevention of over-oxidation of propene to CO and CO2, which are thermodynamically more stable.
2. Low propene selectivity, even with the most promising catalysts like supported vanadium oxide.

The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP offers advantages in terms of reaction efficiency and catalyst stability, but it also introduces the challenge of controlling selectivity to prevent over-oxidation of the desired propene product.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于转向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解（产生更多乙烯但更少丙烯），导致丙烯供需不平衡。

2. 传统生产方法效率低下且能耗高。

ODHP通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 由于热力学有利（放热反应，较低温度），提高了反应效率。
2. 通过防止积碳沉积增强了催化剂稳定性。
3. 有可能将能源消耗减少高达45%。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战，特别是：

1. 防止丙烯过度氧化成热力学上更稳定的CO和CO2。
2. 即使使用最有前景的催化剂（如负载型钒氧化物），丙烯选择性仍然较低。

在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂虽然在反应效率和催化剂稳定性方面提供了优势，但也带来了控制选择性以防止所需丙烯产物过度氧化的挑战。
