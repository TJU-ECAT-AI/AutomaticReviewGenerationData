[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[2] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption"

[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A gap between demand and supply of propene due to the shift towards using shale gas in steam cracking, which produces more ethene but less propene.

2. High energy consumption in conventional production methods.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reaction, lower reaction temperatures).

2. Enhancing catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

3. Potentially reducing energy consumption by around 45% compared to current methods.

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The primary challenge associated with using oxygen as an oxidant is the prevention of over-oxidation of the desired propene product into more thermodynamically stable carbon oxides (CO and CO2). This over-oxidation reduces the selectivity and yield of propene, which is a critical factor in making the process commercially viable.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于转向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解，导致丙烯的供需出现差距，这种方法产生更多乙烯但较少丙烯。

2. 传统生产方法能源消耗高。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 由于有利的热力学条件（放热反应，较低的反应温度），提高了反应效率。

2. 通过防止焦炭沉积在催化剂表面，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

3. 与当前方法相比，有可能将能源消耗减少约45%。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一些限制，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气作为氧化剂的主要挑战是防止所需的丙烯产物过度氧化成更热力学稳定的碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。这种过度氧化会降低丙烯的选择性和产率，这是使该工艺具有商业可行性的关键因素。
