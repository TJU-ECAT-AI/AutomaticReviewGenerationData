[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[2] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption"

[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A gap between supply and demand for propene due to the shift towards using shale gas in steam cracking, which produces more ethene but less propene.

2. High energy consumption in conventional production methods.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reaction, lower temperatures).
2. Enhancing catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition.
3. Potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45% compared to conventional methods.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The main limitation is the prevention of over-oxidation of the desired propene product into more thermodynamically stable carbon oxides (CO and CO2). This over-oxidation reduces the selectivity for propene, which is a critical factor in the commercial viability of the ODHP process.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解的转变，导致丙烯供需出现差距，因为这种方法产生更多乙烯但较少丙烯。

2. 传统生产方法能源消耗高。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 由于热力学有利（放热反应，较低温度），提供了更高的反应效率。
2. 通过防止积碳沉积提高催化剂稳定性。
3. 与传统方法相比，有潜力将能源消耗减少高达45%。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。主要限制是防止所需的丙烯产品过度氧化成更热力学稳定的碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。这种过度氧化降低了丙烯的选择性，这是ODHP工艺商业可行性的关键因素。
