[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins"

[2] "ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."

[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption"

[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A gap between propylene demand and supply due to the shift towards using shale gas in steam cracking, which produces more ethene but less propylene.

2. High energy consumption in conventional production methods.

ODHP addresses these issues by:

1. Offering improved reaction efficiency compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. Providing favorable thermodynamics with lower reaction temperatures.
3. Enhancing catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition.
4. Potentially reducing energy consumption by up to 45%.

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The main challenge is preventing the over-oxidation of propene to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide (COx), which are more thermodynamically stable products. This challenge arises from using oxygen as the oxidant, which can easily lead to complete oxidation of the desired propylene product.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于转向使用页岩气进行蒸汽裂解（产生更多乙烯但较少丙烯），导致丙烯供需出现差距。

2. 传统生产方法能耗高。

ODHP通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 与非氧化脱氢相比，提供了更高的反应效率。
2. 提供有利的热力学条件，反应温度更低。
3. 通过防止积碳沉积提高催化剂稳定性。
4. 有可能将能耗减少高达45%。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。主要挑战是防止丙烯过度氧化成一氧化碳和二氧化碳（COx），这些是热力学上更稳定的产物。这个挑战源于使用氧气作为氧化剂，它很容易导致所需的丙烯产品完全氧化。
