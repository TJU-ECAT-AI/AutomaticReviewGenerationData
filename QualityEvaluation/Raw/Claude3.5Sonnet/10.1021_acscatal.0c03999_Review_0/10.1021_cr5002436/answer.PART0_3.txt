[1] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic"

[5] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy demands of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes
2. Low selectivity towards specific olefins
3. Dependence on dwindling petroleum reserves
4. Rising oil prices

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation
2. Enabling full conversion of paraffin
3. Potentially lowering reaction temperatures (with O2 as oxidant)
4. Eliminating coke deposition (with O2 as oxidant)

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
1. No thermodynamic limitations
2. Higher conversion rates
3. Lower reaction temperatures possible
4. Reduced or eliminated coke formation

Limitations:
1. Risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing olefin selectivity
2. Choice of oxidant affects process characteristics:
   - O2: Exothermic reaction, no coke, but risk of overoxidation
   - CO2: Milder oxidant, but still endothermic reaction and potential for coke formation

The main challenge with using oxygen as an oxidant is maintaining high olefin selectivity while avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解过程的高能耗
2. 对特定烯烃的选择性低
3. 依赖于日益减少的石油储备
4. 油价上涨

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 克服非氧化脱氢的热力学限制
2. 实现烷烃的完全转化
3. 潜在地降低反应温度（使用O2作为氧化剂时）
4. 消除积碳沉积（使用O2作为氧化剂时）

然而，ODHP也有自己的优势和局限性：

优势：
1. 没有热力学限制
2. 更高的转化率
3. 可能降低反应温度
4. 减少或消除积碳形成

局限性：
1. 碳氢化合物过度氧化的风险，降低烯烃选择性
2. 氧化剂的选择影响过程特性：
   - O2：放热反应，无积碳，但存在过度氧化风险
   - CO2：较温和的氧化剂，但仍是吸热反应，且可能形成积碳

使用氧气作为氧化剂的主要挑战是在避免原料中碳氢化合物过度氧化的同时保持高烯烃选择性。
