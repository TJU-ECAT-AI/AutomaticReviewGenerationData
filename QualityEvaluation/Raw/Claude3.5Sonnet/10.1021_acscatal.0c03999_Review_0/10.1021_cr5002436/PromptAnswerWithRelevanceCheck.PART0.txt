[1] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic"

[5] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy demands of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes
2. Low selectivity toward specific olefins
3. Dwindling petroleum reserves
4. Rising oil prices

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Eliminating thermodynamic limitations, allowing full conversion of paraffin
2. Reducing energy requirements
3. Improving selectivity

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

Oxygen as oxidant:
Advantages:
- Eliminates coke deposition
- Lowers reaction temperature to about 400°C
- Makes the reaction exothermic

Limitations:
- Risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing olefin selectivity

CO2 as oxidant:
Advantages:
- Milder oxidant, less likely to oxidize hydrocarbons

Limitations:
- Reaction remains endothermic
- May increase coke deposition due to reverse water-gas shift reaction

The main challenge in ODHP is finding the right balance between oxidant strength and selectivity to maximize olefin yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解过程的高能耗
2. 对特定烯烃的低选择性
3. 石油储备减少
4. 油价上涨

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 消除热力学限制，实现烷烃的完全转化
2. 降低能源需求
3. 提高选择性

然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面也存在自身的优势和局限性：

氧气作为氧化剂：
优势：
- 消除积碳沉积
- 将反应温度降至约400°C
- 使反应成为放热反应

局限性：
- 存在碳氢化合物过度氧化的风险，降低烯烃选择性

二氧化碳作为氧化剂：
优势：
- 更温和的氧化剂，不太可能氧化碳氢化合物

局限性：
- 反应仍然是吸热的
- 由于逆水气变换反应可能增加积碳沉积

ODHP的主要挑战在于在氧化剂强度和选择性之间找到适当的平衡，以最大化烯烃产率，同时最小化不必要的副反应。

For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[4] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1)). Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy demands of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes
2. Low selectivity towards specific olefins
3. Dependence on dwindling petroleum reserves
4. Rising oil prices

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Eliminating thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation
2. Allowing full conversion of paraffin
3. Potentially lowering reaction temperatures (to about 400°C when using O2)
4. Making the reaction exothermic when using O2, reducing energy demands

Advantages of ODHP include:
1. Higher conversion rates
2. Reduced coke deposition (when using O2)
3. Lower energy requirements

Limitations and challenges of ODHP include:
1. Risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing selectivity towards desired olefins
2. Need to carefully select and optimize oxidants
3. Balancing oxidant reactivity with selectivity

The choice of oxidant (e.g., O2 or CO2) presents its own set of advantages and challenges. Oxygen as an oxidant eliminates coke deposition and lowers reaction temperature but poses a risk of overoxidation. The specific challenge with using oxygen is maintaining high olefin selectivity while preventing the oxidation of desired products.

1. High energy demands of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes
2. Low selectivity towards specific olefins
3. Reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves
4. Rising oil prices

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation
2. Allowing for full conversion of paraffin
3. Reducing energy requirements
4. Potentially using more economical feedstocks

Advantages of ODHP, particularly when using oxygen as an oxidant, include:

1. Elimination of coke deposition
2. Lower reaction temperatures (around 400°C)
3. Exothermic reaction, which can improve energy efficiency

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, especially when using oxygen:

1. Risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons in the feed
2. Difficulty in maintaining high olefin selectivity
3. Need for careful control of reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity

The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it affects the reaction dynamics, energy balance, and product selectivity. While oxygen offers several advantages, it also introduces the challenge of preventing excessive oxidation of the desired products.
