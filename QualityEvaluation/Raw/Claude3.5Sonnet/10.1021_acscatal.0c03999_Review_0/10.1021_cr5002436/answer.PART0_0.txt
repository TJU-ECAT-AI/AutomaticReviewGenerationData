[1] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic"

[5] "Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy demands of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes
2. Low selectivity toward specific olefins
3. Dwindling petroleum reserves
4. Rising oil prices

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Eliminating thermodynamic limitations, allowing full conversion of paraffin
2. Reducing energy requirements
3. Improving selectivity

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

Oxygen as oxidant:
Advantages:
- Eliminates coke deposition
- Lowers reaction temperature to about 400°C
- Makes the reaction exothermic

Limitations:
- Risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing olefin selectivity

CO2 as oxidant:
Advantages:
- Milder oxidant, less likely to oxidize hydrocarbons

Limitations:
- Reaction remains endothermic
- May increase coke deposition due to reverse water-gas shift reaction

The main challenge in ODHP is finding the right balance between oxidant strength and selectivity to maximize olefin yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解过程的高能耗
2. 对特定烯烃的低选择性
3. 石油储备减少
4. 油价上涨

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 消除热力学限制，实现烷烃的完全转化
2. 降低能源需求
3. 提高选择性

然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面也存在自身的优势和局限性：

氧气作为氧化剂：
优势：
- 消除积碳沉积
- 将反应温度降至约400°C
- 使反应成为放热反应

局限性：
- 存在碳氢化合物过度氧化的风险，降低烯烃选择性

二氧化碳作为氧化剂：
优势：
- 更温和的氧化剂，不太可能氧化碳氢化合物

局限性：
- 反应仍然是吸热的
- 由于逆水气变换反应可能增加积碳沉积

ODHP的主要挑战在于在氧化剂强度和选择性之间找到适当的平衡，以最大化烯烃产率，同时最小化不必要的副反应。
