[1] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins. For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1)). Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy demands of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes
2. Low selectivity towards specific olefins
3. Dependence on dwindling petroleum reserves
4. Rising oil prices

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Eliminating thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation
2. Allowing full conversion of paraffin
3. Potentially lowering reaction temperatures (to about 400°C when using O2)
4. Making the reaction exothermic when using O2, reducing energy demands

Advantages of ODHP include:
1. Higher conversion rates
2. Reduced coke deposition (when using O2)
3. Lower energy requirements

Limitations and challenges of ODHP include:
1. Risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing selectivity towards desired olefins
2. Need to carefully select and optimize oxidants
3. Balancing oxidant reactivity with selectivity

The choice of oxidant (e.g., O2 or CO2) presents its own set of advantages and challenges. Oxygen as an oxidant eliminates coke deposition and lowers reaction temperature but poses a risk of overoxidation. The specific challenge with using oxygen is maintaining high olefin selectivity while preventing the oxidation of desired products.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化过程的高能耗
2. 对特定烯烃的低选择性
3. 对日益减少的石油储备的依赖
4. 不断上涨的油价

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 消除非氧化脱氢的热力学限制
2. 允许全转化烷烃
3. 可能降低反应温度（使用O2时可降至约400°C）
4. 使用O2时使反应成为放热反应，减少能量需求

ODHP的优势包括：
1. 更高的转化率
2. 减少积碳沉积（使用O2时）
3. 较低的能量需求

ODHP的局限性和挑战包括：
1. 碳氢化合物过度氧化的风险，降低了对目标烯烃的选择性
2. 需要仔细选择和优化氧化剂
3. 平衡氧化剂的反应性和选择性

氧化剂的选择（如O2或CO2）带来了各自的优势和挑战。氧气作为氧化剂可以消除积碳沉积并降低反应温度，但存在过度氧化的风险。使用氧气的特殊挑战在于在防止目标产物氧化的同时保持高烯烃选择性。
