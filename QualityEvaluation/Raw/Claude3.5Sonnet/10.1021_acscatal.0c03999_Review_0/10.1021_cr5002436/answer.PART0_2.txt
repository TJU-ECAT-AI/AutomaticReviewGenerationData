[1] "Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins. For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1)). Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy demands of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes
2. Low selectivity towards specific olefins
3. Reliance on dwindling petroleum reserves
4. Rising oil prices

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative dehydrogenation
2. Allowing for full conversion of paraffin
3. Reducing energy requirements
4. Potentially using more economical feedstocks

Advantages of ODHP, particularly when using oxygen as an oxidant, include:

1. Elimination of coke deposition
2. Lower reaction temperatures (around 400°C)
3. Exothermic reaction, which can improve energy efficiency

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, especially when using oxygen:

1. Risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons in the feed
2. Difficulty in maintaining high olefin selectivity
3. Need for careful control of reaction conditions to balance conversion and selectivity

The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it affects the reaction dynamics, energy balance, and product selectivity. While oxygen offers several advantages, it also introduces the challenge of preventing excessive oxidation of the desired products.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）过程的高能耗
2. 对特定烯烃的低选择性
3. 依赖日益减少的石油储备
4. 不断上涨的油价

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 克服非氧化脱氢的热力学限制
2. 允许全部转化石蜡
3. 降低能源需求
4. 可能使用更经济的原料

ODHP的优势，特别是使用氧气作为氧化剂时，包括：

1. 消除积碳沉积
2. 较低的反应温度（约400°C）
3. 放热反应，可以提高能源效率

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，尤其是在使用氧气时：

1. 原料中烃类过度氧化的风险
2. 难以维持高烯烃选择性
3. 需要仔细控制反应条件以平衡转化率和选择性

在ODHP中选择适当的氧化剂至关重要，因为它影响反应动力学、能量平衡和产品选择性。虽然氧气提供了几个优势，但它也带来了防止所需产品过度氧化的挑战。
