[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand"

[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields"

[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures"

[4] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient co-production from steam and fluidized crackers to meet growing demand.

2. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring very high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative, on-purpose production method for propylene.

2. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant, which alters the dehydrogenation pathway and releases heat, reducing operating temperatures.

3. Suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production, unlike when using molecular oxygen.

Advantages of ODHP with CO2 include lower operating temperatures, reduced energy requirements, and improved selectivity. However, limitations may include the need for effective catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽和流化裂解装置的联产不足以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 丙烷直接脱氢(DDP)受热力学限制，且高度吸热，需要非常高的温度。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了一种替代的、定向的丙烯生产方法。

2. 使用CO2作为温和氧化剂，改变了脱氢路径并释放热量，降低了操作温度。

3. 抑制过度氧化并最大程度地减少碳氧化物的产生，这与使用分子氧不同。

ODHP使用CO2的优势包括较低的操作温度、减少能源需求和提高选择性。然而，限制可能包括需要有效的催化剂，以及优化反应条件以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。
