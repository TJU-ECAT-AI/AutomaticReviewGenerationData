[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand"

[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields"

[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures"

[4] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply from traditional co-production methods to meet growing demand.
2. Thermodynamic limitations and high energy requirements of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP).

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative, on-purpose production method to supplement co-production.
2. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant, which alters the reaction pathway and reduces operating temperatures.
3. Suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production compared to using molecular oxygen.

The advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP include lower operating temperatures, reduced energy requirements, and improved selectivity. However, limitations may include the need for efficient CO2 capture and utilization systems, as well as potential challenges in catalyst development for optimal performance with CO2 as an oxidant.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统共生产方法无法满足不断增长的需求。
2. 丙烷直接脱氢(DDP)的热力学限制和高能耗要求。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供替代性的定向生产方法，以补充共生产。
2. 使用CO2作为温和氧化剂，改变反应路径并降低操作温度。
3. 与使用分子氧相比，抑制过度氧化并最小化一氧化碳的产生。

在ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂的优势包括较低的操作温度、降低能源需求和提高选择性。然而，限制可能包括需要高效的CO2捕获和利用系统，以及在催化剂开发方面可能面临的挑战，以便在使用CO2作为氧化剂时获得最佳性能。
