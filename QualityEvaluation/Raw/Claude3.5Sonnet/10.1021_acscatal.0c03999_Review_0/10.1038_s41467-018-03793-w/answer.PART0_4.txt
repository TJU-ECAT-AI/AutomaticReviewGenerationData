[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand."

[2] "Consequently, there is a need for the development of economic on-purpose production techniques to produce additional propylene."

[3] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields."

[4] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures."

[5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient co-production from steam and fluidized crackers to meet growing demand.
2. The need for economic on-purpose production techniques.
3. Thermodynamic limitations and high energy requirements of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP).

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative on-purpose production method.
2. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant, which alters the dehydrogenation pathway and reduces operating temperatures.
3. Suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production compared to using molecular oxygen.

The advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP include lower operating temperatures and reduced over-oxidation. However, limitations may include the need for efficient CO2 capture and utilization systems, as well as potential catalyst deactivation issues. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, such as over-oxidation and safety concerns, are mitigated by using CO2 instead.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化床裂解的联产不足以满足不断增长的需求。
2. 需要经济的定向生产技术。
3. 丙烷直接脱氢(DDP)的热力学限制和高能耗要求。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供替代的定向生产方法。
2. 使用CO2作为温和氧化剂，改变脱氢途径并降低操作温度。
3. 与使用分子氧相比，抑制过度氧化并最小化碳氧化物的产生。

在ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂的优点包括较低的操作温度和减少过度氧化。然而，限制可能包括需要高效的CO2捕获和利用系统，以及潜在的催化剂失活问题。使用CO2代替氧气可以缓解与使用氧气作为氧化剂相关的特定挑战，如过度氧化和安全隐患。
