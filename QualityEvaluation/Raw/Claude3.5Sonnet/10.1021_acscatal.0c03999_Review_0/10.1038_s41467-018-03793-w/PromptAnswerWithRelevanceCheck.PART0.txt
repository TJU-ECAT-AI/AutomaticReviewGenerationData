<quotes>

[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand."

[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields."

[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures."

[4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS)"

[5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient co-production from steam and fluidized crackers to meet growing demand.

2. Thermodynamic limitations and high energy requirements of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP).

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production method to meet demand.

2. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant, which:
   - Alters the dehydrogenation pathway, reducing operating temperatures.
   - Increases propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.
   - Suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production.

The advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant include lower operating temperatures, improved propane conversion, and reduced unwanted byproducts. However, limitations may include the need for efficient CO2 capture and utilization systems, as well as potential catalyst deactivation issues that are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply from traditional co-production methods to meet growing demand.
2. Thermodynamic limitations and high energy requirements of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP).

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient co-production from steam and fluidized crackers to meet growing demand.

2. Thermodynamic limitations and high endothermicity of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP), requiring extremely high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative, on-purpose production method to meet demand.

2. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant, which alters the reaction pathway and reduces operating temperatures.

3. Suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production, unlike when using molecular oxygen.

Advantages of using CO2 in ODHP include lower operating temperatures, reduced over-oxidation, and potential utilization of a greenhouse gas. However, limitations may include the need for efficient CO2 capture and utilization systems, as well as potential challenges in catalyst design to optimize selectivity and stability under CO2-ODHP conditions.
