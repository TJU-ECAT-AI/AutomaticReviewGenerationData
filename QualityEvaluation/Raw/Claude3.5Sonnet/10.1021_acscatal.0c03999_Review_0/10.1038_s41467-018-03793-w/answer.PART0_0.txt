[1] "The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand."

[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields."

[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures."

[4] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS)"

[5] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient co-production from steam and fluidized crackers to meet growing demand.

2. Thermodynamic limitations and high energy requirements of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP).

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production method to meet demand.

2. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant, which:
   - Alters the dehydrogenation pathway, reducing operating temperatures.
   - Increases propane conversion by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.
   - Suppresses over-oxidation, minimizing carbon oxide production.

The advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant include lower operating temperatures, improved propane conversion, and reduced unwanted byproducts. However, limitations may include the need for efficient CO2 capture and utilization systems, as well as potential catalyst deactivation issues that are not explicitly mentioned in the given text.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化裂解装置的联产不足以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 丙烷直接脱氢(DDP)存在热力学限制和高能耗要求。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供一种替代生产方法以满足需求。

2. 使用CO2作为温和氧化剂，其：
   - 改变脱氢途径，降低操作温度。
   - 通过逆水煤气反应消耗H2，提高丙烷转化率。
   - 抑制过度氧化，最大限度地减少碳氧化物的产生。

使用CO2作为氧化剂的优势包括较低的操作温度、改善的丙烷转化率以及减少不需要的副产品。然而，限制可能包括需要高效的CO2捕获和利用系统，以及潜在的催化剂失活问题，这些在给定的文本中并未明确提及。
