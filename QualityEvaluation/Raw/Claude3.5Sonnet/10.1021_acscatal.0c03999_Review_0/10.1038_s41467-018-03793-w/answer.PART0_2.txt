[1] "Propylene is one of the most diverse petrochemical building blocks used for the production of many chemicals (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile). The co-production of propylene from steam and fluidized crackers is anticipated to be insufficient to satisfy the rapidly growing demand."

[2] "The direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and is highly endothermic (ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol), requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields."

[3] "In principle, the introduction of CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed alters the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from the alkane and consequently releasing the heat of reaction that reduces operating temperatures."

[4] "Additionally, unlike regular oxidative dehydrogenation with molecular oxygen, CO2 as a mild oxidant suppresses over-oxidation and thus minimizes the production of carbon oxides."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient co-production from steam and fluidized crackers to meet growing demand.

2. Thermodynamic limitations and high endothermicity of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP), requiring extremely high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative, on-purpose production method to meet demand.

2. Using CO2 as a mild oxidant, which alters the reaction pathway and reduces operating temperatures.

3. Suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing carbon oxide production, unlike when using molecular oxygen.

Advantages of using CO2 in ODHP include lower operating temperatures, reduced over-oxidation, and potential utilization of a greenhouse gas. However, limitations may include the need for efficient CO2 capture and utilization systems, as well as potential challenges in catalyst design to optimize selectivity and stability under CO2-ODHP conditions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化裂解装置的联产不足以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 丙烷直接脱氢（DDP）存在热力学限制和高吸热性，需要极高的温度。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供一种替代性的定向生产方法来满足需求。

2. 使用CO2作为温和氧化剂，改变反应路径并降低操作温度。

3. 抑制过度氧化并最小化一氧化碳的产生，这与使用分子氧不同。

在ODHP中使用CO2的优势包括较低的操作温度、减少过度氧化以及潜在利用温室气体。然而，局限性可能包括需要高效的CO2捕获和利用系统，以及在CO2-ODHP条件下优化催化剂选择性和稳定性的潜在挑战。
