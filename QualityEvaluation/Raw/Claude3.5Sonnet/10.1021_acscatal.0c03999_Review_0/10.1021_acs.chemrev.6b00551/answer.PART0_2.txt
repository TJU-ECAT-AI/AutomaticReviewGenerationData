[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

[4] "Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include reliance on energy-intensive processes like steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha, as well as limited selectivity and yield. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct and potentially less energy-intensive route to propylene production.

ODHP using oxygen as an oxidant presents several advantages:

1. It is an exothermic reaction, potentially reducing energy requirements compared to endothermic conventional dehydrogenation.

2. The presence of oxygen can help overcome thermodynamic limitations, allowing for higher conversions.

3. It can be operated at lower temperatures compared to thermal dehydrogenation, potentially reducing coking and improving catalyst stability.

However, ODHP also faces significant challenges:

1. Selectivity control: The presence of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, forming undesired carbon oxides and reducing propylene yield.

2. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that can activate propane selectively while avoiding deep oxidation is crucial and challenging.

3. Safety concerns: Using oxygen at high temperatures with hydrocarbons poses explosion risks, requiring careful reactor design and operation.

4. Heat management: While the exothermic nature can be advantageous, it also requires careful heat removal to avoid hotspots and maintain selectivity.

The literature also mentions iodine-mediated dehydrogenation as an alternative, which can offer higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes. However, this approach faces its own challenges, such as the need for higher temperatures to achieve favorable thermodynamics and potential issues with iodine recovery and corrosion.

In summary, while ODHP and other alternative methods like iodine-mediated dehydrogenation offer potential advantages over current propylene production methods, they also present unique challenges that need to be addressed for successful industrial implementation.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括依赖能源密集型工艺如蒸汽裂解和石脑油流化催化裂解，以及有限的选择性和产率。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更直接和潜在能耗更低的丙烯生产途径来解决这些问题。

使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP具有几个优势：

1. 它是一个放热反应，与常规吸热脱氢相比可能减少能源需求。

2. 氧气的存在可以帮助克服热力学限制，允许更高的转化率。

3. 与热脱氢相比，可以在更低的温度下操作，可能减少结焦并提高催化剂稳定性。

然而，ODHP也面临重大挑战：

1. 选择性控制：氧气的存在可能导致过度氧化，形成不需要的碳氧化物并降低丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂设计：开发能够选择性激活丙烷同时避免深度氧化的催化剂至关重要且具有挑战性。

3. 安全问题：在高温下使用氧气和碳氢化合物存在爆炸风险，需要谨慎的反应器设计和操作。

4. 热管理：虽然放热性可能是有利的，但也需要仔细去除热量以避免热点并维持选择性。

文献还提到碘介导的脱氢作为一种替代方法，与传统路线相比可以提供更高的丙烯产率。然而，这种方法面临着自身的挑战，如需要更高的温度来实现有利的热力学条件，以及碘回收和腐蚀的潜在问题。

总之，虽然ODHP和其他替代方法如碘介导的脱氢相比当前丙烯生产方法提供了潜在优势，但它们也带来了需要解决的独特挑战，以实现成功的工业应用。
