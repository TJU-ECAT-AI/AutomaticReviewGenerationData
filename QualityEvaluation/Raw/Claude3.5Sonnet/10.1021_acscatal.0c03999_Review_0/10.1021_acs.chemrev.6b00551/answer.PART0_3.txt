[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

[4] "Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the reliance on energy-intensive processes like steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha, as well as the limited selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more direct and potentially less energy-intensive route to propylene production.

ODHP presents several advantages:
1. It can operate at lower temperatures compared to thermal dehydrogenation.
2. It is not limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, potentially allowing for higher conversions.
3. It can use cheaper feedstocks (propane) compared to traditional methods.

However, ODHP also faces challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:
1. When using oxygen as the oxidant, there is a risk of over-oxidation, leading to the formation of unwanted carbon oxides and reducing feedstock utilization.
2. The use of oxygen also introduces safety concerns due to the potential formation of explosive mixtures with hydrocarbons.

The literature mentions iodine-mediated dehydrogenation as an alternative approach, which offers higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes. However, this method also has limitations:
1. The reaction is slow at low temperatures.
2. High propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures.
3. When combined with oxidative conditions (oxidative iodination), it leads to better propylene yields but still suffers from overoxidation issues.

In summary, while ODHP and related approaches like iodine-mediated dehydrogenation offer promising alternatives to traditional propylene production methods, they still face challenges in balancing reactivity, selectivity, and avoiding unwanted side reactions, particularly when using oxygen as an oxidant.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括依赖能源密集型过程如蒸汽裂解和石脑油流化催化裂解，以及对丙烯的有限选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种更直接、潜在能耗更低的丙烯生产路线来解决这些问题。

ODHP具有以下几个优点：
1. 与热脱氢相比，可以在较低的温度下运行。
2. 不受热力学平衡的限制，可能允许更高的转化率。
3. 可以使用比传统方法更便宜的原料（丙烷）。

然而，ODHP也面临挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：
1. 当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在过度氧化的风险，导致不需要的碳氧化物形成，降低原料利用率。
2. 使用氧气还引入了安全隐患，因为可能形成与碳氢化合物的爆炸性混合物。

文献提到碘介导的脱氢作为一种替代方法，与传统路线相比，它提供了更高的丙烯产率。但是，这种方法也有局限性：
1. 在低温下反应缓慢。
2. 高丙烯产率仅在较高温度下在热力学上有利。
3. 当与氧化条件结合（氧化碘化）时，它确实导致更好的丙烯产率，但仍然存在过度氧化问题。

总之，尽管ODHP和相关方法（如碘介导的脱氢）为传统丙烯生产方法提供了有前景的替代方案，但它们在平衡反应性、选择性和避免不需要的副反应方面仍然面临挑战，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂时。
