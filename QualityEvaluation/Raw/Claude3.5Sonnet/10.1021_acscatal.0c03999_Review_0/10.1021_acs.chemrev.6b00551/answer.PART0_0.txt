[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

[4] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

Current propylene production methods like steam cracking and catalytic cracking of naphtha face challenges in terms of efficiency and selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher propylene yields and operating at lower temperatures.

The key advantages of ODHP include:
1. Higher propylene selectivity
2. Lower energy consumption due to moderate reaction temperatures
3. Potential for process intensification

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges:
1. Selection of suitable oxidants - oxygen can lead to overoxidation and safety concerns
2. Catalyst design to minimize unwanted side reactions
3. Reactor engineering to manage the exothermic nature of the reaction

The use of halogens as oxidants in ODHP shows promise. Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation gives higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes. Adding small amounts of bromine can significantly improve propane conversion and product selectivity. This approach allows for high yields (up to 80%) of propylene and propyl halides at moderate temperatures below 800 K.

However, halogen-based ODHP introduces new challenges related to corrosion, halogen recovery, and process safety that need to be addressed for commercial implementation. Overall, while ODHP offers advantages over current propylene production methods, further research is needed to optimize catalysts, reactor designs, and process integration for industrial viability.

目前的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和石脑油催化裂解，在效率和选择性方面面临挑战。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更高的丙烯产率和在较低温度下操作来解决这些问题。

ODHP的主要优势包括：
1. 更高的丙烯选择性
2. 由于反应温度适中，能耗较低
3. 具有工艺强化的潜力

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战：
1. 合适氧化剂的选择 - 氧气可能导致过度氧化和安全问题
2. 催化剂设计以最小化不必要的副反应
3. 反应器工程设计以管理反应的放热性质

使用卤素作为ODHP的氧化剂显示出前景。碘介导的脱氢反应比传统路线提供更高的丙烯产率。添加少量的溴可以显著提高丙烷转化率和产品选择性。这种方法允许在800 K以下的适度温度下获得高达80%的丙烯和卤代丙烷的产率。

然而，基于卤素的ODHP引入了与腐蚀、卤素回收和工艺安全相关的新挑战，这些需要解决以实现商业化应用。总的来说，虽然ODHP比当前的丙烯生产方法具有优势，但仍需要进一步研究以优化催化剂、反应器设计和工艺集成，以实现工业可行性。
