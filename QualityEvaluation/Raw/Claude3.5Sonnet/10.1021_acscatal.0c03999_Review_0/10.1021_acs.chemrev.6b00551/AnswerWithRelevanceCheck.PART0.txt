          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

[4] "Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

[5] "Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

[6] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:
1. High energy consumption in processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha.
2. Limited selectivity and yield of propylene.
3. Reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks, which are becoming scarce and expensive.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering:
1. A more direct and potentially less energy-intensive route to propylene production.
2. The ability to use cheaper and more abundant propane feedstock.
3. Lower operating temperatures compared to thermal dehydrogenation.
4. Potential for higher conversions by overcoming thermodynamic limitations.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:
1. When using oxygen:
   - Risk of over-oxidation, forming unwanted carbon oxides.
   - Safety concerns due to potential explosive mixtures with hydrocarbons.
   - Need for careful heat management due to the exothermic nature of the reaction.
2. Catalyst design challenges to activate propane selectively while avoiding deep oxidation.

Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation is presented as an alternative approach, offering:
1. Higher propylene yields compared to conventional routes.
2. Selective reaction with propane at low temperatures.

However, this method also has limitations:
1. Slow reaction rates at low temperatures.
2. High propylene yields only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures.
3. Potential issues with iodine recovery and corrosion.

Oxidative iodination using molten iodinated salts shows promise with better propylene yields, but still faces over-oxidation issues.

A combined approach using both iodine and bromine has shown significant improvements:
1. Promotes C3H8 conversion and selectivity of desired products.
2. Achieves high yields (up to 80%) of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures below 800 K.

In summary, while ODHP and halogen-mediated approaches offer advantages over current methods, they still face challenges in balancing reactivity, selectivity, and avoiding unwanted side reactions. The development of optimal catalysts, reactor designs, and process integration remains crucial for industrial viability.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：
1. 蒸汽裂解和石脑油流化催化裂解等过程中的高能耗。
2. 丙烯的有限选择性和产率。
3. 依赖于日益稀缺和昂贵的石油基原料。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：
1. 提供更直接、潜在能耗更低的丙烯生产路线。
2. 能够使用更便宜、更丰富的丙烷原料。
3. 与热脱氢相比，操作温度更低。
4. 通过克服热力学限制，可能实现更高的转化率。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：
1. 使用氧气时：
   - 存在过度氧化的风险，形成不需要的碳氧化物。
   - 由于可能与碳氢化合物形成爆炸性混合物而引起安全隐患。
   - 由于反应的放热性质，需要仔细管理热量。
2. 催化剂设计挑战，需要选择性地活化丙烷同时避免深度氧化。

碘介导的脱氢作为一种替代方法，提供：
1. 与传统路线相比，更高的丙烯产率。
2. 在低温下与丙烷选择性反应。

然而，这种方法也有局限性：
1. 在低温下反应速率慢。
2. 高丙烯产率仅在较高温度下热力学有利。
3. 碘回收和腐蚀的潜在问题。

使用熔融碘化盐的氧化碘化显示出更好的丙烯产率，但仍面临过度氧化问题。

结合使用碘和溴的方法显示出显著改进：
1. 促进C3H8转化和目标产物的选择性。
2. 在800 K以下的适中温度下实现高达80%的C3H6+C3H7X产率。

总之，虽然ODHP和卤素介导的方法比当前方法具有优势，但它们仍面临平衡反应性、选择性和避免不需要的副反应的挑战。开发最佳催化剂、反应器设计和工艺集成对于工业可行性仍然至关重要。
