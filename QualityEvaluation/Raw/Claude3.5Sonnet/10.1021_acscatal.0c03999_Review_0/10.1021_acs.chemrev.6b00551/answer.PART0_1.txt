[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products"

[4] "A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K."

Current propylene production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking face challenges of high energy consumption and limited selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering potentially higher yields and lower energy requirements. 

The use of halogens as mediators in ODHP presents several advantages:

1. Higher propylene yields compared to conventional dehydrogenation routes.

2. Ability to operate at moderate temperatures (below 800 K).

3. Improved selectivity towards desired products.

4. Synergistic effects when using multiple halogens (e.g., bromine and iodine together).

However, ODHP with halogens also faces challenges:

1. Corrosion issues due to the presence of halogen compounds.

2. Need for efficient halogen recovery and recycling systems.

3. Potential environmental and safety concerns associated with halogen use.

4. Complexity in reactor and process design to manage heat release and prevent hot spots.

The selection of oxidants is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen is commonly used, it can lead to overoxidation and formation of undesired carbon oxides. Halogens offer more selective oxidation but require additional steps for regeneration. The choice between oxygen and halogens involves trade-offs between selectivity, process complexity, and economic considerations.

目前的丙烯生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解面临着高能耗和有限选择性的挑战。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供潜在的更高产率和更低能耗来解决这些问题。

使用卤素作为ODHP的介质具有以下几个优势：

1. 与传统脱氢路线相比，丙烯产率更高。

2. 能够在适中的温度下操作（低于800 K）。

3. 提高了对目标产品的选择性。

4. 使用多种卤素时产生协同效应（例如，溴和碘一起使用）。

然而，使用卤素的ODHP也面临着挑战：

1. 由于存在卤素化合物而导致的腐蚀问题。

2. 需要高效的卤素回收和循环系统。

3. 与卤素使用相关的潜在环境和安全问题。

4. 反应器和工艺设计的复杂性，以管理热量释放并防止热点形成。

在ODHP中，氧化剂的选择至关重要。虽然氧气常被使用，但它可能导致过度氧化和形成不需要的碳氧化物。卤素提供更有选择性的氧化，但需要额外的再生步骤。在氧气和卤素之间的选择涉及选择性、工艺复杂性和经济考虑之间的权衡。
