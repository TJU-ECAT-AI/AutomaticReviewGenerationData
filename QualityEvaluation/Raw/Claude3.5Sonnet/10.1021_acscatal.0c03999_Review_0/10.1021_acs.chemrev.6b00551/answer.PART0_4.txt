[1] "Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins."

[2] "Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes."

[3] "For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures"

[4] "Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low selectivity and high energy consumption associated with steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. These processes also rely on petroleum-based feedstocks, which are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more selective and energy-efficient route to propylene production. It uses abundant and cheap propane as a feedstock, which is advantageous given the recent discoveries of large natural gas reserves. ODHP is exothermic, unlike endothermic direct dehydrogenation, potentially leading to energy savings.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there's a risk of over-oxidation, leading to the formation of undesired carbon oxides and reducing propylene yield. This challenge is particularly acute at higher temperatures, which are necessary for favorable thermodynamics but also promote side reactions.

Halogen-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation, particularly using iodine, has shown promise in addressing some of these challenges. Iodine reacts selectively with propane at lower temperatures, forming propylene via dehydroiodination of iodopropane. However, high propylene yields are only achievable at higher temperatures, presenting a trade-off between selectivity and yield.

The use of molten iodinated salts in oxidative iodination of propane has demonstrated better propylene yields, but still faces the challenge of over-oxidation to carbon oxides, which reduces feedstock utilization efficiency.

In summary, while ODHP offers several advantages over conventional propylene production methods, careful consideration must be given to oxidant selection and reaction conditions to balance selectivity, yield, and energy efficiency. The development of novel catalysts and process designs that can mitigate over-oxidation while maintaining high propylene yields remains an active area of research in this field.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解过程中的低选择性和高能耗。这些工艺还依赖于日益稀缺和昂贵的石油基原料。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供更具选择性和能源效率的丙烯生产路线来解决这些问题。它使用丰富且便宜的丙烷作为原料，这在最近发现大量天然气储量的背景下是有利的。与吸热的直接脱氢不同，ODHP是放热反应，可能带来能源节约。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在过度氧化的风险，导致不需要的碳氧化物形成并降低丙烯产率。这一挑战在高温下尤为严重，而高温又是实现有利热力学的必要条件，但同时也促进了副反应的发生。

卤素介导的氧化脱氢，特别是使用碘，在解决这些挑战方面显示出了潜力。碘在较低温度下与丙烷选择性反应，通过碘丙烷的脱氢碘化形成丙烯。然而，高丙烯产率只能在较高温度下实现，这就在选择性和产率之间产生了权衡。

在丙烷的氧化碘化中使用熔融碘化盐显示出更好的丙烯产率，但仍面临过度氧化成碳氧化物的挑战，这降低了原料利用效率。

总之，虽然ODHP比传统丙烯生产方法提供了几个优势，但必须仔细考虑氧化剂的选择和反应条件，以平衡选择性、产率和能源效率。开发可以减少过度氧化同时保持高丙烯产率的新型催化剂和工艺设计仍然是该领域的一个活跃研究方向。
