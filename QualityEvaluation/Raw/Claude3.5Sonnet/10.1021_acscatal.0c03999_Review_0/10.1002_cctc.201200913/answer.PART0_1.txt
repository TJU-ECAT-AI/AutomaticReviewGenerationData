[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC). However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[4] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low selectivity and yields in steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, where propylene is produced as a by-product.

2. High reaction temperatures (around 1000K) required for propane dehydrogenation due to thermodynamic limitations.

3. Separation issues of resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene in propane dehydrogenation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:

1. Offering a more thermodynamically favorable reaction by introducing an oxidant.
2. Potentially allowing lower reaction temperatures compared to traditional dehydrogenation.

However, ODHP presents its own limitations, particularly:

1. The highest propylene yield reported for ODHP is only about 30%.
2. Consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products limits the yield.

The selection of oxidant is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen as an oxidant can improve thermodynamics, it also leads to the formation of undesired oxygenated products, limiting the overall yield of propylene. This highlights the need for alternative oxidants or process improvements to achieve higher propylene yields in ODHP.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 在蒸汽裂解（SC）和流化催化裂解（FCC）过程中，丙烯作为副产品产生，选择性和产率都很低。

2. 由于热力学限制，丙烷脱氢需要很高的反应温度（约1000K）。

3. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，需要分离产生的氢气和未反应的丙烷与丙烯。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了部分问题：

1. 引入氧化剂，使反应在热力学上更有利。
2. 与传统脱氢相比，可能允许较低的反应温度。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是：

1. ODHP报告的最高丙烯产率仅约30%。
2. 丙烯连续氧化生成含氧产物限制了产率。

在ODHP中，氧化剂的选择至关重要。虽然氧气作为氧化剂可以改善热力学，但它也会导致不需要的含氧产物的形成，限制了丙烯的总产率。这突显了ODHP需要替代氧化剂或工艺改进，以实现更高的丙烯产率。
