[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC). However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."

[3] "However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."

[4] "Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low selectivity and yields in steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, where propylene is produced as a by-product.

2. High reaction temperatures (around 1000K) required for propane dehydrogenation to achieve high single-pass propane conversion.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:

1. Providing a more thermodynamically favorable reaction by introducing an oxidant.
2. Potentially allowing for lower reaction temperatures compared to traditional dehydrogenation.

However, ODHP presents its own limitations, particularly:

1. The highest reported propylene yield is only about 30%.
2. Consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products limits the yield.

The selection of oxidants is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen as an oxidant can improve thermodynamics, it also leads to the formation of undesired oxygenated products, limiting the overall propylene yield. This challenge has prompted research into alternative oxidants and catalysts to improve selectivity and yield in ODHP processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 在蒸汽裂解（SC）和流化催化裂解（FCC）过程中，丙烯作为副产品产生，选择性和产率都很低。

2. 丙烷脱氢需要高反应温度（约1000K）才能实现高单程丙烷转化率。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了一些问题：

1. 通过引入氧化剂，使反应在热力学上更有利。
2. 与传统脱氢相比，可能允许较低的反应温度。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是：

1. 报告的最高丙烯产率仅约为30%。
2. 丙烯连续氧化生成含氧产物限制了产率。

在ODHP中，氧化剂的选择至关重要。虽然氧气作为氧化剂可以改善热力学，但它也会导致不需要的含氧产物形成，限制了整体丙烯产率。这一挑战促使研究人员探索替代氧化剂和催化剂，以提高ODHP过程中的选择性和产率。
