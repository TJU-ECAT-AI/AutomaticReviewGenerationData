[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%"

[2] "This process provides an attractive alternate route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."

[3] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."

[4] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low propylene yields (below 30%) due to selectivity losses at higher conversions.
2. Propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides.
3. Coke formation in non-oxidative routes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower temperatures, which is thermodynamically favored.
2. Using oxygen to inhibit coke formation.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. Using oxygen can lead to over-oxidation of hydrocarbons, resulting in unwanted carbon oxides. 

The study introduces a novel approach by using H2S as a gas-phase promoter in ODHP. This addition significantly reduces the formation of carbon oxides, ethylene, and methane while increasing propene selectivity, especially at short residence times. This innovative use of H2S as an oxidant offers a promising solution to improve propylene yields while mitigating the limitations associated with conventional oxygen-based ODHP.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于在高转化率下选择性损失导致丙烯产率低（低于30%）。
2. 丙烯再吸附并随后氧化成碳氧化物。
3. 非氧化路线中的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低温度下操作，这在热力学上更有利。
2. 使用氧气抑制积碳形成。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气可能导致碳氢化合物过度氧化，产生不需要的碳氧化物。

该研究引入了一种新方法，即在ODHP中使用H2S作为气相促进剂。这种添加显著减少了碳氧化物、乙烯和甲烷的形成，同时增加了丙烯的选择性，尤其是在短停留时间内。这种创新性地使用H2S作为氧化剂为提高丙烯产率提供了一个有前景的解决方案，同时缓解了与传统的基于氧气的ODHP相关的限制。
