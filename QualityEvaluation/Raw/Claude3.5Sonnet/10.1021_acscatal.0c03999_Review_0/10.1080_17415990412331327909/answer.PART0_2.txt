[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%"

[2] "ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."

[3] "Vanadia- and molybdena-based oxide catalyst systems have been found to be effective for this reaction, but the unselective combustion reactions limit alkene selectivities"

[4] "Recently, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes at high temperatures has been shown to be a promising route for the selective production of short-chain olefins."

[5] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low propylene yields (below 30%) due to selectivity losses at higher conversions.

2. Propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides.

3. Unselective combustion reactions limiting alkene selectivities.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower temperatures, which is thermodynamically favorable.

2. Using oxygen to inhibit coke formation common in non-oxidative routes.

3. Employing short contact times at high temperatures to improve selectivity.

Advantages of ODHP:
- Improved thermodynamics at lower temperatures
- Reduced coke formation
- Potential for higher selectivity with short contact times

Limitations of ODHP:
- Unselective combustion reactions still occur
- Challenges in balancing conversion and selectivity

Regarding oxidant selection, oxygen is commonly used but presents challenges in terms of controlling selectivity. The study explores the use of H2S as a novel gas-phase promoter, which had not been previously investigated for ODHP. This approach aims to address the specific challenges associated with using oxygen by potentially improving selectivity and yield.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于在高转化率下选择性损失，导致丙烯产率低（低于30%）。

2. 丙烯再吸附和随后氧化为碳氧化物。

3. 非选择性燃烧反应限制了烯烃选择性。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低温度下操作，这在热力学上更有利。

2. 使用氧气抑制非氧化路线中常见的积碳形成。

3. 采用高温短接触时间以提高选择性。

ODHP的优点：
- 在较低温度下热力学性能更好
- 减少积碳形成
- 短接触时间有可能提高选择性

ODHP的局限性：
- 非选择性燃烧反应仍然存在
- 平衡转化率和选择性的挑战

关于氧化剂选择，氧气常被使用但在控制选择性方面存在挑战。该研究探索了使用H2S作为一种新型气相助剂，这在ODHP中之前未被研究过。这种方法旨在通过潜在地提高选择性和产率来解决使用氧气相关的特定挑战。
