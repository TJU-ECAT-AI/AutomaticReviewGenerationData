The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Unselective combustion reactions that limit alkene selectivities in conventional catalytic systems.

2. Significant selectivity losses at higher conversions due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, resulting in propene yields typically below 30%.

3. Coke formation in non-oxidative routes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower temperatures, which is thermodynamically favorable.

2. Using oxygen to inhibit coke formation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. The use of oxygen can lead to undesired combustion reactions, limiting selectivity.

2. Finding the right balance between conversion and selectivity remains difficult.

The study explores a novel approach using H2S as a gas-phase promoter, which had not been previously investigated for ODHP. This approach aims to enhance propene yield while mitigating some of the challenges associated with using oxygen alone.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统催化系统中非选择性燃烧反应限制了烯烃的选择性。

2. 由于丙烯再吸附和随后氧化成碳氧化物，在高转化率下选择性损失显著，导致丙烯产率通常低于30%。

3. 非氧化路线中的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低温度下运行，这在热力学上更有利。

2. 使用氧气抑制积碳形成。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用氧气可能导致不希望的燃烧反应，限制了选择性。

2. 在转化率和选择性之间找到适当的平衡仍然困难。

该研究探索了一种新方法，使用H2S作为气相促进剂，这在ODHP中之前未被研究过。这种方法旨在提高丙烯产率，同时缓解仅使用氧气所带来的一些挑战。
