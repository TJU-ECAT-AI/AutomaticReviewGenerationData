[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%"

[2] "This process provides an attractive alternate route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."

[3] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Selectivity losses at high conversions due to propene re-adsorption and oxidation to CO and CO2, limiting propene yields to below 30%.

2. Coke formation in non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower temperatures, which is thermodynamically favorable.
2. Using O2 to inhibit coke formation.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly with oxidant selection. Using oxygen can lead to over-oxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing selectivity to propene. The study explores using H2S as a gas-phase promoter to enhance propene yield, which had not been previously investigated for ODHP.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于丙烯再吸附和氧化成CO和CO2，在高转化率下选择性损失，限制了丙烯产率低于30%。

2. 非氧化脱氢过程中的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低温度下运行，这在热力学上更有利。
2. 使用O2来抑制积碳形成。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气可能导致碳氢化合物过度氧化，降低对丙烯的选择性。该研究探索了使用H2S作为气相促进剂来提高丙烯产率，这在ODHP中之前未被研究过。

[4] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly. Most importantly, propene selectivity increased and propene became the major product, especially at residence times below 0.5 s."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low selectivity and yield: Conventional processes suffer from extensive selectivity losses as conversion increases, leading to propene yields below 30%.

2. Coke formation: Non-oxidative routes are prone to coke formation, which reduces catalyst efficiency and lifetime.

3. High energy requirements: Traditional cracking and dehydrogenation processes operate at high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering thermodynamic advantages: ODHP is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures compared to conventional methods.

2. Inhibiting coke formation: The presence of oxygen in ODHP inhibits coke formation.

3. Potentially improving selectivity and yield: By using appropriate catalysts and reaction conditions, ODHP can achieve higher propene selectivity and yield.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. Over-oxidation: The use of oxygen can lead to undesired complete oxidation of hydrocarbons to CO and CO2, reducing selectivity.

2. Safety concerns: Mixing oxygen with flammable propane requires careful reactor design to avoid explosive mixtures.

3. Balancing conversion and selectivity: Achieving high propane conversion while maintaining high propene selectivity remains a challenge.

The study introduces a novel approach using H2S as a gas-phase promoter in ODHP, which shows promise in addressing some of these challenges. The addition of H2S to the feed gas significantly reduced the formation of undesired products (COx, C2H4, and CH4) and increased propene selectivity, especially at short residence times. This innovative approach demonstrates the potential for improving ODHP performance through careful selection of promoters and reaction conditions.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 低选择性和产率：传统工艺随着转化率的增加会出现严重的选择性损失，导致丙烯产率低于30%。

2. 积碳形成：非氧化路线容易形成积碳，降低催化剂效率和寿命。

3. 高能耗：传统裂解和脱氢工艺在高温下运行。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供热力学优势：与传统方法相比，ODHP在较低温度下具有热力学优势。

2. 抑制积碳形成：ODHP中氧气的存在抑制了积碳的形成。

3. 潜在提高选择性和产率：通过使用适当的催化剂和反应条件，ODHP可以实现更高的丙烯选择性和产率。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 过度氧化：使用氧气可能导致碳氢化合物不希望的完全氧化为CO和CO2，降低选择性。

2. 安全隐患：将氧气与易燃的丙烷混合需要谨慎的反应器设计，以避免形成爆炸性混合物。

3. 平衡转化率和选择性：在保持高丙烯选择性的同时实现高丙烷转化率仍然是一个挑战。

该研究引入了一种新方法，在ODHP中使用H2S作为气相促进剂，这显示出解决部分挑战的前景。向进料气中添加H2S显著减少了不希望产物（COx、C2H4和CH4）的形成，并增加了丙烯选择性，特别是在短停留时间下。这种创新方法展示了通过谨慎选择促进剂和反应条件来改善ODHP性能的潜力。
