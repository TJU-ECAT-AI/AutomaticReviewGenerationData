[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%"

[2] "This process provides an attractive alternate route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."

[3] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Selectivity losses at high conversions due to propene re-adsorption and oxidation to CO and CO2, limiting propene yields to below 30%.

2. Coke formation in non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Operating at lower temperatures, which is thermodynamically favorable.
2. Using O2 to inhibit coke formation.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly with oxidant selection. Using oxygen can lead to over-oxidation of hydrocarbons, reducing selectivity to propene. The study explores using H2S as a gas-phase promoter to enhance propene yield, which had not been previously investigated for ODHP.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于丙烯再吸附和氧化成CO和CO2，在高转化率下选择性损失，限制了丙烯产率低于30%。

2. 非氧化脱氢过程中的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 在较低温度下运行，这在热力学上更有利。
2. 使用O2来抑制积碳形成。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气可能导致碳氢化合物过度氧化，降低对丙烯的选择性。该研究探索了使用H2S作为气相促进剂来提高丙烯产率，这在ODHP中之前未被研究过。
