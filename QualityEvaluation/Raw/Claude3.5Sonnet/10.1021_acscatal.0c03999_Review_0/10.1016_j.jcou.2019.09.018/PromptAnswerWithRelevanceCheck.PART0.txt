[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products."

[2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."

[3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."

[4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

[5] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Increasing demand that cannot be met by current main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking).
2. Attempts to increase propylene production through these methods negatively impact the production of other important co-products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative process dedicated solely to propylene production.
2. Providing higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propylene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
3. Allowing for chemical CO2 utilization in large-scale propylene production.

The advantages of ODHP, particularly when using CO2 as an oxidant (CO2-PDH), include:

1. Higher propylene yield and propane conversion.
2. Production of valuable by-products like hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas).
3. Potential for CO2 utilization, addressing environmental concerns.

The literature does not directly discuss the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant or compare it to CO2 in detail. However, the focus on CO2-PDH suggests that it may have advantages over oxygen-based ODHP, possibly due to milder oxidation conditions or better selectivity.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 不断增长的需求无法通过当前的主要来源（蒸汽裂解和催化裂解）得到满足。
2. 试图通过这些方法增加丙烯产量会对其他重要副产品的生产产生负面影响。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供一种专门用于丙烯生产的替代工艺。
2. 与商业非氧化脱氢相比，提供更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。
3. 允许在大规模丙烯生产中进行化学CO2利用。

ODHP的优势，特别是使用CO2作为氧化剂（CO2-PDH）时，包括：

1. 更高的丙烯产率和丙烷转化率。
2. 生产有价值的副产品，如氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）。
3. CO2利用的潜力，解决环境问题。

文献并未直接讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战，也没有详细比较氧气和CO2。然而，对CO2-PDH的关注表明，它可能比基于氧气的ODHP具有优势，可能是由于氧化条件更温和或选择性更好。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Inability to meet growing demand: Current main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking) cannot satisfy the estimated future demand for propylene.

2. Co-product interdependence: Attempts to increase propylene production through these methods negatively impact the production of other important co-products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing a dedicated process for propylene production, independent of other products.
2. Offering higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propylene compared to traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Advantages of ODHP, particularly with CO2 as an oxidant (CO2-PDH):

1. Utilization of CO2, making it an environmentally friendly process.
2. Production of valuable by-products: hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas).

The literature does not specifically discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant or compare it to CO2. Therefore, the specific advantages and limitations of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP cannot be addressed based on the given information.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 无法满足不断增长的需求：目前的主要来源（蒸汽裂解和催化裂解）无法满足预计的未来丙烯需求。

2. 联产品相互依存：通过这些方法增加丙烯产量的尝试会对其他重要联产品的生产产生负面影响。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门的丙烯生产过程，独立于其他产品。
2. 与传统的非氧化脱氢相比，提供更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

ODHP的优势，特别是使用CO2作为氧化剂（CO2-PDH）时：

1. 利用CO2，使其成为环境友好的过程。
2. 生产有价值的副产品：氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）。

文献没有具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，也没有将其与CO2进行比较。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论氧气作为ODHP中氧化剂的具体优势和限制。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Insufficient production capacity to meet growing demand. Current main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking) cannot satisfy the projected demand of 130 million tonnes by 2023.

2. Attempts to increase propylene production through optimizing existing processes negatively impact the production of other important co-products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing a selective process dedicated solely to propylene synthesis.

2. Utilizing a co-reagent (O2 or CO2) to remove thermodynamic limitations of traditional propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or increase production through hydrogen binding.

3. Achieving higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propylene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Advantages of ODHP, particularly CO2-PDH:

1. It can be an attractive way for chemical CO2 utilization.
2. In addition to propylene, it produces valuable by-products like hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas).

The literature does not specifically discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant or compare different oxidants in detail. Therefore, the specific advantages and limitations related to oxidant selection cannot be fully addressed based on the given information.

2. 通过优化现有流程来增加丙烯产量的尝试会对其他重要副产品的生产产生负面影响。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

2. 利用共反应物（O2或CO2）来消除传统丙烷脱氢（PDH）的热力学限制或通过氢结合增加产量。

3. 与商业非氧化脱氢相比，实现更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

ODHP的优势，特别是CO2-PDH：

1. 它可以成为化学CO2利用的一种有吸引力的方式。
2. 除了丙烯，还能生产有价值的副产品，如氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Increasing demand: Propene demand is growing rapidly and is expected to reach 130 million tonnes by 2023.

2. Limited supply from traditional sources: The two main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking) cannot meet the growing demand.

3. Negative impact on co-products: Attempts to increase propene production through these methods negatively affect other important co-products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative process specifically dedicated to propene production.

2. Providing higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. Utilizing CO2 as an oxidant (in CO2-PDH), which makes it an attractive method for chemical CO2 utilization.

4. Producing valuable by-products such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) in addition to propene.

The advantages of ODHP include higher conversion and yield, CO2 utilization, and production of valuable by-products. However, the literature does not provide specific information about the limitations of ODHP or challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.
