[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products."

[2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."

[3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."

[4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

[5] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Increasing demand: Propene demand is growing rapidly and is expected to reach 130 million tonnes by 2023.

2. Limited supply from traditional sources: The two main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking) cannot meet the growing demand.

3. Negative impact on co-products: Attempts to increase propene production through these methods negatively affect other important co-products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative process specifically dedicated to propene production.

2. Providing higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

3. Utilizing CO2 as an oxidant (in CO2-PDH), which makes it an attractive method for chemical CO2 utilization.

4. Producing valuable by-products such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) in addition to propene.

The advantages of ODHP include higher conversion and yield, CO2 utilization, and production of valuable by-products. However, the literature does not provide specific information about the limitations of ODHP or challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. More research would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 需求增加：丙烯需求正在迅速增长，预计到2023年将达到1.3亿吨。

2. 传统来源供应有限：两个主要来源（蒸汽裂解和催化裂解）无法满足不断增长的需求。

3. 对副产品的负面影响：通过这些方法增加丙烯产量的尝试会对其他重要副产品产生负面影响。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门用于丙烯生产的替代工艺。

2. 与商业非氧化脱氢相比，提供更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

3. 利用CO2作为氧化剂（在CO2-PDH中），使其成为化学CO2利用的一种有吸引力的方法。

4. 除丙烯外，还生产有价值的副产品，如氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）。

ODHP的优势包括更高的转化率和产率、CO2利用以及有价值副产品的生产。然而，文献没有提供关于ODHP的局限性或使用氧气作为氧化剂所面临的挑战的具体信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面解答这些问题。
