[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products."

[2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."

[3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."

[4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

[5] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Inability to meet growing demand: Current main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking) cannot satisfy the estimated future demand for propylene.

2. Co-product interdependence: Attempts to increase propylene production through these methods negatively impact the production of other important co-products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing a dedicated process for propylene production, independent of other products.
2. Offering higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propylene compared to traditional non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Advantages of ODHP, particularly with CO2 as an oxidant (CO2-PDH):

1. Utilization of CO2, making it an environmentally friendly process.
2. Production of valuable by-products: hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas).

The literature does not specifically discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant or compare it to CO2. Therefore, the specific advantages and limitations of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP cannot be addressed based on the given information.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 无法满足不断增长的需求：目前的主要来源（蒸汽裂解和催化裂解）无法满足预计的未来丙烯需求。

2. 联产品相互依存：通过这些方法增加丙烯产量的尝试会对其他重要联产品的生产产生负面影响。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门的丙烯生产过程，独立于其他产品。
2. 与传统的非氧化脱氢相比，提供更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

ODHP的优势，特别是使用CO2作为氧化剂（CO2-PDH）时：

1. 利用CO2，使其成为环境友好的过程。
2. 生产有价值的副产品：氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）。

文献没有具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，也没有将其与CO2进行比较。因此，基于给定信息无法讨论氧气作为ODHP中氧化剂的具体优势和限制。
