[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023 [1]. It is estimated that such high demand for propene wont be satisfied by its current two most important sources, that is, steam cracking and catalytic cracking, in which propene is obtained as co-products."

[2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."

[3] "An attractive alternative for the traditional PDH is propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (ODH) or propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH)."

[4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."

[5] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. Increasing demand that cannot be met by current main sources (steam cracking and catalytic cracking).
2. Attempts to increase propylene production through these methods negatively impact the production of other important co-products.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative dedicated solely to propylene production.
2. Providing higher per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propylene compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
3. Allowing for chemical CO2 utilization in large-scale propylene production.

The advantages of ODHP include higher conversion and yield, as well as the production of valuable by-products like hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas). The literature does not specifically mention limitations or challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP. However, it does present CO2 as an alternative oxidant, suggesting that there may be some advantages to using CO2 over oxygen in this process.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 不断增长的需求无法通过当前的主要来源（蒸汽裂解和催化裂解）来满足。
2. 通过这些方法增加丙烯产量的尝试会对其他重要副产品的生产产生负面影响。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供一种专门用于丙烯生产的替代方法。
2. 与商业非氧化脱氢相比，提供更高的单程丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。
3. 在大规模丙烯生产中允许化学CO2利用。

ODHP的优势包括更高的转化率和产率，以及生产有价值的副产品如氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）。文献中没有具体提到使用氧气作为ODHP氧化剂的限制或挑战。然而，它确实提出了CO2作为替代氧化剂，这表明在这个过程中使用CO2可能比使用氧气有一些优势。
