[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Cat-
alytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary
methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly
used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are
endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of
DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables
lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur-
face coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a
low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and
propylene at high conversion."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for
dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike
oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its orig-
inal state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynam-
ically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap
and abundant"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Endothermic nature of steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) processes.
2. Coke formation during these processes.
3. Thermodynamic limitations on alkane conversion in DH.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Enabling lower reaction temperatures.
2. More effectively inhibiting surface coke formation.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly when using molecular oxygen as the oxidant:

1. Low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion.

To address the limitations of using oxygen, CO2 has been explored as an alternative oxidant for dehydrogenation. CO2 offers several advantages:

1. Acts as a mild oxidant.
2. Cannot fully oxidize the catalyst due to its weak oxidation capacity.
3. Is thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert.
4. Is cheap and abundant.

These properties of CO2 make it an attractive option for addressing the challenges associated with both traditional propylene production methods and ODHP using oxygen.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）过程的吸热性质。
2. 这些过程中的焦炭形成。
3. DH中烷烃转化的热力学限制。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 实现较低的反应温度。
2. 更有效地抑制表面焦炭形成。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的挑战，特别是在使用分子氧作为氧化剂时：

1. 由于高转化率下丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性低。

为了解决使用氧气的局限性，CO2被探索作为脱氢的替代氧化剂。CO2提供了几个优势：

1. 作为温和的氧化剂。
2. 由于其弱氧化能力，不能完全氧化催化剂。
3. 热力学稳定和动力学惰性。
4. 便宜且丰富。

这些CO2的特性使其成为一个有吸引力的选择，可以解决传统丙烯生产方法和使用氧气的ODHP所面临的挑战。
