[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints."

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Endothermic reactions that require high energy input
2. Coke formation during the process
3. Thermodynamic limitations on alkane conversion in dehydrogenation (DH)

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Enabling lower reaction temperatures
2. More effectively inhibiting surface coke formation

However, ODHP presents its own limitations, particularly when using molecular oxygen as the oxidant:

1. Low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion

To address the challenges associated with using oxygen, CO2 has gained attention as an alternative oxidant for dehydrogenation because:

1. It acts as a mild oxidant
2. It cannot fully oxidize the catalyst due to its weak oxidation capacity
3. It is thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert
4. It is cheap and abundant

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP helps to overcome some of the limitations associated with molecular oxygen while still addressing the primary challenges of traditional propylene production methods.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 需要高能量输入的吸热反应
2. 过程中的积碳形成
3. 脱氢(DH)过程中烷烃转化的热力学限制

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 实现更低的反应温度
2. 更有效地抑制表面积碳形成

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是在使用分子氧作为氧化剂时：

1. 由于高转化率下丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性低

为了解决使用氧气相关的挑战，CO2作为替代氧化剂引起了关注，因为：

1. 它作为温和的氧化剂
2. 由于其弱氧化能力，不能完全氧化催化剂
3. 它在热力学上稳定且动力学上惰性
4. 它便宜且丰富

在ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂有助于克服与分子氧相关的一些限制，同时仍能解决传统丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。
