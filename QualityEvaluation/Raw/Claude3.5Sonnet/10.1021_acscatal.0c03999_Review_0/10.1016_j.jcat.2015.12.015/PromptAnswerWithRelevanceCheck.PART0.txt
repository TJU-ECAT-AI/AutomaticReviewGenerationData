[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Endothermic reactions requiring high energy input
2. Coke formation on catalysts
3. Thermodynamic limitations on alkane conversion in dehydrogenation processes

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Enabling lower reaction temperatures
2. More effectively inhibiting surface coke formation

However, ODHP using molecular oxygen as an oxidant presents its own limitation:

1. Low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion

To address this, CO2 has gained attention as an alternative oxidant because:

1. It acts as a mild oxidant
2. It cannot fully oxidize the catalyst due to its weak oxidation capacity, potentially improving selectivity

Overall, ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant shows promise in addressing the challenges of traditional propylene production methods while potentially overcoming the selectivity issues associated with using oxygen as an oxidant.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 吸热反应需要高能量输入
2. 催化剂上形成焦炭
3. 脱氢过程中烷烃转化的热力学限制

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 降低反应温度
2. 更有效地抑制表面焦炭形成

然而，使用分子氧作为氧化剂的ODHP存在自身的限制：

1. 由于丙烷和丙烯在高转化率下的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性低

为解决这个问题，CO2作为替代氧化剂引起了关注，因为：

1. 它作为温和的氧化剂
2. 由于其弱氧化能力，它不能完全氧化催化剂，可能提高选择性

总的来说，以CO2为氧化剂的ODHP在解决传统丙烯生产方法的挑战的同时，有望克服使用氧气作为氧化剂时相关的选择性问题。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Endothermic nature of steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) processes.
2. Coke formation during these processes.
3. Thermodynamic limitations on alkane conversion in DH.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Enabling lower reaction temperatures.
2. More effectively inhibiting surface coke formation.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly when using molecular oxygen as the oxidant:

1. Low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion.

To address the limitations of using oxygen, CO2 has been explored as an alternative oxidant for dehydrogenation. CO2 offers several advantages:

1. Acts as a mild oxidant.

3. Is thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert.
4. Is cheap and abundant.

These properties of CO2 make it an attractive option for addressing the challenges associated with both traditional propylene production methods and ODHP using oxygen.
