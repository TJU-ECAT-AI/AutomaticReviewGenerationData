[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke. In case of DH, alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic constraints"

[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation. The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion."

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation, because CO2 can act as a mild oxidant. Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. It is a thermodynamically stable and a kinetically inert molecule, and it is also cheap and abundant"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Endothermic reactions requiring high energy input
2. Coke formation on catalysts
3. Thermodynamic limitations on alkane conversion for dehydrogenation (DH)

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Enabling lower reaction temperatures
2. More effectively inhibiting surface coke formation

However, ODHP using molecular oxygen as an oxidant has its own limitation:

1. Low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion

To address this, CO2 has gained attention as an alternative oxidant because:

1. It acts as a mild oxidant
2. It cannot fully oxidize the catalyst due to its weak oxidation capacity
3. It is thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert
4. It is cheap and abundant

This approach aims to balance the benefits of oxidative dehydrogenation while mitigating the selectivity issues associated with using molecular oxygen.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 吸热反应需要高能量输入
2. 催化剂上形成焦炭
3. 脱氢（DH）反应的热力学限制

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 实现更低的反应温度
2. 更有效地抑制表面焦炭形成

然而，使用分子氧作为氧化剂的ODHP有其自身的限制：

1. 由于高转化率下丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化，导致丙烯选择性低

为解决这一问题，CO2作为替代氧化剂引起了关注，因为：

1. 它作为温和的氧化剂
2. 由于其弱氧化能力，它不能完全氧化催化剂
3. 它在热力学上稳定，动力学上惰性
4. 它便宜且丰富

这种方法旨在平衡氧化脱氢的优势，同时缓解与使用分子氧相关的选择性问题。
