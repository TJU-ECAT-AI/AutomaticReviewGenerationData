[1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."

[2] "Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct. The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand; hence, producers are always interested in developing on-demand technologies that produce propylene specifically."

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply from traditional cracking processes to meet growing demand.
2. Limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy requirements, and coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an on-demand technology specifically for propylene production.
2. Adding an oxidant to initiate the reaction, reducing the need for high temperatures.
3. Being exothermic in nature, which helps overcome the high energy input requirement.
4. Limiting coke formation, thus reducing catalyst deactivation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

Advantages:
1. Exothermic nature of the reaction
2. Reduced coke formation

Limitations:
1. Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 when using oxygen as the oxidant
2. Possibility of reaction runaway

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP include the risk of over-oxidation of the desired olefin products and potential safety concerns due to the possibility of reaction runaway.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统裂解工艺的供应无法满足不断增长的需求。
2. 简单脱氢反应的局限性，包括副反应、热力学限制、高能耗要求以及导致催化剂失活的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门用于丙烯生产的按需技术。
2. 添加氧化剂以启动反应，减少对高温的需求。
3. 具有放热性质，有助于克服高能量输入要求。
4. 限制积碳形成，从而减少催化剂失活。

然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面也存在自身的优势和局限性：

优势：
1. 反应的放热性质
2. 减少积碳形成

局限性：
1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，烯烃过度氧化成CO和CO2
2. 反应失控的可能性

在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战包括所需烯烃产品过度氧化的风险，以及由于反应可能失控而引发的潜在安全问题。
