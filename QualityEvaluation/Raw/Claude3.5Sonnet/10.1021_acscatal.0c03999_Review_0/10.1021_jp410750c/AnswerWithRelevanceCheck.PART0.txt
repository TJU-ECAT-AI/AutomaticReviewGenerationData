          [1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."

[2] "Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct. The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand"

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply from traditional cracking processes to meet growing demand.
2. Limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, high energy input requirements, and coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production method to meet increasing demand.
2. Adding an oxidant to initiate the reaction, reducing the need for high temperatures.
3. Being exothermic in nature, which reduces energy input requirements.
4. Limiting coke formation, thus reducing catalyst deactivation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly when using oxygen as the oxidant:

1. Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, reducing selectivity.
2. Possibility of reaction runaway due to the highly exothermic nature of the process.

These challenges highlight the importance of oxidant selection in ODHP processes and the need for careful control of reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and safety risks.

          目前丙烯生产方法面临的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统裂解工艺的供应无法满足不断增长的需求。
2. 简单脱氢反应的局限性，包括副反应、选择性和转化率的热力学限制、高能耗需求以及导致催化剂失活的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供替代生产方法以满足不断增长的需求。
2. 添加氧化剂来启动反应，减少对高温的需求。
3. 反应具有放热性质，减少能量输入需求。
4. 限制积碳形成，从而减少催化剂失活。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂时：

1. 烯烃过度氧化生成CO和CO2，降低选择性。
2. 由于反应的高度放热性质，可能导致反应失控。

这些挑战突显了在ODHP过程中氧化剂选择的重要性，以及需要仔细控制反应条件以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和安全风险。
