[1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct."

[2] "The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand; hence, producers are always interested in developing on-demand technologies that produce propylene specifically."

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Inability of traditional cracking processes to meet growing demand for propylene.

2. Limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, high energy requirements due to the endothermic nature of the process, and coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an on-demand technology specifically for propylene production.

2. Adding an oxidant to the reaction feed, which initiates the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone.

3. Offering an exothermic process, which reduces energy input requirements.

4. Limiting coke formation, which helps prevent catalyst deactivation.

However, ODHP using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges:

1. Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, which reduces selectivity and yield of the desired propylene product.

2. Possibility of reaction runaway, which poses safety concerns in industrial applications.

These challenges highlight the importance of oxidant selection in ODHP processes and the need for careful control of reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and safety risks.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 简单脱氢反应的局限性，包括副反应、选择性和转化率的热力学限制、过程的吸热性质导致高能耗，以及导致催化剂失活的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门用于丙烯生产的按需技术。

2. 在反应进料中添加氧化剂，通过氧化剂而非单纯的高温来启动反应。

3. 提供放热过程，减少能量输入需求。

4. 限制积碳形成，有助于防止催化剂失活。

然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战：

1. 烯烃过度氧化成CO和CO2，降低了目标产物丙烯的选择性和产率。

2. 存在反应失控的可能性，这在工业应用中构成安全隐患。

这些挑战突出了ODHP过程中氧化剂选择的重要性，以及需要仔细控制反应条件以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应和安全风险。
