[1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."

[2] "The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand; hence, producers are always interested in developing on-demand technologies that produce propylene specifically."

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Inability of cracking processes to meet growing demand for propylene.
2. Limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy requirements, and coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an on-demand technology specifically for propylene production.
2. Adding an oxidant to initiate the reaction, reducing the need for high temperatures.
3. Creating an exothermic process, which reduces energy input requirements.
4. Limiting coke formation, which helps maintain catalyst activity.

However, ODHP using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own challenges:

1. Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, reducing selectivity.
2. Possibility of reaction runaway, which poses safety concerns.

The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial in ODHP to balance reactivity, selectivity, and safety considerations.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 裂解工艺无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。
2. 简单脱氢反应的局限性，包括副反应、热力学限制、高能耗要求以及导致催化剂失活的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门用于丙烯生产的按需技术。
2. 添加氧化剂来启动反应，减少对高温的需求。
3. 创造放热过程，降低能量输入需求。
4. 限制积碳形成，有助于维持催化剂活性。

然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP也面临自身的挑战：

1. 烯烃过度氧化成CO和CO2，降低选择性。
2. 反应失控的可能性，带来安全隐患。

在ODHP中选择适当的氧化剂对于平衡反应性、选择性和安全性考虑至关重要。
