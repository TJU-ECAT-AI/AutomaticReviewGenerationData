[1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."

[2] "Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct. The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand"

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply from traditional cracking processes to meet growing demand.
2. Limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy requirements, and coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production method specifically for propylene.
2. Adding an oxidant to initiate the reaction, which makes the process exothermic and reduces coke formation.

Advantages of ODHP:
- Exothermic nature, reducing energy input
- Limited coke formation, improving catalyst lifetime

Limitations of ODHP, particularly when using oxygen:
- Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2
- Possibility of reaction runaway

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant presents specific challenges in controlling the reaction to prevent over-oxidation and maintain safety, while still benefiting from its low cost and the formation of water as a byproduct.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统裂解工艺的供应不足，无法满足不断增长的需求。
2. 简单脱氢反应的局限性，包括副反应、热力学限制、高能耗需求，以及导致催化剂失活的积碳形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供专门用于丙烯生产的替代方法。
2. 添加氧化剂来启动反应，使过程变为放热反应并减少积碳形成。

ODHP的优势：
- 放热性质，减少能量输入
- 有限的积碳形成，提高催化剂寿命

ODHP的局限性，特别是使用氧气时：
- 烯烃过度氧化生成CO和CO2
- 反应失控的可能性

选择氧气作为氧化剂带来了特定的挑战，需要控制反应以防止过度氧化并保持安全，同时仍然受益于其低成本和生成水作为副产品的优势。
