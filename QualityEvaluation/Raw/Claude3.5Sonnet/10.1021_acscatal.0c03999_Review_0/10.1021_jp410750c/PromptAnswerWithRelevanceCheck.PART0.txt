[1] "Light unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and propylene, are important feedstocks used in the manufacturing of chemicals and polymers. More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide."

[2] "Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct. The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand"

[3] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation."

[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."

[5] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Insufficient supply from traditional cracking processes to meet growing demand.
2. Limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, high energy input requirements, and coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production method to meet increasing demand.
2. Adding an oxidant to initiate the reaction, reducing the need for high temperatures.
3. Being exothermic in nature, which reduces energy input requirements.
4. Limiting coke formation, thus reducing catalyst deactivation.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly when using oxygen as the oxidant:

1. Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, reducing selectivity.
2. Possibility of reaction runaway due to the highly exothermic nature of the process.

These challenges highlight the need for careful oxidant selection and process control in ODHP to maximize propylene yield while maintaining safety and efficiency.

1. Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, which reduces selectivity and yield of the desired propylene product.

2. Possibility of reaction runaway, which poses safety concerns in industrial applications.

These challenges highlight the importance of oxidant selection in ODHP processes and the need for careful control of reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions and safety risks.

2. Limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, including side reactions, thermodynamic constraints, high energy requirements, and coke formation leading to catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative production method specifically for propylene.
2. Adding an oxidant to initiate the reaction, which makes the process exothermic and reduces coke formation.

Advantages of ODHP:
- Exothermic nature, reducing energy input
- Limited coke formation, improving catalyst lifetime

Limitations of ODHP, particularly when using oxygen:
- Over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2
- Possibility of reaction runaway

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant presents specific challenges in controlling the reaction to prevent over-oxidation and maintain safety, while still benefiting from its low cost and the formation of water as a byproduct.
