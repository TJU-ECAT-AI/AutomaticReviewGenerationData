<quotes>

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

[2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

[3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Environmental and practical concerns with chromium-based catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative route to obtain propylene from low-cost, saturated propane feedstock.

2. Offering potential for chromium-free catalysts, addressing environmental concerns.

However, the literature does not specifically discuss oxidant selection or challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP. More information would be needed to fully address those aspects of the question.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Environmental concerns with chromium-based catalysts.

3. Need for more efficient routes to convert low-cost saturated feedstocks to alkenes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a potentially more efficient route to convert propane to propylene using chromium-free catalysts. However, the literature does not explicitly discuss ODHP, oxidant selection, or specific challenges associated with using oxygen. The focus is on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using gallium-based catalysts.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Environmental and practical concerns with chromium-based catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation.

3. The need to utilize low-cost saturated feedstocks more efficiently.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene from low-cost propane feedstock using chromium-free catalysts. However, the literature does not provide specific information on the advantages and limitations of ODHP, oxidant selection, or challenges associated with using oxygen. The focus of the study is on non-oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 or N2 as diluents rather than oxidative dehydrogenation.
