[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

[2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

[3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Environmental and practical concerns with chromium-based catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation.

3. The need to utilize low-cost saturated feedstocks more efficiently.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route to produce propylene from low-cost propane feedstock using chromium-free catalysts. However, the literature does not provide specific information on the advantages and limitations of ODHP, oxidant selection, or challenges associated with using oxygen. The focus of the study is on non-oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 or N2 as diluents rather than oxidative dehydrogenation.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解满足不断增长的丙烯需求的能力有限。

2. 在丙烷脱氢中使用铬基催化剂存在环境和实际应用方面的问题。

3. 需要更有效地利用低成本的饱和原料。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种使用无铬催化剂从低成本丙烷原料生产丙烯的途径来解决这些问题。然而，该文献并未提供关于ODHP的优势和局限性、氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关挑战的具体信息。该研究的重点是使用CO2或N2作为稀释剂的非氧化脱氢，而非氧化脱氢。
