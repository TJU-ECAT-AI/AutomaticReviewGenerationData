[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

[2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

[3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Environmental and practical concerns with chromium-based catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative route to obtain propylene from low-cost, saturated propane feedstock.

2. Offering potential for chromium-free catalysts, addressing environmental concerns.

However, the literature does not specifically discuss oxidant selection or challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP. More information would be needed to fully address those aspects of the question.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解满足不断增长的丙烯需求的能力有限。

2. 用于丙烷脱氢的铬基催化剂存在环境和实际应用方面的问题。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了一种从低成本、饱和丙烷原料获得丙烯的替代路线。

2. 提供无铬催化剂的潜力，解决环境问题。

然而，文献并未具体讨论氧化剂选择或使用氧气在ODHP中相关的挑战。需要更多信息才能全面回答这些问题的方面。
