[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

[2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

[3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Environmental and practical concerns with chromium-based catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative route to produce alkenes from low-cost saturated feedstocks.

2. Offering potential for chromium-free catalysts, which are more environmentally friendly.

However, the literature does not provide specific information about oxidant selection challenges or limitations associated with using oxygen in ODHP. The document focuses more on non-oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 or in the absence of oxidants.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的能力有限，无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 用于丙烷脱氢的铬基催化剂存在环境和实际应用方面的问题。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了一种从低成本饱和原料生产烯烃的替代路径。

2. 有潜力使用无铬催化剂，这对环境更加友好。

然而，该文献并未提供关于氧化剂选择挑战或使用氧气进行ODHP相关限制的具体信息。该文档更多地关注使用CO2或在无氧化剂条件下进行的非氧化脱氢。
