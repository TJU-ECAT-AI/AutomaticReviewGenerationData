[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks"

[2] "This process is of increasing significance due to the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market"

[3] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet increasing propylene demand.

2. Environmental concerns with chromium-based catalysts.

3. Need for more efficient routes to convert low-cost saturated feedstocks to alkenes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a potentially more efficient route to convert propane to propylene using chromium-free catalysts. However, the literature does not explicitly discuss ODHP, oxidant selection, or specific challenges associated with using oxygen. The focus is on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using gallium-based catalysts.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括:

1. 蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解满足不断增长的丙烯需求的能力有限。

2. 铬基催化剂存在环境问题。

3. 需要更高效的路线将低成本饱和原料转化为烯烃。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种潜在的更高效的路线来将丙烷转化为丙烯,使用无铬催化剂,从而解决了这些问题。然而,文献并未明确讨论ODHP、氧化剂选择或使用氧气相关的具体挑战。文献重点关注使用镓基催化剂进行丙烷非氧化脱氢。
