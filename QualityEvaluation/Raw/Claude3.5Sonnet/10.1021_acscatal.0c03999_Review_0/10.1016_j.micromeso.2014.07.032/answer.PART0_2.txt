[1] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield"

[2] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention"

[3] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[4] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low olefin selectivity and yield due to over-oxidation when using dioxygen as an oxidant. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as an oxidant, which has attracted considerable attention due to its potential to improve selectivity and yield.

However, ODHP with N2O presents its own set of challenges. The reaction mechanism is not yet fully understood, which hinders the design of effective catalysts. Additionally, catalyst deactivation remains a key issue in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.

The use of nitrous oxide as an oxidant in ODHP offers potential advantages in terms of improved selectivity and yield compared to dioxygen. However, the lack of clear understanding of the reaction mechanism and ongoing issues with catalyst deactivation limit the further development and application of this method. Research efforts are ongoing to address these challenges and unlock the full potential of ODHP with N2O for propylene production.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括使用二氧化物作为氧化剂时，由于过度氧化导致的低烯烃选择性和产率。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提议使用一氧化二氮代替二氧化物作为氧化剂来解决这些问题，这因其提高选择性和产率的潜力而受到广泛关注。

然而，使用N2O的ODHP也带来了一系列挑战。反应机理尚未完全理解，这阻碍了有效催化剂的设计。此外，无论使用二氧化物还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是氧化脱氢反应中的一个关键问题。

在ODHP中使用一氧化二氮作为氧化剂与二氧化物相比，在提高选择性和产率方面具有潜在优势。然而，对反应机理缺乏清晰的理解以及催化剂失活的持续问题限制了该方法的进一步发展和应用。研究工作正在进行，以解决这些挑战，充分发挥ODHP与N2O在丙烯生产中的潜力。
