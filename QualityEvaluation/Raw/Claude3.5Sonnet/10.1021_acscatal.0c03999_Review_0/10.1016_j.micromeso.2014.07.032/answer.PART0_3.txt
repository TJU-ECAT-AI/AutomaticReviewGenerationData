[1] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield"

[2] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention"

[3] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[4] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low olefin selectivity and yield due to over-oxidation when using dioxygen as an oxidant. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as an oxidant, which has shown promising results in improving selectivity and yield.

However, ODHP with N2O presents its own set of challenges. The reaction mechanism is not fully understood, which hinders the design of more effective catalysts. Additionally, catalyst deactivation remains a significant problem, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant. This deactivation is generally attributed to coke formation and deposition on the catalyst surface, but the specific nature and origin of the coke are not well understood.

These limitations in understanding the reaction and deactivation mechanisms make it difficult to develop strategies to prevent catalyst deactivation and improve catalyst lifetime in ODHP with N2O. Despite these challenges, the use of nitrous oxide as an oxidant in ODHP shows potential for addressing the over-oxidation issues associated with dioxygen, making it an area of considerable research interest.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括使用二氧化物作为氧化剂时，由于过度氧化导致的低烯烃选择性和产率。丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提出使用一氧化二氮代替二氧化物作为氧化剂来解决这些问题，这在提高选择性和产率方面已显示出有希望的结果。

然而，使用N2O的ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战。反应机理尚未完全理解，这阻碍了更有效催化剂的设计。此外，无论使用二氧化物还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是一个重大问题。这种失活通常归因于焦炭在催化剂表面的形成和沉积，但焦炭的具体性质和来源尚不清楚。

这些对反应和失活机理理解的局限性使得难以制定防止催化剂失活和提高N2O ODHP中催化剂寿命的策略。尽管存在这些挑战，但在ODHP中使用一氧化二氮作为氧化剂显示出解决与二氧化物相关的过度氧化问题的潜力，使其成为一个受到相当研究兴趣的领域。
