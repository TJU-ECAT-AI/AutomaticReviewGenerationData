The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low olefin selectivity and yield due to over-oxidation when using dioxygen as an oxidant. This results in the extensive formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) even at moderate alkane conversions. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) instead of dioxygen as an oxidant. This approach has attracted considerable attention as it potentially offers improved selectivity and yield.

However, ODHP with N2O presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
- Potentially higher olefin selectivity and yield compared to using dioxygen
- Reduced formation of carbon oxides

Limitations:
- Catalyst deactivation remains a key issue, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant
- There are still unresolved problems that need to be addressed before further development of this reaction
- The reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not yet fully understood
- The deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood, making it difficult to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst lifetime

In the context of oxidant selection, while N2O shows promise in addressing the over-oxidation issues associated with dioxygen, it introduces new challenges in terms of understanding the reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括使用二氧化氮作为氧化剂时烯烃选择性和产率低。这导致即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会大量形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提议使用一氧化二氮（N2O）代替二氧化氮作为氧化剂来解决这些问题。这种方法引起了相当大的关注，因为它可能提供更高的选择性和产率。

然而，使用N2O的ODHP也有自己的优势和局限性：

优势：
- 与使用二氧化氮相比，可能具有更高的烯烃选择性和产率
- 减少碳氧化物的形成

局限性：
- 无论使用二氧化氮还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是一个关键问题
- 在进一步发展这种反应之前，仍有一些未解决的问题需要解决
- ODHP与N2O的反应机理尚未完全理解
- ODHP与N2O中催化剂的失活机理尚未完全理解，这使得难以防止焦炭沉积和增加催化剂寿命

在氧化剂选择的背景下，虽然N2O在解决与二氧化氮相关的过度氧化问题方面显示出前景，但它在理解反应机理和催化剂行为方面引入了新的挑战。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Over-oxidation: When using dioxygen as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed even at moderate alkane conversions. This results in low olefin selectivity and yield.

2. Catalyst deactivation: This is a key issue in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Using nitrous oxide as an alternative oxidant: This approach has gained considerable attention as it may help reduce over-oxidation issues associated with dioxygen.

However, ODHP still presents its own set of challenges:

1. Reaction mechanism understanding: The precise reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not fully understood, which hinders catalyst design and process optimization.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Even with N2O as an oxidant, catalyst deactivation remains a significant challenge that needs to be addressed to improve the process efficiency and catalyst lifetime.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 过度氧化：在使用二氧化氮作为氧化剂进行轻烷烃氧化脱氢时，即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会大量形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。这导致了低烯烃选择性和产率。

2. 催化剂失活：这是氧化脱氢反应中的一个关键问题，无论使用二氧化氮还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 使用一氧化二氮作为替代氧化剂：这种方法已引起相当大的关注，因为它可能有助于减少与二氧化氮相关的过度氧化问题。

然而，ODHP仍然存在自身的一系列挑战：

1. 反应机理理解：ODHP与N2O的精确反应机理尚未完全理解，这阻碍了催化剂设计和过程优化。

2. 催化剂失活：即使使用N2O作为氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是一个需要解决的重大挑战，以提高过程效率和催化剂寿命。

These limitations in understanding the reaction and deactivation mechanisms make it difficult to develop strategies to prevent catalyst deactivation and improve catalyst lifetime in ODHP with N2O. Despite these challenges, the use of nitrous oxide as an oxidant in ODHP shows potential for addressing the over-oxidation issues associated with dioxygen, making it an area of considerable research interest.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using oxygen, include:

1. Over-oxidation: When using dioxygen as an oxidant, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed even at moderate alkane conversions. This results in low olefin selectivity and yield.

2. Low selectivity: The formation of unwanted byproducts reduces the efficiency of the process.

ODHP addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) instead of dioxygen as the oxidant. This approach has attracted considerable attention due to its potential advantages:

1. Potentially higher selectivity: N2O may reduce over-oxidation, leading to improved olefin yields.

2. Milder oxidation conditions: N2O is a less aggressive oxidant compared to O2, which could lead to better control of the reaction.

However, ODHP with N2O also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Unclear reaction mechanism: The exact mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not fully understood, which hinders the design of more effective catalysts.

2. Catalyst deactivation: This remains a key issue in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.

3. Coke formation: The formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface contribute to catalyst deactivation, but the specific nature and origin of this coke are not fully understood.

These challenges highlight the need for further research to optimize ODHP processes, particularly in understanding reaction mechanisms and developing strategies to prevent catalyst deactivation.

目前丙烯生产方法，特别是使用氧气进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的主要挑战包括：

1. 过度氧化：当使用二氧化物作为氧化剂时，即使在中等烷烃转化率下，也会大量形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。这导致了低的烯烃选择性和产率。

2. 低选择性：不需要的副产品的形成降低了过程的效率。

ODHP通过提议使用一氧化二氮（N2O）代替二氧化物作为氧化剂来解决这些问题。这种方法因其潜在优势而受到广泛关注：

1. 可能更高的选择性：N2O可能减少过度氧化，从而提高烯烃产率。

2. 较温和的氧化条件：与O2相比，N2O是一种较不具侵略性的氧化剂，这可能会导致对反应的更好控制。

然而，使用N2O进行ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战：

1. 不清晰的反应机理：使用N2O进行ODHP的确切机理尚未完全了解，这阻碍了更有效催化剂的设计。

2. 催化剂失活：无论使用二氧化物还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，这仍然是氧化脱氢反应中的一个关键问题。

3. 焦炭形成：催化剂表面上焦炭的形成和沉积导致催化剂失活，但这种焦炭的具体性质和来源尚未完全了解。

这些挑战突出了进一步研究的必要性，以优化ODHP过程，特别是在理解反应机理和开发防止催化剂失活策略方面。
