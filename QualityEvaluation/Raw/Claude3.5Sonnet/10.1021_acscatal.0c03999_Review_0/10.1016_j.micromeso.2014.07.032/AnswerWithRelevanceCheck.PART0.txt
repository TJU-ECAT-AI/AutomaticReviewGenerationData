          [1] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield"

[2] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention"

[3] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[4] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using oxygen, include:

1. Over-oxidation: When using dioxygen as an oxidant, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and yield.

2. Low selectivity: The formation of unwanted byproducts reduces the efficiency of the process.

ODHP addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) instead of dioxygen as the oxidant. This approach has attracted considerable attention due to its potential advantages:

1. Potentially higher selectivity: N2O may reduce over-oxidation, leading to improved olefin yields.

2. Milder oxidation conditions: N2O is a less aggressive oxidant compared to O2, which could lead to better control of the reaction.

However, ODHP with N2O also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Unclear reaction mechanism: The exact mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not fully understood, which hinders the design of more effective catalysts.

2. Catalyst deactivation: This remains a key issue in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.

3. Coke formation: The formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface contribute to catalyst deactivation, but the specific nature and origin of this coke are not fully understood.

These challenges highlight the need for further research to optimize ODHP processes, particularly in understanding reaction mechanisms and developing strategies to prevent catalyst deactivation.

          目前丙烯生产方法，特别是使用氧气进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的主要挑战包括：

1. 过度氧化：当使用二氧化物作为氧化剂时，即使在中等烷烃转化率下，也会大量形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。这导致了低的烯烃选择性和产率。

2. 低选择性：不需要的副产品的形成降低了过程的效率。

ODHP通过提议使用一氧化二氮（N2O）代替二氧化物作为氧化剂来解决这些问题。这种方法因其潜在优势而受到广泛关注：

1. 可能更高的选择性：N2O可能减少过度氧化，从而提高烯烃产率。

2. 较温和的氧化条件：与O2相比，N2O是一种较不具侵略性的氧化剂，这可能会导致对反应的更好控制。

然而，使用N2O进行ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战：

1. 不清晰的反应机理：使用N2O进行ODHP的确切机理尚未完全了解，这阻碍了更有效催化剂的设计。

2. 催化剂失活：无论使用二氧化物还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，这仍然是氧化脱氢反应中的一个关键问题。

3. 焦炭形成：催化剂表面上焦炭的形成和沉积导致催化剂失活，但这种焦炭的具体性质和来源尚未完全了解。

这些挑战突出了进一步研究的必要性，以优化ODHP过程，特别是在理解反应机理和开发防止催化剂失活策略方面。
