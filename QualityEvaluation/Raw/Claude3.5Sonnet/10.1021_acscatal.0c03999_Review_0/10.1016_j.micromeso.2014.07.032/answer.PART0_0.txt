The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low olefin selectivity and yield due to over-oxidation when using dioxygen as an oxidant. This results in the extensive formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) even at moderate alkane conversions. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) instead of dioxygen as an oxidant. This approach has attracted considerable attention as it potentially offers improved selectivity and yield.

However, ODHP with N2O presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
- Potentially higher olefin selectivity and yield compared to using dioxygen
- Reduced formation of carbon oxides

Limitations:
- Catalyst deactivation remains a key issue, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant
- There are still unresolved problems that need to be addressed before further development of this reaction
- The reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not yet fully understood
- The deactivation mechanism of catalysts in ODHP with N2O is not fully understood, making it difficult to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst lifetime

In the context of oxidant selection, while N2O shows promise in addressing the over-oxidation issues associated with dioxygen, it introduces new challenges in terms of understanding the reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括使用二氧化氮作为氧化剂时烯烃选择性和产率低。这导致即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会大量形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提议使用一氧化二氮（N2O）代替二氧化氮作为氧化剂来解决这些问题。这种方法引起了相当大的关注，因为它可能提供更高的选择性和产率。

然而，使用N2O的ODHP也有自己的优势和局限性：

优势：
- 与使用二氧化氮相比，可能具有更高的烯烃选择性和产率
- 减少碳氧化物的形成

局限性：
- 无论使用二氧化氮还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是一个关键问题
- 在进一步发展这种反应之前，仍有一些未解决的问题需要解决
- ODHP与N2O的反应机理尚未完全理解
- ODHP与N2O中催化剂的失活机理尚未完全理解，这使得难以防止焦炭沉积和增加催化剂寿命

在氧化剂选择的背景下，虽然N2O在解决与二氧化氮相关的过度氧化问题方面显示出前景，但它在理解反应机理和催化剂行为方面引入了新的挑战。
