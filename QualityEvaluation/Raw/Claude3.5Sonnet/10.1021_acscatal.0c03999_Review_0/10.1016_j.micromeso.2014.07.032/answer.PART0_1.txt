[1] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield"

[2] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention"

[3] "Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Over-oxidation: When using dioxygen as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed even at moderate alkane conversions. This results in low olefin selectivity and yield.

2. Catalyst deactivation: This is a key issue in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Using nitrous oxide as an alternative oxidant: This approach has gained considerable attention as it may help reduce over-oxidation issues associated with dioxygen.

However, ODHP still presents its own set of challenges:

1. Reaction mechanism understanding: The precise reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not fully understood, which hinders catalyst design and process optimization.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Even with N2O as an oxidant, catalyst deactivation remains a significant challenge that needs to be addressed to improve the process efficiency and catalyst lifetime.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 过度氧化：在使用二氧化氮作为氧化剂进行轻烷烃氧化脱氢时，即使在中等烷烃转化率下也会大量形成碳氧化物（CO和CO2）。这导致了低烯烃选择性和产率。

2. 催化剂失活：这是氧化脱氢反应中的一个关键问题，无论使用二氧化氮还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 使用一氧化二氮作为替代氧化剂：这种方法已引起相当大的关注，因为它可能有助于减少与二氧化氮相关的过度氧化问题。

然而，ODHP仍然存在自身的一系列挑战：

1. 反应机理理解：ODHP与N2O的精确反应机理尚未完全理解，这阻碍了催化剂设计和过程优化。

2. 催化剂失活：即使使用N2O作为氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是一个需要解决的重大挑战，以提高过程效率和催化剂寿命。
