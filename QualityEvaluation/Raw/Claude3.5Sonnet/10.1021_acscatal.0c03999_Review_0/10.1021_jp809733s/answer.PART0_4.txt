[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[2] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."

[3] "With air as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA increases with Cr content and reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8. The selectivity toward propene lies in the range of 42–53% for Cr content of 1–3.4 wt %"

[4] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."

[5] "In contrast, the selectivity toward propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

The document does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods. However, it does discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method for producing alkenes from light alkanes.

ODHP addresses some issues by offering a potential route to convert propane directly to propylene. The advantages and limitations of ODHP, particularly regarding oxidant selection, are discussed:

1. Air as oxidant: Results in higher propane conversion, which increases with chromium content and temperature. However, selectivity towards propene is lower (42-53% range).

2. N2O as oxidant: Leads to much lower propane conversion compared to air. However, it offers higher selectivity towards propene.

The choice of oxidant affects both conversion and selectivity, presenting a trade-off. Air provides higher conversion but lower selectivity, while N2O offers lower conversion but higher selectivity. The difference in performance is attributed to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen formed with each oxidant.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that oxygen (from air) may lead to over-oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity towards the desired propene product.

该文档并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。但它确实讨论了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为从轻烷烃生产烯烃的替代方法。

ODHP通过提供直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的潜在途径来解决一些问题。文中讨论了ODHP的优势和局限性，特别是关于氧化剂选择：

1. 使用空气作为氧化剂：导致更高的丙烷转化率，且随着铬含量和温度的增加而增加。然而，对丙烯的选择性较低（42-53%范围）。

2. 使用N2O作为氧化剂：与空气相比，导致丙烷转化率大大降低。但是，它提供了更高的丙烯选择性。

氧化剂的选择影响转化率和选择性，呈现出一种权衡。空气提供更高的转化率但选择性较低，而N2O提供较低的转化率但选择性更高。性能差异归因于反应条件下铬的还原程度以及每种氧化剂形成的表面氧的性质。

文中并未明确指出使用氧气相关的具体挑战。但可以推断，氧气（来自空气）可能导致过度氧化，从而降低对所需丙烯产物的选择性。
