[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[2] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."

[3] "The propane conversion increases with Cr content in the presence of air or N2O, while the selectivity toward propene depends on the reaction temperature and oxidant."

[4] "With air as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA increases with Cr content and reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8. The selectivity toward propene lies in the range of 42–53% for Cr content of 1–3.4 wt %"

[5] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods. However, it does discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method for producing propylene.

ODHP offers advantages in terms of selectivity and activity, as researchers have been working to develop catalysts that are both active and selective for this process. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in ODHP performance.

Two oxidants discussed are air (which contains oxygen) and N2O. Using air as an oxidant results in higher propane conversion but lower selectivity towards propene compared to N2O. With air, propane conversion increases with chromium content and reaction temperature, while propene selectivity ranges from 42-53% for catalysts with 1-3.4 wt% Cr.

N2O as an oxidant leads to lower propane conversion but higher propene selectivity (60-80% in the 623-673 K range). This suggests that N2O might be advantageous for achieving higher propene yields, despite lower overall conversion rates.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen (in air) include potentially lower selectivity towards the desired propene product and possible over-oxidation. N2O, while offering better selectivity, results in lower overall conversion rates.

These findings highlight the trade-offs between conversion and selectivity in ODHP, depending on the choice of oxidant and catalyst composition. Optimizing these parameters remains a key challenge in developing efficient ODHP processes.

文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。然而，它确实讨论了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为生产丙烯的替代方法。

ODHP在选择性和活性方面提供了优势，因为研究人员一直在努力开发既活跃又选择性的催化剂。氧化剂的选择在ODHP性能中起着关键作用。

讨论的两种氧化剂是空气（含氧）和N2O。使用空气作为氧化剂会导致更高的丙烷转化率，但与N2O相比，对丙烯的选择性较低。使用空气时，丙烷转化率随铬含量和反应温度的增加而增加，而对于含1-3.4 wt% Cr的催化剂，丙烯选择性范围为42-53%。

N2O作为氧化剂导致较低的丙烷转化率，但较高的丙烯选择性（在623-673 K范围内为60-80%）。这表明N2O可能有利于获得更高的丙烯产率，尽管整体转化率较低。

使用氧气（空气中）的特定挑战包括可能对所需的丙烯产物的选择性较低，以及可能的过度氧化。N2O虽然提供了更好的选择性，但导致整体转化率较低。

这些发现强调了ODHP中转化率和选择性之间的权衡，这取决于氧化剂的选择和催化剂组成。优化这些参数仍然是开发高效ODHP过程的一个关键挑战。
