[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[2] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."

[3] "With air as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA increases with Cr content and reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8. The selectivity toward propene lies in the range of 4253% for Cr content of 13.4 wt % (Figure 9)."

[4] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."

[5] "The propane conversion is lower in the presence of N2O and reaches only 3% at 673 K for Cr3.4SiBEA. In contrast, the selectivity to propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air."

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is developing active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to alkenes. ODHP addresses this issue by offering a potential alternative route to produce propylene.

The choice of oxidant is a critical factor in ODHP. The literature compares the use of air (containing oxygen) and N2O as oxidants. With air, CrxSiBEA catalysts show higher propane conversion but lower selectivity towards propene (42-53%). N2O as an oxidant results in lower propane conversion but higher selectivity to propene.

The main advantages of ODHP include the potential for higher selectivity towards propene, especially when using N2O as an oxidant. However, limitations include lower conversion rates, particularly with N2O, and the need to balance conversion and selectivity.

Challenges associated with using oxygen (in air) include lower selectivity to propene compared to N2O, although it provides higher conversion rates. The specific challenges of using oxygen likely relate to over-oxidation of products, leading to the formation of undesired CO and CO2.

The development of effective catalysts, such as the CrxSiBEA system described, is crucial to addressing these challenges and optimizing the ODHP process for industrial application.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是开发用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)制烯烃的活性和选择性催化剂。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种潜在的替代路线来生产丙烯来解决这个问题。

氧化剂的选择是ODHP中的一个关键因素。文献比较了使用空气(含氧)和N2O作为氧化剂。使用空气时，CrxSiBEA催化剂显示出较高的丙烷转化率，但对丙烯的选择性较低(42-53%)。使用N2O作为氧化剂时，丙烷转化率较低，但对丙烯的选择性较高。

ODHP的主要优势包括对丙烯具有潜在的更高选择性，特别是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时。然而，限制包括较低的转化率，特别是使用N2O时，以及需要平衡转化率和选择性。

使用氧气(空气中)相关的挑战包括与N2O相比对丙烯的选择性较低，尽管它提供了更高的转化率。使用氧气的具体挑战可能与产物过度氧化有关，导致形成不期望的CO和CO2。

开发有效的催化剂，如所描述的CrxSiBEA系统，对于解决这些挑战和优化ODHP过程以进行工业应用至关重要。
