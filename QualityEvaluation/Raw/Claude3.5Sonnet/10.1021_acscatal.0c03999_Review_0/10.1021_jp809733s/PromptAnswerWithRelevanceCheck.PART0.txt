[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[2] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."

[3] "The propane conversion increases with Cr content in the presence of air or N2O, while the selectivity toward propene depends on the reaction temperature and oxidant."

[4] "With air as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA increases with Cr content and reaction temperature as shown in Figure 8. The selectivity toward propene lies in the range of 42–53% for Cr content of 1–3.4 wt %"

[5] "With N2O as oxidant, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods. However, it does discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method for producing propylene.

ODHP offers advantages in terms of selectivity and activity, as researchers have been working to develop catalysts that are both active and selective for this process. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in ODHP performance.

Two oxidants discussed are air (which contains oxygen) and N2O. Using air as an oxidant results in higher propane conversion but lower selectivity towards propene compared to N2O. With air, propane conversion increases with chromium content and reaction temperature, while propene selectivity ranges from 42-53% for catalysts with 1-3.4 wt% Cr.

N2O as an oxidant leads to lower propane conversion but higher propene selectivity (60-80% in the 623-673 K range). This suggests that N2O might be advantageous for achieving higher propene yields, despite lower overall conversion rates.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen (in air) include potentially lower selectivity towards the desired propene product and possible over-oxidation. N2O, while offering better selectivity, results in lower overall conversion rates.

These findings highlight the trade-offs between conversion and selectivity in ODHP, depending on the choice of oxidant and catalyst composition. Optimizing these parameters remains a key challenge in developing efficient ODHP processes.

文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。然而，它确实讨论了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)作为生产丙烯的替代方法。

ODHP在选择性和活性方面提供了优势，因为研究人员一直在努力开发既活跃又选择性的催化剂。氧化剂的选择在ODHP性能中起着关键作用。

讨论的两种氧化剂是空气（含氧）和N2O。使用空气作为氧化剂会导致更高的丙烷转化率，但与N2O相比，对丙烯的选择性较低。使用空气时，丙烷转化率随铬含量和反应温度的增加而增加，而对于含1-3.4 wt% Cr的催化剂，丙烯选择性范围为42-53%。

N2O作为氧化剂导致较低的丙烷转化率，但较高的丙烯选择性（在623-673 K范围内为60-80%）。这表明N2O可能有利于获得更高的丙烯产率，尽管整体转化率较低。

使用氧气（空气中）的特定挑战包括可能对所需的丙烯产物的选择性较低，以及可能的过度氧化。N2O虽然提供了更好的选择性，但导致整体转化率较低。

这些发现强调了ODHP中转化率和选择性之间的权衡，这取决于氧化剂的选择和催化剂组成。优化这些参数仍然是开发高效ODHP过程的一个关键挑战。

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is developing active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to alkenes. ODHP addresses this issue by offering a potential alternative route to produce propylene.

The choice of oxidant is a critical factor in ODHP. The literature compares the use of air (containing oxygen) and N2O as oxidants. With air, CrxSiBEA catalysts show higher propane conversion but lower selectivity towards propene (42-53%). N2O as an oxidant results in lower propane conversion but higher selectivity to propene.

The main advantages of ODHP include the potential for higher selectivity towards propene, especially when using N2O as an oxidant. However, limitations include lower conversion rates, particularly with N2O, and the need to balance conversion and selectivity.

Challenges associated with using oxygen (in air) include lower selectivity to propene compared to N2O, although it provides higher conversion rates. The specific challenges of using oxygen likely relate to over-oxidation of products, leading to the formation of undesired CO and CO2.

The development of effective catalysts, such as the CrxSiBEA system described, is crucial to addressing these challenges and optimizing the ODHP process for industrial application.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是开发用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢(ODH)制烯烃的活性和选择性催化剂。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种潜在的替代路线来生产丙烯来解决这个问题。

氧化剂的选择是ODHP中的一个关键因素。文献比较了使用空气(含氧)和N2O作为氧化剂。使用空气时，CrxSiBEA催化剂显示出较高的丙烷转化率，但对丙烯的选择性较低(42-53%)。使用N2O作为氧化剂时，丙烷转化率较低，但对丙烯的选择性较高。

ODHP的主要优势包括对丙烯具有潜在的更高选择性，特别是在使用N2O作为氧化剂时。然而，限制包括较低的转化率，特别是使用N2O时，以及需要平衡转化率和选择性。

使用氧气(空气中)相关的挑战包括与N2O相比对丙烯的选择性较低，尽管它提供了更高的转化率。使用氧气的具体挑战可能与产物过度氧化有关，导致形成不期望的CO和CO2。

开发有效的催化剂，如所描述的CrxSiBEA系统，对于解决这些挑战和优化ODHP过程以进行工业应用至关重要。

The provided literature does not directly address the challenges of current propylene production methods or compare oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other processes. The text focuses specifically on characterizing chromium-containing CrSiBEA zeolite catalysts and their performance in ODHP reactions using air or N2O as oxidants. It does not discuss broader industrial context or compare ODHP to other propylene production methods.

However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages and challenges of ODHP:

1. ODHP can produce propylene directly from propane, which may be more efficient than traditional steam cracking.

2. The choice of oxidant affects both conversion and selectivity. Air gives higher propane conversion but lower propylene selectivity compared to N2O.

3. Catalyst composition and structure strongly influence performance. Isolated tetrahedral chromium sites appear important for high propylene selectivity.

4. Coke formation and over-oxidation to COx are challenges that reduce propylene yield.

5. Achieving high propane conversion while maintaining high propylene selectivity remains difficult, as evidenced by the relatively low conversions reported (maximum ~3% with N2O).

Overall, while ODHP shows promise, optimizing catalysts and reaction conditions to achieve industrially viable propylene yields appears to be an ongoing challenge based on the results presented in this study.

提供的文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的挑战，也未将丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他工艺进行比较。文本主要集中在表征含铬的CrSiBEA沸石催化剂及其在使用空气或N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP反应中的性能。它没有讨论更广泛的工业背景或将ODHP与其他丙烯生产方法进行比较。

然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出ODHP的一些优势和挑战：

1. ODHP可以直接从丙烷生产丙烯，这可能比传统的蒸汽裂解更有效率。

2. 氧化剂的选择影响转化率和选择性。与N2O相比，空气提供更高的丙烷转化率，但丙烯选择性较低。

3. 催化剂的组成和结构强烈影响性能。四面体孤立铬位点似乎对高丙烯选择性很重要。

4. 积碳形成和过度氧化成COx是降低丙烯产率的挑战。

5. 在保持高丙烯选择性的同时实现高丙烷转化率仍然困难，这从报告的相对较低的转化率（使用N2O时最高约3%）可以看出。

总的来说，虽然ODHP显示出潜力，但根据这项研究中呈现的结果，优化催化剂和反应条件以达到工业可行的丙烯产率似乎仍是一个持续的挑战。

The document does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods. However, it does discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as an alternative method for producing alkenes from light alkanes.

ODHP addresses some issues by offering a potential route to convert propane directly to propylene. The advantages and limitations of ODHP, particularly regarding oxidant selection, are discussed:

1. Air as oxidant: Results in higher propane conversion, which increases with chromium content and temperature. However, selectivity towards propene is lower (42-53% range).

2. N2O as oxidant: Leads to much lower propane conversion compared to air. However, it offers higher selectivity towards propene.

The choice of oxidant affects both conversion and selectivity, presenting a trade-off. Air provides higher conversion but lower selectivity, while N2O offers lower conversion but higher selectivity. The difference in performance is attributed to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen formed with each oxidant.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that oxygen (from air) may lead to over-oxidation, resulting in lower selectivity towards the desired propene product.

该文档并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。但它确实讨论了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为从轻烷烃生产烯烃的替代方法。

ODHP通过提供直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的潜在途径来解决一些问题。文中讨论了ODHP的优势和局限性，特别是关于氧化剂选择：

1. 使用空气作为氧化剂：导致更高的丙烷转化率，且随着铬含量和温度的增加而增加。然而，对丙烯的选择性较低（42-53%范围）。

2. 使用N2O作为氧化剂：与空气相比，导致丙烷转化率大大降低。但是，它提供了更高的丙烯选择性。

氧化剂的选择影响转化率和选择性，呈现出一种权衡。空气提供更高的转化率但选择性较低，而N2O提供较低的转化率但选择性更高。性能差异归因于反应条件下铬的还原程度以及每种氧化剂形成的表面氧的性质。

文中并未明确指出使用氧气相关的具体挑战。但可以推断，氧气（来自空气）可能导致过度氧化，从而降低对所需丙烯产物的选择性。
