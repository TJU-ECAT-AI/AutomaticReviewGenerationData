[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."

[2] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitation of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by applying an oxidative process, which removes these limitations.

ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates. However, it also has limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The selection of oxidants is crucial in this process, with various options including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide being proposed.

The use of sulphur dioxide as an oxidant illustrates some of the specific challenges associated with ODHP. While it increases the overall conversion rate, it significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation. This demonstrates the complex effect oxidants can have on the reaction mechanism.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant are not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the complexity observed with sulphur dioxide suggests that each oxidant likely presents its own set of advantages and challenges in terms of conversion rates, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms.

传统丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢反应的热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过应用氧化过程解决了这个问题，消除了这些限制。

ODHP具有提高总体转化率等优势。然而，它也有局限性，特别是在选择性方面。氧化剂的选择在这个过程中至关重要，已提出的各种选择包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。

以二氧化硫作为氧化剂的使用说明了ODHP的一些具体挑战。虽然它提高了总体转化率，但显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。这表明氧化剂对反应机理可能产生复杂的影响。

给定的文献并未直接讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战。然而，二氧化硫所表现出的复杂性表明，每种氧化剂在转化率、选择性和反应机理方面可能都有其自身的优势和挑战。
