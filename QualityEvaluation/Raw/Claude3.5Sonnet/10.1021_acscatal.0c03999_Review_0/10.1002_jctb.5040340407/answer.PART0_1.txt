[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."

[2] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[4] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex."

The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitation of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by introducing an oxidative process, which removes these thermodynamic constraints.

ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates. However, it also comes with limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The literature mentions that while the addition of sulphur dioxide (as an oxidant) increased the overall conversion rate, it significantly decreased the selectivity to propylene formation.

Various oxidants have been proposed for ODHP, including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide. Each oxidant likely presents its own set of advantages and challenges. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not detailed in this literature.

The literature suggests that the mechanism of ODHP, at least when using sulphur dioxide as an oxidant, is complex. This complexity likely presents additional challenges in optimizing the process for industrial use.

While the literature doesn't specifically address the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, it's important to note that oxygen's high reactivity could potentially lead to over-oxidation, reducing selectivity to propylene and possibly forming unwanted by-products.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢的热力学限制。丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化过程来解决这个问题，从而消除了这些热力学限制。

ODHP具有提高总体转化率等优势。然而，它也带来了一些限制，特别是在选择性方面。文献提到，虽然添加二氧化硫（作为氧化剂）增加了总体转化率，但它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。

已经提出了多种用于ODHP的氧化剂，包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。每种氧化剂可能都有自己的优势和挑战。文献中没有详细说明使用氧气的具体挑战。

文献表明，ODHP的机制，至少在使用二氧化硫作为氧化剂时，是复杂的。这种复杂性可能会在优化工业应用过程中带来额外的挑战。

虽然文献没有特别提到使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，但值得注意的是，氧气的高反应性可能导致过度氧化，降低对丙烯的选择性，并可能形成不想要的副产品。
