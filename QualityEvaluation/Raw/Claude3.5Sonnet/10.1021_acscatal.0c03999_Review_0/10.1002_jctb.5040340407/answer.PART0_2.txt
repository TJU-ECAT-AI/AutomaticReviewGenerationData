The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitations of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by applying an oxidative process, which removes these limitations and allows for higher conversion rates.

ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates, as demonstrated by the addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed. However, it also has limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The study shows that while the conversion rate increased with the addition of sulphur dioxide, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably.

The selection of oxidants is a crucial aspect of ODHP. Various oxidants have been proposed, including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide. Each oxidant likely presents its own set of advantages and challenges. The study specifically investigates sulphur dioxide as an oxidant, revealing its complex effect on the dehydrogenation mechanism.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, it's important to note that oxygen's high reactivity could potentially lead to over-oxidation, forming undesired products like CO2 and water, which could affect selectivity and yield.

In summary, while ODHP addresses the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation, it introduces new challenges related to selectivity and oxidant selection, requiring careful optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst design.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢反应的热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过应用氧化过程解决了这个问题，消除了这些限制，允许更高的转化率。

ODHP的优势包括提高了整体转化率，正如将二氧化硫添加到丙烯原料中所证明的那样。然而，它也有局限性，特别是在选择性方面。研究表明，虽然添加二氧化硫后转化率增加，但丙烯形成的选择性显著降低。

氧化剂的选择是ODHP的一个关键方面。已经提出了各种氧化剂，包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。每种氧化剂可能都有其自身的优势和挑战。该研究专门调查了二氧化硫作为氧化剂的作用，揭示了它对脱氢机理的复杂影响。

虽然文档没有明确讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，但值得注意的是，氧气的高反应性可能导致过度氧化，形成不需要的产物如CO2和水，这可能影响选择性和产率。

总之，虽然ODHP解决了传统脱氢的热力学限制，但它也带来了与选择性和氧化剂选择相关的新挑战，需要仔细优化反应条件和催化剂设计。
