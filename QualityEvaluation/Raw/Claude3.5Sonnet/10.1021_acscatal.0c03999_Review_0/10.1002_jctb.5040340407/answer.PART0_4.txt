[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."

[2] "Oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide and carbonyl sulphide have been proposed for effecting the conversion of propane to propylene, and a significant amount of research on this type of reaction is reported in the literature."

[3] "The addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion as shown in Figure 3, however, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably."

[4] "In conclusion it appears from the data obtained that the effect of sulphur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex."

The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitations of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by introducing an oxidative process, which removes these limitations.

ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates. However, it also has limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The selection of oxidants is crucial in this process, with various options being explored including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide.

The specific challenges associated with using oxidants like sulphur dioxide include:

1. Decreased selectivity to propylene formation, despite increased overall conversion rates.
2. Complex effects on the reaction mechanism, which are not fully understood.
3. Formation of unwanted by-products, such as carbon dioxide, especially in the early stages of the reaction.

These challenges highlight the need for further research to optimize the ODHP process, particularly in terms of oxidant selection and understanding the complex reaction mechanisms involved.

传统丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢反应的热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化过程来解决这个问题，从而消除了这些限制。

ODHP的优势包括提高了总体转化率。然而，它也有局限性，特别是在选择性方面。氧化剂的选择在这个过程中至关重要，正在探索的各种选择包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。

使用如二氧化硫等氧化剂的具体挑战包括：

1. 尽管总体转化率增加，但丙烯形成的选择性降低。
2. 对反应机理的影响复杂，尚未完全理解。
3. 形成不需要的副产品，如二氧化碳，特别是在反应的早期阶段。

这些挑战突出表明需要进行进一步研究以优化ODHP过程，特别是在氧化剂选择和理解复杂反应机理方面。
