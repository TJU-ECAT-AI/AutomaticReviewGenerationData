The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitation of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by applying an oxidative process, which removes these limitations.

ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates. However, it also has limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The selection of oxidants is crucial in this process, with various options including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide being proposed.

The use of sulphur dioxide as an oxidant illustrates some of the specific challenges associated with ODHP. While it increases the overall conversion rate, it significantly decreases the selectivity to propylene formation. This demonstrates the complex effect oxidants can have on the reaction mechanism.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant are not directly addressed in the given literature. However, the complexity observed with sulphur dioxide suggests that each oxidant likely presents its own set of advantages and challenges in terms of conversion rates, selectivity, and reaction mechanisms.

传统丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢反应的热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过应用氧化过程解决了这个问题，消除了这些限制。

ODHP具有提高总体转化率等优势。然而，它也有局限性，特别是在选择性方面。氧化剂的选择在这个过程中至关重要，已提出的各种选择包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。

以二氧化硫作为氧化剂的使用说明了ODHP的一些具体挑战。虽然它提高了总体转化率，但显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。这表明氧化剂对反应机理可能产生复杂的影响。

给定的文献并未直接讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战。然而，二氧化硫所表现出的复杂性表明，每种氧化剂在转化率、选择性和反应机理方面可能都有其自身的优势和挑战。

The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitation of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by introducing an oxidative process, which removes these thermodynamic constraints.

ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates. However, it also comes with limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The literature mentions that while the addition of sulphur dioxide (as an oxidant) increased the overall conversion rate, it significantly decreased the selectivity to propylene formation.

Various oxidants have been proposed for ODHP, including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide. Each oxidant likely presents its own set of advantages and challenges. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not detailed in this literature.

The literature suggests that the mechanism of ODHP, at least when using sulphur dioxide as an oxidant, is complex. This complexity likely presents additional challenges in optimizing the process for industrial use.

While the literature doesn't specifically address the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, it's important to note that oxygen's high reactivity could potentially lead to over-oxidation, reducing selectivity to propylene and possibly forming unwanted by-products.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢的热力学限制。丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化过程来解决这个问题，从而消除了这些热力学限制。

ODHP具有提高总体转化率等优势。然而，它也带来了一些限制，特别是在选择性方面。文献提到，虽然添加二氧化硫（作为氧化剂）增加了总体转化率，但它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。

已经提出了多种用于ODHP的氧化剂，包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。每种氧化剂可能都有自己的优势和挑战。文献中没有详细说明使用氧气的具体挑战。

文献表明，ODHP的机制，至少在使用二氧化硫作为氧化剂时，是复杂的。这种复杂性可能会在优化工业应用过程中带来额外的挑战。

虽然文献没有特别提到使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，但值得注意的是，氧气的高反应性可能导致过度氧化，降低对丙烯的选择性，并可能形成不想要的副产品。

The primary challenge in conventional propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitations of dehydrogenation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by applying an oxidative process, which removes these limitations and allows for higher conversion rates.

ODHP presents advantages such as increased overall conversion rates, as demonstrated by the addition of sulphur dioxide to the propylene feed. However, it also has limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The study shows that while the conversion rate increased with the addition of sulphur dioxide, the selectivity to propylene formation decreased considerably.

The selection of oxidants is a crucial aspect of ODHP. Various oxidants have been proposed, including oxygen, halogens, sulphur, sulphur dioxide, and carbonyl sulphide. Each oxidant likely presents its own set of advantages and challenges. The study specifically investigates sulphur dioxide as an oxidant, revealing its complex effect on the dehydrogenation mechanism.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, it's important to note that oxygen's high reactivity could potentially lead to over-oxidation, forming undesired products like CO2 and water, which could affect selectivity and yield.

In summary, while ODHP addresses the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation, it introduces new challenges related to selectivity and oxidant selection, requiring careful optimization of reaction conditions and catalyst design.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢反应的热力学限制。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过应用氧化过程解决了这个问题，消除了这些限制，允许更高的转化率。

ODHP的优势包括提高了整体转化率，正如将二氧化硫添加到丙烯原料中所证明的那样。然而，它也有局限性，特别是在选择性方面。研究表明，虽然添加二氧化硫后转化率增加，但丙烯形成的选择性显著降低。

氧化剂的选择是ODHP的一个关键方面。已经提出了各种氧化剂，包括氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和硫化羰基。每种氧化剂可能都有其自身的优势和挑战。该研究专门调查了二氧化硫作为氧化剂的作用，揭示了它对脱氢机理的复杂影响。

虽然文档没有明确讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，但值得注意的是，氧气的高反应性可能导致过度氧化，形成不需要的产物如CO2和水，这可能影响选择性和产率。

总之，虽然ODHP解决了传统脱氢的热力学限制，但它也带来了与选择性和氧化剂选择相关的新挑战，需要仔细优化反应条件和催化剂设计。

2. Complex reaction mechanisms that are not fully understood.
3. Potential for unselective initial reactions or subsequent oxidation of the propylene product to CO2 and H2O.

These challenges highlight the need for further research to optimize the ODHP process, particularly in terms of improving selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates.
