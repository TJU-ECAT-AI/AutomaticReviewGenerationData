[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[2] "In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse water gas shift (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), and hence, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the product side."

[3] "Moreover, CO2 may also reduce the coking effect of catalyst by coke gasification (C + CO2 → 2CO)."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison between oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and other methods. However, it does discuss the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant, which can be considered a form of ODHP.

The main advantages of using CO2 for propane dehydrogenation include:

1. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium towards propylene production.
2. The process combines propane dehydrogenation with the reverse water gas shift reaction.
3. CO2 may help reduce catalyst coking through gasification of carbon deposits.

However, the literature does not explicitly discuss the limitations of this method or compare it to using oxygen as an oxidant. The focus is primarily on the thermodynamics and potential benefits of using CO2 in the reaction, rather than addressing broader challenges in propylene production or comparing different ODHP approaches.

该文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂的丙烷脱氢，这可以被视为ODHP的一种形式。

使用CO2进行丙烷脱氢的主要优势包括：

1. CO2作为温和的氧化剂，将平衡移向丙烯生产。
2. 该过程将丙烷脱氢与逆水气变换反应相结合。
3. CO2可能通过碳沉积物的气化作用帮助减少催化剂结焦。

然而，该文献并未明确讨论这种方法的局限性，也没有将其与使用氧气作为氧化剂进行比较。文献主要关注在反应中使用CO2的热力学和潜在益处，而非讨论丙烯生产的更广泛挑战或比较不同的ODHP方法。
