[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (         
           ) has been heavily studied over the last 
decade."

[2] "CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse 
water gas shift (              ), and hence, the 
equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the 
product side."

[3] "Moreover, CO2 may also reduce the coking effect of 
catalyst by coke gasification (          )."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the document discusses the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) in the presence of CO2 as an alternative method for propylene (C3H6) production. This approach addresses some issues in traditional methods:

1. Equilibrium limitation: CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium towards the product side through the reverse water gas shift reaction.

2. Catalyst coking: CO2 may reduce catalyst coking through coke gasification.

3. Lower temperature operation: The process is studied in the temperature range of 300-500°C, which is accessible by solar thermal energy.

The literature does not specifically discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using oxygen as an oxidant. Instead, it focuses on using CO2 as a mild oxidant. The advantages of using CO2 include its ability to shift the equilibrium and reduce coking while operating at lower temperatures. However, the literature does not provide information on the limitations of this approach or compare it to ODHP using oxygen.

该文献没有明确指出目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。然而，文档讨论了在CO2存在下脱氢丙烷（C3H8）作为丙烯（C3H6）生产的替代方法。这种方法解决了传统方法中的一些问题：

1. 平衡限制：CO2作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆水气变换反应将平衡向产物侧移动。

2. 催化剂结焦：CO2可能通过焦炭气化减少催化剂结焦。

3. 低温操作：该过程在300-500°C的温度范围内进行研究，这可以通过太阳能热能获得。

文献没有具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。相反，它侧重于使用CO2作为温和的氧化剂。使用CO2的优势包括其能够移动平衡并在较低温度下操作的同时减少结焦。然而，文献没有提供关于这种方法的局限性或将其与使用氧气的ODHP进行比较的信息。
