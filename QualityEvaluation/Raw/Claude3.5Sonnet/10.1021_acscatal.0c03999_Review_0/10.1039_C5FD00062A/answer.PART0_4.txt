[1] "In an attempt to ameliorate the burgeoning growth in greenhouse gas emissions, there are currently intense efforts, world-wide, aimed at the utilisation of CO2, particularly in its conversion to fuels and high-value chemical products"

[2] "As an improved reaction of the dehydrogenation of C3H8, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 (C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O) has been heavily studied over the last decade."

[3] "In this promising reaction, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to combine the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with a reverse water gas shift (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O), and hence, the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 can be shifted to the product side."

[4] "Moreover, CO2 may also reduce the coking effect of catalyst by coke gasification (C + CO2 → 2CO)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are:

1. High energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
2. Coking of catalysts
3. Limited equilibrium conversion

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as an oxidant addresses these issues in several ways:

1. It utilizes CO2, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
2. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, shifting the equilibrium towards products
3. CO2 can reduce catalyst coking through gasification of coke deposits

Advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant include:
1. Milder reaction conditions compared to using oxygen
2. Potential for CO2 utilization and reduction of emissions
3. Improved catalyst stability due to reduced coking

Limitations and challenges of using CO2 include:
1. Lower oxidizing power compared to oxygen, potentially resulting in lower conversion rates
2. Need for effective catalysts that can activate both propane and CO2
3. Potential for reverse water-gas shift reaction, which may affect product selectivity

The document does not specifically discuss challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, so that part of the question cannot be directly answered based on the given information.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是：

1. 高能耗和温室气体排放
2. 催化剂结焦
3. 有限的平衡转化率

使用CO2作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 利用CO2，有助于减少温室气体排放
2. CO2作为温和的氧化剂，将平衡向产物方向移动
3. CO2可以通过气化焦炭沉积物来减少催化剂结焦

使用CO2作为氧化剂的优势包括：
1. 与使用氧气相比，反应条件更温和
2. CO2利用和减排的潜力
3. 由于结焦减少，催化剂稳定性得到改善

使用CO2的局限性和挑战包括：
1. 与氧气相比氧化能力较弱，可能导致较低的转化率
2. 需要能够同时活化丙烷和CO2的有效催化剂
3. 可能发生逆水气变换反应，影响产物选择性

文献中没有具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，因此无法根据给定信息直接回答该部分问题。
