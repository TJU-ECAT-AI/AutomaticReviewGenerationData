[1] "Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and fastest growing in demand petrochemicals. Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."

[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere"

[3] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[4] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[5] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. The gap between supply and demand for propylene.
2. High temperature requirements for direct dehydrogenation (DH) of propane.
3. Overoxidation and low selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using oxygen.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative method to maximize propylene production.
2. Offering an exothermic process that can potentially reduce reaction temperatures compared to DH.

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly when using oxygen as an oxidant:

1. Difficulty in controlling the fate of desired propylene.
2. Unavoidable combustion of propane and propylene to CO/CO2, leading to low propylene selectivity.

To address the challenges associated with using oxygen, the use of CO2 as a weak oxidant in ODHP has been proposed. This approach can:

1. Suppress the overoxidation of paraffins and olefins.
2. Potentially improve selectivity towards propylene.

Overall, while ODHP offers some advantages over traditional methods, careful consideration of oxidant selection is crucial to overcome the limitations associated with propylene production.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 丙烯供需之间存在差距。
2. 丙烷直接脱氢(DH)需要高温。
3. 使用氧气进行氧化脱氢(ODH)时存在过度氧化和低选择性问题。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决了一些问题：

1. 提供了一种最大化丙烯生产的替代方法。
2. 提供了一个放热过程，可能比DH降低反应温度。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂时：

1. 难以控制所需丙烯的去向。
2. 不可避免地将丙烷和丙烯燃烧成CO/CO2，导致丙烯选择性低。

为了解决使用氧气相关的挑战，提出了使用CO2作为弱氧化剂进行ODHP。这种方法可以：

1. 抑制烷烃和烯烃的过度氧化。
2. 潜在地提高丙烯的选择性。

总的来说，虽然ODHP比传统方法有一些优势，但仔细考虑氧化剂的选择对于克服丙烯生产相关的限制至关重要。
