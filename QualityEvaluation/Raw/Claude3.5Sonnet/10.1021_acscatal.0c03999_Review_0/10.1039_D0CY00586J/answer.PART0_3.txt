[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."

[2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[3] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[4] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide8."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic nature
- Catalyst deactivation from coke formation
- High costs associated with platinum catalysts

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with oxygen:
- Overoxidation of propane and propylene to CO/CO2
- Low propylene selectivity due to combustion reactions

ODHP addresses some of these issues by:
- Using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of O2
- Potentially reducing reaction temperature compared to DH
- Suppressing overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity

However, ODHP with CO2 still presents challenges such as:
- Finding suitable catalysts with high activity and selectivity
- Achieving stable long-term performance without deactivation
- Optimizing reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield

The selection of oxidant (O2 vs CO2) is crucial, as CO2 offers advantages in selectivity but may have lower activity compared to O2. Overall, ODHP aims to strike a balance between reactivity and selectivity to improve propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 对于直接脱氢（DH）：
- 由于吸热反应性质，需要高温
- 因积碳形成导致的催化剂失活
- 与铂催化剂相关的高成本

2. 对于使用氧气的氧化脱氢（ODH）：
- 丙烷和丙烯过度氧化成CO/CO2
- 由于燃烧反应导致的低丙烯选择性

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了一些问题：
- 使用CO2作为软氧化剂代替O2
- 与DH相比，可能降低反应温度
- 抑制过度氧化并提高丙烯选择性

然而，使用CO2的ODHP仍然存在挑战，如：
- 寻找具有高活性和选择性的合适催化剂
- 实现稳定的长期性能而不失活
- 优化反应条件以最大化丙烯产率

氧化剂的选择（O2与CO2）至关重要，因为CO2在选择性方面具有优势，但活性可能低于O2。总的来说，ODHP旨在在反应性和选择性之间取得平衡，以改善丙烯生产。
