[1] "Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and fastest growing in demand petrochemicals. Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."

[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere"

[3] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[4] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[5] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide"

</quotes>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. The gap between supply and demand for propylene.
2. High temperature requirements for direct dehydrogenation (DH) of propane.
3. Overoxidation and low selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using oxygen.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative method to maximize propylene production.
2. Offering an exothermic process that can potentially reduce reaction temperatures compared to DH.

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations, particularly when using oxygen as an oxidant:

1. Difficulty in controlling the fate of desired propylene.
2. Unavoidable combustion of propane and propylene to CO/CO2, leading to low propylene selectivity.

To address the challenges associated with using oxygen, the use of CO2 as a weak oxidant in ODHP has been proposed. This approach can:

1. Suppress the overoxidation of paraffins and olefins.
2. Potentially improve selectivity towards propylene.

Overall, while ODHP offers some advantages over traditional methods, careful consideration of oxidant selection is crucial to overcome the limitations associated with propylene production.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 丙烯供需之间存在差距。
2. 丙烷直接脱氢(DH)需要高温。
3. 使用氧气进行氧化脱氢(ODH)时存在过度氧化和低选择性问题。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决了一些问题：

1. 提供了一种最大化丙烯生产的替代方法。
2. 提供了一个放热过程，可能比DH降低反应温度。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性，特别是在使用氧气作为氧化剂时：

1. 难以控制所需丙烯的去向。
2. 不可避免地将丙烷和丙烯燃烧成CO/CO2，导致丙烯选择性低。

为了解决使用氧气相关的挑战，提出了使用CO2作为弱氧化剂进行ODHP。这种方法可以：

1. 抑制烷烃和烯烃的过度氧化。
2. 潜在地提高丙烯的选择性。

总的来说，虽然ODHP比传统方法有一些优势，但仔细考虑氧化剂的选择对于克服丙烯生产相关的限制至关重要。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic nature
- Catalyst deactivation due to coking
- Cost of catalysts (e.g. Pt-based)

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2:
- Overoxidation of propane and propylene, leading to low selectivity
- Difficulty controlling propylene formation

ODHP addresses some issues by:
- Potentially lowering reaction temperature due to exothermic nature (when using O2)
- Reducing coking compared to DH

However, ODHP with O2 presents challenges in controlling selectivity due to overoxidation. Using CO2 as a weaker oxidant can help suppress the overoxidation issue while still providing benefits of ODH. This allows for better control of propylene formation while maintaining advantages like lower temperatures compared to DH.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 直接脱氢(DH)：
- 由于吸热反应性质，需要高温
- 催化剂因结焦而失活
- 催化剂成本高（如基于铂的催化剂）

2. 用O2进行氧化脱氢(ODH)：
- 丙烷和丙烯过度氧化，导致选择性低
- 难以控制丙烯的形成

ODHP解决了一些问题：
- 由于放热性质，可能降低反应温度（使用O2时）
- 与DH相比，减少结焦

然而，用O2进行ODHP在控制选择性方面存在挑战，因为存在过度氧化问题。使用CO2作为较弱的氧化剂可以帮助抑制过度氧化问题，同时仍然提供ODH的优势。这允许更好地控制丙烯的形成，同时保持与DH相比温度较低等优势。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic reaction
- Catalyst deactivation from coke formation
- High costs associated with Pt-based catalysts

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2:
- Overoxidation of propane and propylene, leading to low selectivity
- Difficulty controlling propylene yield due to combustion reactions

ODHP addresses some of these issues by using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of O2. This approach offers several advantages:

- Suppresses overoxidation of alkanes/alkenes
- Reduces coke formation
- Favors propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Allows for lower reaction temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation

However, ODHP with CO2 still faces challenges in terms of catalyst stability and achieving high propylene yields. The selection of appropriate catalysts that can maintain activity and selectivity over extended periods remains an important area of research.

- 与铂基催化剂相关的高成本

2. 使用O2的氧化脱氢（ODH）:
- 丙烷和丙烯过度氧化，导致选择性低
- 由于燃烧反应难以控制丙烯产率

ODHP通过使用CO2作为软氧化剂而不是O2来解决其中一些问题。这种方法提供了几个优势：

- 抑制烷烃/烯烃的过度氧化
- 减少积碳形成
- 通过逆水煤气反应促进丙烷转化
- 与直接脱氢相比，允许较低的反应温度

然而，使用CO2的ODHP仍面临催化剂稳定性和获得高丙烯产率的挑战。选择合适的催化剂，能够长期保持活性和选择性，仍然是一个重要的研究领域。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic nature
- Catalyst deactivation from coke formation
- High costs associated with platinum catalysts

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with oxygen:
- Overoxidation of propane and propylene to CO/CO2
- Low propylene selectivity due to combustion reactions

ODHP addresses some of these issues by:
- Using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of O2
- Potentially reducing reaction temperature compared to DH
- Suppressing overoxidation and improving propylene selectivity

However, ODHP with CO2 still presents challenges such as:
- Finding suitable catalysts with high activity and selectivity
- Achieving stable long-term performance without deactivation
- Optimizing reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield

The selection of oxidant (O2 vs CO2) is crucial, as CO2 offers advantages in selectivity but may have lower activity compared to O2. Overall, ODHP aims to strike a balance between reactivity and selectivity to improve propylene production.

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic nature
- Catalyst deactivation from coke formation
- High costs associated with Pt catalysts (for Oleflex process)
- Toxicity concerns with chromium-based catalysts (for CATOFIN process)

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2:
- Overoxidation leading to combustion of propane and propylene
- Low propylene selectivity due to formation of CO and CO2

ODHP addresses some of these issues by:
- Potentially lowering reaction temperatures due to exothermic nature (when using O2)
- Avoiding deep oxidation by using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of O2
- Reducing coke formation
- Favoring propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction

However, ODHP still faces challenges in developing suitable catalysts that exhibit both high activity and promising olefin selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with CO2 offering advantages over O2 in terms of selectivity control and coke reduction, but potentially requiring different catalyst designs to achieve high conversion rates.
