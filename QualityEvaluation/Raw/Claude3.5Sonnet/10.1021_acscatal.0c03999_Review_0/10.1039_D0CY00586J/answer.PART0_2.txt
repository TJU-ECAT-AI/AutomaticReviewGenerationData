[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."

[2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[3] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[4] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide8."

[5] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic reaction
- Catalyst deactivation from coke formation
- High costs associated with Pt-based catalysts

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2:
- Overoxidation of propane and propylene, leading to low selectivity
- Difficulty controlling propylene yield due to combustion reactions

ODHP addresses some of these issues by using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of O2. This approach offers several advantages:

- Suppresses overoxidation of alkanes/alkenes
- Reduces coke formation
- Favors propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Allows for lower reaction temperatures compared to direct dehydrogenation

However, ODHP with CO2 still faces challenges in terms of catalyst stability and achieving high propylene yields. The selection of appropriate catalysts that can maintain activity and selectivity over extended periods remains an important area of research.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 直接脱氢（DH）:
- 由于吸热反应需要高温
- 因积碳导致的催化剂失活
- 与铂基催化剂相关的高成本

2. 使用O2的氧化脱氢（ODH）:
- 丙烷和丙烯过度氧化，导致选择性低
- 由于燃烧反应难以控制丙烯产率

ODHP通过使用CO2作为软氧化剂而不是O2来解决其中一些问题。这种方法提供了几个优势：

- 抑制烷烃/烯烃的过度氧化
- 减少积碳形成
- 通过逆水煤气反应促进丙烷转化
- 与直接脱氢相比，允许较低的反应温度

然而，使用CO2的ODHP仍面临催化剂稳定性和获得高丙烯产率的挑战。选择合适的催化剂，能够长期保持活性和选择性，仍然是一个重要的研究领域。
