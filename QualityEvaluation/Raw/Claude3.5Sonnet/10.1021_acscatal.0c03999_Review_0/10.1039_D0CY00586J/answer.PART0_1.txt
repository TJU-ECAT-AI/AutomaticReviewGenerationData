[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere"

[2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[3] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[4] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic nature
- Catalyst deactivation due to coking
- Cost of catalysts (e.g. Pt-based)

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2:
- Overoxidation of propane and propylene, leading to low selectivity
- Difficulty controlling propylene formation

ODHP addresses some issues by:
- Potentially lowering reaction temperature due to exothermic nature (when using O2)
- Reducing coking compared to DH

However, ODHP with O2 presents challenges in controlling selectivity due to overoxidation. Using CO2 as a weaker oxidant can help suppress the overoxidation issue while still providing benefits of ODH. This allows for better control of propylene formation while maintaining advantages like lower temperatures compared to DH.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 直接脱氢(DH)：
- 由于吸热反应性质，需要高温
- 催化剂因结焦而失活
- 催化剂成本高（如基于铂的催化剂）

2. 用O2进行氧化脱氢(ODH)：
- 丙烷和丙烯过度氧化，导致选择性低
- 难以控制丙烯的形成

ODHP解决了一些问题：
- 由于放热性质，可能降低反应温度（使用O2时）
- 与DH相比，减少结焦

然而，用O2进行ODHP在控制选择性方面存在挑战，因为存在过度氧化问题。使用CO2作为较弱的氧化剂可以帮助抑制过度氧化问题，同时仍然提供ODH的优势。这允许更好地控制丙烯的形成，同时保持与DH相比温度较低等优势。
