          [1] "Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and fastest growing in demand petrochemicals. Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."

[2] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere"

[3] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[4] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[5] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide"

[6] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic nature
- Catalyst deactivation from coke formation
- High costs associated with Pt-based catalysts

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2:
- Overoxidation of propane and propylene, leading to low selectivity
- Difficulty controlling propylene formation due to unavoidable combustion

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses some of these issues by:
- Potentially lowering reaction temperature due to exothermic nature (when using O2)
- Reducing coking compared to DH
- Using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of O2 to suppress overoxidation

Advantages of using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP:
- Avoids deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes
- Reduces coke formation
- Favors propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction
- Allows for better control of propylene formation

However, ODHP still faces challenges such as:
- Finding suitable catalysts with high activity and selectivity
- Achieving stable long-term performance without deactivation
- Optimizing reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield

The selection of oxidant (O2 vs CO2) is crucial, as CO2 offers advantages in selectivity but may have lower activity compared to O2. Overall, ODHP aims to strike a balance between reactivity and selectivity to improve propylene production while addressing the limitations of current methods.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 对于直接脱氢（DH）：
- 由于吸热反应性质，需要高温
- 因积碳形成导致的催化剂失活
- 与铂基催化剂相关的高成本

2. 对于使用O2的氧化脱氢（ODH）：
- 丙烷和丙烯过度氧化，导致选择性低
- 由于不可避免的燃烧反应，难以控制丙烯的形成

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决了一些问题：
- 由于放热性质，可能降低反应温度（使用O2时）
- 与DH相比，减少积碳
- 使用CO2作为软氧化剂代替O2来抑制过度氧化

使用CO2作为ODHP氧化剂的优势：
- 避免烷烃/烯烃的深度氧化
- 减少积碳形成
- 通过逆水煤气反应促进丙烷转化
- 允许更好地控制丙烯的形成

然而，ODHP仍然面临以下挑战：
- 寻找具有高活性和选择性的合适催化剂
- 实现稳定的长期性能而不失活
- 优化反应条件以最大化丙烯产率

氧化剂的选择（O2与CO2）至关重要，因为CO2在选择性方面具有优势，但活性可能低于O2。总的来说，ODHP旨在在反应性和选择性之间取得平衡，以改善丙烯生产，同时解决当前方法的局限性。
