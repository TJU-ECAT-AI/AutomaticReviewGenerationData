[1] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."

[2] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."

[3] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."

[4] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide8."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. For direct dehydrogenation (DH):
- High temperatures required due to endothermic nature
- Catalyst deactivation from coke formation
- High costs associated with Pt catalysts (for Oleflex process)
- Toxicity concerns with chromium-based catalysts (for CATOFIN process)

2. For oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with O2:
- Overoxidation leading to combustion of propane and propylene
- Low propylene selectivity due to formation of CO and CO2

ODHP addresses some of these issues by:
- Potentially lowering reaction temperatures due to exothermic nature (when using O2)
- Avoiding deep oxidation by using CO2 as a soft oxidant instead of O2
- Reducing coke formation
- Favoring propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction

However, ODHP still faces challenges in developing suitable catalysts that exhibit both high activity and promising olefin selectivity. The selection of oxidant is crucial, with CO2 offering advantages over O2 in terms of selectivity control and coke reduction, but potentially requiring different catalyst designs to achieve high conversion rates.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 对于直接脱氢（DH）：
- 由于吸热性质，需要高温
- 因积碳形成导致的催化剂失活
- 与铂催化剂相关的高成本（Oleflex工艺）
- 铬基催化剂的毒性问题（CATOFIN工艺）

2. 对于使用O2的氧化脱氢（ODH）：
- 过度氧化导致丙烷和丙烯燃烧
- 由于CO和CO2的形成导致丙烯选择性低

ODHP通过以下方式解决了其中一些问题：
- 由于放热性质可能降低反应温度（使用O2时）
- 通过使用CO2作为软氧化剂而非O2来避免深度氧化
- 减少积碳形成
- 通过逆水气变换反应促进丙烷转化

然而，ODHP仍面临开发合适催化剂的挑战，这些催化剂需要同时展现高活性和有希望的烯烃选择性。氧化剂的选择至关重要，CO2相比O2在选择性控制和积碳减少方面提供了优势，但可能需要不同的催化剂设计来实现高转化率。
