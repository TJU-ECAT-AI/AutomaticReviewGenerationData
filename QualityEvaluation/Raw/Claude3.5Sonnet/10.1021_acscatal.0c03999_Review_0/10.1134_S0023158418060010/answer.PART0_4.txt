[1] "Catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1]. Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."

[2] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas [1]."

[3] "Studies of the effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reactions of C2C4 paraffins on chromium oxide catalysts are promising lines in the development of these processes because they have shown a positive effect of CO2 on both the activity and the yield of olefins [39]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly for dehydrogenation of propane using chromium-based catalysts, include high coke deposition and rapid deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, reducing overall process efficiency.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing an oxidant, such as CO2, which helps to reduce coke formation and maintain catalyst activity. Using CO2 as an oxidant offers several advantages:

1. It prevents deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is used.
2. It allows for efficient utilization of a greenhouse gas.
3. It has shown positive effects on both catalyst activity and olefin yield.

However, ODHP with CO2 also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Competitive adsorption between CO2 and hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces.
2. Potential oxidation of reduced catalyst species necessary for dehydrogenation.
3. Balancing the oxidative and dehydrogenation reactions to maximize propylene yield.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, it can be inferred that oxygen would lead to deeper oxidation reactions, potentially reducing selectivity towards propylene.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是使用铬基催化剂进行丙烷脱氢时，包括高度积碳和快速失活。这需要频繁的催化剂再生，降低了整体工艺效率。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化剂（如CO2）来解决这些问题，有助于减少积碳形成并维持催化剂活性。使用CO2作为氧化剂具有以下几个优点：

1. 它可以防止使用O2时发生的深度氧化反应。
2. 它允许高效利用温室气体。
3. 它对催化剂活性和烯烃产率都显示出积极影响。

然而，使用CO2进行ODHP也带来了一系列挑战：

1. CO2与催化剂表面的烃类之间的竞争吸附。
2. 可能氧化脱氢所需的还原态催化剂物种。
3. 平衡氧化和脱氢反应以最大化丙烯产率。

虽然文献没有明确讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战，但可以推断氧气会导致更深度的氧化反应，可能降低对丙烯的选择性。
