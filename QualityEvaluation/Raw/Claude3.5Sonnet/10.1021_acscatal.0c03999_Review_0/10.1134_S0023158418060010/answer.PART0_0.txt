[1] "Catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1]."

[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."

[3] "Another way to increase the efficiency of dehydrogenation of light paraffins is to carry out the process in the presence of oxidizing additives, which remove hydrogen from the reaction and remove coke."

[4] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas [1]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, include high coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, reducing process efficiency.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing oxidizing additives to the reaction. These additives help remove hydrogen and coke, potentially increasing catalyst lifetime and process efficiency. 

CO2 is a promising oxidant for ODHP as it avoids deep oxidation reactions that occur with O2, while also utilizing a greenhouse gas. However, the use of CO2 presents its own challenges, such as competitive adsorption with hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces, which can decrease propane conversion. The oxidant selection impacts reaction pathways and product yields, requiring careful optimization.

While ODHP with CO2 shows promise in addressing coke formation and improving catalyst stability, it introduces complexities in reaction kinetics and catalyst design that require further research to fully exploit its potential advantages.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是丙烷催化脱氢，包括高焦炭沉积和催化剂失活。这需要频繁的催化剂再生，降低了工艺效率。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过向反应中引入氧化添加剂来解决这些问题。这些添加剂有助于去除氢和焦炭，可能增加催化剂寿命和提高工艺效率。

CO2是ODHP的一种有前途的氧化剂，因为它避免了使用O2时发生的深度氧化反应，同时还利用了温室气体。然而，使用CO2也带来了自身的挑战，比如与催化剂表面的碳氢化合物竞争吸附，这可能会降低丙烷转化率。氧化剂的选择影响反应途径和产品收率，需要仔细优化。

虽然使用CO2的ODHP在解决焦炭形成和改善催化剂稳定性方面显示出前景，但它在反应动力学和催化剂设计方面引入了复杂性，需要进一步研究以充分利用其潜在优势。
