[1] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."

[2] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas [1]."

[3] "With respect to the dehydrogenation of paraffins, gallium catalysts have been studied relatively recently. These systems are less active, but they are characterized by high selectivity and stability [1, 1013], which can be very important for their industrial implementation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high coke deposition, reduced catalyst activity, and the need for frequent regeneration procedures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing an oxidizing agent, such as CO2, which helps to reduce coke formation and maintain catalyst activity. 

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages:
1. It prevents deep oxidation reactions that occur with O2.
2. It allows for efficient utilization of a greenhouse gas.
3. It helps remove hydrogen from the reaction and reduces coke formation.

However, ODHP with CO2 also presents limitations:
1. CO2 can compete with propane for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially decreasing propane conversion.
2. In some cases, such as with gallium catalysts, CO2 can negatively impact propylene yield.

The selection of oxidant is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen is a more reactive oxidant, it can lead to deep oxidation and loss of selectivity. CO2, on the other hand, offers a milder oxidation environment but may have lower overall activity.

Recent studies on gallium catalysts for dehydrogenation show promise in terms of high selectivity and stability, although they are less active than traditional chromium-based catalysts. This highlights the ongoing research efforts to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for propylene production.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高焦炭沉积、催化剂活性降低以及需要频繁的再生程序。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化剂（如CO2）来解决这些问题，有助于减少焦炭形成并维持催化剂活性。

使用CO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂具有以下几个优点：
1. 避免了使用O2时发生的深度氧化反应。
2. 允许有效利用温室气体。
3. 有助于从反应中去除氢气并减少焦炭形成。

然而，使用CO2进行ODHP也存在一些限制：
1. CO2可能与丙烷在催化剂表面的吸附位点上竞争，可能会降低丙烷转化率。
2. 在某些情况下，如使用镓催化剂时，CO2可能会对丙烯产率产生负面影响。

氧化剂的选择在ODHP中至关重要。虽然氧气是一种更具反应性的氧化剂，但它可能导致深度氧化和选择性损失。相比之下，CO2提供了一个较温和的氧化环境，但整体活性可能较低。

最近对镓催化剂在脱氢反应中的研究显示出高选择性和稳定性的前景，尽管它们的活性低于传统的铬基催化剂。这突显了正在进行的研究努力，以开发更高效和稳定的丙烯生产催化剂。
