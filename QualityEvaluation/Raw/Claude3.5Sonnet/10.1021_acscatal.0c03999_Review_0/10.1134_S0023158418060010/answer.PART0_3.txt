The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly for chromium-based catalysts, include high coke deposition during operation, which reduces catalyst activity and requires cyclic regeneration procedures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing an oxidizing agent, such as CO2, which helps to remove coke and hydrogen from the reaction, thereby increasing catalyst stability and propylene yield.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages. It avoids deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is used, leading to better selectivity towards propylene. Additionally, it allows for the efficient utilization of CO2, a greenhouse gas, making the process more environmentally friendly.

However, ODHP also has its own set of limitations. The choice of oxidant is crucial, as different oxidants can lead to varying levels of activity, selectivity, and stability. While CO2 offers benefits in terms of coke reduction and greenhouse gas utilization, it may also compete with propane for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially decreasing propane conversion.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant include the risk of deep oxidation reactions, which can lead to the formation of undesired products and reduce propylene selectivity. This is one of the reasons why CO2 is considered as an alternative oxidant in ODHP processes.

Gallium-based catalysts have also been studied for paraffin dehydrogenation, offering high selectivity and stability. However, they are generally less active than chromium-based catalysts, which presents a trade-off between activity and stability that must be considered in industrial applications.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是对于铬基催化剂，包括运行期间的高焦炭沉积，这降低了催化剂活性并需要周期性再生程序。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过引入氧化剂（如CO2）来解决这些问题，这有助于去除反应中的焦炭和氢气，从而提高催化剂稳定性和丙烯产率。

在ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂具有几个优点。它避免了使用O2时发生的深度氧化反应，从而提高了对丙烯的选择性。此外，它允许有效利用CO2这种温室气体，使该过程更加环保。

然而，ODHP也有自己的一系列限制。氧化剂的选择至关重要，因为不同的氧化剂可能导致不同水平的活性、选择性和稳定性。虽然CO2在减少焦炭和利用温室气体方面提供了好处，但它也可能与丙烷竞争催化剂表面的吸附位点，可能降低丙烷转化率。

使用氧气作为氧化剂的特定挑战包括深度氧化反应的风险，这可能导致不期望产物的形成并降低丙烯选择性。这是考虑CO2作为ODHP过程中替代氧化剂的原因之一。

镓基催化剂也被研究用于烷烃脱氢，提供高选择性和稳定性。然而，它们通常比铬基催化剂活性较低，这在工业应用中必须考虑活性和稳定性之间的权衡。
