The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, include high coke deposition and catalyst deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, reducing process efficiency.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing oxidizing additives to the reaction. These additives help remove hydrogen and coke, potentially increasing catalyst lifetime and process efficiency. 

CO2 is a promising oxidant for ODHP as it avoids deep oxidation reactions that occur with O2, while also utilizing a greenhouse gas. However, the use of CO2 presents its own challenges, such as competitive adsorption with hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces, which can decrease propane conversion. The oxidant selection impacts reaction pathways and product yields, requiring careful optimization.

While ODHP with CO2 shows promise in addressing coke formation and improving catalyst stability, it introduces complexities in reaction kinetics and catalyst design that require further research to fully exploit its potential advantages.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是丙烷催化脱氢，包括高焦炭沉积和催化剂失活。这需要频繁的催化剂再生，降低了工艺效率。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过向反应中引入氧化添加剂来解决这些问题。这些添加剂有助于去除氢和焦炭，可能增加催化剂寿命和提高工艺效率。

CO2是ODHP的一种有前途的氧化剂，因为它避免了使用O2时发生的深度氧化反应，同时还利用了温室气体。然而，使用CO2也带来了自身的挑战，比如与催化剂表面的碳氢化合物竞争吸附，这可能会降低丙烷转化率。氧化剂的选择影响反应途径和产品收率，需要仔细优化。

虽然使用CO2的ODHP在解决焦炭形成和改善催化剂稳定性方面显示出前景，但它在反应动力学和催化剂设计方面引入了复杂性，需要进一步研究以充分利用其潜在优势。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly for chromium-based catalysts, include high coke deposition during operation, which reduces catalyst activity and requires frequent regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing an oxidizing agent, such as CO2, which helps to remove coke and hydrogen from the reaction, thereby maintaining catalyst activity and stability.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages:
1. It avoids deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is used.
2. It allows for efficient utilization of CO2, a greenhouse gas.
3. It helps maintain catalyst activity by removing coke and hydrogen.

However, ODHP with CO2 also has limitations:
1. CO2 can compete with propane for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially reducing propane conversion.
2. In some cases, particularly with gallium-based catalysts, CO2 can negatively impact propylene yield.

The selection of oxidant is crucial in ODHP. While oxygen (O2) is a more reactive oxidant, it can lead to deep oxidation reactions, reducing selectivity. CO2, on the other hand, is less reactive but more selective, making it a promising alternative for ODHP processes.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include:
1. Higher risk of deep oxidation, leading to the formation of COx instead of propylene.
2. Potential safety concerns due to the explosive nature of hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures.
3. Difficulty in controlling selectivity towards propylene formation.

In summary, while ODHP with CO2 addresses some of the major challenges in propylene production, such as coking and catalyst deactivation, it introduces new complexities related to reaction kinetics and catalyst design that need to be optimized for industrial implementation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是对于铬基催化剂，包括运行期间的高焦炭沉积，这降低了催化剂活性并需要频繁再生。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过引入氧化剂（如CO2）来解决这些问题，有助于去除反应中的焦炭和氢气，从而维持催化剂的活性和稳定性。

在ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂具有以下优势：
1. 避免了使用O2时发生的深度氧化反应。
2. 允许高效利用CO2这种温室气体。
3. 通过去除焦炭和氢气来帮助维持催化剂活性。

然而，使用CO2的ODHP也有一些限制：
1. CO2可能与丙烷竞争催化剂表面的吸附位点，可能降低丙烷转化率。
2. 在某些情况下，特别是对于镓基催化剂，CO2可能对丙烯产率产生负面影响。

氧化剂的选择在ODHP中至关重要。虽然氧气（O2）是一种更具反应性的氧化剂，但它可能导致深度氧化反应，降低选择性。相比之下，CO2反应性较低但选择性更高，使其成为ODHP过程的一个有前景的替代品。

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括：
1. 深度氧化风险更高，导致形成COx而不是丙烯。
2. 由于碳氢化合物-氧气混合物的爆炸性，存在潜在的安全隐患。
3. 难以控制对丙烯形成的选择性。

总之，虽然使用CO2的ODHP解决了丙烯生产中的一些主要挑战，如结焦和催化剂失活，但它也引入了与反应动力学和催化剂设计相关的新复杂性，这些需要为工业实施进行优化。

Recent studies on gallium catalysts for dehydrogenation show promise in terms of high selectivity and stability, although they are less active than traditional chromium-based catalysts. This highlights the ongoing research efforts to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for propylene production.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing an oxidizing agent, such as CO2, which helps to remove coke and hydrogen from the reaction, thereby increasing catalyst stability and propylene yield.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages. It avoids deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is used, leading to better selectivity towards propylene. Additionally, it allows for the efficient utilization of CO2, a greenhouse gas, making the process more environmentally friendly.

However, ODHP also has its own set of limitations. The choice of oxidant is crucial, as different oxidants can lead to varying levels of activity, selectivity, and stability. While CO2 offers benefits in terms of coke reduction and greenhouse gas utilization, it may also compete with propane for adsorption sites on the catalyst surface, potentially decreasing propane conversion.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant include the risk of deep oxidation reactions, which can lead to the formation of undesired products and reduce propylene selectivity. This is one of the reasons why CO2 is considered as an alternative oxidant in ODHP processes.

Gallium-based catalysts have also been studied for paraffin dehydrogenation, offering high selectivity and stability. However, they are generally less active than chromium-based catalysts, which presents a trade-off between activity and stability that must be considered in industrial applications.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly for dehydrogenation of propane using chromium-based catalysts, include high coke deposition and rapid deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, reducing overall process efficiency.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by introducing an oxidant, such as CO2, which helps to reduce coke formation and maintain catalyst activity. Using CO2 as an oxidant offers several advantages:

1. It prevents deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is used.
2. It allows for efficient utilization of a greenhouse gas.
3. It has shown positive effects on both catalyst activity and olefin yield.

However, ODHP with CO2 also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Competitive adsorption between CO2 and hydrocarbons on catalyst surfaces.
2. Potential oxidation of reduced catalyst species necessary for dehydrogenation.
3. Balancing the oxidative and dehydrogenation reactions to maximize propylene yield.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, it can be inferred that oxygen would lead to deeper oxidation reactions, potentially reducing selectivity towards propylene.
