[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."

[3] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[4] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

[5] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

[6] "Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A serious supply deficit due to rapid growth in market demand for propylene derivatives.

2. The endothermic nature of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which requires high energy input.

3. Rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation in the DHP process.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Being exothermic, which eliminates the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures and reduces energy requirements.

2. Potentially increasing propylene production to meet the growing demand.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

Advantages:
1. Lower energy requirements due to exothermic nature.
2. Potential for higher propylene yields.

Limitations:
1. When using oxygen as an oxidant, overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides can occur, leading to inefficient reactant use and low process selectivity.
2. Safety concerns due to the flammability of oxygen, which may impair practical implementation.

These challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant have led researchers to explore alternative soft oxidants for ODHP reactions to improve selectivity and safety while maintaining the benefits of the oxidative process.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于丙烯衍生物市场需求的快速增长导致严重的供应短缺。

2. 丙烷直接脱氢（DHP）过程的吸热性质，需要高能量输入。

3. DHP过程中催化剂因结焦而快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 具有放热性，消除了低温下的热力学限制，降低了能量需求。

2. 有可能增加丙烯产量以满足不断增长的需求。

然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面也存在自身的优势和局限性：

优势：
1. 由于放热性质，能量需求较低。
2. 有潜力获得更高的丙烯产率。

局限性：
1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，烯烃可能过度氧化成碳氧化物，导致反应物利用效率低下和工艺选择性降低。
2. 由于氧气的可燃性，存在安全隐患，可能影响实际应用。

这些使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战促使研究人员探索替代性软氧化剂用于ODHP反应，以提高选择性和安全性，同时保持氧化过程的优势。
