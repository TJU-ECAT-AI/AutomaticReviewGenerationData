[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."

[2] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3) Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[3] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

[4] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

[5] "Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. A serious supply deficit due to rapid growth in market demand for propylene derivatives.

2. The endothermic nature of direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which requires high energy input.

3. Rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation in DHP.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Being exothermic, which eliminates the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures.

2. Potentially increasing propylene production to meet growing demand.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

Advantages:
1. Exothermic reaction, allowing for lower temperature operation.
2. Potential to increase propylene production.

Limitations:
1. When using oxygen as an oxidant:
   a. Overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in inefficient reactant use and low selectivity.
   b. Process flammability concerns, which may impair practical implementation.

These challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant have led to research into alternative soft oxidants for ODHP, aiming to improve selectivity and safety while maintaining the benefits of the oxidative process.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于丙烯衍生物市场需求的快速增长，导致严重的供应短缺。

2. 丙烷直接脱氢（DHP）的吸热性质，需要高能量输入。

3. DHP中由于积碳导致的催化剂快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 具有放热性，消除了低温下的热力学限制。

2. 有潜力增加丙烯产量，以满足不断增长的需求。

然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面也存在自身的优势和局限性：

优势：
1. 放热反应，允许在较低温度下操作。
2. 有潜力增加丙烯产量。

局限性：
1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时：
   a. 烯烃过度氧化生成碳氧化物（COx），导致反应物利用效率低和选择性差。
   b. 存在过程易燃性问题，可能影响实际应用。

这些与使用氧气作为氧化剂相关的挑战导致了对ODHP替代软氧化剂的研究，旨在改善选择性和安全性，同时保持氧化过程的优势。
