[1] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."

[3] "Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), are the high energy input required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction and rapid catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by being an exothermic reaction, which eliminates the thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures and reduces energy requirements. This makes ODHP an attractive alternative to traditional methods.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. When using oxygen as the oxidant, there are several limitations:

1. Overoxidation: The presence of oxygen can lead to the overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in inefficient use of reactants and low process selectivity.

2. Safety concerns: The use of oxygen raises concerns about process flammability, which may hinder practical implementation.

To address these issues associated with using oxygen, researchers have been exploring the use of soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, and sulfur-containing compounds. These alternative oxidants aim to mitigate the problems of overoxidation and flammability while maintaining the advantages of ODHP.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是丙烷直接脱氢（DHP）过程中，是由于反应的吸热性质而需要高能量输入，以及由于积碳形成导致的催化剂快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过其放热反应特性解决了这些问题，消除了低温下的热力学限制，并降低了能量需求。这使得ODHP成为传统方法的一个有吸引力的替代方案。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在几个限制：

1. 过度氧化：氧气的存在可能导致烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物（COx），导致反应物使用效率低下和工艺选择性低。

2. 安全隐患：使用氧气会引起工艺易燃性的担忧，这可能会阻碍实际应用。

为了解决使用氧气相关的这些问题，研究人员一直在探索使用软氧化剂，如CO2、N2O和含硫化合物。这些替代氧化剂旨在缓解过度氧化和易燃性问题，同时保持ODHP的优势。
