[1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

Current propylene production methods face challenges related to high energy consumption and catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially reducing catalyst coking. 

When using oxygen as the oxidant, ODHP presents advantages such as lower energy requirements compared to traditional dehydrogenation. However, it also has limitations, primarily the risk of over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, which reduces selectivity. This necessitates careful heat management and reactor design to avoid hotspots.

Using CO2 as an alternative oxidant in ODHP offers several benefits. It can suppress catalyst deactivation, increase energy savings, and produce CO as the main byproduct instead of water. The use of CO2 also helps avoid the over-oxidation issues associated with oxygen, potentially leading to higher selectivity towards the desired olefin products.

However, CO2 as an oxidant may present its own challenges, such as potentially lower reaction rates compared to oxygen and the need to develop catalysts specifically optimized for CO2 activation. Overall, ODHP with CO2 represents a promising approach to address the limitations of current propylene production methods, but further research and development are needed to fully realize its potential.

目前的丙烯生产方法面临着高能耗和催化剂失活的挑战。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过允许较低的反应温度和潜在地减少催化剂结焦来解决这些问题。

当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，ODHP相比传统脱氢具有能耗更低的优势。然而，它也有局限性，主要是烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物的风险，这会降低选择性。这就需要仔细管理热量并设计反应器以避免热点。

使用CO2作为ODHP的替代氧化剂提供了几个好处。它可以抑制催化剂失活，增加能源节约，并产生CO作为主要副产品而不是水。使用CO2还有助于避免与氧气相关的过度氧化问题，可能导致更高的目标烯烃产品选择性。

然而，CO2作为氧化剂可能会带来自身的挑战，例如与氧气相比反应速率可能较低，以及需要开发专门针对CO2活化优化的催化剂。总的来说，使用CO2进行ODHP代表了一种有前景的方法来解决当前丙烯生产方法的局限性，但还需要进一步的研究和开发才能充分实现其潜力。
