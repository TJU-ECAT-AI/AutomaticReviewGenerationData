[1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high reaction temperatures and the need for frequent catalyst regeneration due to coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and reducing coke formation. 

When using oxygen as an oxidant, ODHP faces challenges related to the exothermic nature of the reaction, requiring careful heat management to avoid over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides. This limits selectivity toward the desired propylene product.

Using CO2 as an alternative oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages. It can suppress catalyst deactivation, increase energy savings, and produce mainly CO as a byproduct instead of carbon oxides. The reaction with CO2 is less exothermic, allowing for better control of selectivity. However, CO2 as an oxidant may result in lower conversion rates compared to oxygen.

Overall, ODHP with CO2 presents a promising route to address the limitations of conventional propylene production methods, but further catalyst and process optimization is needed to improve conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高反应温度和由于结焦而需要频繁催化剂再生。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过允许较低的反应温度和减少积碳形成来解决这些问题。

当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，ODHP面临与反应放热性相关的挑战，需要仔细管理热量以避免烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物。这限制了对所需丙烯产品的选择性。

使用CO2作为ODHP中的替代氧化剂提供了几个优势。它可以抑制催化剂失活，增加能源节省，并主要产生CO作为副产品而不是碳氧化物。与CO2的反应放热量较小，可以更好地控制选择性。然而，CO2作为氧化剂可能导致较低的转化率。

总的来说，使用CO2的ODHP为解决传统丙烯生产方法的局限性提供了一条有前景的途径，但需要进一步优化催化剂和工艺，以提高转化率同时保持高选择性。
