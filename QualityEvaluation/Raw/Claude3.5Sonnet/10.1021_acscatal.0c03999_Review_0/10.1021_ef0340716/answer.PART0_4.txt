[1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high reaction temperatures and the need for heat removal due to exothermic reactions when using oxygen as an oxidant. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and reduced heat generation. 

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages:
1. It suppresses catalyst deactivation
2. It increases energy savings
3. It avoids over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, improving selectivity
4. It produces mainly CO as a byproduct instead of water

However, ODHP with CO2 also has limitations:
1. The reaction is less exothermic, which may result in lower conversion rates
2. CO2 is a weaker oxidant compared to oxygen, potentially requiring more advanced catalysts
3. The production of CO as a byproduct may necessitate additional purification steps

Overall, while ODHP with CO2 addresses some key challenges in propylene production, it also introduces new considerations in terms of reaction kinetics, catalyst design, and product separation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高反应温度和使用氧气作为氧化剂时需要去除热量，因为反应是放热的。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过允许较低的反应温度和减少热量产生来解决这些问题。

使用CO2作为ODHP的氧化剂有以下几个优点：
1. 抑制催化剂失活
2. 提高能源节约
3. 避免烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物，提高选择性
4. 主要副产品是CO而不是水

然而，使用CO2进行ODHP也有一些限制：
1. 反应的放热量较小，可能导致转化率降低
2. CO2是较弱的氧化剂，与氧气相比，可能需要更先进的催化剂
3. CO作为副产品的生成可能需要额外的纯化步骤

总的来说，虽然使用CO2进行ODHP解决了丙烯生产中的一些关键挑战，但它也在反应动力学、催化剂设计和产品分离方面引入了新的考虑因素。
