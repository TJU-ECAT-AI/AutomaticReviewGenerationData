          [1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "It is expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxidation."

[4] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

[5] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high reaction temperatures, catalyst deactivation, and the risk of over-oxidation when using oxygen as an oxidant. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially higher selectivity towards the desired olefin products.

Advantages of ODHP using oxygen:
1. Lower energy requirements compared to traditional dehydrogenation.
2. Significant conversion at lower reaction temperatures.

Limitations of ODHP using oxygen:
1. Exothermic reactions require careful heat management.
2. Risk of over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, reducing selectivity.
3. Necessity for effective catalyst development and process control.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages:
1. Suppresses deep oxidation, leading to higher selectivity for propylene.
2. Reduces catalyst deactivation.
3. Increases energy savings.
4. Produces CO as the main byproduct instead of water.
5. Contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by utilizing CO2.

Limitations of ODHP with CO2:
1. Potentially lower reaction rates compared to oxygen due to CO2 being a weaker oxidant.
2. May require more advanced catalysts specifically optimized for CO2 activation.
3. Production of CO as a byproduct may necessitate additional separation steps.

Overall, while ODHP with CO2 offers promising advantages in terms of selectivity, catalyst longevity, and lower operating temperatures, it also presents challenges in terms of reaction kinetics, catalyst design, and product separation that need to be addressed for widespread industrial adoption.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高反应温度、催化剂失活和使用氧气作为氧化剂时过度氧化的风险。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过允许较低的反应温度和潜在的更高的目标烯烃产物选择性来解决这些问题。

使用氧气进行ODHP的优势：
1. 与传统脱氢相比，能量需求更低。
2. 在较低的反应温度下也能实现显著的转化。

使用氧气进行ODHP的局限性：
1. 放热反应需要仔细管理热量。
2. 烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物的风险，降低选择性。
3. 需要有效的催化剂开发和过程控制。

使用CO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂具有几个优势：
1. 抑制深度氧化，导致丙烯的选择性更高。
2. 减少催化剂失活。
3. 提高能源节约。
4. 产生CO作为主要副产品而不是水。
5. 通过利用CO2有助于减少温室气体排放。

以CO2为氧化剂的ODHP的局限性：
1. 由于CO2是较弱的氧化剂，反应速率可能比氧气低。
2. 可能需要更先进的催化剂，专门针对CO2活化进行优化。
3. CO作为副产品的产生可能需要额外的分离步骤。

总的来说，虽然以CO2为氧化剂的ODHP在选择性、催化剂寿命和较低操作温度方面提供了有前景的优势，但在反应动力学、催化剂设计和产品分离方面也带来了需要解决的挑战，以实现广泛的工业应用。
