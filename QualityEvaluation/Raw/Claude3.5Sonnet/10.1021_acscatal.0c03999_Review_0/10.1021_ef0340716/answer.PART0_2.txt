[1] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control."

[2] "However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."

[3] "Therefore, it is expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxidation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and the need for effective catalyst development and process control. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing an alternative approach that can operate at lower temperatures.

However, ODHP using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges. The exothermic nature of these reactions necessitates heat removal and careful control to avoid over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, which reduces selectivity toward the desired olefins.

The use of CO2 as a weak oxidant in ODHP offers advantages by potentially suppressing deep oxidation, thus improving selectivity towards propylene. This approach may help overcome the limitations associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, such as the risk of over-oxidation and the need for precise temperature control.

However, the literature does not explicitly mention specific challenges associated with using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP. Further research would be needed to fully understand the potential limitations of this approach.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括脱氢过程的高温操作以及对有效催化剂开发和过程控制的需求。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提出可在较低温度下操作的替代方法来解决这些问题。

然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP也存在一系列挑战。这些反应的放热性质需要热量移除和仔细控制，以避免烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物，从而降低对所需烯烃的选择性。

使用CO2作为弱氧化剂进行ODHP具有潜在抑制深度氧化的优势，从而提高对丙烯的选择性。这种方法可能有助于克服使用氧气作为氧化剂相关的限制，如过度氧化的风险和精确温度控制的需求。

然而，文献中并未明确提及使用CO2作为ODHP氧化剂的具体挑战。需要进一步研究以全面了解这种方法的潜在局限性。
