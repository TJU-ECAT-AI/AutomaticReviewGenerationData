[1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "It is expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxidation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high reaction temperatures and the risk of over-oxidation when using oxygen as an oxidant. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially higher selectivity towards the desired olefin products.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages:
1. It suppresses deep oxidation, leading to higher selectivity for propylene.
2. The reaction can occur at lower temperatures compared to traditional dehydrogenation.
3. CO2 utilization contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

However, ODHP with CO2 also has limitations:
1. The reaction is less exothermic than with oxygen, potentially requiring additional energy input.
2. CO is produced as a byproduct, which may necessitate additional separation steps.
3. Catalyst development is crucial for improving activity and selectivity in CO2-based ODHP.

Overall, while ODHP with CO2 offers promising advantages in terms of selectivity and lower operating temperatures, it also presents challenges in terms of energy efficiency and byproduct management that need to be addressed for widespread industrial adoption.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高反应温度和使用氧气作为氧化剂时过度氧化的风险。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过允许较低的反应温度和潜在的更高的目标烯烃产物选择性来解决这些问题。

使用CO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂具有几个优势：
1. 它抑制深度氧化，导致丙烯的选择性更高。
2. 与传统脱氢相比，反应可以在较低的温度下进行。
3. CO2的利用有助于减少温室气体排放。

然而，以CO2为氧化剂的ODHP也有局限性：
1. 与氧气相比，反应的放热性较低，可能需要额外的能量输入。
2. CO作为副产品产生，可能需要额外的分离步骤。
3. 催化剂开发对于提高CO2基ODHP的活性和选择性至关重要。

总的来说，虽然以CO2为氧化剂的ODHP在选择性和较低操作温度方面提供了有前景的优势，但在能源效率和副产品管理方面也带来了需要解决的挑战，以实现广泛的工业应用。
