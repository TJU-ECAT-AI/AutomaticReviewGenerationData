[1] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature. However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."

[2] "Reaction 26 shows the ODH of alkanes in the presence of CO2. Other than the products of alkenes and water, CO is the main byproduct."

[3] "It is expected that the use of the weak oxidant CO2, replacing oxygen in the reactions, will suppress the deep oxidation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high reaction temperatures and the risk of over-oxidation when using oxygen as an oxidant. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially higher selectivity towards the desired olefin products.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents several advantages:
1. It suppresses deep oxidation, leading to higher selectivity for propylene.
2. The reaction can occur at lower temperatures compared to traditional dehydrogenation.
3. CO2 utilization contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

However, ODHP with CO2 also has limitations:
1. The reaction is less exothermic than with oxygen, potentially requiring additional energy input.
2. CO is produced as a byproduct, which may necessitate additional separation steps.
3. Catalyst development is crucial for improving activity and selectivity in CO2-based ODHP.

Overall, while ODHP with CO2 offers promising advantages in terms of selectivity and lower operating temperatures, it also presents challenges in terms of energy efficiency and byproduct management that need to be addressed for widespread industrial adoption.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高反应温度和使用氧气作为氧化剂时过度氧化的风险。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过允许较低的反应温度和潜在的更高的目标烯烃产物选择性来解决这些问题。

使用CO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂具有几个优势：
1. 它抑制深度氧化，导致丙烯的选择性更高。
2. 与传统脱氢相比，反应可以在较低的温度下进行。
3. CO2的利用有助于减少温室气体排放。

然而，以CO2为氧化剂的ODHP也有局限性：
1. 与氧气相比，反应的放热性较低，可能需要额外的能量输入。
2. CO作为副产品产生，可能需要额外的分离步骤。
3. 催化剂开发对于提高CO2基ODHP的活性和选择性至关重要。

总的来说，虽然以CO2为氧化剂的ODHP在选择性和较低操作温度方面提供了有前景的优势，但在能源效率和副产品管理方面也带来了需要解决的挑战，以实现广泛的工业应用。

Current propylene production methods face challenges related to high energy consumption and catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and potentially reducing catalyst coking. 

When using oxygen as the oxidant, ODHP presents advantages such as lower energy requirements compared to traditional dehydrogenation. However, it also has limitations, primarily the risk of over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, which reduces selectivity. This necessitates careful heat management and reactor design to avoid hotspots.

Using CO2 as an alternative oxidant in ODHP offers several benefits. It can suppress catalyst deactivation, increase energy savings, and produce CO as the main byproduct instead of water. The use of CO2 also helps avoid the over-oxidation issues associated with oxygen, potentially leading to higher selectivity towards the desired olefin products.

However, CO2 as an oxidant may present its own challenges, such as potentially lower reaction rates compared to oxygen and the need to develop catalysts specifically optimized for CO2 activation. Overall, ODHP with CO2 represents a promising approach to address the limitations of current propylene production methods, but further research and development are needed to fully realize its potential.

目前的丙烯生产方法面临着高能耗和催化剂失活的挑战。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过允许较低的反应温度和潜在地减少催化剂结焦来解决这些问题。

当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，ODHP相比传统脱氢具有能耗更低的优势。然而，它也有局限性，主要是烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物的风险，这会降低选择性。这就需要仔细管理热量并设计反应器以避免热点。

使用CO2作为ODHP的替代氧化剂提供了几个好处。它可以抑制催化剂失活，增加能源节约，并产生CO作为主要副产品而不是水。使用CO2还有助于避免与氧气相关的过度氧化问题，可能导致更高的目标烯烃产品选择性。

然而，CO2作为氧化剂可能会带来自身的挑战，例如与氧气相比反应速率可能较低，以及需要开发专门针对CO2活化优化的催化剂。总的来说，使用CO2进行ODHP代表了一种有前景的方法来解决当前丙烯生产方法的局限性，但还需要进一步的研究和开发才能充分实现其潜力。

[1] "In the past decades, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and much effort has been exerted for effective catalyst development and process control."

[2] "However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high-temperature operation of dehydrogenation processes and the need for effective catalyst development and process control. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing an alternative approach that can operate at lower temperatures.

However, ODHP using oxygen as an oxidant presents its own set of challenges. The exothermic nature of these reactions necessitates heat removal and careful control to avoid over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, which reduces selectivity toward the desired olefins.

The use of CO2 as a weak oxidant in ODHP offers advantages by potentially suppressing deep oxidation, thus improving selectivity towards propylene. This approach may help overcome the limitations associated with using oxygen as an oxidant, such as the risk of over-oxidation and the need for precise temperature control.

However, the literature does not explicitly mention specific challenges associated with using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP. Further research would be needed to fully understand the potential limitations of this approach.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括脱氢过程的高温操作以及对有效催化剂开发和过程控制的需求。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提出可在较低温度下操作的替代方法来解决这些问题。

然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP也存在一系列挑战。这些反应的放热性质需要热量移除和仔细控制，以避免烯烃过度氧化成碳氧化物，从而降低对所需烯烃的选择性。

使用CO2作为弱氧化剂进行ODHP具有潜在抑制深度氧化的优势，从而提高对丙烯的选择性。这种方法可能有助于克服使用氧气作为氧化剂相关的限制，如过度氧化的风险和精确温度控制的需求。

然而，文献中并未明确提及使用CO2作为ODHP氧化剂的具体挑战。需要进一步研究以全面了解这种方法的潜在局限性。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high reaction temperatures and the need for frequent catalyst regeneration due to coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and reducing coke formation. 

When using oxygen as an oxidant, ODHP faces challenges related to the exothermic nature of the reaction, requiring careful heat management to avoid over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides. This limits selectivity toward the desired propylene product.

Using CO2 as an alternative oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages. It can suppress catalyst deactivation, increase energy savings, and produce mainly CO as a byproduct instead of carbon oxides. The reaction with CO2 is less exothermic, allowing for better control of selectivity. However, CO2 as an oxidant may result in lower conversion rates compared to oxygen.

Overall, ODHP with CO2 presents a promising route to address the limitations of conventional propylene production methods, but further catalyst and process optimization is needed to improve conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity.
