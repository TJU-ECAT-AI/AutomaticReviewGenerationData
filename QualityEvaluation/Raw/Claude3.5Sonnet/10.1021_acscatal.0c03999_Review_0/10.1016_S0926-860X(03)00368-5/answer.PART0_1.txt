[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy requirements: Traditional dehydrogenation of propane is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures.

2. Low selectivity: The reaction tends to be nonselective due to equal reactivity of C-H bonds in propane.

3. Coke formation: High temperatures promote thermal cracking reactions, leading to coke and light alkane formation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Being exothermic, potentially reducing energy requirements.
2. Potentially improving selectivity towards propene.

However, ODHP with oxygen as the oxidant presents its own challenges:

1. Heat management: The exothermic nature requires careful heat removal.
2. Overoxidation: Risk of propane oxidizing to carbon oxides and oxygenates, reducing propene selectivity.

Using CO2 as an alternative oxidant in ODHP offers advantages:

1. Milder oxidation conditions: Allows for lower reaction temperatures.
2. Higher selectivity: Produces propene with high selectivity.
3. Potential environmental benefit: Utilizes CO2, a greenhouse gas.

The main challenge with CO2 as an oxidant is developing effective catalysts that can achieve high propene yields while maintaining selectivity.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：传统的丙烷脱氢是吸热反应，需要高温和低压条件。

2. 低选择性：由于丙烷中C-H键反应活性相同，反应趋于非选择性。

3. 结焦：高温促进热裂解反应，导致结焦和轻烷烃的形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 放热反应，可能降低能耗。
2. 可能提高对丙烯的选择性。

然而，以氧气为氧化剂的ODHP也存在自身的挑战：

1. 热量管理：放热特性需要谨慎去除热量。
2. 过度氧化：丙烷可能氧化成碳氧化物和含氧化合物，降低丙烯选择性。

使用CO2作为ODHP的替代氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 更温和的氧化条件：允许更低的反应温度。
2. 更高的选择性：能够高选择性地生产丙烯。
3. 潜在的环境效益：利用了温室气体CO2。

以CO2为氧化剂的主要挑战是开发能够在保持选择性的同时实现高丙烯产率的有效催化剂。
