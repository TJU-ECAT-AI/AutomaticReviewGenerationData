[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy requirements: Traditional dehydrogenation of propane is endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures.

2. Poor selectivity: The reaction tends to be nonselective due to equal reactivity of C-H bonds in propane.

3. Coke formation and thermal cracking: High temperatures promote unwanted side reactions.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Being exothermic, potentially reducing energy requirements.
2. Allowing operation at lower temperatures, which can improve selectivity.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges:

1. Heat management: The exothermic nature requires careful heat removal.
2. Overoxidation: Risk of further oxidizing propene to carbon oxides and oxygenates.

Regarding oxidant selection:

1. Oxygen: Offers high activity but poses challenges in controlling selectivity and avoiding overoxidation.
2. CO2: Acts as a milder oxidant, allowing for lower operating temperatures and higher selectivity to propene. However, it may result in lower activity compared to oxygen.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP represents a promising approach to address the limitations of both traditional dehydrogenation and oxygen-based ODHP, offering a balance between reactivity and selectivity.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：传统的丙烷脱氢是吸热反应，需要高温和低压条件。

2. 选择性差：由于丙烷中C-H键反应活性相当，反应倾向于非选择性。

3. 积碳和热裂解：高温促进不需要的副反应。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 反应放热，可能减少能源需求。
2. 可在较低温度下操作，有助于提高选择性。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战：

1. 热量管理：放热特性需要谨慎地去除热量。
2. 过度氧化：存在将丙烯进一步氧化为碳氧化物和含氧化合物的风险。

关于氧化剂的选择：

1. 氧气：提供高活性，但在控制选择性和避免过度氧化方面存在挑战。
2. 二氧化碳：作为较温和的氧化剂，允许在较低的操作温度下获得更高的丙烯选择性。然而，与氧气相比，其活性可能较低。

在ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂是一种有前景的方法，可以解决传统脱氢和基于氧气的ODHP的限制，在反应活性和选择性之间取得平衡。
