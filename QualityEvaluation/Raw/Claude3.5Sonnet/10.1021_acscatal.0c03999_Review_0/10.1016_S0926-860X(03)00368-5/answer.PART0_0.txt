[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High temperatures and low pressures required for traditional dehydrogenation, leading to nonselective reactions and thermal cracking.

2. Coke formation and production of light alkanes at high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Allowing operation at lower temperatures, reducing thermal cracking and coke formation.

2. Shifting the reaction equilibrium to favor propylene production.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges:

1. When using oxygen as an oxidant, the reaction is highly exothermic, requiring careful heat management.

2. Risk of overoxidation, leading to unwanted carbon oxides and oxygenates.

Using CO2 as a mild oxidant offers advantages:

1. Allows for lower reaction temperatures while maintaining high selectivity to propylene.

2. Reduces the risk of overoxidation compared to oxygen.

3. Provides an opportunity to utilize CO2, addressing environmental concerns.

The main challenge with CO2 as an oxidant is developing effective catalysts that can activate both propane and CO2 while maintaining high selectivity to propylene.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统脱氢需要高温和低压，导致非选择性反应和热裂解。

2. 高温下形成焦炭和产生轻烃。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 允许在较低温度下操作，减少热裂解和焦炭形成。

2. 将反应平衡转移到有利于丙烯生成的方向。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，反应高度放热，需要仔细管理热量。

2. 存在过度氧化的风险，导致不需要的碳氧化物和含氧化合物生成。

使用CO2作为温和氧化剂提供了以下优势：

1. 允许在较低反应温度下保持对丙烯的高选择性。

2. 与氧气相比，降低了过度氧化的风险。

3. 提供了利用CO2的机会，解决环境问题。

使用CO2作为氧化剂的主要挑战是开发能够同时活化丙烷和CO2，同时保持对丙烯高选择性的有效催化剂。
