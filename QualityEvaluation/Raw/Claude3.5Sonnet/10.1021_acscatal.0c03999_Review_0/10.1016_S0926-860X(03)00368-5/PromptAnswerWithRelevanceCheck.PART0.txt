<quotes>

[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High temperatures and low pressures required for traditional dehydrogenation, leading to nonselective reactions and thermal cracking.

2. Coke formation and production of light alkanes at high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Allowing operation at lower temperatures, reducing thermal cracking and coke formation.

2. Shifting the reaction equilibrium to favor propylene production.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges:

1. When using oxygen as an oxidant, the reaction is highly exothermic, requiring careful heat management.

2. Risk of overoxidation, leading to unwanted carbon oxides and oxygenates.

Using CO2 as a mild oxidant offers advantages:

1. Allows for lower reaction temperatures while maintaining high selectivity to propylene.

2. Reduces the risk of overoxidation compared to oxygen.

3. Provides an opportunity to utilize CO2, addressing environmental concerns.

The main challenge with CO2 as an oxidant is developing effective catalysts that can activate both propane and CO2 while maintaining high selectivity to propylene.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统脱氢需要高温和低压，导致非选择性反应和热裂解。

2. 高温下形成焦炭和产生轻烃。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 允许在较低温度下操作，减少热裂解和焦炭形成。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，反应高度放热，需要仔细管理热量。

2. 存在过度氧化的风险，导致不需要的碳氧化物和含氧化合物生成。

使用CO2作为温和氧化剂提供了以下优势：

1. 允许在较低反应温度下保持对丙烯的高选择性。

2. 与氧气相比，降低了过度氧化的风险。

3. 提供了利用CO2的机会，解决环境问题。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy requirements: Traditional dehydrogenation of propane is endothermic and requires high temperatures and low pressures.

2. Low selectivity: The reaction tends to be nonselective due to equal reactivity of C-H bonds in propane.

3. Coke formation: High temperatures promote thermal cracking reactions, leading to coke and light alkane formation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Being exothermic, potentially reducing energy requirements.
2. Potentially improving selectivity towards propene.

However, ODHP with oxygen as the oxidant presents its own challenges:

1. Heat management: The exothermic nature requires careful heat removal.
2. Overoxidation: Risk of propane oxidizing to carbon oxides and oxygenates, reducing propene selectivity.

Using CO2 as an alternative oxidant in ODHP offers advantages:

1. Milder oxidation conditions: Allows for lower reaction temperatures.
2. Higher selectivity: Produces propene with high selectivity.
3. Potential environmental benefit: Utilizes CO2, a greenhouse gas.

The main challenge with CO2 as an oxidant is developing effective catalysts that can achieve high propene yields while maintaining selectivity.

2. 低选择性：由于丙烷中C-H键反应活性相同，反应趋于非选择性。

3. 结焦：高温促进热裂解反应，导致结焦和轻烷烃的形成。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

然而，以氧气为氧化剂的ODHP也存在自身的挑战：

1. 热量管理：放热特性需要谨慎去除热量。
2. 过度氧化：丙烷可能氧化成碳氧化物和含氧化合物，降低丙烯选择性。

使用CO2作为ODHP的替代氧化剂具有以下优势：

1. 更温和的氧化条件：允许更低的反应温度。
2. 更高的选择性：能够高选择性地生产丙烯。
3. 潜在的环境效益：利用了温室气体CO2。

以CO2为氧化剂的主要挑战是开发能够在保持选择性的同时实现高丙烯产率的有效催化剂。

Regarding oxidant selection:

2. CO2: Acts as a milder oxidant, allowing for lower operating temperatures and higher selectivity to propene. However, it may result in lower activity compared to oxygen.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP represents a promising approach to address the limitations of both traditional dehydrogenation and oxygen-based ODHP, offering a balance between reactivity and selectivity.
