          [1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High energy requirements: Traditional dehydrogenation of propane is endothermic, requiring high temperatures and low pressures.
2. Poor selectivity: The reaction tends to be nonselective due to equal reactivity of C-H bonds in propane.
3. Coke formation and thermal cracking: High temperatures promote unwanted side reactions.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:
1. Being exothermic, potentially reducing energy requirements.
2. Allowing operation at lower temperatures, which can improve selectivity.
3. Shifting the reaction equilibrium to favor propylene production.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges:
1. Heat management: The exothermic nature requires careful heat removal.
2. Overoxidation: Risk of further oxidizing propene to carbon oxides and oxygenates.

Regarding oxidant selection:
1. Oxygen: Offers high activity but poses challenges in controlling selectivity and avoiding overoxidation.
2. CO2: Acts as a milder oxidant, allowing for lower operating temperatures and higher selectivity to propene. However, it may result in lower activity compared to oxygen.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages:
1. Allows for relatively low reaction temperatures while maintaining high selectivity to propylene.
2. Reduces the risk of overoxidation compared to oxygen.
3. Provides an opportunity to utilize CO2, addressing environmental concerns.

The main challenge with CO2 as an oxidant is developing effective catalysts that can activate both propane and CO2 while maintaining high selectivity to propylene.

          目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 高能耗：传统的丙烷脱氢是吸热反应，需要高温和低压条件。
2. 选择性差：由于丙烷中C-H键反应活性相当，反应倾向于非选择性。
3. 积碳和热裂解：高温促进不需要的副反应。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：
1. 反应放热，可能减少能源需求。
2. 可在较低温度下操作，有助于提高选择性。
3. 将反应平衡转移到有利于丙烯生成的方向。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的挑战：
1. 热量管理：放热特性需要谨慎地去除热量。
2. 过度氧化：存在将丙烯进一步氧化为碳氧化物和含氧化合物的风险。

关于氧化剂的选择：
1. 氧气：提供高活性，但在控制选择性和避免过度氧化方面存在挑战。
2. 二氧化碳：作为较温和的氧化剂，允许在较低的操作温度下获得更高的丙烯选择性。然而，与氧气相比，其活性可能较低。

使用CO2作为ODHP的氧化剂提供了以下优势：
1. 允许在相对较低的反应温度下保持对丙烯的高选择性。
2. 与氧气相比，降低了过度氧化的风险。
3. 提供了利用CO2的机会，解决环境问题。

使用CO2作为氧化剂的主要挑战是开发能够同时活化丙烷和CO2，同时保持对丙烯高选择性的有效催化剂。
