[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High temperature and low pressure requirements for good alkene yields in traditional dehydrogenation.

2. Non-selectivity of the reaction due to equal reactivity of C-H bonds in propane.

3. Thermal cracking reactions leading to coke formation and light alkanes at high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an alternative to thermal cracking.
2. Allowing for lower reaction temperatures.

However, ODHP with oxygen presents its own challenges:

1. Exothermic nature requiring heat removal.
2. Risk of overoxidation to carbon oxides and oxygenates.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers advantages:

1. Acts as a mild oxidant.
2. Allows for relatively low reaction temperatures.
3. Provides high selectivity towards propene.

The main challenge in oxidant selection is balancing reactivity to achieve desired conversion while maintaining selectivity and avoiding unwanted side reactions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统脱氢需要高温和低压才能获得良好的烯烃产率。

2. 由于丙烷中C-H键的反应活性相等，反应的选择性较低。

3. 高温下的热裂解反应导致焦炭形成和轻烷烃生成。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了热裂解的替代方案。
2. 允许在较低的反应温度下进行。

然而，使用氧气的ODHP也带来了自身的挑战：

1. 反应放热需要移除热量。
2. 存在过度氧化生成碳氧化物和含氧化合物的风险。

使用CO2作为ODHP的氧化剂提供了以下优势：

1. 作为温和的氧化剂。
2. 允许在相对较低的反应温度下进行。
3. 对丙烯具有高选择性。

氧化剂选择的主要挑战是在实现所需转化率的同时保持选择性并避免不必要的副反应之间取得平衡。
