[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic process which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."

[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."

[3] "Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. High temperature and low pressure requirements for traditional dehydrogenation, leading to nonselective reactions and thermal cracking.

2. Coke formation and production of light alkanes at high temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Allowing the reaction to occur at lower temperatures, reducing thermal cracking and coke formation.

2. Shifting the equilibrium towards products by removing hydrogen, potentially improving yields.

However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:

Advantages:
1. Lower reaction temperatures
2. Potential for higher selectivity and yields

Limitations:
1. When using oxygen as an oxidant, heat removal is necessary due to the exothermic nature of the reaction.
2. Risk of overoxidation, leading to the formation of carbon oxides and oxygenates.

In the context of oxidant selection, CO2 has emerged as a promising alternative to oxygen:

1. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, allowing for high selectivity towards propene.
2. The reaction can be performed at relatively low temperatures while maintaining high selectivity.
3. Using CO2 as an oxidant may help address environmental concerns by utilizing this greenhouse gas.

However, the specific challenges associated with using CO2 as an oxidant are not extensively discussed in the given literature excerpt.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 传统脱氢需要高温和低压条件，导致非选择性反应和热裂解。

2. 高温下会形成焦炭并产生轻烷烃。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 允许在较低温度下进行反应，减少热裂解和焦炭形成。

2. 通过去除氢气来改变平衡，可能提高产率。

然而，ODHP也有自己的优势和局限性：

优势：
1. 较低的反应温度
2. 可能获得更高的选择性和产率

局限性：
1. 当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，由于反应的放热性质，需要进行热量去除。
2. 存在过度氧化的风险，导致碳氧化物和含氧化合物的形成。

在氧化剂选择方面，CO2已成为氧气的一个有前景的替代品：

1. CO2作为温和的氧化剂，可以实现对丙烯的高选择性。
2. 反应可以在相对较低的温度下进行，同时保持高选择性。
3. 使用CO2作为氧化剂可能有助于解决环境问题，因为它利用了这种温室气体。

然而，在给定的文献摘录中并未广泛讨论使用CO2作为氧化剂的具体挑战。
