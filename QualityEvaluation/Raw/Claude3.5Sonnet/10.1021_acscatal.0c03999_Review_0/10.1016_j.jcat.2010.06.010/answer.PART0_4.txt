[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry. However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low olefin yields and selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an attractive way to convert cheap and abundant raw materials (propane) into valuable petrochemical building blocks (propylene). However, ODHP also faces limitations, particularly low olefin selectivity due to fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides.

The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges. While using molecular oxygen (O2) as an oxidant leads to higher activity, it results in lower propylene selectivity. In contrast, using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent significantly improves propene selectivity across various catalyst types, including iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The improved performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced catalyst species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This, in turn, suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, thereby enhancing selectivity. However, the use of N2O also comes with its own set of challenges, such as potentially lower overall activity compared to O2.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括低烯烃产率和选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种将廉价和丰富的原料(丙烷)转化为有价值的石化基础产品(丙烯)的有吸引力的方法来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也面临着限制，特别是由于目标烯烃快速连续氧化为碳氧化物而导致的低烯烃选择性。

氧化剂的选择在解决这些挑战中起着至关重要的作用。虽然使用分子氧(O2)作为氧化剂会导致更高的活性，但会降低丙烯选择性。相比之下，使用一氧化二氮(N2O)作为氧化剂可以显著提高各种催化剂类型的丙烯选择性，包括含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O性能的改善归因于还原催化剂物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这反过来抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化，从而提高了选择性。然而，使用N2O也带来了自身的一系列挑战，例如与O2相比可能会降低整体活性。
