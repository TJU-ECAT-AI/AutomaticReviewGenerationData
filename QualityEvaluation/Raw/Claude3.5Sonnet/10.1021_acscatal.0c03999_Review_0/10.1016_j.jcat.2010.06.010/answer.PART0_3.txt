[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry. However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications."

[2] "The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."

[3] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[4] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low olefin yields, preventing industrial application of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

2. Low olefin selectivity due to rapid consecutive oxidation of target olefins to carbon oxides.

ODHP addresses these issues by offering an attractive way to convert cheap and abundant raw materials (propane) into valuable petrochemical building blocks (propene). However, it still faces limitations in terms of yield and selectivity.

The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) instead of molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidizing agent has shown significant improvements in propene selectivity. This is because:

1. N2O reoxidizes reduced catalyst species more slowly than O2.
2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.
3. Consequently, the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed.

However, challenges remain in optimizing the catalysts and reaction conditions to achieve industrially viable yields while maintaining high selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 低烯烃产率，阻碍了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的工业应用。

2. 由于目标烯烃快速连续氧化为碳氧化物，导致烯烃选择性低。

ODHP通过提供一种将廉价且丰富的原材料（丙烷）转化为有价值的石化基础产品（丙烯）的有吸引力的方法来解决这些问题。然而，它在产率和选择性方面仍面临限制。

氧化剂的选择在解决这些挑战中起着关键作用。使用一氧化二氮（N2O）代替分子氧（O2）作为氧化剂已显示出显著提高丙烯选择性的效果。这是因为：

1. N2O重氧化还原的催化剂物种比O2慢。
2. 这导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。
3. 因此，抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程。

然而，在优化催化剂和反应条件以实现工业可行的产率同时保持高选择性方面仍然存在挑战。
