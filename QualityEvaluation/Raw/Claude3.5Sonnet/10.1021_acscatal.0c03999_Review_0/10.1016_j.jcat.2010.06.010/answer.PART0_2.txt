[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry. However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides and supported vanadium-containing materials."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction, the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low olefin yields in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).
2. Low olefin selectivity due to fast consecutive oxidation of target olefins to carbon oxides.

ODHP addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an attractive way to convert cheap and abundant raw materials (propane) into valuable petrochemical building blocks (propene).
2. Potentially improving selectivity through careful catalyst and oxidant selection.

However, ODHP still faces limitations:

1. Yields are not yet high enough for industrial application.
2. Balancing activity and selectivity remains challenging.

Regarding oxidant selection:

1. Using N2O instead of O2 can significantly improve propene selectivity.
2. N2O leads to slower reoxidation of reduced catalyst sites, resulting in lower concentration of active oxygen species.
3. This suppresses consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, improving selectivity.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include:
1. Higher reactivity leading to faster consecutive oxidation of desired products.
2. More difficult control of selectivity compared to N2O.

Overall, while ODHP shows promise for addressing current propylene production challenges, optimizing catalyst design and oxidant choice to balance activity and selectivity remains an important area of research.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的烯烃产率低。
2. 由于目标烯烃快速连续氧化为碳氧化物，导致烯烃选择性低。

ODHP通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了一种将廉价且丰富的原料（丙烷）转化为有价值的石油化工基础材料（丙烯）的有吸引力的方法。
2. 通过精心选择催化剂和氧化剂，有可能提高选择性。

然而，ODHP仍面临一些限制：

1. 产率尚未高到足以进行工业应用。
2. 平衡活性和选择性仍然具有挑战性。

关于氧化剂的选择：

1. 使用N2O代替O2可以显著提高丙烯选择性。
2. N2O导致还原催化剂位点的再氧化速度较慢，从而降低活性氧物种的浓度。
3. 这抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化，提高了选择性。

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括：
1. 反应性更高，导致所需产物更快速地连续氧化。
2. 与N2O相比，选择性控制更加困难。

总的来说，虽然ODHP在解决当前丙烯生产挑战方面显示出前景，但优化催化剂设计和氧化剂选择以平衡活性和选择性仍然是一个重要的研究领域。
