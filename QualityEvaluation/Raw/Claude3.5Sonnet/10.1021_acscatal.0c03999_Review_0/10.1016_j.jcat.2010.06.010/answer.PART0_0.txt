[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry. However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low olefin yields and low olefin selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an attractive way to convert cheap and abundant raw materials (propane) into valuable petrochemical building blocks (propylene). 

However, ODHP also presents its own set of limitations, particularly the fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides, which reduces selectivity. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges. When using nitrous oxide (N2O) instead of molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidizing agent, propene selectivity is significantly improved across various catalyst systems.

The advantage of using N2O stems from its slower reoxidation of reduced catalyst species compared to O2. This results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses the undesired consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides. Thus, while ODHP offers potential advantages in propylene production, careful consideration of the oxidant and reaction conditions is necessary to overcome the challenges of selectivity and yield.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括烯烃产率低和烯烃选择性低。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过提供一种将廉价且丰富的原料(丙烷)转化为有价值的石化基础产品(丙烯)的有吸引力的方法来解决这些问题。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的一些限制，特别是目标烯烃快速连续氧化成碳氧化物，这降低了选择性。氧化剂的选择在解决这些挑战中起着至关重要的作用。当使用一氧化二氮(N2O)代替分子氧(O2)作为氧化剂时，在各种催化剂系统中丙烯的选择性都显著提高。

使用N2O的优势源于其与O2相比对还原态催化剂物种的再氧化速度较慢。这导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，从而抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物不良的连续氧化。因此，虽然ODHP在丙烯生产中提供了潜在的优势，但需要仔细考虑氧化剂和反应条件，以克服选择性和产率的挑战。
