[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry."

[2] "However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."

[3] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[4] "In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Low olefin yields in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).
2. Low olefin selectivity due to fast consecutive oxidation of target olefins to carbon oxides.

ODHP addresses these issues by:

1. Providing an attractive way to convert cheap and abundant raw materials (propane) into valuable petrochemical building blocks (propene).
2. Offering potential for improved selectivity through catalyst and process optimization.

However, ODHP presents its own set of limitations:

1. Still struggling with low olefin yields, preventing industrial application.
2. Challenges in balancing activity and selectivity.

Regarding oxidant selection:

1. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) instead of molecular oxygen (O2) as the oxidizing agent has shown significant improvements in propene selectivity.
2. N2O leads to slower reoxidation of reduced catalyst species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.
3. This lower concentration of active sites suppresses consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, improving selectivity.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include:

1. Higher reactivity leading to faster consecutive oxidation of desired products.
2. Difficulty in controlling selectivity due to the formation of highly reactive oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的烯烃产率低。
2. 由于目标烯烃快速连续氧化成碳氧化物，导致烯烃选择性低。

ODHP通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了一种将廉价和丰富的原材料（丙烷）转化为有价值的石化基础材料（丙烯）的有吸引力的方法。
2. 通过催化剂和工艺优化，有可能提高选择性。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的局限性：

1. 仍然面临烯烃产率低的问题，阻碍了工业应用。
2. 在活性和选择性之间平衡的挑战。

关于氧化剂选择：

1. 使用一氧化二氮（N2O）代替分子氧（O2）作为氧化剂，已显示出显著提高丙烯选择性的效果。
2. N2O导致还原态催化剂物种的再氧化速度较慢，resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites。
3. 这种较低的活性位点浓度抑制了丙烯连续氧化成碳氧化物的过程，从而提高了选择性。

使用氧气相关的具体挑战包括：

1. 较高的反应活性导致所需产物更快地发生连续氧化。
2. 由于催化剂表面形成高活性氧物种，难以控制选择性。
