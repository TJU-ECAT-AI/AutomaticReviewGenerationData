[1] "Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene."

[2] "There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking."

[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene."

[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide."

[5] "The answer to this problem may be oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Heavy reliance on fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas.
2. Meeting high global demand as propylene is the second most important petrochemical feedstock after ethylene.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative production method that is less dependent on fossil fuel feedstocks.
2. Potentially increasing propylene yields compared to traditional methods.

Advantages of ODHP:
1. It is an exothermic reaction, making it more energy-efficient than endothermic dehydrogenation.
2. It can overcome thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative routes.

Limitations of ODHP, particularly with oxygen as an oxidant:
1. Over-oxidation of products to carbon dioxide, reducing selectivity for desired products.
2. Safety concerns due to the use of oxygen at high temperatures.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents potential advantages:
1. Milder oxidizing power compared to oxygen, potentially improving selectivity.
2. Utilization of CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a feedstock.
3. Reduced risk of over-oxidation compared to using oxygen.

However, challenges remain in developing efficient catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions for CO2-based ODHP to achieve commercially viable conversions and selectivities.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 严重依赖石油和天然气等化石燃料。
2. 满足高全球需求，因为丙烯是仅次于乙烯的第二重要的石化原料。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供一种较少依赖化石燃料原料的替代生产方法。
2. 与传统方法相比，可能增加丙烯产量。

ODHP的优势：
1. 它是一个放热反应，比吸热脱氢反应更节能。
2. 它可以克服非氧化路线的热力学限制。

ODHP的限制，尤其是使用氧气作为氧化剂时：
1. 产品过度氧化成二氧化碳，降低了目标产品的选择性。
2. 由于在高温下使用氧气而产生安全隐患。

使用CO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂具有潜在优势：
1. 与氧气相比，氧化能力更温和，可能提高选择性。
2. 利用温室气体CO2作为原料。
3. 与使用氧气相比，过度氧化的风险降低。

然而，在开发高效催化剂和优化CO2基ODHP反应条件以实现商业可行的转化率和选择性方面仍然存在挑战。
