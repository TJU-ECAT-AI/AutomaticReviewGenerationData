The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Reliance on fossil fuels: Propylene is mainly produced from petroleum, natural gas, and coal, which are non-renewable resources.

2. High global demand: As the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene, there is significant pressure to meet increasing propylene demand.

3. Limited efficiency of traditional methods: Existing technologies like olefin metathesis, methanol-to-propene conversion, and olefin cracking have limitations in meeting the growing demand.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Utilizing propane: ODHP offers a more direct route to produce propylene from propane, which is more abundant and potentially cheaper than traditional feedstocks.

2. Improved efficiency: ODHP is an exothermic reaction, potentially offering energy savings compared to endothermic traditional dehydrogenation processes.

3. Potential for higher yields: By removing hydrogen in-situ, ODHP can potentially achieve higher propylene yields than traditional methods.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. Over-oxidation with oxygen: When using molecular oxygen as an oxidant, there is a significant risk of over-oxidation, leading to the formation of CO2 and other unwanted byproducts, which reduces selectivity towards propylene.

2. CO2 as an alternative oxidant: To address the over-oxidation issue, CO2 has been proposed as a milder oxidant for ODHP. This approach offers the potential for improved selectivity and the added benefit of CO2 utilization.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include:

1. Selectivity control: Balancing the oxidative power to achieve high propane conversion while maintaining high propylene selectivity is challenging.

2. Safety concerns: The use of oxygen in hydrocarbon processing carries inherent safety risks due to the potential for explosive mixtures.

3. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that can activate propane while resisting over-oxidation in the presence of oxygen is a significant challenge.

While CO2 as an oxidant addresses some of these issues, it introduces new challenges such as the need for more active catalysts due to CO2's lower oxidizing power and the potential for reverse water-gas shift reactions competing with the desired ODHP reaction.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 依赖化石燃料：丙烯主要由石油、天然气和煤炭生产，这些都是不可再生资源。

2. 全球需求高：作为仅次于乙烯的第二重要石化产品原料，满足不断增长的丙烯需求压力巨大。

3. 传统方法效率有限：现有的烯烃复分解、甲醇制丙烯和烯烃裂解等技术在满足不断增长的需求方面存在局限性。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 利用丙烷：ODHP提供了一种从丙烷直接生产丙烯的更直接路线，丙烷比传统原料更丰富且潜在更便宜。

2. 提高效率：ODHP是放热反应，与传统吸热脱氢过程相比可能节省能源。

3. 更高产率潜力：通过原位除氢，ODHP可能实现比传统方法更高的丙烯产率。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 氧气过度氧化：使用分子氧作为氧化剂时，存在显著的过度氧化风险，导致CO2和其他不需要的副产品的形成，降低了丙烯的选择性。

2. CO2作为替代氧化剂：为解决过度氧化问题，CO2被提议作为ODHP的温和氧化剂。这种方法有可能提高选择性，并带来CO2利用的额外益处。

使用氧气在ODHP中的具体挑战包括：

1. 选择性控制：平衡氧化能力以实现高丙烷转化率同时保持高丙烯选择性具有挑战性。

2. 安全问题：在烃类加工中使用氧气由于潜在的爆炸性混合物而带来固有的安全风险。

3. 催化剂设计：开发能够在氧气存在下激活丙烷同时抵抗过度氧化的催化剂是一个重大挑战。

虽然CO2作为氧化剂解决了一些问题，但它也带来了新的挑战，如由于CO2氧化能力较低而需要更活跃的催化剂，以及潜在的逆水气变换反应与所需ODHP反应竞争。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Heavy reliance on fossil fuels like petroleum and natural gas.
2. Meeting high global demand as propylene is the second most important petrochemical feedstock after ethylene.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative production method that is less dependent on fossil fuel feedstocks.
2. Potentially increasing propylene yields compared to traditional methods.

Advantages of ODHP:
1. It is an exothermic reaction, making it more energy-efficient than endothermic dehydrogenation.
2. It can overcome thermodynamic limitations of non-oxidative routes.

Limitations of ODHP, particularly with oxygen as an oxidant:
1. Over-oxidation of products to carbon dioxide, reducing selectivity for desired products.
2. Safety concerns due to the use of oxygen at high temperatures.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP presents potential advantages:
1. Milder oxidizing power compared to oxygen, potentially improving selectivity.
2. Utilization of CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a feedstock.
3. Reduced risk of over-oxidation compared to using oxygen.

However, challenges remain in developing efficient catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions for CO2-based ODHP to achieve commercially viable conversions and selectivities.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

1. Selectivity issues with oxygen: While oxygen can overcome thermodynamic limitations, it often leads to a significant loss of selectivity due to the production of undesired carbon oxides and oxygenates.

2. Balancing reactivity and selectivity: Finding an oxidant that is active enough to drive the reaction but selective enough to avoid over-oxidation is a key challenge.

3. Catalyst development: Designing catalysts that can effectively activate propane while controlling the oxidation process is crucial for the success of ODHP.

4. Process control: Managing reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing byproduct formation requires careful process optimization.

These challenges highlight the need for continued research and development in ODHP technology, particularly in the areas of catalyst design and oxidant selection, to make it a viable alternative to traditional propylene production methods.
