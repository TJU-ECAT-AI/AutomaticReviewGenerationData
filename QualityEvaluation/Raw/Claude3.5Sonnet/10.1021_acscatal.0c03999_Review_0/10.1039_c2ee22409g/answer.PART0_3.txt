[1] "Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene."

[2] "There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking."

[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene."

[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Heavy reliance on fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, coal) for production.

2. High global demand for propylene as a key petrochemical feedstock.

3. Limited efficiency of traditional production methods.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative technology that can potentially reduce reliance on fossil fuel cracking.

2. Providing a more direct route to produce propylene from propane.

3. Potentially improving efficiency compared to traditional methods.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection:

1. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there are issues with over-oxidation of products to carbon dioxide, reducing selectivity for the desired propylene.

2. Finding the right balance between reactivity and selectivity is crucial for ODHP to be commercially viable.

3. Alternative oxidants like CO2 are being explored to address some of these selectivity issues, but they come with their own challenges in terms of activation and conversion rates.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 生产过程严重依赖化石燃料（石油、天然气、煤炭）。

2. 作为关键的石化原料,丙烯的全球需求量很大。

3. 传统生产方法的效率有限。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供一种可能减少对化石燃料裂解依赖的替代技术。

2. 为从丙烷生产丙烯提供更直接的路线。

3. 与传统方法相比,可能提高效率。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时,产品过度氧化成二氧化碳的问题会降低目标产物丙烯的选择性。

2. 找到反应性和选择性之间的正确平衡对ODHP的商业可行性至关重要。

3. 正在探索使用CO2等替代氧化剂来解决一些选择性问题,但这些氧化剂在活化和转化率方面也面临着自身的挑战。
