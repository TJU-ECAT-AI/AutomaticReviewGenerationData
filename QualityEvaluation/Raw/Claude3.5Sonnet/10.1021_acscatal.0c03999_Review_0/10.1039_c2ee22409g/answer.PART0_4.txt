[1] "Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene."

[2] "There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking."

[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene."

[4] "Although the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the process, the selectivity for dehydrogenation products remains an unsolved problem due to the over-oxidation of n-butane to carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Heavy reliance on fossil fuels, particularly petroleum and natural gas.

2. High global demand for propylene as a key petrochemical feedstock.

3. Limited efficiency and selectivity of traditional production methods.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Offering an alternative route to propylene production that is potentially more efficient.

2. Utilizing propane, which is more abundant and less costly than traditional feedstocks.

3. Potentially reducing energy consumption compared to traditional thermal dehydrogenation.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection:

1. When using oxygen as an oxidant, there is a risk of over-oxidation, leading to the formation of unwanted carbon dioxide and reducing selectivity towards propylene.

2. Finding the right balance between conversion and selectivity remains a significant challenge.

3. Catalyst design is crucial to improve selectivity and reduce unwanted side reactions.

The use of CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP has been explored as a potential solution to some of these challenges, as it may offer milder oxidation conditions and potentially improve selectivity. However, this approach also requires further research and development to become commercially viable.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 严重依赖化石燃料，特别是石油和天然气。

2. 作为关键石化原料，丙烯的全球需求量很大。

3. 传统生产方法的效率和选择性有限。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供了一种潜在更高效的丙烯生产替代路线。

2. 利用丙烷作为原料，丙烷比传统原料更丰富且成本更低。

3. 与传统热脱氢相比，可能减少能源消耗。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面：

1. 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，存在过度氧化的风险，导致形成不需要的二氧化碳，降低了丙烯的选择性。

2. 在转化率和选择性之间找到适当的平衡仍然是一个重大挑战。

3. 催化剂设计对于提高选择性和减少不需要的副反应至关重要。

探索使用CO2作为ODHP中的氧化剂，被认为是解决部分挑战的潜在方案，因为它可能提供更温和的氧化条件，并可能提高选择性。然而，这种方法还需要进一步的研究和开发才能实现商业化。
