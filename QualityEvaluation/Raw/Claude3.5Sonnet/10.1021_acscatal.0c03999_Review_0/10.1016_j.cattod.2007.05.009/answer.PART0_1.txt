[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."

[4] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[5] "In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Mismatch between supply and demand: Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) produce more ethylene than propylene, while propylene demand is growing faster.

2. Thermodynamic limitations: Traditional dehydrogenation processes face conversion constraints due to thermodynamic equilibrium.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking is a major issue in current processes, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Specifically targeting propylene production, potentially helping to meet growing demand.

2. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations through the use of oxygen, allowing for higher conversion.

3. Potentially reducing coking issues, as the presence of oxygen can help remove coke deposits.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges:

1. Catalyst effectiveness: The economic viability of ODHP depends on developing catalysts with high activity and selectivity.

2. Yield improvement: To be competitive with established technologies, ODHP needs to achieve better yields than current methods.

3. Safety concerns: Using oxygen as an oxidant introduces potential safety risks that need to be carefully managed.

4. Selectivity control: Avoiding over-oxidation of propane to CO2 is crucial for maximizing propylene yield.

While ODHP shows promise in addressing some key issues in propylene production, significant improvements in catalyst performance and process design are still needed for it to become a commercially viable alternative to current technologies.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 供需不匹配：蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）生产的乙烯比丙烯多，而丙烯需求增长更快。

2. 热力学限制：传统脱氢过程由于热力学平衡面临转化率限制。

3. 催化剂失活：结焦是当前过程中的一个主要问题，导致催化剂快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 专门针对丙烯生产，有潜力满足不断增长的需求。

2. 通过使用氧气克服热力学限制，实现更高的转化率。

3. 可能减少结焦问题，因为氧气的存在可以帮助去除积碳沉积物。

然而，ODHP面临自身的挑战：

1. 催化剂效率：ODHP的经济可行性取决于开发具有高活性和选择性的催化剂。

2. 产率提升：为了与成熟技术竞争，ODHP需要实现比当前方法更好的产率。

3. 安全concerns：使用氧气作为氧化剂会引入潜在的安全风险，需要谨慎管理。

4. 选择性控制：避免丙烷过度氧化成CO2对于最大化丙烯产率至关重要。

虽然ODHP在解决丙烯生产的一些关键问题上显示出前景，但在催化剂性能和工艺设计方面仍需要显著改进，才能成为商业上可行的替代技术。
