[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes  by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."

[4] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[5] "In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."

[6] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods and how oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues are:

1. Mismatch between supply and demand: Current production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) produce more ethylene than propylene, while propylene demand is growing faster, especially in Western Europe.

2. Thermodynamic limitations: Traditional dehydrogenation processes face thermodynamic constraints that limit alkane conversion.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking is a major problem in current methods, causing rapid catalyst deactivation.

ODHP addresses these issues by:

1. Targeting specific olefin production: ODHP can be tailored to produce propylene specifically, potentially addressing the supply-demand mismatch.

2. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations: As an oxidative process, ODHP is not subject to the same thermodynamic constraints as traditional dehydrogenation.

3. Reducing coking: The presence of oxygen in ODHP can help mitigate coking issues.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Catalyst effectiveness: The economic viability of ODHP depends heavily on developing catalysts with high activity and selectivity.

2. Yield requirements: To be competitive with established technologies, ODHP needs to achieve better yields than current methods.

3. Energy efficiency: As a more exothermal reaction, ODHP can lead to higher energy losses and fixed costs.

4. By-product formation: CO2 is a major by-product in ODHP, which can impact process economics and environmental considerations.

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP offers advantages in terms of overcoming thermodynamic limitations and potentially reducing coking. However, it also introduces challenges related to controlling selectivity, managing the exothermic nature of the reaction, and minimizing unwanted CO2 production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战以及丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)如何解决这些问题:

1. 供需不匹配：当前的生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解(FCC)生产的乙烯多于丙烯，而丙烯需求增长更快，尤其是在西欧。

2. 热力学限制：传统脱氢过程面临热力学约束，限制了烷烃转化。

3. 催化剂失活：结焦是当前方法的一个主要问题，导致催化剂快速失活。

ODHP通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 针对特定烯烃生产：ODHP可以定制为专门生产丙烯，有可能解决供需不匹配问题。

2. 克服热力学限制：作为氧化过程，ODHP不受与传统脱氢相同的热力学约束。

3. 减少结焦：ODHP中氧的存在可以帮助减轻结焦问题。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战：

1. 催化剂效能：ODHP的经济可行性高度依赖于开发具有高活性和选择性的催化剂。

2. 产率要求：为了与现有技术竞争，ODHP需要达到比当前方法更好的产率。

3. 能源效率：作为更放热的反应，ODHP可能导致更高的能量损失和固定成本。

4. 副产品形成：CO2是ODHP的主要副产品，可能影响过程经济性和环境考量。

在ODHP中选择氧气作为氧化剂在克服热力学限制和潜在减少结焦方面提供了优势。但它也带来了与控制选择性、管理反应放热性质以及最小化不必要的CO2产生相关的挑战。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Mismatch between supply and demand: Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) produce more ethylene than propylene, while propylene demand is growing faster.

2. Thermodynamic limitations: Traditional dehydrogenation processes face conversion constraints due to thermodynamic equilibrium.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking is a major issue in current processes, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Specifically targeting propylene production, potentially helping to meet growing demand.

2. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations through the use of oxygen, allowing for higher conversion.

3. Potentially reducing coking issues, as the presence of oxygen can help remove coke deposits.

However, ODHP faces its own challenges:

1. Catalyst effectiveness: The economic viability of ODHP depends on developing catalysts with high activity and selectivity.

2. Yield improvement: To be competitive with established technologies, ODHP needs to achieve better yields than current methods.

3. Safety concerns: Using oxygen as an oxidant introduces potential safety risks that need to be carefully managed.

4. Selectivity control: Avoiding over-oxidation of propane to CO2 is crucial for maximizing propylene yield.

While ODHP shows promise in addressing some key issues in propylene production, significant improvements in catalyst performance and process design are still needed for it to become a commercially viable alternative to current technologies.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Misalignment between production and demand: Steam cracking produces more ethylene than propylene, while demand for propylene is growing faster, especially in Western Europe.

2. Limited conversion in dehydrogenation: Thermodynamic constraints restrict alkane conversion in traditional dehydrogenation processes.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking causes rapid catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

4. Offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermic process, compared to endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking.

5. Providing process simplicity as an incentive for adoption.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant introduces safety concerns and potential over-oxidation of desired products. The development of effective catalysts, especially supported vanadium oxide catalysts, is crucial for addressing these challenges and optimizing ODHP performance.

3. Improving energy efficiency: ODHP is exothermic, unlike endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking processes.

4. Simplifying the process: ODHP offers a more straightforward approach to propylene production.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Higher energy losses: The more exothermic nature of ODHP results in greater energy losses compared to traditional methods.

2. CO2 production: The main by-product of ODHP is CO2, which contributes to higher fixed costs and environmental concerns.

3. Selectivity issues: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, ODHP typically faces challenges in achieving high selectivity to propylene due to the presence of oxygen, which can lead to over-oxidation.

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant brings both advantages (overcoming thermodynamic limitations, preventing coking) and challenges (CO2 production, potential over-oxidation) to the ODHP process. Balancing these factors is crucial for developing an economically viable and environmentally friendly propylene production method.

Limitations and challenges of ODHP, particularly regarding oxidant selection:
- When using oxygen as the oxidant, controlling selectivity is challenging due to the risk of over-oxidation.
- Alternative oxidants like N2O or CO2 are being explored, as they may offer better control over oxygen species reactivity or allow in-situ control of the active phase properties.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include finding the right balance between reactivity and selectivity, as oxygen can lead to undesired complete oxidation products. Catalyst design and reaction conditions must be carefully optimized to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.
