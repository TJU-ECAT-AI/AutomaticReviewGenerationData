[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes  by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."

[4] "The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."

[5] "In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."

[6] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods and how oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues are:

1. Mismatch between supply and demand: Current production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) produce more ethylene than propylene, while propylene demand is growing faster, especially in Western Europe.

2. Thermodynamic limitations: Traditional dehydrogenation processes face thermodynamic constraints that limit alkane conversion.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking is a major problem in current methods, causing rapid catalyst deactivation.

ODHP addresses these issues by:

1. Targeting specific olefin production: ODHP can be tailored to produce propylene specifically, potentially addressing the supply-demand mismatch.

2. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations: As an oxidative process, ODHP is not subject to the same thermodynamic constraints as traditional dehydrogenation.

3. Reducing coking: The presence of oxygen in ODHP can help mitigate coking issues.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Catalyst effectiveness: The economic viability of ODHP depends heavily on developing catalysts with high activity and selectivity.

2. Yield requirements: To be competitive with established technologies, ODHP needs to achieve better yields than current methods.

3. Energy efficiency: As a more exothermal reaction, ODHP can lead to higher energy losses and fixed costs.

4. By-product formation: CO2 is a major by-product in ODHP, which can impact process economics and environmental considerations.

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP offers advantages in terms of overcoming thermodynamic limitations and potentially reducing coking. However, it also introduces challenges related to controlling selectivity, managing the exothermic nature of the reaction, and minimizing unwanted CO2 production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战以及丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)如何解决这些问题:

1. 供需不匹配：当前的生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解(FCC)生产的乙烯多于丙烯，而丙烯需求增长更快，尤其是在西欧。

2. 热力学限制：传统脱氢过程面临热力学约束，限制了烷烃转化。

3. 催化剂失活：结焦是当前方法的一个主要问题，导致催化剂快速失活。

ODHP通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 针对特定烯烃生产：ODHP可以定制为专门生产丙烯，有可能解决供需不匹配问题。

2. 克服热力学限制：作为氧化过程，ODHP不受与传统脱氢相同的热力学约束。

3. 减少结焦：ODHP中氧的存在可以帮助减轻结焦问题。

然而，ODHP也带来了自身的一系列挑战：

1. 催化剂效能：ODHP的经济可行性高度依赖于开发具有高活性和选择性的催化剂。

2. 产率要求：为了与现有技术竞争，ODHP需要达到比当前方法更好的产率。

3. 能源效率：作为更放热的反应，ODHP可能导致更高的能量损失和固定成本。

4. 副产品形成：CO2是ODHP的主要副产品，可能影响过程经济性和环境考量。

在ODHP中选择氧气作为氧化剂在克服热力学限制和潜在减少结焦方面提供了优势。但它也带来了与控制选择性、管理反应放热性质以及最小化不必要的CO2产生相关的挑战。
