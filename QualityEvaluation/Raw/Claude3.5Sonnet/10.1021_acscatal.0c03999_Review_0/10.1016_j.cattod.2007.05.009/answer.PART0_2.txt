[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."

[4] "The improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."

[5] "Although it cannot be stated that this is the definitive picture of supported vanadium oxide catalysts, nevertheless these points represent a good starting point for both scientific debate and a deeper comprehension of this important class of ODH catalysts."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Misalignment between production and demand: Steam cracking produces more ethylene than propylene, while demand for propylene is growing faster, especially in Western Europe.

2. Limited conversion in dehydrogenation: Thermodynamic constraints restrict alkane conversion in traditional dehydrogenation processes.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking causes rapid catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation processes.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Focusing specifically on propylene production to meet growing demand.

2. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations of traditional dehydrogenation.

3. Potentially reducing coking issues associated with traditional dehydrogenation.

4. Offering improved energy efficiency as an exothermic process, compared to endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking.

5. Providing process simplicity as an incentive for adoption.

However, ODHP presents its own challenges, particularly in oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant introduces safety concerns and potential over-oxidation of desired products. The development of effective catalysts, especially supported vanadium oxide catalysts, is crucial for addressing these challenges and optimizing ODHP performance.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 生产与需求不匹配：蒸汽裂解生产的乙烯比丙烯多，而丙烯的需求增长更快，尤其是在西欧。

2. 脱氢过程中转化受限：传统脱氢过程中热力学限制了烷烃转化。

3. 催化剂失活：在脱氢过程中，积碳导致催化剂快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 专注于丙烯生产，以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 克服传统脱氢的热力学限制。

3. 可能减少与传统脱氢相关的积碳问题。

4. 作为放热过程，与吸热的脱氢和裂解相比，提供了更高的能源效率。

5. 提供过程简化作为采用的激励。

然而，ODHP也存在自身的挑战，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。使用氧气作为氧化剂会引入安全问题，并可能导致目标产物过度氧化。开发有效的催化剂，特别是负载型钒氧化物催化剂，对于解决这些挑战和优化ODHP性能至关重要。
