[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."

[4] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]. In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH:"

[5] "Indeed, the use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Mismatch between supply and demand: Steam cracking favors ethylene production, while propylene demand is growing faster, especially in Western Europe. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) produces smaller amounts of propylene.

2. Thermodynamic limitations: Traditional dehydrogenation processes face thermodynamic constraints that limit alkane conversion.

3. Coking and catalyst deactivation: A major problem in dehydrogenation is coking, which leads to rapid catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Providing a targeted method for propylene production to meet growing demand.

2. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations through the use of oxygen.

3. Potentially reducing coking issues due to the presence of oxygen.

Advantages of ODHP include:
- Exothermic reaction, improving energy efficiency compared to endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking.
- Process simplicity.

Limitations and challenges of ODHP, particularly regarding oxidant selection:
- When using oxygen as the oxidant, controlling selectivity is challenging due to the risk of over-oxidation.
- Alternative oxidants like N2O or CO2 are being explored, as they may offer better control over oxygen species reactivity or allow in-situ control of the active phase properties.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include finding the right balance between reactivity and selectivity, as oxygen can lead to undesired complete oxidation products. Catalyst design and reaction conditions must be carefully optimized to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 供需不匹配：蒸汽裂解更倾向于乙烯生产，而丙烯需求增长更快，尤其是在西欧。流化催化裂化(FCC)产生较少量的丙烯。

2. 热力学限制：传统脱氢过程面临热力学限制，制约烷烃转化。

3. 结焦和催化剂失活：脱氢过程中的一个主要问题是结焦，导致催化剂快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 提供针对性的丙烯生产方法，以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 通过使用氧气克服热力学限制。

3. 由于氧气的存在，可能减少结焦问题。

ODHP的优势包括：
- 放热反应，与吸热的脱氢和裂解相比，提高了能源效率。
- 工艺简单。

ODHP的局限性和挑战，特别是关于氧化剂选择：
- 使用氧气作为氧化剂时，由于过度氧化的风险，控制选择性具有挑战性。
- 正在探索N2O或CO2等替代氧化剂，因为它们可能提供更好的氧物种反应性控制，或允许对活性相进行原位控制。

在ODHP中使用氧气的具体挑战包括找到反应性和选择性之间的正确平衡，因为氧气可能导致不希望的完全氧化产物。必须仔细优化催化剂设计和反应条件，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化不需要的副反应。
