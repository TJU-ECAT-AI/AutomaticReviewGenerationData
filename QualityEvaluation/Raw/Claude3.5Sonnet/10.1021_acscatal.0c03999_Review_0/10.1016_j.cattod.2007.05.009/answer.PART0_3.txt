[1] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced. Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The use of O2 enables to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid catalyst regeneration."

[4] "The improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."

[5] "More exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:

1. Mismatch between supply and demand: Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) produce more ethylene than propylene, while propylene demand is growing faster.

2. Thermodynamic limitations: Traditional dehydrogenation processes face conversion constraints due to thermodynamics.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking is a major issue in dehydrogenation, leading to rapid catalyst deactivation.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:

1. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations: The use of oxygen allows higher conversions.

2. Avoiding catalyst regeneration: The presence of oxygen prevents coking and extends catalyst life.

3. Improving energy efficiency: ODHP is exothermic, unlike endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking processes.

4. Simplifying the process: ODHP offers a more straightforward approach to propylene production.

However, ODHP also presents its own set of challenges:

1. Higher energy losses: The more exothermic nature of ODHP results in greater energy losses compared to traditional methods.

2. CO2 production: The main by-product of ODHP is CO2, which contributes to higher fixed costs and environmental concerns.

3. Selectivity issues: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, ODHP typically faces challenges in achieving high selectivity to propylene due to the presence of oxygen, which can lead to over-oxidation.

The selection of oxygen as an oxidant brings both advantages (overcoming thermodynamic limitations, preventing coking) and challenges (CO2 production, potential over-oxidation) to the ODHP process. Balancing these factors is crucial for developing an economically viable and environmentally friendly propylene production method.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：

1. 供需不匹配：蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）生产的乙烯多于丙烯，而丙烯需求增长更快。

2. 热力学限制：传统脱氢过程由于热力学原因面临转化率限制。

3. 催化剂失活：结焦是脱氢过程中的一个主要问题，导致催化剂快速失活。

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：

1. 克服热力学限制：使用氧气允许更高的转化率。

2. 避免催化剂再生：氧气的存在防止结焦并延长催化剂寿命。

3. 提高能源效率：ODHP是放热反应，而脱氢和裂解过程是吸热的。

4. 简化工艺：ODHP提供了一种更直接的丙烯生产方法。

然而，ODHP也面临自身的一系列挑战：

1. 更高的能量损失：ODHP的更强放热性导致比传统方法更大的能量损失。

2. CO2生产：ODHP的主要副产品是CO2，这增加了固定成本并引发环境问题。

3. 选择性问题：虽然在引用中没有明确提到，但ODHP通常面临实现高丙烯选择性的挑战，因为氧气的存在可能导致过度氧化。

选择氧气作为氧化剂为ODHP过程带来了优势（克服热力学限制，防止结焦）和挑战（CO2生产，潜在的过度氧化）。平衡这些因素对于开发经济可行和环境友好的丙烯生产方法至关重要。
