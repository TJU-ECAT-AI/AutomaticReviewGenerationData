Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as
a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide. Characterization results reveal that after severe calcination
highly isolated FeOAl species are the only exposed iron sites detectable, which account for ca. 60%
of the total iron species in Fe-ZSM-5. Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ
DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the for-
mation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with
high selectivity. The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and
the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes. The accumulation rate and the specific
constitution of alkylbenzenes are found to depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous
oxide: lower N2O/C3H8 ratios result in formation of aromatics with smaller kinetic diameter, which are
accumulated at a lower rate. This leads to lower deactivation rates and longer catalyst lifetimes. Remark-
ably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat
1 h1 and a propylene production rate of
ca. 6 mmol gcat
1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

1. Introduction
Light olefins are very important components for the petrochem-
ical industry with increasing market demands in recent years. The
oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes provides a promising
route to produce light olefins, and has therefore been widely stud-
ied. During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with
dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by
over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in
low olefin selectivity and olefin yield [1]. Recently, it has been pro-
posed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the
oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted con-
siderable attention [213]. Iron-zeolites have been developed as
unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes
with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to
propylene (ODHP).
Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with
N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before
the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction
mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet. In the past
decades, activation and conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeo-
lites have been extensively investigated [1419]. In the case of
the ODHP with N2O, the presence of the propane reductant in
the reaction system makes the conversion of nitrous oxide on
iron-zeolites much more complicated. For the design of effective
catalysts, it is important to know the different pathways for the
formation of the dehydrogenation product propylene and of by-
products. Another essential problem is the deactivation mecha-
nism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is
a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter
whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant. In a general
sense, formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are
responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the specification of
coke and its origin are not fully understood. Accordingly, there is
no effective means to prevent the deposition of coke and to
increase the catalyst lifetime in the ODHP with N2O.
In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state
exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found
to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a
severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a
high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20].

constitution and the almost complete absence of Brnsted acid
sites make this Fe-ZSM-5 material an ideal model catalyst for
studying the ODHP with N2O. The present work aims to present
a detailed study on this reaction over Fe-ZSM-5, with emphasis
on the reaction and deactivation mechanism.
2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation
ZSM-5 zeolite in its H-form (Sinopec, Si/Al = 24, Fe impurity:
60 ppm) was employed as host for iron species. Fe-ZSM-5 was
prepared by solid-state exchange using ferrocene as iron source
[21]. In a typical experiment, ca. 3 g of the zeolite was placed in
a quartz reaction chamber connected to a vacuum line and treated
at 5 * 102 Pa and 573 K for 4 h. After cooling to 323 K, the reaction
chamber was transferred into a glove box and 0.5 g ferrocene was
dumped onto the dried zeolite. Subsequently, the chamber was
heated to 423 K and kept at this temperature under vacuum for
24 h to insure the complete surface reaction between ferrocene
and the zeolite Brnsted acid sites. The resulting solid was calcined
in flowing air (H2O level of 200 ppm) at 1073 K for 6 h. It will be
denoted as Fe-ZSM-5-G. For reference, Fe-ZSM-5 was also prepared
by conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as iron pre-
cursor. In a typical experiment, 1 g zeolite sample was mechani-
cally mixed with 0.5 g FeCl3 in the glove box and the mixture
was placed in a sealed reactor. The reactor was heated to 573 K
at 10 K/min and kept at this temperature for 2 h. The resulting
solid was thoroughly washed with deionized water, dried at
353 K overnight and calcined in flowing air at 1073 K for 6 h. The
product will be denoted as Fe-ZSM-5-E.
2.2. Sample characterization
FTIR spectra in diffuse reflection mode, i.e. DRIFTS, with the
probe molecule NO were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 spec-
trometer (64 scans, resolution  2 cm1). A self-supporting pellet
made of the catalyst sample was placed in the reaction chamber
(Harrick, Praying Mantis CHC-CHA-3) and pretreated in flowing
He at 773 K for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature in flowing
He, the He stream was switched to 1%NO/He and a series of
time-dependent DRIFT spectra were recorded, which will be
reported in terms of the KubelkaMunk (KM) function below.
Si, Al and Fe contents in the samples were analyzed by a Perkin
Elmer Optima 2000 inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometer (ICP-OES). The samples were dissolved in hot aqua
regia with the addition of several drops of HF. Before ICP analysis,
the excess acid in solution was removed by heating at constant
temperature of 453 K.
The amounts of organic compounds deposited on Fe-ZSM-5 cat-
alyst after ODHP with N2O were analyzed by thermogravimetry
(TG) on a Setram Setsys 16/18 thermogravimetric analyzer. In a
typical measurement, 0.1 g of Fe-ZSM-5 after 400 min time-
on-stream in ODHP was pretreated at 373 K in an Al2O3 crucible
to remove the physisorbed water/organic and then heated to
1273 K at a constant rate of 10 K min1 and under flowing syn-
thetic air of 30 mL min1.
The

occluded
in
the
channels of Fe-ZSM-5-G catalyst after ODHP with N2O was ana-
lyzed by gas chromatography with mass-spectrometric detection
(GCMS). Typically, 0.3 g catalyst sample after reaction was care-
fully dissolved in 10 mL 1 M HF solution. The solution was treated
with 10 mL CH2Cl2 to extract the organic compounds and the resid-
ual water was removed by the addition of sufficient sodium sulfate
solid. Then, 1.0 lL CH2Cl2 organic extract was analyzed by GCMS
(Agilent 7890A/5975 MSD) with a DB-5 MS column (30 m,
0.25 mm i.d., stationary phase thickness 0.25 lm). The following
temperature program was employed: isothermal at 313 K for
6 min, heating to 553 K with a rate of 10 K min1, and isothermal
at 553 K for 10 min.
2.3. Isothermal transient response experiments
Isothermal transient response experiments were performed in a
quartz plug-flow reactor at atmosphere pressure. Pure He was fed
to the reactor loaded with a Fe-ZSM-5 sample (pretreated in flow-
ing He at 773 K for 1 h) at 20 mL min1 and transient pulses of pure
nitrous oxide (100 lL per pulse) were injected into the feed stream
via an electronic six-port valve. The reactor outlet was on-line ana-
lyzed by using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Omnistar
QIC 20).
2.4. Temperature-programmed experiments
Temperature-programmed desorption
and surface
reaction
(abbreviated as TPD and TPSR, respectively) experiments were per-
formed in a quartz plug-flow reactor at atmospheric pressure. Gen-
erally, the inlet gas mixture was fed to the reactor through four
mass-flow controllers (Seven Star D-07) and the reactor outlet
was analyzed by using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) in
the multiple-ion detection mode. The following main mass frag-
ments (m/e) were recorded: 4 (He), 18 (H2O), 28 (N2, N2O, CO),
30 (N2O), 32 (O2), 40 (Ar), 43 (C3H6), 44 (N2O, CO2), 45 (C3H8), 56
(acrolein), 58 (allyl alcohol), 91 (toluene, MB), 105 (xylene, DMB)
and 106 (ethylbenzene, EB). The presence of NO and NO2 under
our reaction conditions could be excluded according to the results
from a chemiluminescence NOx analyzer (Ecotech EC 9841).
Calibration was carried out with mixtures of known gas composi-
tion. If more than one component contributed to a mass fragment,
a second mass was used to distinguish the different components.
For TPSR, the catalyst sample was pretreated in He at 773 K for
1 h and cooled to 473 K in flowing He. The catalyst was then con-
tacted with the reactant gas mixture (N2O/He or N2O/C3H8/He) for
30 min, subsequently TPSR was performed from 473 to 873 K at a
heating rate of 10 K min1 and the reaction outlet was monitored
by an on-line MS. For TPD, the catalyst sample was also pretreated
in He at 773 K for 1 h and cooled to 473 K in flowing He. After the
saturated adsorption of N2O/He or O2/He at 473 K, the sample was
cooled to 373 K and purged with He for 30 min. Finally, TPD was
performed in flowing He from 473 to 873 K at a heating rate of
10 K min1 and the outlet was monitored by on-line MS.
2.5. In situ DRIFTS study
In situ DRIFT spectra were recorded on the Bruker Tensor 27
spectrometer, equipped with a liquid N2 cooled MCT detector.
The catalyst samples of ca. 25 mg were finely ground and placed
in the reaction chamber (Harrick, Praying Mantis CHC-CHA-3).
Prior to each experiment, the sample was pretreated in He at
773 K for 1 h and cooled to the desired temperature for taking a
