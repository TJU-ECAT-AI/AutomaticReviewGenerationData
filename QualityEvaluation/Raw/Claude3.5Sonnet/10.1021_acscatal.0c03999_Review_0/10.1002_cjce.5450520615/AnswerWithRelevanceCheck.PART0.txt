          [1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."

          [2] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."

          [3] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."

          [4] "Additionally, dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking of the feed."

          [5] "The LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 system with twice the stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for applicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."

          While the literature doesn't directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a detailed comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other methods, it offers insights into challenges and potential solutions for oxidative dehydrogenation processes in general:

          1. Heat management: Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are highly exothermic, which can lead to hot spots, cracking, and burning of the feed and products. This is particularly problematic for higher paraffins.

          2. Catalyst limitations: Finding effective catalysts that can withstand high temperatures while promoting the desired reaction is challenging, especially for higher paraffins.

          3. Selectivity issues: Undesired side reactions like cracking and burning can reduce selectivity to the desired olefin products.

          The use of molten salts as reaction media is presented as a solution to address these challenges:

          1. Improved heat dissipation: Molten salts have excellent heat transfer properties, allowing for rapid dissipation of reaction heat.

          2. Prevention of hot spots: The uniform temperature distribution in molten salts helps prevent localized overheating.

          3. Potential catalytic activity: Some molten salt systems, particularly those containing transition metal salts, can act as catalysts for the reaction.

          The study demonstrates that a molten salt system (LiCl/KCl + MnCl2) was effective for various dehydrogenation reactions, including propane to propylene. This indicates that such a system might address some of the challenges in propylene production, particularly in terms of heat management and catalyst efficiency.

          However, the document doesn't specifically discuss ODHP using oxygen as an oxidant or its particular advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen/helium mixtures is mentioned, suggesting that oxidant selection is an important consideration in these processes, but the specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not explicitly addressed in this text.

          虽然文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有详细比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法，但它为氧化脱氢过程的一般挑战和潜在解决方案提供了见解：

          1. 热量管理：氧化脱氢反应是高度放热的，这可能导致热点、裂解和进料及产品的燃烧。这对于高级烷烃尤其是个问题。

          2. 催化剂限制：找到能够承受高温同时促进所需反应的有效催化剂是具有挑战性的，特别是对于高级烷烃。

          3. 选择性问题：不需要的副反应如裂解和燃烧可能会降低对所需烯烃产品的选择性。

          使用熔融盐作为反应介质被提出作为解决这些挑战的方案：

          1. 改善热量散发：熔融盐具有优良的传热性能，可以快速散发反应热。

          2. 防止热点：熔融盐中均匀的温度分布有助于防止局部过热。

          3. 潜在的催化活性：一些熔融盐系统，特别是含有过渡金属盐的系统，可以作为反应的催化剂。

          研究表明，一种熔融盐系统（LiCl/KCl + MnCl2）对各种脱氢反应都有效，包括丙烷到丙烯的转化。这表明这种系统可能解决了丙烯生产中的一些挑战，特别是在热量管理和催化剂效率方面。

          然而，该文档并未具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP或其特定的优势和局限性。文中提到了氧气/氦气混合物的使用，这表明氧化剂的选择在这些过程中是一个重要考虑因素，但本文并未明确讨论使用氧气相关的具体挑战。
