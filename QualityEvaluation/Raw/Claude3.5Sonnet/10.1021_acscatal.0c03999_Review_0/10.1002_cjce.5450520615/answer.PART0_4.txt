[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."

[2] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."

[3] "Additionally, dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking of the feed."

[4] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."

The literature does not specifically address current propylene production methods or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it does discuss challenges and solutions for oxidative dehydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, which may be relevant:

1. Heat management: Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are highly exothermic, which can lead to hot spots, cracking, and burning of the feed and products. 

2. Catalyst limitations: For higher paraffins like butane, finding effective catalysts that can withstand high temperatures while promoting the desired reaction is challenging.

3. Selectivity issues: Undesired side reactions like cracking and burning can reduce selectivity to the desired olefin products.

The use of molten salts as reaction media is presented as a solution to address these challenges:

1. Improved heat dissipation: Molten salts have excellent heat transfer properties, allowing for rapid dissipation of reaction heat.

2. Prevention of hot spots: The uniform temperature distribution in molten salts helps prevent localized overheating.

3. Potential catalytic activity: Some molten salt systems, particularly those containing transition metal salts, can act as catalysts for the reaction.

While the document doesn't specifically discuss oxidant selection for ODHP, it mentions the use of oxygen (mixed with helium to simulate air) as an oxidant in the experimental setup. The challenges associated with using oxygen are not explicitly addressed in this text.

该文献并未具体讨论当前的丙烯生产方法或丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)。然而，它确实讨论了其他碳氢化合物氧化脱氢的挑战和解决方案，这可能具有相关性：

1. 热量管理：氧化脱氢反应是高度放热的，这可能导致热点、裂解和进料及产品的燃烧。

2. 催化剂限制：对于像丁烷这样的高级烷烃，找到能够承受高温同时促进所需反应的有效催化剂是具有挑战性的。

3. 选择性问题：不需要的副反应如裂解和燃烧可能会降低对所需烯烃产品的选择性。

使用熔融盐作为反应介质被提出作为解决这些挑战的方案：

1. 改善热量散发：熔融盐具有优良的传热性能，可以快速散发反应热。

2. 防止热点：熔融盐中均匀的温度分布有助于防止局部过热。

3. 潜在的催化活性：一些熔融盐系统，特别是含有过渡金属盐的系统，可以作为反应的催化剂。

虽然该文档没有具体讨论ODHP的氧化剂选择，但它提到在实验设置中使用氧气（与氦混合以模拟空气）作为氧化剂。本文中并未明确讨论使用氧气相关的挑战。
