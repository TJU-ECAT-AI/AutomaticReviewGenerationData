[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."

[2] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."

[3] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."

[4] "The LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 system with twice the stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for applicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or discuss the specific advantages and limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using oxygen as an oxidant. However, we can infer some insights from the information provided about related dehydrogenation processes:

1. Heat management: The text mentions that high temperatures can cause cracking and burning of feedstocks, particularly for higher paraffins. This suggests that heat management is a significant challenge in dehydrogenation processes.

2. Catalyst efficiency: The paper discusses the search for efficient catalysts that can promote the reaction without causing unwanted side reactions.

3. Feedstock utilization: The study explores ways to efficiently convert more saturated feedstocks into olefins and diolefins, which could be relevant to propylene production from propane.

4. Reaction medium: The use of molten salts is proposed as a solution to heat transfer issues, suggesting that traditional reaction media may have limitations in managing the exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

While the paper doesn't specifically discuss ODHP or the use of oxygen as an oxidant, it does mention the use of oxygen/helium mixtures in place of air for analytical convenience. This suggests that oxidant selection is an important consideration in these processes.

The study demonstrates that the molten salt system developed (LiCl/KCl + MnCl2) was effective for various dehydrogenation reactions, including propane to propylene. This indicates that such a system might address some of the challenges in propylene production, particularly in terms of heat management and catalyst efficiency.

However, without more specific information on ODHP using oxygen, it's not possible to comment on its particular advantages or limitations compared to the hydrogen sulfide promoted process described in the paper.

虽然文献没有直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，或者探讨使用氧气作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的具体优势和限制，但我们可以从文中提供的相关脱氢过程信息中推断一些见解：

1. 热量管理：文中提到高温会导致原料裂解和燃烧，特别是对于较高级的烷烃。这表明热量管理是脱氢过程中的一个重要挑战。

2. 催化剂效率：论文讨论了寻找能促进反应而不引起不必要副反应的高效催化剂。

3. 原料利用：研究探索了将饱和度较高的原料高效转化为烯烃和二烯烃的方法，这可能与从丙烷生产丙烯有关。

4. 反应介质：提出使用熔融盐作为解决热传递问题的方案，表明传统反应介质在管理氧化脱氢反应的放热性质方面可能存在局限性。

虽然论文没有具体讨论ODHP或使用氧气作为氧化剂，但确实提到了出于分析方便而使用氧气/氦气混合物代替空气。这表明氧化剂的选择在这些过程中是一个重要考虑因素。

研究表明，所开发的熔融盐系统（LiCl/KCl + MnCl2）对各种脱氢反应都有效，包括丙烷到丙烯的转化。这表明这种系统可能解决了丙烯生产中的一些挑战，特别是在热量管理和催化剂效率方面。

然而，由于缺乏使用氧气进行ODHP的更具体信息，无法评论其相对于文中描述的硫化氢促进过程的特定优势或局限性。
