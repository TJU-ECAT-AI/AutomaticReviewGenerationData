[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation has been carried out in molten salts by Phillips Petroleum Co. on C4 and higher paraffins, but in their work an unpromoted system was used and very low yields of olefinic products were obtained."

[2] "The LiClIKCl + MnCll system with twice the stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for applicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."

[3] "Thus, 75% yield of ethylene was obtained compared to 77% on solid catalyst'z', 82% butadiene was obtained from butene as compared to 60% on solid catalyst"' and 72% styrene was obtained, compared to 76% on solid atalyst'."

The document does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a detailed comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other methods. However, it does mention some relevant information about oxidative dehydrogenation in general.

The paper discusses a molten salt system for oxidative dehydrogenation that shows improved performance compared to solid catalysts for various hydrocarbon conversions, including propane to propylene. This system uses hydrogen sulfide as a promoter and achieves higher yields than unpromoted systems or solid catalysts in some cases. 

The advantages of this molten salt system include:
1. Higher yields for some reactions compared to solid catalysts
2. Ability to handle multiple types of dehydrogenation reactions
3. Improved heat dissipation, reducing hydrocarbon degradation

However, the document does not specifically discuss oxidant selection challenges or limitations of ODHP. It focuses on the use of hydrogen sulfide as a promoter rather than discussing oxygen as the primary oxidant.

The paper does not provide enough information to fully address the question's focus on current propylene production challenges or a comprehensive comparison of ODHP to other methods.

该文档并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有详细比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实提到了一些关于氧化脱氢的相关信息。

该论文讨论了一种用于氧化脱氢的熔盐系统，该系统在各种碳氢化合物转化方面表现优于固体催化剂，包括丙烷到丙烯的转化。这个系统使用硫化氢作为促进剂，在某些情况下比未促进的系统或固体催化剂获得更高的产率。

这种熔盐系统的优势包括：
1. 某些反应比固体催化剂获得更高的产率
2. 能够处理多种类型的脱氢反应
3. 改善热量散失，减少碳氢化合物的降解

然而，该文档并未特别讨论氧化剂选择的挑战或ODHP的局限性。它主要关注硫化氢作为促进剂的使用，而不是讨论氧气作为主要氧化剂。

这篇论文没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于当前丙烯生产挑战的问题，或对ODHP与其他方法进行全面比较。
