[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation has been carried out in molten salts by Phillips Petroleum Co. on C4 and higher paraffins, but in their work an unpromoted system was used and very low yields of olefinic products were obtained."

[2] "The LiClIKCl + MnCll system with twice the stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for applicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."

[3] "Thus, 75% yield of ethylene was obtained compared to 77% on solid catalyst'z', 82% butadiene was obtained from butene as compared to 60% on solid catalyst"' and 72% styrene was obtained, compared to 76% on solid atalyst'."

The document does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a detailed comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to other methods. However, it does mention some relevant information about oxidative dehydrogenation in general.

The paper discusses a molten salt system for oxidative dehydrogenation that shows improved performance compared to solid catalysts for various hydrocarbon conversions, including propane to propylene. This system uses hydrogen sulfide as a promoter and achieves higher yields than unpromoted systems or solid catalysts in some cases. 

The advantages of this molten salt system include:
1. Higher yields for some reactions compared to solid catalysts
2. Ability to handle multiple types of dehydrogenation reactions
3. Improved heat dissipation, reducing hydrocarbon degradation

However, the document does not specifically discuss oxidant selection challenges or limitations of ODHP. It focuses on the use of hydrogen sulfide as a promoter rather than discussing oxygen as the primary oxidant.

The paper does not provide enough information to fully address the question's focus on current propylene production challenges or a comprehensive comparison of ODHP to other methods.

该文档并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有详细比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实提到了一些关于氧化脱氢的相关信息。

该论文讨论了一种用于氧化脱氢的熔盐系统，该系统在各种碳氢化合物转化方面表现优于固体催化剂，包括丙烷到丙烯的转化。这个系统使用硫化氢作为促进剂，在某些情况下比未促进的系统或固体催化剂获得更高的产率。

这种熔盐系统的优势包括：
1. 某些反应比固体催化剂获得更高的产率
2. 能够处理多种类型的脱氢反应
3. 改善热量散失，减少碳氢化合物的降解

然而，该文档并未特别讨论氧化剂选择的挑战或ODHP的局限性。它主要关注硫化氢作为促进剂的使用，而不是讨论氧气作为主要氧化剂。

这篇论文没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于当前丙烯生产挑战的问题，或对ODHP与其他方法进行全面比较。

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."

[2] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."

[3] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."

[4] "The LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 system with twice the stoichiometric amount of sulphur was tested for applicability to other dehydrogenation reactions, namely ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or discuss the specific advantages and limitations of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using oxygen as an oxidant. However, we can infer some insights from the information provided about related dehydrogenation processes:

1. Heat management: The text mentions that high temperatures can cause cracking and burning of feedstocks, particularly for higher paraffins. This suggests that heat management is a significant challenge in dehydrogenation processes.

2. Catalyst efficiency: The paper discusses the search for efficient catalysts that can promote the reaction without causing unwanted side reactions.

3. Feedstock utilization: The study explores ways to efficiently convert more saturated feedstocks into olefins and diolefins, which could be relevant to propylene production from propane.

4. Reaction medium: The use of molten salts is proposed as a solution to heat transfer issues, suggesting that traditional reaction media may have limitations in managing the exothermic nature of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

While the paper doesn't specifically discuss ODHP or the use of oxygen as an oxidant, it does mention the use of oxygen/helium mixtures in place of air for analytical convenience. This suggests that oxidant selection is an important consideration in these processes.

The study demonstrates that the molten salt system developed (LiCl/KCl + MnCl2) was effective for various dehydrogenation reactions, including propane to propylene. This indicates that such a system might address some of the challenges in propylene production, particularly in terms of heat management and catalyst efficiency.

However, without more specific information on ODHP using oxygen, it's not possible to comment on its particular advantages or limitations compared to the hydrogen sulfide promoted process described in the paper.

虽然文献没有直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，或者探讨使用氧气作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的具体优势和限制，但我们可以从文中提供的相关脱氢过程信息中推断一些见解：

1. 热量管理：文中提到高温会导致原料裂解和燃烧，特别是对于较高级的烷烃。这表明热量管理是脱氢过程中的一个重要挑战。

2. 催化剂效率：论文讨论了寻找能促进反应而不引起不必要副反应的高效催化剂。

3. 原料利用：研究探索了将饱和度较高的原料高效转化为烯烃和二烯烃的方法，这可能与从丙烷生产丙烯有关。

4. 反应介质：提出使用熔融盐作为解决热传递问题的方案，表明传统反应介质在管理氧化脱氢反应的放热性质方面可能存在局限性。

虽然论文没有具体讨论ODHP或使用氧气作为氧化剂，但确实提到了出于分析方便而使用氧气/氦气混合物代替空气。这表明氧化剂的选择在这些过程中是一个重要考虑因素。

研究表明，所开发的熔融盐系统（LiCl/KCl + MnCl2）对各种脱氢反应都有效，包括丙烷到丙烯的转化。这表明这种系统可能解决了丙烯生产中的一些挑战，特别是在热量管理和催化剂效率方面。

然而，由于缺乏使用氧气进行ODHP的更具体信息，无法评论其相对于文中描述的硫化氢促进过程的特定优势或局限性。

The literature does not specifically address current propylene production methods or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). However, it does discuss challenges and solutions for oxidative dehydrogenation of other hydrocarbons, which may be relevant:

1. Heat management: Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are highly exothermic, which can lead to hot spots, cracking, and burning of the feed and products. 

2. Catalyst limitations: For higher paraffins like butane, finding effective catalysts that can withstand high temperatures while promoting the desired reaction is challenging.

3. Selectivity issues: Undesired side reactions like cracking and burning can reduce selectivity to the desired olefin products.

The use of molten salts as reaction media is presented as a solution to address these challenges:

1. Improved heat dissipation: Molten salts have excellent heat transfer properties, allowing for rapid dissipation of reaction heat.

2. Prevention of hot spots: The uniform temperature distribution in molten salts helps prevent localized overheating.

3. Potential catalytic activity: Some molten salt systems, particularly those containing transition metal salts, can act as catalysts for the reaction.

While the document doesn't specifically discuss oxidant selection for ODHP, it mentions the use of oxygen (mixed with helium to simulate air) as an oxidant in the experimental setup. The challenges associated with using oxygen are not explicitly addressed in this text.

该文献并未具体讨论当前的丙烯生产方法或丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)。然而，它确实讨论了其他碳氢化合物氧化脱氢的挑战和解决方案，这可能具有相关性：

1. 热量管理：氧化脱氢反应是高度放热的，这可能导致热点、裂解和进料及产品的燃烧。

2. 催化剂限制：对于像丁烷这样的高级烷烃，找到能够承受高温同时促进所需反应的有效催化剂是具有挑战性的。

3. 选择性问题：不需要的副反应如裂解和燃烧可能会降低对所需烯烃产品的选择性。

使用熔融盐作为反应介质被提出作为解决这些挑战的方案：

1. 改善热量散发：熔融盐具有优良的传热性能，可以快速散发反应热。

2. 防止热点：熔融盐中均匀的温度分布有助于防止局部过热。

3. 潜在的催化活性：一些熔融盐系统，特别是含有过渡金属盐的系统，可以作为反应的催化剂。

虽然该文档没有具体讨论ODHP的氧化剂选择，但它提到在实验设置中使用氧气（与氦混合以模拟空气）作为氧化剂。本文中并未明确讨论使用氧气相关的挑战。
