[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."

[3] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[4] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction;"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the study focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using SO2 as an oxidant, which suggests that this method is being explored to address certain limitations in existing processes.

ODHP addresses the equilibrium limitation of conventional dehydrogenation reactions. By using an oxidant (SO2 in this case), the reaction can overcome thermodynamic constraints, potentially allowing for higher conversions.

Advantages of ODHP with SO2 include:
1. Increased propane conversion compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. The ability to operate at higher temperatures, which can lead to higher conversions.

Limitations of this specific ODHP process include:
1. Lower selectivity to propylene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. The formation of unwanted byproducts such as H2S, H2O, and potentially CO2.

The study does not directly compare SO2 with oxygen as an oxidant, so the specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not addressed in this literature. However, the use of SO2 presents its own challenges, particularly in terms of maintaining high selectivity to propylene.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在给定的文献中并未明确说明。然而，该研究关注使用SO2作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP），这表明正在探索这种方法来解决现有工艺中的某些限制。

ODHP解决了传统脱氢反应的平衡限制。通过使用氧化剂（在本例中为SO2），反应可以克服热力学限制，可能允许更高的转化率。

使用SO2进行ODHP的优点包括：
1. 与非氧化脱氢相比，丙烷转化率增加。
2. 能够在更高温度下操作，这可能导致更高的转化率。

这种特定ODHP过程的限制包括：
1. 与非氧化脱氢相比，丙烯的选择性较低。
2. 形成不需要的副产品，如H2S、H2O，可能还有CO2。

该研究没有直接比较SO2与氧气作为氧化剂的情况，因此没有涉及使用氧气相关的具体挑战。然而，使用SO2也带来了自身的挑战，特别是在维持高丙烯选择性方面。
