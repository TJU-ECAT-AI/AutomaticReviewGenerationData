[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."

[3] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[4] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction"

[5] "the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include equilibrium limitations and high energy requirements. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by using an oxidant (in this case, SO2) to shift the equilibrium and potentially lower energy requirements.

Advantages of ODHP include increased propane conversion and the ability to overcome equilibrium limitations. However, it also presents limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The study shows that while SO2 addition increases propane conversion, it significantly reduces selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

The choice of oxidant is crucial in ODHP. This study focuses on SO2 as the oxidant, which presents its own set of challenges. While SO2 can increase conversion, it may also lead to unwanted side reactions, such as the oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, reducing overall selectivity.

The study does not specifically address the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. However, the use of SO2 as an alternative oxidant suggests that there may be difficulties or limitations with using oxygen directly in this process.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括平衡限制和高能耗要求。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过使用氧化剂(在本例中为SO2)来改变平衡并可能降低能源需求，从而解决这些问题。

ODHP的优势包括增加丙烷转化率和克服平衡限制的能力。然而，它也存在局限性，特别是在选择性方面。研究表明，虽然添加SO2可以增加丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，它显著降低了对丙烯的选择性。

在ODHP中，氧化剂的选择至关重要。这项研究主要关注SO2作为氧化剂，这带来了一系列特有的挑战。虽然SO2可以提高转化率，但它也可能导致不需要的副反应，如丙烯被氧化成水和二氧化碳，从而降低整体选择性。

该研究没有具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战。然而，使用SO2作为替代氧化剂表明，在这个过程中直接使用氧气可能存在一些困难或限制。
