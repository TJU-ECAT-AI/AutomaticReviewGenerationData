[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."

[3] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other methods. However, it does offer some insights into the ODHP process using SO2 as an oxidant:

1. ODHP using SO2 is presented as an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in propane dehydrogenation.

2. The reaction is endothermic, and the equilibrium constant increases with temperature, suggesting that higher temperatures favor the formation of propylene.

3. While adding SO2 to the feed increases propane conversion, it significantly reduces selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

4. The study does not discuss the use of oxygen as an oxidant or compare it to SO2, so the specific challenges associated with using oxygen cannot be addressed based on this literature.

5. The research indicates that ODHP with SO2 presents its own limitations, particularly in terms of reduced selectivity to propylene, which could be a significant drawback for industrial applications.

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about primary challenges in current propylene production methods or to make a comprehensive comparison between ODHP and other methods.

这篇文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用SO2作为氧化剂的ODHP过程的见解：

1. 使用SO2的ODHP被提出作为克服丙烷脱氢平衡限制的一种替代方法。

2. 该反应是吸热的，平衡常数随温度升高而增加，这表明较高的温度有利于丙烯的形成。

3. 虽然在进料中添加SO2可以增加丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，它显著降低了丙烯的选择性。

4. 这项研究没有讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂或将其与SO2进行比较，因此无法根据这篇文献讨论使用氧气相关的具体挑战。

5. 研究表明，使用SO2的ODHP存在其自身的局限性，特别是在丙烯选择性降低方面，这可能是工业应用的一个重大缺点。

这篇文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，或对ODHP与其他方法进行全面比较。
