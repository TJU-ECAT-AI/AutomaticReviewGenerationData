The literature does not directly address the primary challenges in current propylene production methods or provide a comprehensive comparison of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with other methods. However, it does offer some insights into the ODHP process using SO2 as an oxidant:

1. ODHP using SO2 is presented as an alternative to overcome equilibrium limitations in propane dehydrogenation.

2. The reaction is endothermic, and the equilibrium constant increases with temperature, suggesting that higher temperatures favor the formation of propylene.

3. While adding SO2 to the feed increases propane conversion, it significantly reduces selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

4. The study does not discuss the use of oxygen as an oxidant or compare it to SO2, so the specific challenges associated with using oxygen cannot be addressed based on this literature.

5. The research indicates that ODHP with SO2 presents its own limitations, particularly in terms of reduced selectivity to propylene, which could be a significant drawback for industrial applications.

The literature does not provide enough information to fully answer the question about primary challenges in current propylene production methods or to make a comprehensive comparison between ODHP and other methods.

这篇文献并未直接讨论当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，也没有全面比较丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)与其他方法。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用SO2作为氧化剂的ODHP过程的见解：

1. 使用SO2的ODHP被提出作为克服丙烷脱氢平衡限制的一种替代方法。

2. 该反应是吸热的，平衡常数随温度升高而增加，这表明较高的温度有利于丙烯的形成。

3. 虽然在进料中添加SO2可以增加丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，它显著降低了丙烯的选择性。

4. 这项研究没有讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂或将其与SO2进行比较，因此无法根据这篇文献讨论使用氧气相关的具体挑战。

5. 研究表明，使用SO2的ODHP存在其自身的局限性，特别是在丙烯选择性降低方面，这可能是工业应用的一个重大缺点。

这篇文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，或对ODHP与其他方法进行全面比较。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include equilibrium limitations and high energy requirements. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by using an oxidant (in this case, SO2) to shift the equilibrium and potentially lower energy requirements.

Advantages of ODHP include increased propane conversion and the ability to overcome equilibrium limitations. However, it also presents limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The study shows that while SO2 addition increases propane conversion, it significantly reduces selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

The choice of oxidant is crucial in ODHP. This study focuses on SO2 as the oxidant, which presents its own set of challenges. While SO2 can increase conversion, it may also lead to unwanted side reactions, such as the oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, reducing overall selectivity.

The study does not specifically address the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. However, the use of SO2 as an alternative oxidant suggests that there may be difficulties or limitations with using oxygen directly in this process.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括平衡限制和高能耗要求。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过使用氧化剂(在本例中为SO2)来改变平衡并可能降低能源需求，从而解决这些问题。

ODHP的优势包括增加丙烷转化率和克服平衡限制的能力。然而，它也存在局限性，特别是在选择性方面。研究表明，虽然添加SO2可以增加丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，它显著降低了对丙烯的选择性。

在ODHP中，氧化剂的选择至关重要。这项研究主要关注SO2作为氧化剂，这带来了一系列特有的挑战。虽然SO2可以提高转化率，但它也可能导致不需要的副反应，如丙烯被氧化成水和二氧化碳，从而降低整体选择性。

该研究没有具体讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战。然而，使用SO2作为替代氧化剂表明，在这个过程中直接使用氧气可能存在一些困难或限制。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the study focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using SO2 as an oxidant, which suggests that this approach is being explored to address certain limitations in existing methods.

ODHP addresses the equilibrium limitation of the conventional dehydrogenation reaction. By using SO2 as an oxidant, it shifts the equilibrium towards the product side, increasing propane conversion. This is evident from the increased conversion rates when SO2 is added to the feed.

Advantages of ODHP with SO2 include:
1. Increased propane conversion
2. Overcoming equilibrium limitations
3. Potential for high-temperature operations with increased selectivity per pass (when using reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst)

Limitations and challenges of this method include:
1. Lower selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed
2. Potential oxidation of propylene by SO2, leading to unwanted products like water and carbon dioxide
3. The need for catalyst regeneration due to carbon deposition

The study does not discuss the use of oxygen as an oxidant, focusing instead on SO2. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not addressed in this literature.

It's important to note that while this method shows promise, the authors state it is premature to fully understand the mechanisms involved, indicating that further research is needed to optimize the process and overcome its current limitations.

该文献没有明确指出当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。然而，研究重点关注使用SO2作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP），这表明正在探索这种方法来解决现有方法的某些局限性。

ODHP解决了常规脱氢反应的平衡限制。通过使用SO2作为氧化剂，它将平衡向产物一侧移动，增加了丙烷转化率。这从向进料中添加SO2时转化率的增加可以看出。

使用SO2进行ODHP的优势包括：
1. 提高丙烷转化率
2. 克服平衡限制
3. 高温操作时每次通过的选择性显著提高的潜力（使用还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂时）

该方法的局限性和挑战包括：
1. 与纯丙烷进料相比，丙烯选择性较低
2. SO2可能氧化丙烯，导致水和二氧化碳等不需要的产物
3. 由于碳沉积，需要催化剂再生

该研究没有讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂，而是专注于SO2。这篇文献没有涉及使用氧气相关的具体挑战。

值得注意的是，虽然这种方法显示出前景，但作者表示目前还不能完全理解所涉及的机制，这表明需要进一步研究以优化该过程并克服当前的局限性。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include thermodynamic limitations and equilibrium constraints. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by using an oxidant (in this case, SO2) to shift the equilibrium and overcome thermodynamic limitations.

ODHP offers advantages such as increased propane conversion and the potential to operate at lower temperatures. However, it also presents limitations, particularly in terms of selectivity. The study shows that while SO2 increases propane conversion, it significantly reduces selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed.

The choice of oxidant is crucial in ODHP. This study focuses on SO2, which presents its own set of challenges. While SO2 helps overcome equilibrium limitations, it can also lead to undesired side reactions, such as the oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, reducing overall selectivity.

The study does not directly address the challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant. However, the use of SO2 as an alternative oxidant suggests that oxygen may present its own set of challenges, possibly including safety concerns or difficulty in controlling selectivity.

In summary, while ODHP with SO2 offers a potential solution to equilibrium limitations in propylene production, it introduces new challenges related to selectivity and undesired side reactions. The study highlights the complex trade-offs involved in developing more efficient propylene production methods.

目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括热力学限制和平衡约束。丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)通过使用氧化剂(在本例中为SO2)来改变平衡并克服热力学限制，从而解决这些问题。

ODHP提供了一些优势，如增加丙烷转化率和在较低温度下操作的潜力。然而，它也存在一些限制，特别是在选择性方面。研究表明，虽然SO2增加了丙烷转化率，但与纯丙烷进料相比，它显著降低了对丙烯的选择性。

氧化剂的选择在ODHP中至关重要。这项研究重点关注SO2，它带来了一系列独特的挑战。虽然SO2有助于克服平衡限制，但它也可能导致不希望的副反应，如丙烯被氧化成水和二氧化碳，从而降低整体选择性。

该研究没有直接讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂的挑战。然而，使用SO2作为替代氧化剂表明，氧气可能会带来自己的一系列挑战，可能包括安全问题或难以控制选择性。

总之，虽然使用SO2进行ODHP为克服丙烯生产中的平衡限制提供了潜在解决方案，但它也引入了与选择性和不希望的副反应相关的新挑战。这项研究突出了开发更高效丙烯生产方法所涉及的复杂权衡。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the study focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using SO2 as an oxidant, which suggests that this method is being explored to address certain limitations in existing processes.

ODHP addresses the equilibrium limitation of conventional dehydrogenation reactions. By using an oxidant (SO2 in this case), the reaction can overcome thermodynamic constraints, potentially allowing for higher conversions.

Advantages of ODHP with SO2 include:
1. Increased propane conversion compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. The ability to operate at higher temperatures, which can lead to higher conversions.

Limitations of this specific ODHP process include:
1. Lower selectivity to propylene compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.
2. The formation of unwanted byproducts such as H2S, H2O, and potentially CO2.

The study does not directly compare SO2 with oxygen as an oxidant, so the specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not addressed in this literature. However, the use of SO2 presents its own challenges, particularly in terms of maintaining high selectivity to propylene.
