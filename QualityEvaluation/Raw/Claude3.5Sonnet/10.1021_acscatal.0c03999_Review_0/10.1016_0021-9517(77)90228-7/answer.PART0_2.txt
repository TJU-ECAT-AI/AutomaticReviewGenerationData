[1] "The overall reaction for the deyhdrogen-ation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + SO2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."

[2] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."

[3] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane; however, the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed"

[4] "oxidative dehydrogenation using SO, offers another alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction"

[5] "SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."

[6] "the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are not explicitly stated in the given literature. However, the study focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using SO2 as an oxidant, which suggests that this approach is being explored to address certain limitations in existing methods.

ODHP addresses the equilibrium limitation of the conventional dehydrogenation reaction. By using SO2 as an oxidant, it shifts the equilibrium towards the product side, increasing propane conversion. This is evident from the increased conversion rates when SO2 is added to the feed.

Advantages of ODHP with SO2 include:
1. Increased propane conversion
2. Overcoming equilibrium limitations
3. Potential for high-temperature operations with increased selectivity per pass (when using reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst)

Limitations and challenges of this method include:
1. Lower selectivity to propylene compared to pure propane feed
2. Potential oxidation of propylene by SO2, leading to unwanted products like water and carbon dioxide
3. The need for catalyst regeneration due to carbon deposition

The study does not discuss the use of oxygen as an oxidant, focusing instead on SO2. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen are not addressed in this literature.

It's important to note that while this method shows promise, the authors state it is premature to fully understand the mechanisms involved, indicating that further research is needed to optimize the process and overcome its current limitations.

该文献没有明确指出当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。然而，研究重点关注使用SO2作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP），这表明正在探索这种方法来解决现有方法的某些局限性。

ODHP解决了常规脱氢反应的平衡限制。通过使用SO2作为氧化剂，它将平衡向产物一侧移动，增加了丙烷转化率。这从向进料中添加SO2时转化率的增加可以看出。

使用SO2进行ODHP的优势包括：
1. 提高丙烷转化率
2. 克服平衡限制
3. 高温操作时每次通过的选择性显著提高的潜力（使用还原态Pd/Al2O3催化剂时）

该方法的局限性和挑战包括：
1. 与纯丙烷进料相比，丙烯选择性较低
2. SO2可能氧化丙烯，导致水和二氧化碳等不需要的产物
3. 由于碳沉积，需要催化剂再生

该研究没有讨论使用氧气作为氧化剂，而是专注于SO2。这篇文献没有涉及使用氧气相关的具体挑战。

值得注意的是，虽然这种方法显示出前景，但作者表示目前还不能完全理解所涉及的机制，这表明需要进一步研究以优化该过程并克服当前的局限性。
