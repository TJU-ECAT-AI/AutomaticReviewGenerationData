[1] "Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant."

[2] "An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."

[3] "These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening."

[4] "Premji et al. have explored the role of H2S in ODHP in the gas phase from experimental and theoretical perspectives. (44) From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH."

[5] "With the propyl-O2 adduct, the propylene is the kinetic product, though a side distribution of other products can be formed, such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane, all of which are more thermodynamically stable than propylene. On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers several advantages and challenges compared to traditional oxygen-based systems:

Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation has a significantly lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, much higher than the 13.41 eV for oxygen oxidation to CO2. This reduced driving force for overoxidation is advantageous for selective alkene production.

Reaction mechanisms: Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, methane coupling occurs on transition metal sulfides, with gaseous sulfur regenerating vacancies. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species (SH and HS2) participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems.

Catalytic performance: The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and far from practical consideration. Ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires very high temperatures (1050°C). The high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts.

Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity. In propane dehydrogenation, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically with propyl-S2 adducts, unlike propyl-O2 adducts which can form various side products.

Key challenges:
1. High reaction temperatures required
2. Poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides
3. High CH activation barriers (1.91-2.68 eV) on sulfide catalysts

Opportunities for improvement:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates
2. Exploration of MS (metal-sulfur) bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Further investigation of gas-phase sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction and their role in improving alkene selectivity

与传统的氧气系统相比，硫作为甲烷氧化偶联替代氧化剂的使用具有以下优势和挑战：

热力学：硫氧化的过度氧化热力学驱动力显著低于氧气。甲烷被硫氧化成CS2的能量势阱为3.45 eV，远高于氧化成CO2的13.41 eV。这种较低的过度氧化驱动力有利于选择性烯烃生产。

反应机理：基于硫的系统涉及表面和气相反应。在表面上，甲烷偶联发生在过渡金属硫化物上，气态硫再生空位。在气相中，硫自由基物种（SH和HS2）参与氢抽提，类似于氧气系统中的OH和OOH自由基。

催化性能：目前基于硫的催化剂性能适中，距离实际应用还有一定距离。在PdS催化剂上可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性，但这需要非常高的温度（1050°C）。高温是必要的，因为反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上较高的CH活化障碍。

烯烃选择性：基于硫的系统在提高烯烃选择性方面显示出潜力。在丙烷脱氢中，与丙基-O2加合物相比，丙基-S2加合物在动力学和热力学上都更有利于丙烯的形成，而前者可能形成各种副产品。

主要挑战：
1. 需要高反应温度
2. 与金属氧化物相比，硫化物催化剂的氢抽提能力较差
3. 硫化物催化剂上的CH活化障碍高（1.91-2.68 eV）

改进机会：
1. 基于描述符的理论筛选，以识别具有更高转化率的催化剂
2. 探索MS（金属-硫）键能作为CH活化和CC偶联反应障碍的描述符
3. 进一步研究气相硫自由基物种在氢抽提中的作用及其在提高烯烃选择性方面的作用
