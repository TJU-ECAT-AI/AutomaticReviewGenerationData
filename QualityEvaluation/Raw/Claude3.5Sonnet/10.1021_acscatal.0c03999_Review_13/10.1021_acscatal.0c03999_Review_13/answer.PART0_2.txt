[1] "Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant."

[2] "An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."

[3] "These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening."

[4] "Premji et al. have explored the role of H2S in ODHP in the gas phase from experimental and theoretical perspectives. (44) From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH."

[5] "With the propyl-O2 adduct, the propylene is the kinetic product, though a side distribution of other products can be formed, such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane, all of which are more thermodynamically stable than propylene. On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers several distinct characteristics compared to traditional oxygen-based systems:

1. Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation has a significantly lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, much higher than the 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. This lower driving force reduces the likelihood of unwanted complete oxidation.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The sulfur-based system involves both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, gaseous sulfur regenerates vacancies formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species like SH and HS2 participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH in oxygen-based systems.

3. Catalytic performance: The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and not yet practical for industrial applications. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires high temperatures (1050°C). The high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts.

4. Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show promising selectivity for alkenes. In propane dehydrogenation, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically with propyl-S2 adducts, partly due to the instability of S-containing hydrocarbon products. This contrasts with oxygen-based systems, where side products like propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane are more thermodynamically stable than propylene.

Key challenges for sulfur-based systems include:
1. High reaction temperatures required
2. Relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts
3. Poor hydrogen abstraction capabilities of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides

Opportunities for future improvements include:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates
2. Further exploration of the MS bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Development of catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity

与传统的氧化系统相比，硫作为甲烷氧化偶联的替代氧化剂具有以下几个显著特征：

1. 热力学：硫氧化的过度氧化热力学驱动力显著低于氧气。甲烷被硫氧化为CS2的能量井为3.45 eV，远高于O2将甲烷氧化为CO2的13.41 eV。这种较低的驱动力降低了不需要的完全氧化的可能性。

2. 反应机理：基于硫的系统涉及表面和气相反应。在表面上，气态硫再生由甲烷偶联过程中H2S脱附形成的空位。在气相中，硫自由基物种如SH和HS2参与氢抽提，类似于氧基系统中的OH和OOH。

3. 催化性能：目前基于硫的催化剂性能一般，尚未达到工业应用的实用水平。在PdS催化剂上可以达到最高18%的乙烯选择性，但这需要高温（1050°C）。高温是必要的，因为反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上较高的CH活化能垒。

4. 烯烃选择性：基于硫的系统显示出有希望的烯烃选择性。在丙烷脱氢中，由于含硫烃类产物的不稳定性，丙烯的形成在动力学和热力学上都更有利于丙基-S2加合物。这与氧基系统形成对比，在氧基系统中，副产物如丙醛、甲基环氧乙烷和环氧丁烷在热力学上比丙烯更稳定。

基于硫系统的主要挑战包括：
1. 需要高反应温度
2. 硫化物催化剂上较高的CH活化能垒
3. 与金属氧化物相比，硫化物催化剂的氢抽提能力较差

未来改进的机会包括：
1. 基于描述符的理论筛选，以识别具有更高转化率的催化剂
2. 进一步探索MS键能作为CH活化和CC偶联反应能垒的描述符
3. 开发能在较低温度下运行同时保持高选择性的催化剂
