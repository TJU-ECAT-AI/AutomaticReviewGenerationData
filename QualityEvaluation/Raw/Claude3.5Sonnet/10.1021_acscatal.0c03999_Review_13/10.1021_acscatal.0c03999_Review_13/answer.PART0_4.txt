[1] "Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant."

[2] "An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."

[3] "These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening."

[4] "Premji et al. have explored the role of H2S in ODHP in the gas phase from experimental and theoretical perspectives. (44) From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH."

[5] "With the propyl-O2 adduct, the propylene is the kinetic product, though a side distribution of other products can be formed, such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane, all of which are more thermodynamically stable than propylene. On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers several advantages and challenges compared to traditional oxygen-based systems:

Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation has a much lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, significantly higher than the 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation to CO2. This reduced driving force for overoxidation is a key advantage of sulfur-based systems.

Reaction mechanisms: Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, gaseous sulfur regenerates vacancies formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species like SH and HS2 participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems.

Catalytic performance: The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and far from practical consideration. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires very high temperatures (1050°C). The high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts.

Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity. In propane dehydrogenation, for example, propylene formation is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically with propyl-S2 adducts compared to propyl-O2 adducts. This is partly due to the relative instability of S-containing hydrocarbon products.

Key challenges:
1. High reaction temperatures required
2. Poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides
3. High CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts (ranging from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2)

Opportunities for future improvements:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates
2. Further exploration of the MS bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Development of catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity

In summary, while sulfur-based oxidants show promise for improved selectivity and reduced overoxidation, significant challenges remain in terms of catalytic performance and reaction conditions. Future research focusing on catalyst design and optimization could potentially unlock the full potential of this approach.

与传统的氧气基系统相比，硫作为甲烷氧化偶联反应中的替代氧化剂具有以下几个优势和挑战：

热力学：与氧气相比，硫氧化的过度氧化热力学驱动力要低得多。甲烷被硫氧化为CS2的能量阱为3.45 eV，明显高于O2氧化为CO2的13.41 eV。这种较低的过度氧化驱动力是硫基系统的一个关键优势。

反应机理：硫基系统涉及表面反应和气相反应。在表面上，气态硫再生甲烷偶联过程中H2S脱附形成的空位。在气相中，硫自由基物种如SH和HS2参与氢抽提，类似于氧气基系统中的OH和OOH自由基。

催化性能：目前硫基催化剂的性能较为一般，距离实际应用还有一定距离。在PdS催化剂上可以实现高达18%的乙烯选择性，但这需要非常高的温度（1050°C）。高温是必要的，因为反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上相对较高的CH活化能垒。

烯烃选择性：硫基系统在提高烯烃选择性方面显示出潜力。例如，在丙烷脱氢反应中，与丙基-O2加合物相比，丙基-S2加合物在动力学和热力学上更有利于丙烯的形成。这部分是由于含硫烃类产物的相对不稳定性。

主要挑战：
1. 需要高反应温度
2. 与金属氧化物相比，硫化物催化剂的氢抽提能力较差
3. 硫化物催化剂上的CH活化能垒较高（从MoS2的1.91 eV到TiS2的2.68 eV不等）

未来改进的机会：
1. 基于描述符的理论筛选，以识别具有更高转化率的催化剂
2. 进一步探索MS键能作为CH活化和CC偶联反应能垒的描述符
3. 开发能在较低温度下运行同时保持高选择性的催化剂

总之，虽然硫基氧化剂在提高选择性和减少过度氧化方面显示出潜力，但在催化性能和反应条件方面仍然存在重大挑战。未来聚焦于催化剂设计和优化的研究可能会充分释放这种方法的潜力。
