[1] "Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant."

[2] "An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."

[3] "While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. In particular, the authors have observed the MS bond energy to be a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers."

[4] "Premji et al. have explored the role of H2S in ODHP in the gas phase from experimental and theoretical perspectives. (44) From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH."

[5] "On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products. The more favorable energetics for propylene formation with sulfide species is consistent with experimental observation of higher propylene selectivity observed in the paper."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers several advantages and challenges compared to traditional oxygen-based systems:

Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation has a higher energy barrier (3.45 eV) compared to oxygen oxidation (13.41 eV), resulting in a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation. This potentially allows for better control of the reaction and improved selectivity towards desired products.

Reaction mechanisms: Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, sulfur regenerates vacancies formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species (SH and HS2) participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems.

Catalytic performance: The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and requires high temperatures (e.g., 1050°C for PdS catalyst). This is due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides.

Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity. For example, an ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved with a PdS catalyst. In propane dehydrogenation, propylene formation is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically with sulfur species compared to oxygen-based systems.

Key challenges and opportunities for future improvements include:

1. Developing catalysts with higher conversion rates and lower operating temperatures through descriptor-based theoretical screening.
2. Optimizing the MS (metal-sulfur) bond energy, which has been identified as a good descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers.
3. Further exploring the role of gas-phase sulfur radical species in improving selectivity and conversion rates.
4. Addressing the practical considerations of using sulfur as an oxidant, such as potential environmental and equipment corrosion issues.

Overall, while sulfur-based systems show promise for improved selectivity and control in alkane conversion reactions, significant research and development are still needed to make them competitive with traditional oxygen-based systems in terms of performance and practicality.

与传统的氧气系统相比，使用硫作为甲烷氧化偶联的替代氧化剂具有以下几个优势和挑战：

热力学：硫氧化的能量壁垒（3.45 eV）高于氧气氧化（13.41 eV），导致过度氧化的热力学驱动力较低。这可能允许更好地控制反应并提高目标产物的选择性。

反应机理：基于硫的系统涉及表面和气相反应。在表面上，硫再生由甲烷偶联过程中H2S脱附形成的空位。在气相中，硫自由基物种（SH和HS2）参与氢抽提，类似于氧气系统中的OH和OOH自由基。

催化性能：目前基于硫的催化剂性能一般，需要高温（例如，PdS催化剂需要1050°C）。这是由于反应的热力学和硫化物催化剂上相对较高的CH活化能垒，与金属氧化物相比，它们是较差的氢抽提剂。

烯烃选择性：基于硫的系统显示出提高烯烃选择性的潜力。例如，使用PdS催化剂可以达到高达18%的乙烯选择性。在丙烷脱氢过程中，与基于氧的系统相比，硫物种在动力学和热力学上更有利于丙烯的形成。

未来改进的主要挑战和机会包括：

1. 通过基于描述符的理论筛选开发转化率更高、操作温度更低的催化剂。
2. 优化MS（金属-硫）键能，这已被确定为CH活化和CC偶联反应能垒的良好描述符。
3. 进一步探索气相硫自由基物种在提高选择性和转化率方面的作用。
4. 解决使用硫作为氧化剂的实际问题，如潜在的环境和设备腐蚀问题。

总的来说，虽然基于硫的系统在烷烃转化反应的选择性和控制方面显示出潜力，但在性能和实用性方面仍需要大量研究和开发才能与传统的基于氧气的系统竞争。

4. Potential for improved selectivity due to the lower overoxidation tendency of sulfur-based systems.

Future improvements may focus on developing catalysts with lower CH activation barriers, optimizing reaction conditions, and exploring novel sulfide-based materials to enhance conversion rates and selectivity.

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers several distinct characteristics compared to traditional oxygen-based systems:

1. Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation has a significantly lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, much higher than the 13.41 eV for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2. This lower driving force reduces the likelihood of unwanted complete oxidation.

2. Reaction mechanisms: The sulfur-based system involves both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, gaseous sulfur regenerates vacancies formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species like SH and HS2 participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH in oxygen-based systems.

3. Catalytic performance: The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and not yet practical for industrial applications. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires high temperatures (1050°C). The high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts.

4. Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show promising selectivity for alkenes. In propane dehydrogenation, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically with propyl-S2 adducts, partly due to the instability of S-containing hydrocarbon products. This contrasts with oxygen-based systems, where side products like propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane are more thermodynamically stable than propylene.

Key challenges for sulfur-based systems include:
1. High reaction temperatures required
2. Relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts
3. Poor hydrogen abstraction capabilities of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides

Opportunities for future improvements include:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates
2. Further exploration of the MS bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Development of catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity

4. 烯烃选择性：基于硫的系统显示出有希望的烯烃选择性。在丙烷脱氢中，由于含硫烃类产物的不稳定性，丙烯的形成在动力学和热力学上都更有利于丙基-S2加合物。这与氧基系统形成对比，在氧基系统中，副产物如丙醛、甲基环氧乙烷和环氧丁烷在热力学上比丙烯更稳定。

基于硫系统的主要挑战包括：
1. 需要高反应温度
2. 硫化物催化剂上较高的CH活化能垒
3. 与金属氧化物相比，硫化物催化剂的氢抽提能力较差
