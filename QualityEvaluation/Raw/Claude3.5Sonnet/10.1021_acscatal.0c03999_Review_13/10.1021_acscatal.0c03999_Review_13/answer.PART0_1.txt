[1] "Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is 13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at 3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant."

[2] "An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides."

[3] "From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH. Subsequently, after CH activation to form propyl radicals, both O2 and S2 can then form adducts with the propyl and undergo further reactions."

[4] "On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products. The more favorable energetics for propylene formation with sulfide species is consistent with experimental observation of higher propylene selectivity observed in the paper."

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers several advantages and challenges compared to traditional oxygen-based systems:

Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation has a higher energy barrier (3.45 eV) compared to oxygen oxidation (13.41 eV), resulting in a lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation. This characteristic makes sulfur a less active oxidant, potentially leading to improved selectivity towards desired products.

Reaction mechanisms: Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, sulfur can regenerate vacancies formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species (SH and HS2) participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems.

Catalytic performance: Sulfide catalysts, such as PdS, can achieve ethylene selectivity up to 18% at high temperatures (1050°C). However, these catalysts are generally poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides, resulting in higher CH activation barriers and the need for elevated temperatures.

Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show improved selectivity towards alkenes. For example, in propane dehydrogenation, the propyl-S2 adduct favors propylene formation both kinetically and thermodynamically, leading to higher propylene selectivity compared to oxygen-based systems.

Key challenges and opportunities:
1. High temperature requirements due to thermodynamics and high CH activation barriers.
2. Relatively modest catalyst performance, far from practical consideration.
3. Need for descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify more efficient catalysts.
4. Potential for improved selectivity due to the lower overoxidation tendency of sulfur-based systems.

Future improvements may focus on developing catalysts with lower CH activation barriers, optimizing reaction conditions, and exploring novel sulfide-based materials to enhance conversion rates and selectivity.

使用硫作为甲烷氧化偶联的替代氧化剂与传统的氧基系统相比，具有以下几个优势和挑战：

热力学：硫氧化的能量壁垒（3.45 eV）高于氧氧化（13.41 eV），导致过度氧化的热力学驱动力较低。这一特性使硫成为一种活性较低的氧化剂，可能会提高向目标产物的选择性。

反应机理：硫基系统涉及表面和气相反应。在表面上，硫可以再生甲烷偶联过程中由H2S脱附形成的空位。在气相中，硫自由基物种（SH和HS2）参与氢抽提，类似于氧基系统中的OH和OOH自由基。

催化性能：硫化物催化剂（如PdS）在高温（1050°C）下可以达到18%的乙烯选择性。然而，这些催化剂与金属氧化物相比通常是较差的氢抽提剂，导致CH活化能垒较高，需要较高的温度。

烯烃选择性：硫基系统显示出对烯烃的改进选择性。例如，在丙烷脱氢中，丙基-S2加合物在动力学和热力学上都有利于丙烯的形成，与氧基系统相比，导致更高的丙烯选择性。

主要挑战和机遇：
1. 由于热力学和较高的CH活化能垒，需要高温条件。
2. 催化剂性能相对较低，距离实际应用还有一定距离。
3. 需要基于描述符的理论筛选来识别更高效的催化剂。
4. 由于硫基系统过度氧化趋势较低，有潜力提高选择性。

未来的改进可能集中在开发CH活化能垒较低的催化剂、优化反应条件以及探索新型硫化物基材料，以提高转化率和选择性。
