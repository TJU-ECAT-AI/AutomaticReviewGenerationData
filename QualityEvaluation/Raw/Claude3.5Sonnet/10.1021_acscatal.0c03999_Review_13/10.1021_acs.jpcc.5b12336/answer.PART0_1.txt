The given literature does not contain any information about the use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling or its comparison to traditional oxygen-based systems. The document appears to be about reactions of molten LiI with I2, H2O, and O2, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
