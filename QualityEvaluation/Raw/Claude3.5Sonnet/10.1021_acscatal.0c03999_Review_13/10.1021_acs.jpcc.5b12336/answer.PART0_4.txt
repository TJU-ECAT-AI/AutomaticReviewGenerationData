<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about the use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling or its comparison to traditional oxygen-based systems. The text appears to be a partial citation for an article about reactions of molten LiI with I2, H2O, and O2, which is unrelated to the question asked. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the question based on the given literature.

所给文献中没有包含任何关于硫作为甲烷氧化偶联替代氧化剂的使用,或其与传统氧气体系的比较的信息。文本似乎是一篇关于熔融LiI与I2、H2O和O2反应的文章的部分引用,与所问问题无关。因此,我无法根据所给文献回答这个问题。
