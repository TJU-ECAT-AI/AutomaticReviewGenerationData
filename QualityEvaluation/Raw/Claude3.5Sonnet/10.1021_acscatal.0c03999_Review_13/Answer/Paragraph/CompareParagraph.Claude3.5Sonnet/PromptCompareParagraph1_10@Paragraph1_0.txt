A comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling (MOC) reveals both promising aspects and significant challenges when contrasted with traditional oxygen-based systems. Thermodynamically, sulfur-based reactions offer potential advantages, including lower operating temperatures and improved selectivity towards desired C2+ products. The reaction mechanisms differ substantially, with sulfur forming intermediate species that can promote C-C coupling more efficiently than oxygen. Catalytic performance studies have shown that certain sulfur-based systems can achieve higher yields of ethane and ethylene, albeit often at the expense of increased complexity in product separation. However, challenges persist, such as catalyst deactivation due to sulfur poisoning and the need for sulfur regeneration cycles. Corrosion issues and the formation of undesired sulfur-containing byproducts also present hurdles. Future prospects for sulfur-based MOC systems hinge on developing more robust catalysts, optimizing reactor designs to manage sulfur circulation, and improving downstream processing techniques. While oxygen-based systems currently dominate industrial applications, ongoing research into sulfur alternatives may unlock new pathways for more efficient and selective methane conversion processes.

Comparative Analysis of Sulfur as an Alternative Oxidant in Methane Oxidative Coupling

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling presents both advantages and challenges when compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. This review focuses on the thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity of sulfur-based systems, as well as the key challenges and opportunities for future improvements.

Thermodynamics:
One of the primary advantages of using sulfur as an oxidant is the significantly lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, which is considerably higher than the 13.41 eV for oxygen oxidation to CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This reduced driving force for overoxidation is favorable for selective alkene production, as it decreases the likelihood of complete oxidation to carbon dioxide.

Reaction Mechanisms:
Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, methane coupling occurs on transition metal sulfides, with gaseous sulfur regenerating vacancies. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species (SH and HS2) participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This dual-pathway mechanism contributes to the overall reaction efficiency and selectivity.

Catalytic Performance:
The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and far from practical consideration. Ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires very high temperatures (1050Â°C) [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. The high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13], which are significantly higher than those observed in traditional oxygen-based systems.

Alkene Selectivity:
Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity, particularly in propane dehydrogenation. With propyl-S2 adducts, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This is in contrast to propyl-O2 adducts, which can form various side products such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane, all of which are more thermodynamically stable than propylene.

Key Challenges:
1. High reaction temperatures required
2. Poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides
3. High CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts

Opportunities for Future Improvements:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates
2. Exploration of MS (metal-sulfur) bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Further investigation of gas-phase sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction and their role in improving alkene selectivity
4. Development of catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity



Integrative Understanding and Prospective Outlook:
The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling represents a promising avenue for improving selectivity and reducing overoxidation in alkene production. The thermodynamic advantages of sulfur-based systems, coupled with their potential for enhanced alkene selectivity, suggest that this approach could lead to significant advancements in the field of oxidative coupling reactions.

Future research efforts should focus on addressing the key challenges identified, particularly the high reaction temperatures and CH activation barriers. This may involve the development of novel catalyst materials that can effectively lower these barriers while maintaining the beneficial thermodynamic properties of sulfur-based systems. Additionally, the exploration of metal-sulfur bond energies as descriptors for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers could provide valuable insights for catalyst design and optimization.

The role of gas-phase sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction warrants further investigation, as understanding and harnessing these mechanisms could lead to improved process efficiency and selectivity. Computational studies and advanced spectroscopic techniques could be employed to elucidate the precise nature of these gas-phase reactions and their interplay with surface-mediated processes.

Ultimately, the goal should be to develop sulfur-based catalytic systems that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity and conversion rates. This may require a multidisciplinary approach, combining insights from surface science, computational chemistry, and materials engineering. By addressing these challenges and capitalizing on the unique properties of sulfur as an oxidant, researchers may be able to unlock new possibilities in the field of oxidative coupling reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable processes for alkene production.
