Comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling: thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, challenges, and future prospects in contrast to traditional oxygen-based systems

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling presents a novel approach with distinct advantages and challenges compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. This review examines the key aspects of this approach, including thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity.

Thermodynamics:
One of the most significant advantages of using sulfur as an oxidant is the reduced thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, considerably higher than the 13.41 eV for oxygen oxidation to CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This substantial difference in energetics results in a lower propensity for complete oxidation, potentially leading to improved selectivity towards desired alkene products.

Reaction Mechanisms:
The reaction mechanisms in sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the catalyst surface, methane coupling occurs on transition metal sulfides, with gaseous sulfur regenerating vacancies. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species such as SH and HS2 participate in hydrogen abstraction, analogous to the role of OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This dual-pathway mechanism offers opportunities for fine-tuning the reaction process to enhance selectivity and conversion.

Catalytic Performance:
Despite the promising thermodynamic advantages, the current catalytic performance of sulfur-based systems remains modest and far from practical consideration. For instance, an ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires extremely high temperatures of 1050°C [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. The need for such high temperatures stems from both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, which range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13].

Alkene Selectivity:
Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity, particularly in propane dehydrogenation. With propyl-S2 adducts, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, partly due to the relative instability of S-containing hydrocarbon products. This contrasts with propyl-O2 adducts, which can form various thermodynamically stable side products such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13].

Key Challenges:
1. High reaction temperatures required for sufficient conversion
2. Poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides
3. High CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts

Future Prospects:
To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of sulfur-based oxidants in methane oxidative coupling, several avenues for improvement can be explored:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates at lower temperatures
2. Investigation of MS (metal-sulfur) bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Further study of gas-phase sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction and their role in improving alkene selectivity
4. Development of novel catalyst formulations that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The exploration of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling represents a paradigm shift in the field of alkane activation. While the current performance metrics fall short of practical application, the underlying thermodynamic advantages and potential for improved selectivity warrant continued research efforts. Future investigations may focus on developing hybrid systems that combine the benefits of both sulfur and oxygen-based oxidants, potentially leading to synergistic effects in terms of conversion and selectivity. Additionally, the insights gained from studying sulfur-based systems could inspire novel approaches in other related fields, such as the direct conversion of methane to value-added chemicals or the development of more efficient desulfurization catalysts for petroleum refining. As our understanding of the fundamental chemistry and catalysis involved in these systems deepens, we may unlock new pathways for sustainable hydrocarbon utilization and contribute to the broader goals of green chemistry and energy efficiency.

6.3. Reactions with Other Soft Oxidants
6.3.1. Sulfides
Zhu et al. have explored the possibility of sulfur as another less active oxidant for alkane conversion, specifically for methane oxidative coupling. (298) The authors note that the thermodynamic well for O2 oxidation of methane to CO2 is −13.41 eV, whereas for sulfur oxidation to CS2, it is considerably higher in energy at −3.45 eV. Therefore, the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation is much lower for the sulfur oxidant. This approach is realized by carrying out the reaction under gaseous sulfur flow on a selection of transition metal sulfides. Presumably, the gaseous sulfur regenerates vacancies on the surface formed from H2S desorption during methane coupling. An ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst at 1050 °C. High temperatures are needed for this process due to both the thermodynamics of the reaction and the relatively high C&ndash;H activation barriers on the sulfide catalysts, which are poor hydrogen abstractors compared to metal oxides. These barriers range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2. While the performance of this catalyst is found to be relatively modest and far from practical consideration, it is conceivable that future studies can identify catalysts with higher conversion rates by descriptor-based theoretical screening. In particular, the authors have observed the M&ndash;S bond energy to be a good descriptor for both C&ndash;H activation and C&ndash;C coupling reaction barriers.
Premji et al. have explored the role of H2S in ODHP in the gas phase from experimental and theoretical perspectives. (44) From theoretical calculations, it was proposed the co-feed of H2S/O2 and partial oxidation of H2S can produce sulfur radical species SH and HS2 which participate in hydrogen abstraction along with OH and OOH. Subsequently, after C&ndash;H activation to form propyl radicals, both O2 and S2 can then form adducts with the propyl and undergo further reactions. With the propyl-O2 adduct, the propylene is the kinetic product, though a side distribution of other products can be formed, such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane, all of which are more thermodynamically stable than propylene. On the other hand, with the propyl-S2 adduct, propylene is more favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, in part due to the relative instability of the S-containing hydrocarbon products. The more favorable energetics for propylene formation with sulfide species is consistent with experimental observation of higher propylene selectivity observed in the paper.
6.3.2. Halides
There has been recent interests in using halogens, such as Cl2 and Br2, as oxidants, particularly in oxyhalogenation reactions, which can be used for alkane to alkene conversion. (249,299) Zichittella et al. have explored the mechanism and factors governing alkene selectivity for oxyhalogenation in a combined theoretical and experimental study of an iron phosphate catalyst. (252) Interestingly, the authors have observed a divergence in the mechanism for ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination, with the former being dominated by surface reactions and the latter being mainly dominated by gas-phase reactions (Figure 31). In the proposed mechanism, ethane oxychlorination follows a surface-mediated C&ndash;H activation (with a barrier of 0.61 eV) to form an ethyl intermediate which then reacts with a surface chloride to form ethyl chloride in a barrierless process. Ethyl chloride is subsequently dehydrohalogenated (where a hydrogen and halogen are both removed from the alkyl in a concerted step) to ethylene, the desired product, in another surface reaction. By contrast, when Br2 is used, a gas-phase reaction is found to be more favorable where bromine desorbs as radicals which dehydrogenate and polybrominate ethane in a process unselective to ethylene. These results highlight the importance of the competition between surface and gas phase reactions that control the selectivity of the alkene and how the different oxidants shift their relative contributions.
