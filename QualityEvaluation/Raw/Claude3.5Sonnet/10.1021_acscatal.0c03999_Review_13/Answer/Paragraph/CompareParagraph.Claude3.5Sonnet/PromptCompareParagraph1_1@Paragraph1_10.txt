The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling presents a novel approach with distinct advantages and challenges compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. This comparative analysis focuses on thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity.

Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation demonstrates a significantly lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, substantially higher than the 13.41 eV for oxygen oxidation to CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This reduced driving force for overoxidation is advantageous for selective alkene production, potentially leading to improved product yields.

Reaction mechanisms: Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, methane coupling occurs on transition metal sulfides, with gaseous sulfur regenerating vacancies. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species (SH and HS2) participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This dual-mechanism approach offers unique opportunities for catalyst design and process optimization.

Catalytic performance: The current performance of sulfur-based catalysts is modest and far from practical consideration. Ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires very high temperatures (1050Â°C). These high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, which range from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. The poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides further compounds this challenge.

Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity, particularly in propane dehydrogenation. With propyl-S2 adducts, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically, unlike propyl-O2 adducts which can form various side products such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_13]. This inherent selectivity advantage could lead to more efficient processes with fewer unwanted by-products.

Key challenges in sulfur-based systems include the high reaction temperatures required, poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts, and high CH activation barriers. However, opportunities for improvement exist, such as descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates, exploration of metal-sulfur (MS) bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers, and further investigation of gas-phase sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling represents a paradigm shift in catalyst design and reaction engineering. While current performance metrics fall short of practical application, the fundamental advantages in thermodynamics and selectivity warrant continued research and development.

Future research directions may include:

1. Advanced computational modeling: Utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict and design novel sulfide catalysts with optimized performance.

2. Hybrid catalyst systems: Exploring synergistic effects between sulfide and oxide catalysts to combine the selectivity advantages of sulfur with the activity of traditional oxide systems.

3. Process intensification: Developing innovative reactor designs that can effectively manage the high temperatures required while maximizing heat recovery and energy efficiency.

4. In-situ characterization techniques: Advancing our understanding of the dynamic surface and gas-phase processes occurring during sulfur-based oxidative coupling reactions.

5. Techno-economic analysis: Comprehensive evaluation of the potential industrial viability of sulfur-based systems, considering factors such as catalyst lifetime, sulfur recovery, and overall process economics.

By addressing these challenges and capitalizing on the unique properties of sulfur-based systems, researchers may unlock new pathways for efficient and selective conversion of methane and other light alkanes to value-added products.

A comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling (MOC) reveals both promising aspects and significant challenges when contrasted with traditional oxygen-based systems. Thermodynamically, sulfur-based reactions offer potential advantages, including lower operating temperatures and improved selectivity towards desired C2+ products. The reaction mechanisms differ substantially, with sulfur forming intermediate species that can promote C-C coupling more efficiently than oxygen. Catalytic performance studies have shown that certain sulfur-based systems can achieve higher yields of ethane and ethylene, albeit often at the expense of increased complexity in product separation. However, challenges persist, such as catalyst deactivation due to sulfur poisoning and the need for sulfur regeneration cycles. Corrosion issues and the formation of undesired sulfur-containing byproducts also present hurdles. Future prospects for sulfur-based MOC systems hinge on developing more robust catalysts, optimizing reactor designs to manage sulfur circulation, and improving downstream processing techniques. While oxygen-based systems currently dominate industrial applications, ongoing research into sulfur alternatives may unlock new pathways for more efficient and selective methane conversion processes.
