Comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling: thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, challenges, and future prospects in contrast to traditional oxygen-based systems.

The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling presents both advantages and challenges when compared to traditional oxygen-based systems. This review analyzes the key aspects of this approach, including thermodynamics, reaction mechanisms, catalytic performance, and alkene selectivity.

Thermodynamics:
Sulfur oxidation demonstrates a significantly lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, which is considerably higher than the 13.41 eV for oxygen oxidation to CO2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_13]. This reduced driving force for overoxidation is advantageous for selective alkene production, potentially leading to improved product yields and selectivity.

Reaction Mechanisms:
Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, methane coupling occurs on transition metal sulfides, with gaseous sulfur regenerating vacancies. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species (SH and HS2) participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_13]. This dual-phase mechanism offers opportunities for fine-tuning reaction pathways and potentially enhancing selectivity.

Catalytic Performance:
The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and far from practical consideration. Ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires very high temperatures (1050°C). The high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts, ranging from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2 [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_13]. These high activation barriers present a significant challenge for commercial viability.

Alkene Selectivity:
Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity. In propane dehydrogenation, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically with propyl-S2 adducts, unlike propyl-O2 adducts which can form various side products such as propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_13]. This enhanced selectivity is partly due to the relative instability of S-containing hydrocarbon products, which could lead to higher-purity alkene streams.

Key Challenges:
1. High reaction temperatures required
2. Poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides
3. High CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts

Opportunities for Improvement:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates
2. Exploration of MS (metal-sulfur) bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Further investigation of gas-phase sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction and their role in improving alkene selectivity
4. Development of catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling represents a promising avenue for improving alkene selectivity and reducing overoxidation. However, significant challenges remain in terms of catalytic performance and reaction conditions. Future research efforts should focus on several key areas to unlock the full potential of this approach:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Utilizing computational methods and descriptor-based screening to identify novel sulfide catalysts with lower CH activation barriers and improved hydrogen abstraction abilities. This could involve exploring bimetallic sulfides or doped materials to fine-tune electronic properties.

2. Mechanistic studies: Deeper investigation into the interplay between surface and gas-phase reactions, particularly the role of sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction. This understanding could lead to optimized reaction conditions and catalyst formulations.

3. Process intensification: Exploring innovative reactor designs or reaction engineering approaches to overcome the high temperature requirements while maintaining selectivity. This might include membrane reactors or short contact time reactors to minimize unwanted side reactions.

4. Hybrid systems: Investigating the potential of combining sulfur-based and oxygen-based systems to leverage the advantages of both approaches. This could involve sequential or alternating use of oxidants or the development of dual-function catalysts.

5. Sustainability considerations: Evaluating the life-cycle impact and potential for sulfur recovery and recycling in industrial-scale processes to ensure environmental and economic viability.

By addressing these challenges and exploring new frontiers, the use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling could potentially revolutionize alkene production, offering more selective and efficient processes for the chemical industry.
