The use of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling offers several advantages and challenges compared to traditional oxygen-based systems:

Thermodynamics: Sulfur oxidation has a significantly lower thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation compared to oxygen. The energy well for sulfur oxidation of methane to CS2 is 3.45 eV, much higher than the 13.41 eV for oxygen oxidation to CO2. This reduced driving force for overoxidation is advantageous for selective alkene production.

Reaction mechanisms: Sulfur-based systems involve both surface and gas-phase reactions. On the surface, methane coupling occurs on transition metal sulfides, with gaseous sulfur regenerating vacancies. In the gas phase, sulfur radical species (SH and HS2) participate in hydrogen abstraction, similar to OH and OOH radicals in oxygen-based systems.

Catalytic performance: The performance of sulfur-based catalysts is currently modest and far from practical consideration. Ethylene selectivity of up to 18% can be achieved on a PdS catalyst, but this requires very high temperatures (1050°C). The high temperatures are necessary due to the thermodynamics of the reaction and the high CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts (ranging from 1.91 eV on MoS2 to 2.68 eV for TiS2).

Alkene selectivity: Sulfur-based systems show promise for improved alkene selectivity. In propane dehydrogenation, propylene formation is favored both kinetically and thermodynamically with propyl-S2 adducts, unlike propyl-O2 adducts which can form various side products.

Key challenges include:
1. High reaction temperatures required
2. Poor hydrogen abstraction ability of sulfide catalysts compared to metal oxides
3. High CH activation barriers on sulfide catalysts

Opportunities for improvement include:
1. Descriptor-based theoretical screening to identify catalysts with higher conversion rates
2. Exploration of MS (metal-sulfur) bond energy as a descriptor for both CH activation and CC coupling reaction barriers
3. Further investigation of gas-phase sulfur radical species in hydrogen abstraction and their role in improving alkene selectivity
4. Development of catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity

In summary, while sulfur-based oxidants show promise for improved selectivity and reduced overoxidation, significant challenges remain in terms of catalytic performance and reaction conditions. Future research focusing on catalyst design and optimization could potentially unlock the full potential of this approach.
