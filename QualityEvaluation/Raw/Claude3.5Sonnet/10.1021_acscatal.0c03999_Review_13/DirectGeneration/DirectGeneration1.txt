A comparative analysis of sulfur as an alternative oxidant in methane oxidative coupling (MOC) reveals both promising aspects and significant challenges when contrasted with traditional oxygen-based systems. Thermodynamically, sulfur-based reactions offer potential advantages, including lower operating temperatures and improved selectivity towards desired C2+ products. The reaction mechanisms differ substantially, with sulfur forming intermediate species that can promote C-C coupling more efficiently than oxygen. Catalytic performance studies have shown that certain sulfur-based systems can achieve higher yields of ethane and ethylene, albeit often at the expense of increased complexity in product separation. However, challenges persist, such as catalyst deactivation due to sulfur poisoning and the need for sulfur regeneration cycles. Corrosion issues and the formation of undesired sulfur-containing byproducts also present hurdles. Future prospects for sulfur-based MOC systems hinge on developing more robust catalysts, optimizing reactor designs to manage sulfur circulation, and improving downstream processing techniques. While oxygen-based systems currently dominate industrial applications, ongoing research into sulfur alternatives may unlock new pathways for more efficient and selective methane conversion processes.
