Abstract
Dehydrogenation of propane to propene is one of the important reactions for the production of higher-value chemical intermediates. In the commercial processes, platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts have been used for catalytic propane dehydrogenation. Herein, we first report that bulk tungsten oxide can serve as the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas. The activation of tungsten oxide by hydrogen is attributed to reduction of the metal oxide and presence of multivalent oxidation states. Comparison of the catalytic performance of partially reduced WO3x to other highly active metal oxides shows that WO3x exhibits superior catalytic activity and selectivity than Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The findings of this work provide the possibility for activation of metal oxides for catalytic reactions and the opportunity for the development of new type of catalytic systems utilizing partially reduced metal oxides.

1 Introduction
Catalytic processes to produce value-added chemicals from light alkanes have attracted attention as a considerable amount of methane, ethane and propane is available from shale gas reservoirs in a cost-effective manner. The fact that propene, a product of dehydrogenation of propane, is used as feedstock for the production of valuable chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates and other chemical intermediates, motivates the study of propane dehydrogenation [1]. The increasing worldwide demand for propene also spurs the development of techniques to convert propane to propene exclusively rather than the utilization of conventional processes, yielding propene with low selectivity [2, 3]. Several catalytic dehydrogenation installations for the selective production of propene are under construction or planned [1].
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8  C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure [1, 4]. Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for CH bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions [57]. In the case of dehydrogenation over metal oxides, the loss of activity and selectivity also arises from the oxidation state change of metal oxides during the reaction because both propane and hydrogen can act as reducing agents at the high temperatures [8, 9].
In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species [10]. It has been reported that in addition to CrOx, various transition metal oxides, including GaOx, VOx, FeOx, InOx, ZrOx and ZnOx, are active for CH bond activation of propane [1, 8, 1120]. Previous study of propane dehydrogenation over ZrOx promoted with La2O3 showed that the bulk metal oxide exhibits comparable catalytic activity to that of noble metal Pt [15]. Bulk Ga2O3 also showed a high propene selectivity of 95% while its activity was slightly lower than Cr2O3 for propane dehydrogenation at 500C [11]. These show that several metal oxides could be the promising catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane.
Recently, tungsten oxide is of great interest due to wide range of applications in heterogeneous catalysis, photochemistry, and electrochemistry [2124]. The nonstoichiometry arising from oxygen vacancies and the presence of multivalent oxidation states often results in unique properties in catalysis [25, 26]. It has been shown that the bulk and supported tungsten oxides are catalytically active for dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and isomerization of hydrocarbons [25, 27, 28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the catalytic properties of tungsten oxide for propane dehydrogenation have not been explored despite the fact that it is group VI transition metal oxide along with CrOx, utilized as industrial catalysts. In this work, we report that bulk tungsten oxide is highly active and selective for propane dehydrogenation when it is partially reduced. Although fully oxidized bulk WO3 is inactive under propane feed condition, co-feeding of H2 and/or H2 pretreatment activates the tungsten oxide. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on H2 pretreatment conditions and H2 partial pressure in the feed gas. The activation of tungsten oxide by H2 is attributed to partial reduction of the metal oxide and the oxidation state change. The partially reduced tungsten oxide, WO3x, exhibits superior catalytic performance than those of Cr2O3 and Ga2O3, which are known as highly active metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation. The findings of this work open up the possibility for activation of several metal oxides by reduction and offer the opportunity for the development of new type of catalytic systems utilizing partially reduced metal oxides.
2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
Tungsten(VI) chloride (WCl6, >99.9%), Pluronic P123 (Mn = 5800, EO20PO70EO20, EO=ethylene oxide, PO=propylene oxide), chromium(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, >99%) and gallium(III) nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, >99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All gases used in this study, propane, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, argon (all ultra high purity, 99.999%) and air (extra dry), were supplied by Praxair.
2.2 Material Synthesis
Tungsten oxide was synthesized via the soft-templating method utilizing self-assembly of P123 [29]. For typical synthesis, 2 g of P123 was dissolved in 20 ml ethanol and stirred overnight at room temperature. A metal precursor solution was prepared separately by dissolving 4.0 g of tungsten (VI) chloride into 20 ml of ethanol. The tungsten precursor solution was slowly added to the solution containing P123 and stirred for 5 h. Then, the mixed solution was poured into Petri dishes and the solvent was slowly evaporated at 40C for 2 days and at 60C for another 2 days. The resulting sample was calcined in air at 400C for 6 h, followed by 700C for 6 h. For the comparison of catalytic performance, bulk Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 were prepared by thermal decomposition of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O at 700C for 6 h in air and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O at 750C for 3 h in air, respectively.
2.3 Material Characterization
Structural characterization of tungsten oxide was performed using a Philips CM200/FEG transmission electronic microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV. The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface areas and pore volumes of metal oxides were measured via N2 (ultra high purity, 99.999%) physisorption at 77 K using Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) analyzer. For temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), WO3 sample of 200 mg was pretreated under Ar flow at 120C for 1 h. After the pretreatment, the catalyst was heated from 100 to 800C with a heating rate of 5C/min under a mixed gas flow (50 ml/min) of 10 vol% H2 and 90 vol% Ar. The TPR profile was obtained by monitoring H2 consumption using a thermal conductivity detector. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a Siemens D500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation source (1.54 Å). Chemical characterization of tungsten oxide was performed using a ultra-high vacuum (UHV) PHI 5400 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) system with a non-monochromatic Al X-ray source (Kα=1486.7 eV) operated at 350 W power. Survey XPS spectra were obtained with analyzer pass energy of 178.5 eV and step size of 1 eV. High-resolution spectra of W 4 f were obtained with analyzer pass energy of 35 and 0.05 eV energy steps. There was no charging effect during the measurement of tungsten oxide samples. The peak fitting was performed using Casa XPS software. Binding energy values for the W 4f7/2 peak-shape were obtained from standard reference materials (commercial WO3, WO2 and metallic W from SigmaAldrich) and compared to the values analyzed under similar spectrometer conditions in literature [26, 30]. The metal peak was detected at 30.0 eV and has an asymmetric peak shape with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1 eV. The surface species of W6+, W5+ and W4+ were fitted at 34.30.2, 33.00.2 and 31.30.1 eV, respectively. An additional component corresponding to the W 5p3/2 peak was set at 7.5 eV above the W 4f7/2 peak from metallic W. The W4f7/24f5/2 doublet separation was 2.18 eV and peak area ratio was 4:3. Satellite peaks were set at 36.0 eV for metallic W and 40.0 eV for W6+ species, respectively.
2.4 Catalytic Measurements
The catalytic performance of tungsten oxide for propane dehydrogenation was evaluated in a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with 5 mm inner diameter. Typically, 200 mg of catalyst diluted with 400 mg quartz chips (total bed height 3.5 cm) was placed in the middle of the reactor and supported by a porous quartz frit inside the reactor. The catalyst was pelletized and sieved to yield 150250 μm grain size before mixing with quartz chips of the same grain size.
In this study the total flow rate of feed gas was 50 ml/min and it was balanced with He. The flow rate of each gas was regulated using calibrated mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst). The temperature was controlled using a type-K thermocouple positioned at the top of the catalytic bed inside of the quartz reactor and a PID controller. To avoid reaction of the thermocouple with feed gas, the thermocouple was shielded by quartz sheath. Prior to propane dehydrogenation reaction, the loaded catalyst was preheated to 650C with a heating rate of 10C/min for 85 min in a stream of He and then pretreated by H2 (5 ml/min) or air (O2, 5 ml/min) at 650C. After pretreatment, the reactor was cooled down to 600C while purging the reactor with He for 20 min. The propane dehydrogenation reaction was run with a flow of 4 ml/min of propane, corresponding to WHSV=2.4 h1, under atmospheric pressure. A blank test showed that the conversion of propane at 600C by thermal cracking is <1%. In catalytic test conversion of propane ranged between 2 and 10%.
The reactant and products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph (SRI GC 8610 C) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). All data were collected from 21 min with 6 min interval after steady-state is established. The propane conversion (\({{X}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}}}\)), product selectivity (S i ) and surface area normalized activity were calculated as follows:
$${{X}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}}}(\%)=\frac{{{n}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}_{in}}}-{{n}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}_{out}}}}{{{n}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}_{in}}}}\times 100$$ (1)
$${{S}_{i}}\left( \% \right)=\frac{{{a}_{i}}}{3}\times \frac{{{n}_{i}}}{{{n}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{{{8}_{in}}}}}}-{{n}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{{{8}_{out}}}}}}}\times 100$$ (2)
$$Activity(mo{{l}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}}}{{m}{-2}}{{s}{-1}})=\frac{{{F}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}}}\times {{X}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}}}}{SA}$$ (3)
where \({{n}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}}}\) is the number of moles of propane, n i is the number of moles of C1C3 products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6 or C3H6), a i is the number of carbon atoms in the corresponding product, \({{F}_{{{C}_{3}}{{H}_{8}}}}\) is the moles of propane fed per second, SA is BET surface area measured by N2 adsorption, respectively. In the calculations, the conversion of propane to coke was not taken into account because the carbon balance was within 3% deviation during the measurement.
3 Results
3.1 Characterizations of Fresh Samples
All samples for propane dehydrogenation were first prepared by calcining as-synthesized tungsten oxide in air at 400C for 6 h, followed by 700C for 6 h. The morphology, specific surface area, porosity, structure and oxidation state of the fresh samples were characterized by TEM, N2 adsorptiondesorption, XRD and XPS analysis. In this study a soft-templating approach utilizing the self-assembled supramolecular structure of organic surfactant was attempted to obtain a mesoporous structure with high surface area. However, the TEM image of the tungsten oxide sample calcined under air atmosphere shows no porous structure (Fig. 1a). The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherm also exhibits the curves similar to those of nonporous materials (Fig. SI. 1). The low BET area of 6.3 m2/g and pore volume of 0.082 cm3/g of the sample confirm that utilizing the organic surfactant, P123, is not suitable for the preparation of mesoporous tungsten oxide for high-temperature reactions. The high-resolution (HR) TEM image of the prepared tungsten oxide shows interplanar distance of 3.1 Å, attributed to \((11\stackrel{-}{2}\)) plane of WO3 crystal structure (Fig. 1d). The corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern is shown in the inset. The XRD diffractogram of the tungsten oxide sample in Fig. 2a reveals the diffraction peaks assigned to a monoclinic phase of WO3 crystal (JCPDS Card No. 240747). The W 4f XPS spectra obtained from the WO3 sample exhibit two sharp peaks at 34.3 eV (W 4f7/2) and 36.5 eV (W 4f5/2) and one broad satellite peak at 40.4 eV (Fig. 3a). These binding energies of W 4 f doublet peaks reveal that surface species of tungsten are in the state of W6+ [26]. This was also confirmed by comparing the W 4f XPS spectra of our sample with those obtained from commercial WO3 sample (Sigma-Aldrich, Figure SI. 2), in which each peak exhibits nearly the same binding energies of 34.2 eV (W 4f7/2), 36.4 eV (W 4f5/2) and 40.5 eV (satellite WO3 feature).

Co-feeding of H2 and C3H8 results in partial reduction of the sample during the reaction, exhibiting W6+, W5+, W4+ and W0. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of catalyst, 50 ml/min of total flow rate, pretreatment with 50 vol% air at 650C for 1 h, propane dehydrogenation at 600C under atmospheric pressure for 12 h, WHSVpropane = 2.4 h1

3.2 Catalytic Performance for Propane Dehydrogenation
3.2.1 Activation of Tungsten Oxide by Co-feeding of H2
The catalytic performance of the prepared WO3 samples for propane dehydrogenation was studied at 600C with increasing H2/C3H8 ratio in feed gas; H2/C3H8=0, 0.5, 1 and 2. Before the reaction, the WO3 samples were pretreated at 650C for 1 h under air flow as described above. Figure 4a, b show specific activity normalized by BET surface area of the sample and selectivity towards C3H6, respectively. When propane is only present in the feed gas, the WO3 catalyst exhibits negligible activity and low C3H6 selectivity arising from thermal cracking of propane. Co-feeding of H2 and propane, however, results in a remarkable increase of activity and selectivity during the initial period of reaction, activating the catalyst. The increase of H2/C3H8 ratio in the feed gas from 0.5 to 1 to 2 leads to higher activity although it results in rapid activation and deactivation of the catalyst. At the feed ratios of H2/C3H8=0.5 and 1, the C3H6 selectivity of the activated tungsten oxide is quite stable, showing 90% selectivity. However, an excess of H2 in the feed (H2/C3H8=2) leads to a lower C3H6 selectivity of 84% and it decreases further after a time of the stream of 300 min. The decrease of selectivity is mainly attributed to the increase of methane (CH4) production.

Tungsten oxide exhibits negligible activity and low selectivity when it is reacted with C3H8. The catalyst is activated by co-feeding of H2 and C3H8. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of catalyst, 50 ml/min of total flow rate, pretreatment with 50 vol% air at 650C for 1 h, propane dehydrogenation at 600C under atmospheric pressure for 12 h, WHSVpropane = 2.4 h1
Full size image
In order to elucidate the influence of co-feeding of H2 on the activation of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, the morphology, bulk structure and the oxidation state of spent samples were analyzed by TEM, XRD and XPS. After 12 h reaction with propane in the absence of H2 (H2/C3H8=0) at 600C, no noticeable morphological changes were observed in TEM images (Fig. 1b). The spent catalyst shows the similar XRD pattern to that of the fresh sample before the reaction (Fig. 2b). The fact that spent sample has a lattice spacing of 3.8 Å corresponding to (002) interplanar distance of WO3 supports the XRD results (Fig. 1e). The binding energies of W 4f and the atomic ratio of O/W3 measured from the spent catalyst indicate the existence of only W6+ species on the surface (Fig. 3b). This is confirmed by the observation that the spent catalyst showed the same pale-yellow color as the fresh sample. These results clearly demonstrate that the fully oxidized WO3 undergoes no structural and chemical changes under propane flow at 600C and the WO3 sample is inactive for propane dehydrogenation.
However, the catalyst reacted with the feed gas mixture of C3H8 and H2 (H2/C3H8=1) shows agglomeration of tungsten oxide particles (Fig. 1c). The HR-TEM image exhibits the interplanar distances of 3.5 Å, corresponding to the (\(\bar{1}10\)) plane of WO2 (Fig. 1f). As shown in Fig. 2c, the structural change from WO3 to WO2 during the reaction is also observed in the XRD diffractogram, where the peaks at 2θ = 25.8, 36.6 and 52.8 are assigned to monoclinic WO2 phase (JCPDS Card No. 05-0431). Moreover, the W 4f XPS spectrum of the spent catalyst clearly reveals new peaks at lower binding energies (Fig. 3c). This shows that W6+ species on the surface of the WO3 sample were reduced to W5+, W4+ and W0, corresponding to 33.1, 31.3 and 30.0 eV for W 4f7/2, respectively. As a consequence of this partial reduction under the flow of gas mixture with H2/C3H8=1, the surface atomic O/W ratio of the spent catalyst decreased from 3 to 2.42. It is noteworthy that no peaks corresponding to WO3 phase were visible in the XRD patterns whereas a considerable amount of W6+ species was observed in XPS spectrum. This discrepancy arises from re-oxidation of the partially reduced tungsten oxide surface by air exposure while preparing sample for XPS analysis [27]. It should also be noted that the color of the sample was changed from pale yellow to deep blue after the propane dehydrogenation reaction. These observations clearly indicate that the activation of tungsten oxide during the propane dehydrogenation as shown in Fig. 4 is attributed to the reduction of the catalyst by the gas mixtures of H2 and C3H8.
3.2.2 Activation of Tungsten Oxide by H2 Pretreatment
The influence of reduction on the catalytic performance of tungsten oxide for propane dehydrogenation was further studied by varying pretreatment conditions. TPR profile showed that a fresh WO3 sample starts to be reduced at 650C by H2 (Fig. SI. 3). For a comparison of catalytic properties of fully oxidized WO3 and reduced sample, fresh WO3 catalysts were pretreated under the flow of H2 or air for 1h at 650C and then, purged by He while cooling down the reactor to a reaction temperature of 600C. Figure 5a, b show specific activity and C3H6 selectivity of the pretreated tungsten oxides under the flow of a gas mixture with H2/C3H8=1. For air-pretreated catalyst, an induction period (50 min) is required to exhibit catalytic activity. However, the formation of propene and high selectivity of 90% are readily observable after H2 pretreatment. Under the flow of the gas mixture of C3H8 and H2, the H2-pretreated catalyst is further activated up to 105 min and then starts to be deactivated. These imply that partially reduced tungsten oxide, WO3x, shows higher activity and selectivity than fully oxidized WO3 and the catalytic performance depends on the degree of reduction of tungsten oxide. The effect of reduction on the intrinsic catalytic performance of tungsten oxide was also investigated by varying the duration of H2 pretreatment (Fig. 5c, d and Figure SI. 4). The results show that the initial activity of the tungsten oxide noticeably increases up to 3 h pretreatment and then decreases after a longer pretreatment of 5 h. However, all catalysts exhibit similar C3H6 selectivity between 90 and 93%, showing that the initial selectivity is not affected by the H2 pretreatment time (Fig. 5d).

Tungsten oxide is activated by H2 pretreatment and the initial activity strongly depends on the duration of H2 pretreatment. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of catalyst, 50 ml/min of total flow rate, pretreatment with 50 vol% of air or 10 vol% of H2 at 650C, propane dehydrogenation with C3H8 and H2 at 600C under atmospheric pressure, H2/C3H8=1, WHSVpropane = 2.4 h1
Full size image
To understand the influences of H2 pretreatment, the TEM, XRD and XPS results obtained from 2.5 to 5 h H2-pretreated tungsten oxide samples were compared to fresh WO3 sample. Both H2-pretreated samples exhibit severe aggregation of tungsten oxide particles (Fig. 6a, b). The XRD patterns demonstrate that they are reduced during the H2 pretreatment (Fig. 6c, d). The sample pretreated by H2 for 2.5 h exhibits apparent peaks assigned to monoclinic WO2 phase (JCPDS Card No. 05-0431) and small peaks corresponding to the crystalline cubic phase of metallic W (JCPDS Card No. 04-0806). The formation of the metallic W phase is clearly evidenced for the sample pretreated for 5 h. This observation shows that WO3 is reduced further by longer H2 pretreatment time. The W 4f XPS spectra for the H2-pretreated samples reveal the oxidation state change from W6+ to multiple oxidation states including W6+ (34.2 eV), W5+ (33.0 eV), W4+ (31.2 eV) and W0 (29.6 eV) (Fig. 6e, f). Therefore, the high activity of the tungsten oxide catalyst pretreated by H2 for 2.5 h results from the partial reduction of tungsten oxide and its multivalent oxidation states. A clear difference between the tungsten oxide catalysts reduced for 2.5 and 5 h is the atomic compositions of surface W0 species. Although the composition of W0 species is 8% for the sample pretreated for 2.5 h, it increases up to 26% after 5 h H2 reduction (Table 1). The existence of metallic W is observed in the HR-TEM image, in which the sample has a lattice spacing (2.3 Å) corresponding to (110) plane of the cubic metallic W (inset in Fig. 6b). Considering a drop of catalytic activity after 5 h H2 pretreatment in Fig. 5c, a negative effect by the over-reduction is attributed to the formation of metallic tungsten phases on the surface.

These show that a fresh WO3 sample is partially reduced by H2 pretreatment, exhibiting multiple oxidation state of W6+, W5+, W4+ and W0. Longer pretreatment time leads to a higher concentration of metallic W. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of catalyst, 50 ml/min of total flow rate, pretreatment with 10 vol% H2 at 650C

3.2.3 Catalytic Performance of Partially Reduced Tungsten Oxide
For the evaluation of the catalytic performance, the catalytic activity and the selectivity of partially reduced tungsten oxide, WO3x, were compared to those of other highly active bulk metal oxides such as Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 (Fig. 7a, b and Figure SI. 5a, b). The catalytic tests for all metal oxides were conducted at 600C under the feed of C3H8 in the absence of H2. As shown in Fig. 5, pretreatment conditions affect the catalytic performance of metal oxides. Therefore, the samples of WO3 and Cr2O3 were pretreated in air or H2 before propane dehydrogenation to find out optimal pretreatment conditions for each metal oxide. In the case of Ga2O3, it was only pretreated in air because reduction of the metal oxide by H2 can lead to the formation of volatile or liquid phases under the reaction condition. As expected, partially reduced WO3x showed higher activity and selectivity than fully oxidized WO3. In contrast, Cr2O3 exhibited better catalytic performance when it was air-pretreated. It is noteworthy that higher activity of air-pretreated Cr2O3 is attributed to the fact that Cr6+ species plays a role as the precursor to produce the most active surface species [9]. The easy reducibility of Cr2O3 and therefore, the total loss of Cr6+ species by H2 pretreatment appears to result in lower activity. The comparison of the catalytic performance of three metal oxides after the optimal pretreatment is shown in Fig. 7a, b. The partially reduced WO3x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600C. A rapid deactivation of metal oxide catalysts during propane dehydrogenation requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts. In the commercial Catofin process, CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is typically regenerated after 12 min of dehydrogenation at 575C. Although the partially reduced WO3x catalyst shows high activity and selectivity during the reaction at 600C, fast deactivation is still observed as shown in Figure SI. 5a.

The partially reduced tungsten oxide shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity than other highly active metal oxides, Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g of catalyst, 50 ml/min of total flow rate, pretreatment with 10 vol% H2 for WO3 (2.5 h) and Cr2O3 (1 h) or pretreatment with 50 vol% air for WO3 (1 h), Cr2O3 (1 h) and Ga2O3 (1 h) at 650C, propane dehydrogenation with only C3H8 at 600C under atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane = 2.4 h1

The influence of pre-reduction on the activity and selectivity was further studied by repeating propane dehydrogenation for 1 h (Fig. 8a, b). The fresh WO3 sample was pre-reduced at 650C for 2.5 h for the 1st cycle of reaction. After the propane dehydrogenation reaction, the catalyst was regenerated under air flow at 650C for 20 min, followed by over-reduced with H2 for 3.5 h on purpose. During several reaction cycles (2nd12th cycles), the initial activity and the selectivity of WO3x gradually decrease, exhibiting deactivation. However, shorter pretreatment, 3 h H2 pretreatment, results in better the catalytic performance as shown for the 13th16th cycles. Although a further shorter pre-reduction for 2.5 h leads to the lower activity and the selectivity as measured in the 17th cycle, the catalytic efficiency is recovered to the pervious values after 3 h pretreatment. This suggests that there is an optimal chemical state to obtain the best catalytic performance and it can be achieved by controlling the H2 pretreatment time. It is also noteworthy that despite its deactivation during the repeated cycles, the activity and selectivity of WO3x catalyst at 18 cycle are still higher than those of fresh Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 catalysts.

4 Discussion
A key observation of this work is that the reduction of bulk WO3 by co-feeding of H2 and/or H2 pretreatment activates the tungsten oxide catalyst for propane dehydrogenation although fully oxidized WO3 is inactive. Moreover, the partially reduced WO3x shows superior catalytic performance than bulk Cr2O3 and Ga2O3, reported as highly active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. These observations raise fundamental questions about the characteristics of WO3x governing its catalytic activity and the specific active sites for propane dehydrogenation. A directly observable change arising from reduction by H2 in the pretreatment step or during the reaction with gas mixtures of C3H8 and H2 is a variation of the oxidation state of the tungsten oxide catalysts. The influence of oxidation state on alkane dehydrogenation over metal oxides has been extensively studied for chromium oxide [9, 3133]. It has been suggested that Cr3+ cation is the most active for dehydrogenation reactions among Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+ surface species [33, 34]. Also, a close relationship between oxidation state of metal ion and activity has been observed in dehydrogenation over supported VOx, in which V3+ ion showed higher active than V5+ and V4+ species [20]. Indeed, our results obtained from catalytic measurement and XPS analysis confirm that the activity and selectivity of tungsten oxide are influenced by its oxidation state. Although the presence of only W6+ species on the surface of tungsten oxide leads to no activity and poor selectivity, the evolution of multivalent oxidation state results in high catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. In repeated cycles the variation of oxidation state of WO3x also determines its catalytic efficiency as shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, we expect that oxidation state of tungsten oxide is a factor governing its catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.
The complexity arising from the presence of multivalent W cations on the surface hampers the identification of specific active sites of partially reduced WO3x for propane dehydrogenation. However, similar activation of tungsten oxides by H2 reduction has been reported for isomerization reactions, which involve dehydrogenation as the first reaction step [27, 35]. It was suggested that dehydrogenative properties of WO3x are attributed to W4+ cations with free electrons [27]. Our XPS result for the highly active tungsten oxide, pretreated for 2.5 h, also shows that W4+ species has the highest concentration of 45% among the surface W species (Table 1). Therefore, we suggest that W4+ species is the most likely active site for the propane dehydrogenation. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that other W cations or the interfaces between various W species are active for propane dehydrogenation. Recently, it was observed that slightly reduced WO3x with W6+ and W5+ cations exhibits improved catalytic activity compared to fully oxidized WO3 with only W6+ cation for hydrogenation of cyclohexane [25]. This implies that the catalytic properties, responsible for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, also arise from W5+ species or the interface between W6+ and W5+ cations. The presence of a considerable amount of metallic tungsten species has a negative effect on the activity for propane dehydrogenation as shown for 5 h pretreated sample in Fig. 5c. However, it should be noted that W0 species can often contribute to dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbon [36]. It was shown that the reduced WO3x with W6+, W5+, W4+ and a small amount of W0 species reveals higher conversion and selectivity towards dehydrogenation reaction than those with only W6+, W5+ and W4+ cations [27]. Indeed, the tungsten oxide pretreated by H2 for 2.5 h exhibits excellent catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation although it includes 8% of W0 species. This implies that the metal-oxide interfaces between metallic tungsten and tungsten oxides may play an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane.
The nature of active sites, oxidation state and the catalytic properties of tungsten oxide mentioned above are closely inter-correlated. Therefore, further careful experiments are needed for deep understanding of the superior activity of partially reduced WO3x for propane dehydrogenation. It is also interesting to see whether the modification of catalytic characteristics by control of oxidation state can be applied to other metal oxides. We are conducting experiments to understand the influence of those properties and exploring the control of the catalytic performance to propane dehydrogenation by using oxidizing and reducing agents.
5 Conclusions
Fully oxidized bulk tungsten oxide, WO3, is inactive for propane dehydrogenation. However, tungsten oxide can be activated by H2 pretreatment and/or co-feeding of H2 during the reaction. The reduction and oxidation state change of the tungsten oxide in the H2 environment were confirmed by HR-TEM, XRD and XPS. The catalytic activity of the WO3x catalysts strongly depends on the H2 reduction conditions. After the H2 pretreatment, the partially reduced WO3x shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity than those of other highly active metal oxides, Cr2O3 and Ga2O3.
