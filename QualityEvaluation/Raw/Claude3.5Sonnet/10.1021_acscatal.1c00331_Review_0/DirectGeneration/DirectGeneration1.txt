Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has emerged as a promising method for propene production, offering a more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternative to traditional cracking processes. This approach involves the selective removal of hydrogen from propane molecules to form propene, utilizing specialized catalysts to facilitate the reaction. Platinum-based catalysts have shown particular promise due to their high selectivity and activity. However, the PDH process faces several challenges, with coke formation on the catalyst surface being the most critical. This carbon deposition leads to catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration cycles and reducing overall process efficiency. Recent research has focused on optimizing catalyst compositions, developing novel support materials, and exploring innovative reactor designs to mitigate coke formation and enhance catalyst stability. Additionally, scientists are investigating the intricate mechanisms of coke formation and seeking ways to balance the trade-off between high conversion rates and catalyst longevity. As the demand for propene continues to grow, advancing PDH technology and addressing the coke formation challenge remain crucial for the widespread adoption of this process in industrial applications.
