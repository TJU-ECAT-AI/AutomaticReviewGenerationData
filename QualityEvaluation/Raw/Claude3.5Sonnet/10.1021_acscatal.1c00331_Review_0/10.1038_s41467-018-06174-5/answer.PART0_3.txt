[1] "Due to the thermodynamic constrains, methane activation was investigated at 800 C, while the tests with other alkanes were carried out at 550 C, where PDH was also performed."

[2] "Carbon deposits were the main side product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction"

[3] "When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites caused by temperature-induced sintering process"

[4] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds"

[5] "Although the energies for activating C3H8 at the methylene or methyl CH bond to yield iso-C3H7 or n-C3H7 are close (Supplementary Table 7), subtraction of a sec-ond hydrogen to yield propene is kinetically more favourable for the iso-C3H7 fragment."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene that typically operates at temperatures around 550°C. The reaction is endothermic and requires careful control of reaction conditions to optimize propene yield. 

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction temperature: Higher temperatures increase productivity but reduce catalyst durability due to sintering.

2. Catalyst type: Traditionally, Pt-based and CrOx catalysts have been used, but there are drawbacks such as cost and environmental concerns. The study introduces ZrO2 as a promising alternative catalyst.

3. Coke formation: This is a major side product, with about 10% selectivity. While undesired, coke deposits can actually help reduce overall costs in processes like CATOFIN by providing heat during catalyst regeneration.

4. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration: Pt-based catalysts suffer from deactivation due to sintering. Regeneration often involves using harmful chlorine-containing compounds.

5. Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation process involves breaking C-H bonds, with the formation of iso-C3H7 intermediates being kinetically favored.

Industrial applications of PDH need to balance these factors to achieve high propene yields while maintaining catalyst performance over time. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might include optimizing reaction conditions, developing more coke-resistant catalysts, and finding environmentally friendly regeneration methods. The use of novel catalysts like ZrO2 could potentially address some of these challenges by offering improved durability and easier regeneration.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，通常在550°C左右的温度下进行。这个反应是吸热的，需要仔细控制反应条件以优化丙烯产量。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应温度：更高的温度会提高生产率，但由于烧结会降低催化剂的耐久性。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用基于Pt和CrOx的催化剂，但存在成本和环境问题等缺点。该研究引入ZrO2作为一种有前景的替代催化剂。

3. 焦炭形成：这是一个主要的副产品，选择性约为10%。虽然不受欢迎，但在CATOFIN等过程中，焦炭沉积实际上可以通过在催化剂再生过程中提供热量来帮助降低总体成本。

4. 催化剂失活和再生：基于Pt的催化剂因烧结而失活。再生常常涉及使用有害的含氯化合物。

5. 反应机理：脱氢过程涉及断裂C-H键，形成iso-C3H7中间体在动力学上是有利的。

PDH的工业应用需要平衡这些因素，以在保持催化剂长期性能的同时获得高丙烯产率。减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略可能包括优化反应条件、开发更耐焦炭的催化剂，以及寻找环境友好的再生方法。使用像ZrO2这样的新型催化剂可能通过提供更好的耐久性和更容易的再生来解决其中一些挑战。
