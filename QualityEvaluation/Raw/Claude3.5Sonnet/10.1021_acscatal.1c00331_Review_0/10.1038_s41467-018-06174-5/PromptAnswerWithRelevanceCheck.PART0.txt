[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

[3] "A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds."

[4] "Carbon deposits were the main side product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction."

[5] "When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites caused by temperature-induced sintering process"

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an environmentally friendly process for propene production compared to oil-based cracking technologies. It utilizes natural/shale gas feedstock with fewer impurities. PDH has been developed to address the gap between propene demand and supply.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature affects catalyst durability and productivity. Higher temperatures increase productivity but decrease durability due to crystallite size growth from sintering.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used but have drawbacks such as high cost and deactivation through sintering. ZrO2-based catalysts have shown promise as an alternative.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in propene production, with new plants under construction.

Coke formation impacts process efficiency by:

1. Reducing catalyst activity and selectivity
2. Requiring frequent regeneration

However, coke deposits can indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in processes like CATOFIN by providing heat during regeneration for the endothermic PDH reaction.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition)
2. Developing more coke-resistant catalysts
3. Improving regeneration techniques
4. Using alternative catalysts like ZrO2 that may have different coking behaviors

For Pt-based catalysts specifically, current regeneration involves treatment with environmentally harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds to re-disperse platinum. Research into more eco-friendly regeneration methods or alternative catalysts is ongoing to address this issue.

与基于石油的裂解技术相比，丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种更环保的丙烯生产方法。它使用天然气/页岩气作为原料，杂质更少。PDH的发展是为了解决丙烯供需之间的差距。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：温度影响催化剂的耐久性和生产力。较高的温度会提高生产力，但由于烧结导致晶粒尺寸增大，耐久性会下降。

2. 催化剂类型：常用的铂基催化剂存在成本高和因烧结导致失活等缺点。氧化锆基催化剂作为替代品显示出了潜力。

3. 工业应用：PDH在丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，新的工厂正在建设中。

焦炭形成对工艺效率的影响：

1. 降低催化剂活性和选择性
2. 需要频繁再生

然而，在CATOFIN等工艺中，焦炭沉积物可以间接contribute to降低总体成本，因为在催化剂再生阶段焦炭燃烧释放的热量可用于吸热的PDH反应。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）
2. 开发更耐焦炭的催化剂
3. 改进再生技术
4. 使用可能具有不同结焦行为的替代催化剂，如氧化锆

对于铂基催化剂，目前的再生涉及使用对环境有害的Cl2或含氯化合物处理以重新分散铂。为解决这个问题，正在研究更环保的再生方法或替代催化剂。

[5] "The yield of propene within one PDH cycle initially increased and then decreased with rising time on stream at 550 C but continuously decreased at higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 9). The increase is related to the formation of Zrcus sites, while the decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by formation of carbon deposits, which could be removed upon oxidative catalyst regeneration as proven by stable catalyst performance within first 20 cycles at 550 C (Fig. 4b)."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an environmentally friendly process for propene production, based on natural/shale gas feedstock with fewer impurities compared to oil-based cracking. PDH has been developed to address the gap between propene demand and supply, with propene being a crucial chemical industry building block.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is typically performed at high temperatures (550-625°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Commercial catalysts include supported CrOx and Pt species. However, these have drawbacks:
   - CrOx catalysts pose health risks due to Cr(VI) exposure.
   - Pt-based catalysts are expensive and prone to deactivation through sintering.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important, with new plants under construction to meet propene demand.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. However, carbon deposits can indirectly contribute to cost minimization in processes like CATOFIN by providing heat during catalyst regeneration for the endothermic PDH reaction.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:
1. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition).
2. Developing novel catalyst formulations with improved coke resistance.
3. Implementing efficient regeneration protocols, such as oxidative treatment to remove carbon deposits.
4. Exploring alternative catalysts, like the ZrO2-based materials described in the study, which show promising performance and durability.

The research presents a ZrO2-based catalyst that outperforms traditional CrOx and Pt catalysts, offering a potential alternative with improved activity and regeneration capabilities. This catalyst's performance is attributed to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites (Zrcus) that can be controlled through the size of ZrO2 crystallites, opening new avenues for catalyst design in PDH processes.

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（550-625°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：商业催化剂包括负载的CrOx和Pt物种。但这些催化剂存在缺点：
   - CrOx催化剂由于Cr(VI)暴露而带来健康风险。
   - 基于Pt的催化剂昂贵且容易因烧结而失活。

3. 工业应用：PDH变得越来越重要，新的工厂正在建设中以满足丙烯需求。

催化剂上的积碳形成，包括基于Pt的催化剂，通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率。然而，碳沉积物可以在CATOFIN等过程中间接地通过在催化剂再生阶段燃烧释放热量来为吸热的PDH反应提供热量，从而有助于降低总体成本。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：
1. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）。

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene that typically operates at temperatures around 550°C. The reaction is endothermic and requires careful control of reaction conditions to optimize propene yield. 

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction temperature: Higher temperatures increase productivity but reduce catalyst durability due to sintering.

2. Catalyst type: Traditionally, Pt-based and CrOx catalysts have been used, but there are drawbacks such as cost and environmental concerns. The study introduces ZrO2 as a promising alternative catalyst.

3. Coke formation: This is a major side product, with about 10% selectivity. While undesired, coke deposits can actually help reduce overall costs in processes like CATOFIN by providing heat during catalyst regeneration.

4. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration: Pt-based catalysts suffer from deactivation due to sintering. Regeneration often involves using harmful chlorine-containing compounds.

5. Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation process involves breaking C-H bonds, with the formation of iso-C3H7 intermediates being kinetically favored.

Industrial applications of PDH need to balance these factors to achieve high propene yields while maintaining catalyst performance over time. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration might include optimizing reaction conditions, developing more coke-resistant catalysts, and finding environmentally friendly regeneration methods. The use of novel catalysts like ZrO2 could potentially address some of these challenges by offering improved durability and easier regeneration.
