[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene14,15. This olefin is second to ethene as an important building block of the chemical industry with an annual production of about 80 million metric tons15."

[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species14,15. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration17, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds15."

[4] "Carbon deposits were the main side product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction14."

[5] "The yield of propene within one PDH cycle initially increased and then decreased with rising time on stream at 550 C but continuously decreased at higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 9). The increase is related to the formation of Zrcus sites, while the decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by formation of carbon deposits, which could be removed upon oxidative catalyst regeneration as proven by stable catalyst performance within first 20 cycles at 550 C (Fig. 4b)."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an environmentally friendly process for propene production, based on natural/shale gas feedstock with fewer impurities compared to oil-based cracking. PDH has been developed to address the gap between propene demand and supply, with propene being a crucial chemical industry building block.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is typically performed at high temperatures (550-625°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Commercial catalysts include supported CrOx and Pt species. However, these have drawbacks:
   - CrOx catalysts pose health risks due to Cr(VI) exposure.
   - Pt-based catalysts are expensive and prone to deactivation through sintering.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important, with new plants under construction to meet propene demand.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. However, carbon deposits can indirectly contribute to cost minimization in processes like CATOFIN by providing heat during catalyst regeneration for the endothermic PDH reaction.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:
1. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition).
2. Developing novel catalyst formulations with improved coke resistance.
3. Implementing efficient regeneration protocols, such as oxidative treatment to remove carbon deposits.
4. Exploring alternative catalysts, like the ZrO2-based materials described in the study, which show promising performance and durability.

The research presents a ZrO2-based catalyst that outperforms traditional CrOx and Pt catalysts, offering a potential alternative with improved activity and regeneration capabilities. This catalyst's performance is attributed to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites (Zrcus) that can be controlled through the size of ZrO2 crystallites, opening new avenues for catalyst design in PDH processes.

催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种环境友好的丙烯生产方法，基于含有较少杂质的天然气/页岩气原料，相比于基于石油的裂解技术更加清洁。PDH的发展旨在解决丙烯供需之间的差距，丙烯是化工行业的重要基础原料。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（550-625°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：商业催化剂包括负载的CrOx和Pt物种。但这些催化剂存在缺点：
   - CrOx催化剂由于Cr(VI)暴露而带来健康风险。
   - 基于Pt的催化剂昂贵且容易因烧结而失活。

3. 工业应用：PDH变得越来越重要，新的工厂正在建设中以满足丙烯需求。

催化剂上的积碳形成，包括基于Pt的催化剂，通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率。然而，碳沉积物可以在CATOFIN等过程中间接地通过在催化剂再生阶段燃烧释放热量来为吸热的PDH反应提供热量，从而有助于降低总体成本。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：
1. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）。
2. 开发具有改进的抗积碳性能的新型催化剂配方。
3. 实施高效的再生方案，如氧化处理以去除碳沉积物。
4. 探索替代催化剂，如研究中描述的基于ZrO2的材料，这些材料显示出有希望的性能和耐久性。

该研究提出了一种基于ZrO2的催化剂，其性能优于传统的CrOx和Pt催化剂，为PDH过程提供了一种潜在的替代方案，具有改进的活性和再生能力。这种催化剂的性能归因于配位不饱和Zr位点（Zrcus）的存在，这些位点可以通过ZrO2晶体的尺寸来控制，为PDH过程的催化剂设计开辟了新的途径。
