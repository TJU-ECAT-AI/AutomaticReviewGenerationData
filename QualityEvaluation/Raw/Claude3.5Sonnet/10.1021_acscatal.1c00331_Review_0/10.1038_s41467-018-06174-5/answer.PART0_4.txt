[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds."

[4] "Figure 4a shows a comparison of the present STY(C3H6) values with those obtained over state-of-the-art catalysts. All traditional catalysts with supported species of different metal oxides including chromium are less active than ZrO2. The latter also showed higher activity in comparison with doped ZrO2-based catalysts possessing supported Ru. Even in comparison with highly active but expensive Pt-based catalysts, ZrO2 proved its outstanding PDH activity."

[5] "The yield of propene within one PDH cycle initially increased and then decreased with rising time on stream at 550 C but continuously decreased at higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 9). The increase is related to the formation of Zrcus sites, while the decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by formation of carbon deposits, which could be removed upon oxidative catalyst regeneration as proven by stable catalyst performance within first 20 cycles at 550 C (Fig. 4b)."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an environmentally friendly process for propene production that uses natural/shale gas as feedstock, which contains fewer impurities compared to oil-based feedstocks. PDH has been developed to address the gap between propene demand and supply.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is typically performed at temperatures between 550°C and 625°C, with lower temperatures generally favoring catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Traditional catalysts include supported CrOx and Pt species. However, these have drawbacks:
   - CrOx catalysts pose health risks due to Cr(VI) exposure.
   - Pt-based catalysts are expensive and prone to deactivation through sintering.

The study introduces ZrO2 as a novel, highly active catalyst for PDH, outperforming traditional catalysts and even expensive Pt-based ones.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry, with new plants under construction to meet propene demand.

4. Coke formation: This is a significant issue affecting process efficiency, particularly for Pt-based catalysts. Coke deposits cause catalyst deactivation over time.

5. Mitigation strategies and catalyst regeneration:
   - For Pt catalysts, re-dispersion is typically done using Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds, but these are environmentally harmful.
   - For the novel ZrO2 catalyst, oxidative regeneration can effectively remove carbon deposits and restore catalyst performance.

The study demonstrates that controlling the nanostructure of ZrO2 can optimize its performance and stability in PDH, offering a promising alternative to traditional catalysts with fewer environmental and health concerns.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种环境友好的丙烯生产方法，使用天然气/页岩气作为原料，相比于基于石油的原料含有更少的杂质。PDH的开发旨在解决丙烯供需之间的差距。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在550°C至625°C之间进行，较低的温度通常有利于催化剂的稳定性。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂包括负载的CrOx和Pt物种。但这些催化剂存在缺点：
   - CrOx催化剂由于Cr(VI)暴露而带来健康风险。
   - 基于Pt的催化剂昂贵且容易因烧结而失活。

该研究引入ZrO2作为PDH的新型高活性催化剂，其性能优于传统催化剂，甚至超过昂贵的基于Pt的催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH在化学工业中变得越来越重要，新的工厂正在建设中以满足丙烯需求。

4. 积碳形成：这是影响过程效率的重要问题，特别是对于基于Pt的催化剂。积碳沉积会导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

5. 缓解策略和催化剂再生：
   - 对于Pt催化剂，通常使用Cl2或含氯化合物进行再分散，但这些物质对环境有害。
   - 对于新型ZrO2催化剂，氧化再生可以有效去除碳沉积物并恢复催化剂性能。

该研究表明，通过控制ZrO2的纳米结构可以优化其在PDH中的性能和稳定性，为传统催化剂提供了一种有前景的替代方案，同时减少了环境和健康问题。
