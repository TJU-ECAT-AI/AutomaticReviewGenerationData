[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

[3] "There are, however, flaws related to the commercial catalysts with supported CrOx or Pt species. According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, workplace exposure to Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds."

[4] "The use of ZrO2 composed of small crystallites is also beneficial for propene selectivity, which increased with a decrease in the crystallite size (Fig. 1b). Such positive effect holds over a broad range of propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 6)."

[5] "Carbon deposits were the main side product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an environmentally friendly process for propene production, based on natural/shale gas feedstock with fewer impurities compared to oil-based cracking. It helps address the gap between propene demand and supply.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is typically performed at high temperatures (550-625°C in the study) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Traditional catalysts include supported CrOx or Pt species. However, these have drawbacks:
   - CrOx: Potential health hazards due to Cr(VI) exposure
   - Pt: High cost and deactivation due to sintering

The study presents ZrO2 as an alternative catalyst, with smaller crystallite sizes beneficial for propene selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for propene production, with new plants under construction.

4. Coke formation: This is a major challenge for Pt-based catalysts, leading to deactivation. However, coke deposits can indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in some processes (e.g., CATOFIN) by providing heat during regeneration for the endothermic PDH reaction.

5. Mitigation strategies:
   - For Pt catalysts: Re-dispersion using Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds, though these are ecologically harmful.
   - The study suggests using ZrO2 with controlled crystallite size as an alternative to traditional catalysts, potentially reducing coke formation and improving regeneration efficiency.

Overall, while PDH is a promising technology for propene production, ongoing research aims to develop more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts and processes.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是一种环境友好的丙烯生产方法，基于含有较少杂质的天然气/页岩气原料，相比于基于石油的裂解技术。它有助于缓解丙烯供需之间的差距。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（研究中为550-625°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂包括负载的CrOx或Pt物种。然而，这些催化剂存在缺点：
   - CrOx：由于Cr(VI)暴露可能造成健康危害
   - Pt：成本高昂，且由于烧结导致失活

研究提出ZrO2作为替代催化剂，较小的晶粒尺寸有利于提高丙烯选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH在丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，新的工厂正在建设中。

4. 积碳形成：这是Pt基催化剂面临的主要挑战，导致催化剂失活。然而，在某些工艺中（如CATOFIN），积碳可以间接贡献于降低整体成本，通过在再生过程中为吸热的PDH反应提供热量。

5. 缓解策略：
   - 对于Pt催化剂：使用Cl2或含氯化合物进行再分散，尽管这些物质对环境有害。
   - 研究建议使用晶粒尺寸可控的ZrO2作为传统催化剂的替代品，可能减少积碳形成并提高再生效率。

总的来说，虽然PDH是一种有前景的丙烯生产技术，但持续的研究旨在开发更高效、更具成本效益和更环保的催化剂和工艺。
