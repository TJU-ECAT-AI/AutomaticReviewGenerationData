[1] "The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

[3] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity"

[4] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."

[5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to the increasing demand for alkenes. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures to achieve high propene yields. However, this also promotes unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking, leading to coke formation and light alkane production.

2. Catalyst types: The study focuses on gallium oxide catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3, which shows the highest activity among gallium oxide polymorphs. It even outperforms chromium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2.

3. Industrial applications: Propene is used as a raw material for various products including polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid.

4. Use of CO2: Carbon dioxide can be utilized as an oxidant in the reaction, leading to higher propene selectivity. This approach is both economically and ecologically attractive.

5. Coke formation: While the study doesn't specifically discuss Pt-based catalysts, it does mention coke formation as a problem in PDH. β-Ga2O3 shows lower coke deposition, possibly due to its low surface area.

6. Mitigation strategies: The use of CO2 as an oxidant appears to improve catalyst stability and activity. The study also mentions catalyst regeneration with oxygen, although full activity restoration was not achieved after the first regeneration cycle.

While the study doesn't directly address Pt-based catalysts or provide extensive information on industrial applications, it does offer insights into alternative catalyst materials and reaction conditions that could potentially be applied to improve PDH processes.

催化直接脱氢生产丙烯（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为烯烃需求不断增加。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，这也会促进不需要的副反应，如热裂解，导致积炭形成和轻烷烃生成。

2. 催化剂类型：该研究重点关注氧化镓催化剂，特别是β-Ga2O3，它在氧化镓多晶型中表现出最高的活性。在CO2存在的情况下，它甚至比氧化铬催化剂表现更好。

3. 工业应用：丙烯被用作多种产品的原材料，包括聚丙烯、聚丙烯腈、丙烯醛和丙烯酸。

4. CO2的使用：二氧化碳可以作为反应中的氧化剂，导致更高的丙烯选择性。这种方法在经济和生态上都具有吸引力。

5. 积炭形成：虽然该研究没有具体讨论基于Pt的催化剂，但确实提到积炭形成是PDH中的一个问题。β-Ga2O3显示出较低的积炭沉积，可能是由于其低表面积。

6. 缓解策略：使用CO2作为氧化剂似乎可以提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。该研究还提到了用氧气进行催化剂再生，尽管在第一次再生循环后未能完全恢复活性。

虽然该研究没有直接涉及基于Pt的催化剂或提供广泛的工业应用信息，但它确实提供了关于替代催化剂材料和反应条件的见解，这些可能应用于改进PDH过程。
