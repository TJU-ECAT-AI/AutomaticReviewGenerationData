[1] "The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

[3] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."

[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

[5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to the growing demand for alkenes. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring high temperatures for high propene yield. However, high temperatures also promote thermal cracking and coke formation, leading to decreased product yield and catalyst deactivation.

2. Catalyst types: The study focuses on gallium oxide catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3, which shows the highest activity among gallium oxide polymorphs and outperforms chromium oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2.

3. Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation reaction likely proceeds through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

4. CO2 promotion: The presence of CO2 enhances the reaction through the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction.

Regarding coke formation and mitigation strategies:

1. Coke formation impacts process efficiency by decreasing product yield and causing catalyst deactivation.

2. The study shows that β-Ga2O3, with its lower surface area, experiences less coke deposition compared to other gallium oxide polymorphs.

3. The presence of CO2 helps mitigate coke formation through the Boudouard reaction, which removes carbon deposits from the catalyst surface.

4. Catalyst regeneration can be achieved through oxidation treatment, as demonstrated in the study where O2 was introduced at 500°C to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst.

While the study doesn't specifically address Pt-based catalysts, the findings on gallium oxide catalysts provide insights into potential strategies for improving PDH processes and catalyst performance.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为烯烃需求不断增长。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一种吸热反应，需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，高温也会促进热裂解和焦炭形成，导致产品产率下降和催化剂失活。

2. 催化剂类型：该研究主要关注氧化镓催化剂，特别是β-Ga2O3，它在氧化镓多晶型中表现出最高的活性，并在CO2存在的情况下优于氧化铬催化剂。

3. 反应机理：脱氢反应可能是通过异裂解离反应途径进行，而不是氧化还原机制。

4. CO2促进作用：CO2的存在通过逆水气变换反应和布德瓦反应增强了反应。

关于焦炭形成和缓解策略：

1. 焦炭形成通过降低产品产率和导致催化剂失活影响过程效率。

2. 研究表明，β-Ga2O3由于表面积较小，与其他氧化镓多晶型相比，焦炭沉积较少。

3. CO2的存在有助于通过布德瓦反应缓解焦炭形成，该反应可从催化剂表面去除碳沉积物。

4. 催化剂再生可以通过氧化处理实现，如研究中所示，在500°C下引入O2以燃烧掉沉积在催化剂上的碳物质。

虽然该研究没有具体涉及基于Pt的催化剂，但关于氧化镓催化剂的发现为改进PDH过程和催化剂性能提供了见解。
