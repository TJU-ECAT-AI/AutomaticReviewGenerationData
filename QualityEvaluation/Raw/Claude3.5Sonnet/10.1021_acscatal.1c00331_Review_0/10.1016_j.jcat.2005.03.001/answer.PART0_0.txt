[1] "The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

[3] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."

[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

[5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to the growing demand for alkenes. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring high temperatures for high propene yield. However, high temperatures also promote unwanted side reactions like thermal cracking.

2. Catalyst types: The study focuses on gallium oxide catalysts, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest activity among polymorphs, outperforming even chromium oxide in the presence of CO2.

3. Industrial applications: Propene is used as a raw material for various products including polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid.

4. Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation reaction is proposed to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation pathway, enhanced by CO2 due to reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions.

5. Coke formation: While the study doesn't specifically address Pt-based catalysts, it does mention coke formation as a problem leading to decreased product yield and increased catalyst deactivation. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 is associated with lower coke deposition, suggesting that controlling catalyst surface area could be a strategy to mitigate coke formation.

6. Catalyst regeneration: The study mentions regeneration of β-Ga2O3 catalyst using O2 at 500°C, but notes that the original activity is not fully restored after the first regeneration.

Overall, the research suggests that gallium oxide catalysts, particularly β-Ga2O3, show promise for PDH reactions, especially in the presence of CO2. However, further research would be needed to fully address issues of coke formation and catalyst regeneration in industrial applications.

催化直接脱氢法（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为烯烃的需求不断增长。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热反应，需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，高温也会促进热裂解等不良副反应。

2. 催化剂类型：该研究关注氧化镓催化剂，其中β-Ga2O3在多晶型中表现出最高活性，在CO2存在的情况下甚至超过了氧化铬催化剂。

3. 工业应用：丙烯被用作多种产品的原料，包括聚丙烯、聚丙烯腈、丙烯醛和丙烯酸。

4. 反应机理：提出脱氢反应通过异裂解离路径进行，并由于逆水煤气变换反应和布道反应的存在而得到增强。

5. 积碳形成：虽然该研究没有具体讨论基于Pt的催化剂，但提到积碳形成是导致产品产率下降和催化剂失活增加的问题。β-Ga2O3的低比表面积与较低的积碳沉积相关，这表明控制催化剂表面积可能是减少积碳形成的一种策略。

6. 催化剂再生：研究提到使用500°C的O2再生β-Ga2O3催化剂，但注意到第一次再生后原始活性无法完全恢复。

总的来说，研究表明氧化镓催化剂，特别是β-Ga2O3，在PDH反应中显示出前景，尤其是在CO2存在的情况下。然而，还需要进一步研究以全面解决工业应用中的积碳形成和催化剂再生问题。
