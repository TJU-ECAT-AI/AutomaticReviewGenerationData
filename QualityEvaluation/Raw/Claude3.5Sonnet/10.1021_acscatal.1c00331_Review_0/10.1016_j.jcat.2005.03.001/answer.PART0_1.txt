[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over different polymorphs of gallium oxide was investigated."

[2] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

[4] "Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3. The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."

[5] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3."

[6] "The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited. In the absence of CO2, the amount of coke deposited on β-Ga2O3 is obviously increased, and the reduction in surface area after reaction is more evident."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the removal of hydrogen from propane molecules to form propene. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The reaction is typically carried out at high temperatures (500-600°C) to achieve sufficient conversion. The presence of CO2 can enhance the reaction, especially at temperatures above 550°C.

2. Catalyst types: Various catalysts can be used for PDH, including gallium oxide polymorphs and chromium oxide. Among gallium oxide polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 shows the highest activity, even surpassing chromium oxide in the presence of CO2.

3. Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation reaction on gallium oxide catalysts is believed to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation pathway, rather than a redox mechanism.

4. Promoting effects: CO2 enhances the reaction through the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction, which help shift the equilibrium towards product formation and remove carbon deposits.

5. Industrial applications: The high activity and stability of β-Ga2O3, especially in the presence of CO2, make it a promising catalyst for industrial PDH processes.

Regarding coke formation on catalysts:

1. Impact on process efficiency: Coke formation can lead to catalyst deactivation and reduced surface area, negatively affecting process efficiency.

2. Mitigation strategies: 
   a) Using CO2 as a co-feed helps reduce coke formation through the Boudouard reaction.
   b) Choosing catalysts with lower surface areas, like β-Ga2O3, can result in less coke deposition.
   c) Optimizing reaction conditions, such as temperature and CO2 concentration, can help minimize coke formation.

3. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly discussed for Pt-based catalysts in the given literature, the study mentions regeneration of gallium oxide catalysts using O2 treatment at 500°C. Similar principles could potentially be applied to Pt-based catalysts, but further research would be needed to confirm this.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及从丙烷分子中移除氢以形成丙烯。这个过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：反应通常在高温（500-600°C）下进行，以获得足够的转化率。CO2的存在可以增强反应，特别是在550°C以上的温度下。

2. 催化剂类型：PDH可以使用各种催化剂，包括氧化镓多晶型和氧化铬。在氧化镓多晶型中，β-Ga2O3显示出最高的活性，在CO2存在的情况下甚至超过了氧化铬。

3. 反应机理：在氧化镓催化剂上的脱氢反应被认为是通过异裂解离反应途径进行的，而不是氧化还原机制。

4. 促进效应：CO2通过逆水气变换反应和布道反应增强反应，这有助于将平衡转向产物形成并去除碳沉积。

5. 工业应用：β-Ga2O3的高活性和稳定性，特别是在CO2存在的情况下，使其成为工业PDH过程的有前景的催化剂。

关于催化剂上的积碳形成：

1. 对过程效率的影响：积碳形成可导致催化剂失活和表面积减少，对过程效率产生负面影响。

2. 缓解策略：
   a) 使用CO2作为共进料有助于通过布道反应减少积碳形成。
   b) 选择表面积较低的催化剂，如β-Ga2O3，可导致较少的积碳沉积。
   c) 优化反应条件，如温度和CO2浓度，可以帮助最小化积碳形成。

3. 催化剂再生：虽然给定文献中没有明确讨论基于Pt的催化剂，但研究提到了使用500°C下的O2处理再生氧化镓催化剂。类似的原理可能适用于基于Pt的催化剂，但需要进一步的研究来确认这一点。
