[1] "Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid. Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene."

[2] "The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

[3] "Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity"

[4] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."

[5] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures to achieve good propene yields, but this also promotes unwanted side reactions.

2. Catalyst types: The study focused on gallium oxide catalysts, with β-Ga2O3 showing the highest activity, even surpassing chromium oxide in the presence of CO2.

3. Industrial applications: Propene is used to produce various materials like polypropene and acrylic acid.

4. Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation occurs through a heterolytic dissociation pathway rather than a redox mechanism.

5. CO2 promotion: Adding CO2 enhances the reaction through reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions, improving catalyst stability and propene selectivity.

The document does not specifically discuss coke formation on Pt-based catalysts or strategies to mitigate it. However, it mentions that high temperatures lead to coke formation, which decreases product yield and increases catalyst deactivation. The use of CO2 as an oxidant is presented as a strategy to improve catalyst stability, likely by reducing coke formation through the Boudouard reaction.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH需要高温才能获得良好的丙烯产率，但这也会促进不需要的副反应。

2. 催化剂类型：该研究重点关注氧化镓催化剂，其中β-Ga2O3表现出最高活性，在CO2存在下甚至超过了氧化铬。

3. 工业应用：丙烯用于生产聚丙烯和丙烯酸等各种材料。

4. 反应机理：脱氢反应通过异裂解离途径进行，而不是氧化还原机制。

5. CO2促进：添加CO2通过逆水气变换反应和Boudouard反应增强反应，提高催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性。

该文献没有具体讨论Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成或减轻积碳的策略。然而，它提到高温会导致积碳形成，从而降低产品产率并增加催化剂失活。使用CO2作为氧化剂被提出作为提高催化剂稳定性的策略，可能是通过Boudouard反应减少积碳形成。
