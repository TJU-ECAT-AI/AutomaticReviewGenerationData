Abstract
Studies on dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) over monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, which contain markedly diﬀerent Pt particle
sizes, reveal that the reaction is dependent on the size of the particle. Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less
selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are sig-
niﬁcantly higher over the former than that on the latter.

1. Introduction
On-purpose propylene production technologies such as
dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to
make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conven-
tional crackers [1–3]. Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts
are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However,
major problems associated with these catalytic systems are
cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation.
The former reduces the desired product selectivity and
the latter causes deactivation of the catalyst. The deacti-
vated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without los-
ing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the
process complexity and operation costs. Consequently,
much research has been devoted to develop dehydrogena-
tion catalysts that increase the rate of DHP reaction while
diminishing undesired side reactions such as cracking, thus
prolonging the life time. An example of this kind, Pt–Sn
bimetallic catalysts show the above mentioned characteris-
tics, to some extent, more than the corresponding mono-
metallic Pt catalysts [2,3]. However, despite extensive
studies the role of Sn in a bimetallic catalyst remains elu-
sive [1,3]. Moreover, DHP is not known to depend on
the Pt particle size and there are no reports in the literature
dealing with this issue. This work exclusively evaluates the
eﬀect of Pt particle size on the activity, selectivity and the
degree of coking. To this end, a tapered element oscillating
microbalance (TEOM) coupled with a GC system was used
to derive the comprehensive information from a single
catalysis experiment. For the ﬁrst time, we report that
monometallic Pt-SBA-15 catalyst which contains smaller
particles is much more active but less selective in DHP than
catalyst with larger particles.
2. Experimental
The parent siliceous SBA-15 was prepared using a pro-
cedure similar to that reported in [4]. 1.3 wt% Pt on
SBA-15 supports were prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation (IMP) and deposition-precipitation (DP) [5]
using aqueous solutions of Pt (NH3)4 (NO3)2 (Johnson-
Matthey/Aesar). The as-prepared IMP and DP catalysts
were dried at 373 K for 16 h and subsequently calcined at
673 K and 573 K for 4 h, respectively. The resulting cata-
lysts were denoted as Pt-SBA-15-IMP and Pt-SBA-15-DP.

Chemi instrument. Catalytic activity, selectivity and coking
were simultaneously determined in a tapered element oscil-
lating microbalance (TEOM) reactor (Series 1500, Ruppr-
echt and Patashnick Co.) with an in situ GC analysis [6].
Real-time measurements of gas composition and mass
changes caused by coke formation make it possible to
study the activity, selectivity and coke formation simulta-
neously. The TEOM reactor was loaded with 30 mg of cat-
alyst (sieve fraction 250 lm) ﬁrmly packed between two
plugs of quartz wool. Prior to the experiments the catalysts
were pretreated in ﬂowing H2 (20 ml/min) at 793 K for 4 h.
The DHP was carried out isothermally at 793 K and at
atmospheric pressure. The feed consists of 8 vol.% C3H8
and 13 vol.% H2 in He at a total ﬂow of 150 ml/min. The
space velocity (SV), calculated as g propane/g.cat.h, was
47 h1. A purge gas (He) ﬂow of 200 ml/min was used
and the reaction mixture was preheated at 723 K. The coke
content was determined from the mass change measured
during the reaction. The product gases were analysed by
an on-line GC (HP 5890) equipped with a FID, using
GS-Q column (30 m length and 0.543 mm i.d.).
3. Results and discussion
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the pristine
SBA-15 show the characteristic behaviour of the mesopor-
ous materials exhibiting an irreversible type IV isotherm
with a well-deﬁned hysteresis loop of type H1 at p/
p0 > 0.66 [7]. The pore diameter distribution of the sample
was determined by the Bd-B model applied to the desorp-
tion branch of the isotherm which predicts a pore diameter
of 7–9 nm. The speciﬁc BET surface area of the sample was
determined to be 850 m2 g1. As expected, the BET surface
area of the catalysts (Pt-SBA-15-IMP (585 m2 g1) and Pt-
SBA-15-DP (350 m2 g1)) decreased after metal loading as
compared to the pristine SBA-15.
Fig. 1 shows that Pt-SBA-15-IMP contains larger Pt
particles than does Pt-SBA-15-DP. In the former, the par-
ticles are not well distributed and the average size is around
21 nm, as seen in the TEM image of Fig. 1a. By contrast
with the latter, Pt particles, which appear as bright spots
in the STEM image of Fig. 1b, are homogeneously distrib-
uted with a narrow size distribution and average size of
3 nm. It should be mentioned that the larger Pt particles
in Pt-SBA-15-IMP show up very clearly in TEM images
whereas, dark ﬁeld STEM gives better contrast for the
smaller particles that are present in Pt-SBA-15-DP. How-
ever, for comparative purposes a STEM image of Pt-
SBA-15-IMP is also shown in Fig. 1a (inset).
Pt-SBA-15-IMP shows four characteristic XRD (not
shown) reﬂections of the large Pt particles at 2H of 39.8o,
46.2o, 67.4o and 81.1o which can be attributed to (111),
(200), (220) and (311) inter planar spacings of the cubic
platinum metal structure, respectively [8]. The average Pt
particle size in Pt-SBA-15-IMP, determined from the full
width half-maximum (FWHM) of Pt (111) peak and the
Scherrer equation, was 21 nm, in agreement with the
TEM observations. However, the peaks observed in Pt-
SBA-15-IMP are more or less completely missing in Pt-
SBA-15-DP indicating that the particles are below the size
that can be detected by XRD, again consistent with the
TEM value of 3 nm. By comparison, the average Pt particle
size determined by H2-chemisorption is signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent from that by TEM and XRD as shown in Table 1. Such
discrepancy in the particle size determined by H2-chemi-
sorption and TEM and/or XRD is frequently discussed

in the literature [1,8,9]. A plausible reason could be strong
interactions between particle and support. Nevertheless,
the dispersion data still show a smaller Pt particle size in
the catalyst Pt-SBA-15-DP as compared to that in Pt-
SBA-15-IMP, which is consistent with that measured by
TEM and XRD.
Based on TEM and XRD results, also partly sup-
ported by chemisorption, it can be concluded that Pt-
SBA-15-DP contains smaller Pt particles, with an average
size of 3 nm, while the Pt-SBA-15-IMP contains larger
Pt particles, with an average size of 21 nm. Conse-
quently, surface site heterogeneity (i.e., the fraction of
coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt atoms, for example
at edges, steps, kinks, terraces, etc.) of Pt particles in the
catalysts is expected to be diﬀerent [8,10]. It increases
with decreasing particle size since, in smaller particles
the surface is mostly terminated by steps and edges where
Pt atoms are highly coordinatively unsaturated [8,10].
Diﬀerently, in larger particles the surface is mostly termi-
nated by terraces and planes where Pt atoms are rela-
tively
coordinatively
saturated
[8,10].
Furthermore,
taking into account the pore diameter of the samples as
evidenced by N2 physisorption data, it can be assumed
that the Pt particles may reside inside or outside the
pores depending on their sizes (Fig. 1).
Fig. 2a shows C3H8 conversion and coke formation over
Pt-SBA-15-DP and Pt-SBA-15-IMP catalysts at 793 K. Ini-
tial C3H8 conversion values correspond to the analysis of
reaction products after 5 min on stream. Pt-SBA-15-DP
that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial
C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-
IMP which contains larger particles. However, initial selec-
tivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as
compared over the latter ( 90%) (Fig. 2b). The most sig-
niﬁcant eﬀect of the Pt particle size is on the coke forma-
tion during the reaction. The initial rate of coking is an
order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that
on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on
the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher
(0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%). Accordingly, coke
content, after 220 min on stream, was measured to be
almost two orders of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP
than on Pt-SBA-15-IMP (Fig. 2a). These results clearly
demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system
for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectiv-
ity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment. How-
ever, from the above observations, it can be suggested
that a reaction mechanism involving common surface
intermediates, which form from activated/partly dehydro-
genated propane, can either desorb as C3H6 or further
undergo cracking to C1, C2 and even to surface carbon
deposits. Accordingly, these results indicate that small Pt
particles are very active for C–C bond activation [8,11],
namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt parti-
cles are more selective for C–H bond activation [8,11],
namely dehydrogenation reactions. Consequently, selectiv-
ity to C3H6 depends on the activity ratio between C–H and
C–C bond activation.
In Pt-SBA-15-DP, C3H8 conversion decreases and selec-
tivity to C3H6 increases sharply after a few minutes on
stream (Fig. 2a and b) due to deactivation of highly active
coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites, for instance at
step and edge sites, by coke. This indicates that coke acts as
a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those
sites that are active for C–C bond activation. Nonetheless,
propane conversion remains higher during the whole time
on stream for Pt-SBA-15-DP as compared to Pt-SBA-15-
IMP (Fig. 2a). However, activity with respect to the surface
Pt sites (TOF) is lower on the former than on the latter
(Table 1). This is due to the fact that true initial TOF is dif-
ﬁcult to determine over Pt-SBA-15-DP due to rapid deac-
tivation of Pt sites by coke as evidenced by the above
results. By contrast, for Pt-SBA-15-IMP, C3H8 conversion
and selectivity to C3H6 both decrease more gradually
(Fig. 2a and b). Such a decrease in selectivity to propene
was also previously observed over Pt/Sn/Na/ZSM-5 cata-

lysts and it was attributed to the changes of catalyst acidity
and/or active sites [12]. Accordingly, the support SBA-15 is
not, or is only weakly, acidic in nature [7] and hence the
eﬀect of acidity on the selectivity of C3H6 can safely be
excluded. The other plausible reasons for the decrease in
the initial C3H6 selectivity as well as an increase in the ini-
tial selectivity to CH4 (Fig. 2b) and C2 (not shown) on large
Pt particles could be the rearrangement or modiﬁcations in
the behaviour of Pt sites in Pt particles during the time on
stream [12].
4. Conclusion
Pt particle size is an important parameter to be taken
into account while designing a rational catalyst for DHP
since particle size not only inﬂuences the activity but also
plays a crucial role in determining selectivity as evidenced
by coking. Accordingly, smaller particles are more active
for propane conversion and coke formation while, larger
particles are less active for both the reactions but more
selective for propene formation. These results could hold
the key to understanding the role of Sn in a bimetallic
catalyst and a detailed study on this subject is underway.
It is also evident from this work that TEOM coupled
with GC/MS is a powerful tool for obtaining comprehen-
sive information of intricate catalytic reactions such as
DHP.
