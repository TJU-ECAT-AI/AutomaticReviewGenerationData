[1] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production. Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives."

[2] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

[3] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

[4] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[5] "The origin of the enhanced catalytic performance and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is ascribed to the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu, which is confirmed by the change of particle morphology and atomic electronic environment of the catalyst. The PtCu interaction inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture."

[6] "The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a promising method for propene production due to the increasing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves. PDH converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, making it economically competitive.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields. However, these conditions can lead to undesired thermal cracking and rapid coke deposition.

2. Catalyst types: Chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are commonly used. Cr-based catalysts show excellent performance but are limited by toxicity. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity, thermal stability, and lower coke formation rates.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is considered one of the most promising alternatives to traditional propylene production methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn has been shown to enhance catalytic performance and stability.

2. Developing bimetallic catalysts: PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrate improved anti-coking ability and catalytic performance through the intimate interaction between Pt and Cu.

3. Inhibiting propylene adsorption: The PtCu interaction reduces propylene adsorption, minimizing the possibility of coke formation and suppressing cracking reactions that form lighter hydrocarbons.

4. Increasing energy barriers: A higher energy barrier for C-C bond cleavage in PtCu catalysts suppresses methane formation, further improving propylene selectivity.

These strategies aim to enhance catalyst stability, increase propylene selectivity, and reduce the need for frequent catalyst regeneration, ultimately improving the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有前途的丙烯生产方法，因为丙烯需求不断增加而化石油储量不断减少。PDH将低成本的饱和烃转化为高附加值的烯烃，使其在经济上具有竞争力。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一种吸热的、受平衡限制的反应，需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，这些条件可能导致不必要的热裂解和快速积碳。

2. 催化剂类型：常用铬基和铂基催化剂。铬基催化剂性能优异，但受毒性限制。铂基催化剂具有高活性、热稳定性和较低的积碳形成速率。

3. 工业应用：PDH被认为是传统丙烯生产方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油流化催化裂解）的最有前途的替代方案之一。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。缓解积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：添加Sn、La、Ga和Zn等元素已被证明可以提高催化性能和稳定性。

2. 开发双金属催化剂：PtCu/Al2O3催化剂通过Pt和Cu之间的密切相互作用，展现出改善的抗积碳能力和催化性能。

3. 抑制丙烯吸附：PtCu相互作用减少了丙烯吸附，最大限度地减少了积碳形成的可能性，并抑制了形成轻烃的裂解反应。

4. 增加能量障碍：PtCu催化剂中C-C键断裂的能量障碍较高，抑制了甲烷的生成，进一步提高了丙烯选择性。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，增加丙烯选择性，减少频繁的催化剂再生需求，最终提高PDH过程的整体效率。
