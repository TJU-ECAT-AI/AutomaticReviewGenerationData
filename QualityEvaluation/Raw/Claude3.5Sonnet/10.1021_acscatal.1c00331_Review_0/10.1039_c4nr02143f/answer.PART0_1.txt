[1] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

[2] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives. The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."

[3] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

[5] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[6] "The PtCu interaction inhibits propylene adsorption and elevates the energy barrier of CC bond rupture. The inhibited propylene adsorption diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reaction towards the formation of lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3, while a higher energy barrier for CC bond cleavage suppresses the methane formation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into value-added olefins (propylene). This process has become increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction that requires high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields. However, these conditions can lead to undesired side reactions.

2. Catalyst types: Chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the main commercial options. Cr-based catalysts perform well but are limited by toxicity concerns. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity, thermal stability, and lower coke formation rates.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is considered one of the most promising alternatives to traditional propylene production methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This leads to decreased propylene yield and selectivity over time.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn has been shown to enhance catalyst performance and stability.

2. Developing bimetallic catalysts: For example, PtCu catalysts have demonstrated improved anti-coking ability by inhibiting propylene adsorption and increasing the energy barrier for C-C bond rupture.

3. Optimizing catalyst composition: Finding the optimal promoter loading (e.g., 0.5 wt% Cu in PtCu/Al2O3) can maximize propylene selectivity and yield while minimizing deactivation.

These strategies aim to reduce coke formation, suppress undesired side reactions, and enhance catalyst stability, ultimately improving the efficiency and economic viability of the PDH process.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种通过将低成本饱和烃（丙烷）转化为高附加值烯烃（丙烯）的丙烯生产方法。由于丙烯需求不断增长和化石油储量减少，这一过程变得越来越重要。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热和平衡受限的反应，需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，这些条件可能导致不希望的副反应。

2. 催化剂类型：铬基和铂基催化剂是主要的商业选择。铬基催化剂性能良好，但受毒性问题限制。铂基催化剂具有高活性、热稳定性和较低的积碳形成率。

3. 工业应用：PDH被认为是传统丙烯生产方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油流化催化裂解）的最有前景的替代方法之一。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过导致催化剂失活显著影响过程效率。这会导致丙烯产率和选择性随时间降低。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：添加Sn、La、Ga和Zn等元素已被证明可以提高催化剂性能和稳定性。

2. 开发双金属催化剂：例如，PtCu催化剂通过抑制丙烯吸附和提高C-C键断裂的能量势垒，表现出更好的抗积碳能力。

3. 优化催化剂组成：找到最佳助剂负载量（如PtCu/Al2O3中0.5 wt%的Cu）可以最大化丙烯选择性和产率，同时最小化失活。

这些策略旨在减少积碳形成，抑制不希望的副反应，并提高催化剂稳定性，最终提高PDH过程的效率和经济可行性。
