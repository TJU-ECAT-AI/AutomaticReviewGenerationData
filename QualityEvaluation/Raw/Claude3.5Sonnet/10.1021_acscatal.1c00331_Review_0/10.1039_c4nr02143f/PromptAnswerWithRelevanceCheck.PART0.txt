[1] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

[2] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives. The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."

[3] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

[5] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[6] "The addition of Cu resulted in a remarkable suppression of methane formation. The predominance of methane formation on Pt/Al2O3 indicates a high catalytic activity towards CC bond rupture compared to PtCu/Al2O3."

[7] "The promotional effect of Cu on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has also exhibited in other dehydrogenation systems. The suppression of cracking reaction of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is reported in butane dehydrogenation, which is ascribed to the formation of the PtCu alloy."

[8] "The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production due to its economic competitiveness in converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields. However, these conditions also lead to undesired thermal cracking and rapid coke deposition.

2. Catalyst types: Commercial catalysts for PDH are primarily chromium- and platinum-based. Cr-based catalysts show excellent performance but are limited by toxicity. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity, thermal stability, and lower coke formation rates.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves, making it a more economical route for propylene production compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, Zn, and Cu to Pt-based catalysts has been shown to improve catalytic performance and stability.

2. Bimetallic catalysts: The formation of PtCu alloys, for example, has demonstrated improved anti-coking ability by inhibiting propylene adsorption and suppressing cracking reactions.

3. Modifying electronic properties: The addition of promoters like Cu can alter the electronic environment of Pt atoms, leading to increased energy barriers for C-C bond rupture and suppression of methane formation.

These strategies aim to enhance propylene selectivity, reduce coke formation, and improve overall catalyst stability and regeneration in the PDH process.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into value-added olefins (propylene). This process has become increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction that requires high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields. However, these conditions can lead to undesired side reactions.

2. Catalyst types: Chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the main commercial options. Cr-based catalysts perform well but are limited by toxicity concerns. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity, thermal stability, and lower coke formation rates.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is considered one of the most promising alternatives to traditional propylene production methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This leads to decreased propylene yield and selectivity over time.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn has been shown to enhance catalyst performance and stability.

2. Developing bimetallic catalysts: For example, PtCu catalysts have demonstrated improved anti-coking ability by inhibiting propylene adsorption and increasing the energy barrier for C-C bond rupture.

3. Optimizing catalyst composition: Finding the optimal promoter loading (e.g., 0.5 wt% Cu in PtCu/Al2O3) can maximize propylene selectivity and yield while minimizing deactivation.

These strategies aim to reduce coke formation, suppress undesired side reactions, and enhance catalyst stability, ultimately improving the efficiency and economic viability of the PDH process.
