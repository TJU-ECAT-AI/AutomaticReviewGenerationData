[1] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

[2] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives. The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."

[3] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

[5] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[6] "The alkene species formed via alkane dehydrogenation has been considered as the origin of coke formation by many studies."

[7] "The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a promising method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins. This process is considered more economically competitive compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields. However, these conditions can lead to undesired thermal cracking and rapid coke deposition.

2. Catalyst types: Chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the main commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts show excellent performance but are limited by toxicity. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity, thermal stability, and lower coke formation rates.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Elements such as Sn, La, Ga, and Zn have been reported to improve catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts.

2. Inhibiting propylene adsorption: For example, PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts show improved anti-coking ability by inhibiting propylene adsorption, which reduces the possibility of coke formation and suppresses cracking reactions.

3. Modifying catalyst properties: Altering the electronic environment of surface Pt atoms can weaken the interaction between Pt and adsorbed molecules, potentially reducing coke formation.

These strategies aim to enhance propylene selectivity, reduce catalyst deactivation, and improve overall process efficiency in PDH reactions.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）作为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，通过将低成本的饱和烃转化为高附加值的烯烃。与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油流化催化裂解方法相比，这一过程被认为更具经济竞争力。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热和平衡受限的反应，需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，这些条件可能导致不良的热裂解和快速的积碳沉积。

2. 催化剂类型：铬基和铂基催化剂是PDH的主要商业催化剂。铬基催化剂表现出优异的性能，但受毒性限制。铂基催化剂具有高活性、热稳定性和较低的积碳形成速率。

3. 工业应用：由于丙烯需求不断增长和化石油储量减少，PDH变得越来越重要。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。减轻积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：据报道，Sn、La、Ga和Zn等元素可以改善铂基催化剂的催化性能和稳定性。

2. 抑制丙烯吸附：例如，PtCu/Al2O3催化剂通过抑制丙烯吸附显示出改善的抗积碳能力，这减少了积碳形成的可能性并抑制了裂解反应。

3. 修改催化剂性质：改变表面铂原子的电子环境可以削弱铂与吸附分子之间的相互作用，潜在地减少积碳形成。

这些策略旨在提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性，减少催化剂失活，并提高整体过程效率。
