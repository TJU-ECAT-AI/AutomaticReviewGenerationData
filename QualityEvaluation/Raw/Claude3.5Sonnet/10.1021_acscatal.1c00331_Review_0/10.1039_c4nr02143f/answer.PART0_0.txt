[1] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

[2] "Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives. The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."

[3] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

[5] "Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[6] "The addition of Cu resulted in a remarkable suppression of methane formation. The predominance of methane formation on Pt/Al2O3 indicates a high catalytic activity towards CC bond rupture compared to PtCu/Al2O3."

[7] "The promotional effect of Cu on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst has also exhibited in other dehydrogenation systems. The suppression of cracking reaction of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst is reported in butane dehydrogenation, which is ascribed to the formation of the PtCu alloy."

[8] "The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production due to its economic competitiveness in converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields. However, these conditions also lead to undesired thermal cracking and rapid coke deposition.

2. Catalyst types: Commercial catalysts for PDH are primarily chromium- and platinum-based. Cr-based catalysts show excellent performance but are limited by toxicity. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity, thermal stability, and lower coke formation rates.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves, making it a more economical route for propylene production compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Incorporating elements like Sn, La, Ga, Zn, and Cu to Pt-based catalysts has been shown to improve catalytic performance and stability.

2. Bimetallic catalysts: The formation of PtCu alloys, for example, has demonstrated improved anti-coking ability by inhibiting propylene adsorption and suppressing cracking reactions.

3. Modifying electronic properties: The addition of promoters like Cu can alter the electronic environment of Pt atoms, leading to increased energy barriers for C-C bond rupture and suppression of methane formation.

These strategies aim to enhance propylene selectivity, reduce coke formation, and improve overall catalyst stability and regeneration in the PDH process.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它能够经济地将低成本的饱和烃转化为高附加值的烯烃。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热和平衡受限的反应，需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，这些条件也会导致不期望的热裂解和快速积碳。

2. 催化剂类型：PDH的商业催化剂主要是铬基和铂基催化剂。铬基催化剂性能优异，但受毒性限制。铂基催化剂具有高活性、热稳定性和较低的积碳形成率。

3. 工业应用：由于丙烯需求不断增长和化石油储量减少，PDH变得越来越重要，与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解等方法相比，它为丙烯生产提供了更经济的路线。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。缓解积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：将Sn、La、Ga、Zn和Cu等元素掺入铂基催化剂中，已被证明可以提高催化性能和稳定性。

2. 双金属催化剂：例如，PtCu合金的形成已经显示出改善的抗积碳能力，通过抑制丙烯吸附和抑制裂解反应。

3. 修改电子性质：添加Cu等助剂可以改变Pt原子的电子环境，导致C-C键断裂的能量障碍增加，抑制甲烷的形成。

这些策略旨在提高丙烯选择性，减少积碳形成，并改善PDH过程中催化剂的整体稳定性和再生能力。
