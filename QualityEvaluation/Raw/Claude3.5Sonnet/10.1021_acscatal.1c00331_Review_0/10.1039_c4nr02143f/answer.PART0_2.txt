[1] "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production. Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives."

[2] "The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive. Moreover, the extensive exploitation of natural gas as a resource of propane guarantees the feasibility and low-cost of the PDH process."

[3] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

[5] "However, many problems of Pt, such as significant catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation and low propylene selectivity resulted from the generation of lighter hydrocarbons via CC bond cleavage, constrain the catalytic performance and limit the catalytic efficiency of Pt catalysts."

[6] "The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

[7] "Based on the previous study, coke is initially formed on the metal surface and then transferred to the support, followed by further dehydrogenation and condensation reactions on acid sites."

[8] "The Cu promoter plays a significant role in the reaction of PDH by inducing the metal interaction between Pt and Cu, which is the primary origin of the enhanced propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalyst."

[9] "The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production due to its economic advantages and ability to utilize low-cost propane from natural gas resources. The process involves converting saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into value-added olefins (propylene) using catalysts.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic, equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve good propylene yields. However, these conditions can lead to undesired side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

2. Catalyst types: The main commercial catalysts are chromium- and platinum-based. Cr-based catalysts show excellent performance but are limited by toxicity concerns. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity and stability but face challenges with coke formation and low propylene selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves. It offers a more economical route for propylene production compared to traditional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and reducing propylene selectivity. Coke initially forms on the metal surface and then transfers to the support, where further reactions occur.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Adding promoters: Elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn have been shown to enhance catalyst performance.

2. Bimetallic catalysts: The addition of Cu to Pt catalysts (PtCu/Al2O3) has demonstrated improved propylene selectivity and anti-coking ability by inhibiting propylene adsorption and suppressing cracking reactions.

3. Optimizing metal interactions: The PtCu interaction in bimetallic catalysts is the primary origin of enhanced performance, highlighting the importance of carefully designed catalyst compositions.

These strategies aim to balance high propylene yields with catalyst stability and longevity, addressing the main challenges in industrial PDH applications.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种很有前景的丙烯生产方法，因为它具有经济优势，并能够利用来自天然气资源的低成本丙烷。这个过程涉及使用催化剂将饱和烃（丙烷）转化为高附加值的烯烃（丙烯）。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热的、平衡受限的反应，需要高温才能获得良好的丙烯产率。然而，这些条件可能导致不期望的副反应和催化剂失活。

2. 催化剂类型：主要的商业催化剂是基于铬和铂的。基于铬的催化剂表现出优异的性能，但受到毒性问题的限制。基于铂的催化剂提供高活性和稳定性，但面临积碳形成和低丙烯选择性的挑战。

3. 工业应用：由于丙烯需求的持续增长和化石油储备的减少，PDH变得越来越重要。与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解等方法相比，它为丙烯生产提供了一条更经济的路线。

在基于铂的催化剂上形成的积碳显著影响了工艺效率，导致催化剂失活和降低丙烯选择性。积碳最初在金属表面形成，然后转移到载体上，在那里发生进一步的反应。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：已证明Sn、La、Ga和Zn等元素可以提高催化剂性能。

2. 双金属催化剂：向铂催化剂中添加铜（PtCu/Al2O3）已显示出改善的丙烯选择性和抗积碳能力，通过抑制丙烯吸附和抑制裂解反应。

3. 优化金属相互作用：双金属催化剂中的PtCu相互作用是性能增强的主要来源，突出了精心设计催化剂组成的重要性。

这些策略旨在平衡高丙烯产率与催化剂稳定性和寿命，解决工业PDH应用中的主要挑战。
