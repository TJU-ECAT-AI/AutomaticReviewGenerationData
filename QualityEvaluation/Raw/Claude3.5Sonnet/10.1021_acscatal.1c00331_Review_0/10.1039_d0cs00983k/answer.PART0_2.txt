[1] "Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines."

[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "As for the development of the reactor, it should be noted that low operation pressure is beneficial for improving the single-pass conversion, decreasing the amount of unconverted alkane recycled back to the reactor, and reducing the energy consumption of the whole process."

[4] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[5] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."

[6] "Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Low operation pressure is beneficial for improving single-pass conversion and reducing energy consumption.

2. Catalyst types: Supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are widely used in industry due to their satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is applied commercially for propene production, with several processes like OleflexTM and CatofinTM being widely used.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This deactivation occurs in two stages: quick deactivation followed by a steady state. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters or modifying the catalyst support to enhance coke resistance.
2. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.
3. Implementing effective regeneration processes, such as oxychlorination regeneration, where the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (usually chlorine) to redisperse sintered Pt particles.

These approaches aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles, thereby improving overall process efficiency.

催化直接脱氢法（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程是吸热的，受热力学平衡限制。低操作压力有利于提高单程转化率并降低能耗。

2. 催化剂类型：工业上广泛使用负载型PtSn和CrOx催化剂，因为它们具有令人满意的脱氢活性和选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH已商业化应用于丙烯生产，OleflexTM和CatofinTM等几种工艺被广泛使用。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。这种失活分两个阶段发生：快速失活阶段和稳态阶段。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂或改性催化剂载体以增强抗积碳能力。
2. 优化反应条件以最小化积碳形成。
3. 实施有效的再生工艺，如氧氯化再生，其中在含卤素（通常是氯）的空气存在下再生失活催化剂，以重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒。

这些方法旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高活性和选择性，并减少再生周期的频率，从而提高整体过程效率。
