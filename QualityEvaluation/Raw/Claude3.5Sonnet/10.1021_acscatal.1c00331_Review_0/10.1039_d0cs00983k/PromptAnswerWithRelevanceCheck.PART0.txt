Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: The process is endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Higher temperatures and lower pressures favor conversion but can lead to side reactions. Typical reaction temperatures are 560-630°C.

Catalyst types: Supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are widely used industrially due to their good activity and selectivity. Other catalysts like VOx and Ga2O3 have also been studied.

Industrial applications: Commercial processes like OleflexTM and CatofinTM use fixed-bed or moving-bed reactors with PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Continuous regeneration is often employed.

Coke formation on Pt catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. It occurs in two stages - rapid initial deactivation followed by steady-state coking. 

Strategies to mitigate coking and improve regeneration:
1. Increasing H2 partial pressure to inhibit coke formation
2. Optimizing catalyst composition and structure 
3. Using promoters to enhance coke resistance
4. Employing continuous regeneration systems
5. Adding chlorine during regeneration to redisperse sintered Pt particles

Overall, balancing conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability through optimized reaction conditions and catalyst design is crucial for efficient PDH processes.

[4] "Increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple. To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

[5] "The monometallic Pt can not only promote the formation of coke or coke precursors via deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, but also expedite the cleavage of CC bonds."

[6] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[3] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[4] "There are two undesirable aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction: one is high energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, and a large amount of unconverted propane must be recycled back to the reactor after separation, leading to large equipment investment and high energy consumption."

[5] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."

[6] "The catalyst deactivates quickly due to coke deposition, because the strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions."

[7] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[8] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. It involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene and hydrogen gas. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic reaction, requiring high temperatures (typically 560-630°C) and low pressures to achieve favorable equilibrium conversions. However, these conditions also promote side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

2. Catalyst types: The main industrial catalysts are supported PtSn and CrOx. PtSn catalysts offer high activity and selectivity but are expensive and prone to deactivation. CrOx catalysts are cheaper but raise environmental concerns.

3. Industrial applications: Several commercial processes exist, including OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4. These use either fixed-bed, moving-bed, or fluidized-bed reactor configurations.

4. Process challenges: PDH suffers from high energy consumption due to its endothermic nature and the need for feed recycling. Single-pass conversions are limited by thermodynamic equilibrium.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by rapidly deactivating the catalyst. This necessitates frequent regeneration, increasing operational costs and downtime. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn to Pt catalysts to reduce the strong interaction between Pt and alkenes, which leads to coke formation.

2. Introducing a second metal to form alloys with Pt, enhancing sintering resistance by anchoring Pt particles to the support.

3. Using carriers with strong interactions with Pt, such as Al2O3, to prevent Pt particle migration and coalescence.

4. Employing oxychlorination regeneration (using air and chlorine) to redisperse sintered Pt particles, as simple coke burning is insufficient and can worsen sintering.

5. Optimizing reactor design and operation to minimize coke formation, such as using low pressure-drop radial reactors and introducing small amounts of hydrogen to slow down coking.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, reduce regeneration frequency, and maintain high catalyst activity and selectivity over multiple cycles.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产的一种重要方法。它涉及从丙烷中移除氢以形成丙烯和氢气。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热反应，需要高温（通常560-630°C）和低压来实现有利的平衡转化率。然而，这些条件也促进了副反应和催化剂失活。

2. 催化剂类型：主要的工业催化剂是负载型PtSn和CrOx。PtSn催化剂具有高活性和选择性，但价格昂贵且容易失活。CrOx催化剂较便宜，但引起环境问题。

3. 工业应用：存在几种商业化工艺，包括OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4。这些工艺使用固定床、移动床或流化床反应器配置。

4. 工艺挑战：由于其吸热性质和需要进料回收，PDH具有高能耗。单程转化率受热力学平衡限制。

Pt基催化剂上的结焦形成显著影响工艺效率，导致催化剂快速失活。这需要频繁再生，增加了运营成本和停机时间。减少结焦形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 向Pt催化剂中添加Sn等助剂，以减少Pt与烯烃之间的强相互作用，从而降低结焦形成。

2. 引入第二种金属与Pt形成合金，通过将Pt颗粒锚定在载体上来增强抗烧结性。

3. 使用与Pt具有强相互作用的载体，如Al2O3，以防止Pt颗粒迁移和聚集。

4. 采用氧氯化再生（使用空气和氯）来重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒，因为简单的焦炭燃烧是不够的，还可能加剧烧结。

5. 优化反应器设计和操作以最小化结焦形成，例如使用低压降径向反应器，并引入少量氢气以减缓结焦速率。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少再生频率，并在多个循环中保持高催化剂活性和选择性。
