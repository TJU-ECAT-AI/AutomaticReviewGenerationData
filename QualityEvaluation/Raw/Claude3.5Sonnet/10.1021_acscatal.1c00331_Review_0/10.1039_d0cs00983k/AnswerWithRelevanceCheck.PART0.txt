          [1] "Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines."

[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[4] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[5] "There are two undesirable aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction: one is high energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, and a large amount of unconverted propane must be recycled back to the reactor after separation, leading to large equipment investment and high energy consumption."

[6] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."

[7] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."

[8] "The catalyst deactivates quickly due to coke deposition, because the strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions."

[9] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."

[10] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[11] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic reaction, requiring high temperatures (typically 560-630°C) and low pressures to achieve favorable equilibrium conversions. The process is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, with high energy consumption (approximately 120 kJ/mol for complete conversion).

2. Catalyst types: The main industrial catalysts are supported PtSn and CrOx. These catalysts offer satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. PtSn catalysts are highly active and selective but prone to deactivation, while CrOx catalysts are cheaper but may raise environmental concerns.

3. Industrial applications: Several commercial processes exist, including OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4. These use either fixed-bed, moving-bed, or fluidized-bed reactor configurations.

4. Process challenges: PDH suffers from high energy consumption due to its endothermic nature and the need for feed recycling. Single-pass conversions are limited by thermodynamic equilibrium, leading to large equipment investments and high energy consumption for recycling unconverted propane.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by rapidly deactivating the catalyst. This deactivation occurs in two stages: quick deactivation followed by a steady state. The strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions and coke deposition.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Increasing H2 partial pressure to inhibit coke formation, as implemented in the OleflexTM process.

2. Adding a second metal to form alloys with Pt, enhancing sintering resistance by anchoring Pt particles to the support.

3. Employing oxychlorination regeneration (using air and chlorine) to redisperse sintered Pt particles, as simple coke burning is insufficient and can worsen sintering.

4. Optimizing reactor design and operation to minimize coke formation and facilitate more efficient regeneration.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, reduce regeneration frequency, and maintain high catalyst activity and selectivity over multiple cycles, thereby improving overall process efficiency in industrial PDH operations.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热反应，需要高温（通常560-630°C）和低压来实现有利的平衡转化率。该过程受热力学平衡限制，能耗高（完全转化约需120 kJ/mol）。

2. 催化剂类型：主要的工业催化剂是负载型PtSn和CrOx。这些催化剂具有令人满意的脱氢活性和选择性。PtSn催化剂活性和选择性高，但容易失活，而CrOx催化剂较便宜，但可能引起环境问题。

3. 工业应用：存在几种商业化工艺，包括OleflexTM、CatofinTM、STARTM、LindeTM和FBD-4。这些工艺使用固定床、移动床或流化床反应器配置。

4. 工艺挑战：由于其吸热性质和需要进料回收，PDH具有高能耗。单程转化率受热力学平衡限制，导致大量设备投资和高能耗用于回收未转化的丙烷。

Pt基催化剂上的结焦形成显著影响工艺效率，导致催化剂快速失活。这种失活分为两个阶段：快速失活阶段和稳态阶段。Pt与烯烃之间的强相互作用导致严重的副反应和积碳沉积。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 增加H2分压以抑制积碳形成，如OleflexTM工艺中所实施的那样。

2. 添加第二种金属与Pt形成合金，通过将Pt颗粒锚定在载体上来增强抗烧结性。

3. 采用氧氯化再生（使用空气和氯）来重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒，因为简单的焦炭燃烧是不够的，还可能加剧烧结。

4. 优化反应器设计和操作，以最小化积碳形成并促进更高效的再生。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少再生频率，并在多个循环中保持高催化剂活性和选择性，从而提高工业PDH操作的整体工艺效率。
