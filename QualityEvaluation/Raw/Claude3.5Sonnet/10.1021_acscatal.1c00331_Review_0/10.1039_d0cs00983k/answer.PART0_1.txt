[1] "Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines."

[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[4] "Increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple. To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

[5] "The monometallic Pt can not only promote the formation of coke or coke precursors via deep dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, but also expedite the cleavage of CC bonds."

[6] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. To increase conversion, strategies include increasing reaction temperature, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressure, and lowering H2 partial pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are widely used in industry due to their satisfactory activity and selectivity. 

3. Industrial applications: PDH is applied commercially, but there's still room for improvement, especially in energy efficiency and environmental impact.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency:

1. It promotes deep dehydrogenation and CC bond cleavage, reducing selectivity.

2. It causes catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Adding promoters (e.g., Sn) to Pt catalysts to reduce coke formation.

2. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coking.

3. Using air regeneration in the presence of a halide (typically chlorine) to redisperse sintered Pt particles and restore activity.

4. Developing more coke-resistant and easily regenerable catalysts.

5. Improving reactor designs to reduce coking and facilitate more efficient regeneration.

丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程是吸热的，并受热力学平衡限制。为提高转化率，采取的策略包括提高反应温度、降低烃类分压和降低H2分压。

2. 催化剂类型：负载型PtSn和CrOx催化剂在工业中广泛使用，因为它们具有令人满意的活性和选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH已经商业化应用，但在能源效率和环境影响方面仍有改进空间。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率：

1. 它促进深度脱氢和CC键断裂，降低选择性。

2. 它导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略：

1. 向Pt催化剂中添加助剂（如Sn）以减少积碳形成。

2. 优化反应条件以最小化积碳。

3. 在含卤素（通常是氯）的环境中使用空气再生，以重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒并恢复活性。

4. 开发更耐积碳和易于再生的催化剂。

5. 改进反应器设计，减少积碳并促进更高效的再生。
