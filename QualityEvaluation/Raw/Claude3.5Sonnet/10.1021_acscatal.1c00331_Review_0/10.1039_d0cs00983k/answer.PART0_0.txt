[1] "Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines."

[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[4] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."

[5] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."

[6] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: The process is endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Higher temperatures and lower pressures favor conversion but can lead to side reactions. Typical reaction temperatures are 560-630°C.

Catalyst types: Supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are widely used industrially due to their good activity and selectivity. Other catalysts like VOx and Ga2O3 have also been studied.

Industrial applications: Commercial processes like OleflexTM and CatofinTM use fixed-bed or moving-bed reactors with PtSn or CrOx catalysts. Continuous regeneration is often employed.

Coke formation on Pt catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. It occurs in two stages - rapid initial deactivation followed by steady-state coking. 

Strategies to mitigate coking and improve regeneration:
1. Increasing H2 partial pressure to inhibit coke formation
2. Optimizing catalyst composition and structure 
3. Using promoters to enhance coke resistance
4. Employing continuous regeneration systems
5. Adding chlorine during regeneration to redisperse sintered Pt particles

Overall, balancing conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability through optimized reaction conditions and catalyst design is crucial for efficient PDH processes.

催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

反应条件：该过程是吸热的，并受热力学平衡限制。较高的温度和较低的压力有利于转化，但可能导致副反应。典型的反应温度为560-630°C。

催化剂类型：负载型PtSn和CrOx催化剂由于其良好的活性和选择性而被广泛用于工业生产。其他催化剂如VOx和Ga2O3也有研究。

工业应用：商业化过程如OleflexTM和CatofinTM使用固定床或移动床反应器，采用PtSn或CrOx催化剂。通常采用连续再生。

Pt催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。它分两个阶段发生 - 快速初始失活followed by稳态积碳。

减少积碳和改善再生的策略：
1. 增加H2分压以抑制积碳形成
2. 优化催化剂组成和结构
3. 使用助剂增强抗积碳能力
4. 采用连续再生系统
5. 再生过程中添加氯以重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒

总的来说，通过优化反应条件和催化剂设计来平衡转化率、选择性和催化剂稳定性对于高效PDH过程至关重要。
