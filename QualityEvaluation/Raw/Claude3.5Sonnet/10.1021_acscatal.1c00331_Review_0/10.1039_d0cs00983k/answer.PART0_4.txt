[1] "Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines."

[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[4] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."

[5] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."

[6] "For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is endothermic and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Typical conditions involve temperatures around 600°C and pressures slightly above atmospheric.

2. Catalyst types: Supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts are widely used in industry due to their satisfactory activity and selectivity. 

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been commercially implemented in processes like OleflexTM and CatofinTM.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This occurs in two stages: rapid initial deactivation followed by a steady state. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Increasing H2 partial pressure to inhibit coke formation, as done in the OleflexTM process.

2. Regenerating spent catalysts using air and a halide (typically chlorine) to burn off coke and redisperse sintered Pt particles.

3. Optimizing catalyst composition and reactor design to enhance coking resistance and facilitate more efficient regeneration.

These approaches aim to extend catalyst lifetime, reduce regeneration frequency, and maintain high process efficiency in industrial PDH operations.

催化直接脱氢是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程是吸热的，受热力学平衡限制。典型条件包括约600°C的温度和略高于大气压的压力。

2. 催化剂类型：负载型PtSn和CrOx催化剂因其令人满意的活性和选择性而广泛应用于工业。

3. 工业应用：PDH已在OleflexTM和CatofinTM等工艺中得到商业化应用。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。这发生在两个阶段：快速的初始失活，随后是稳态。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 增加H2分压以抑制积碳形成，如OleflexTM工艺中所做的那样。

2. 使用空气和卤化物（通常是氯）再生失效催化剂，以燃烧积碳并重新分散烧结的Pt颗粒。

3. 优化催化剂组成和反应器设计，以增强抗积碳能力并促进更高效的再生。

这些方法旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少再生频率，并在工业PDH操作中保持高过程效率。
