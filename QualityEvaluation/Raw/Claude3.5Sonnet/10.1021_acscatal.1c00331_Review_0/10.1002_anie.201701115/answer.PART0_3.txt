[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt."

[5] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

[6] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer. Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[7] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped. The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to the growing demand for light olefins in the chemical industry. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene using a catalyst.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. This is necessary to achieve economically viable yields.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn catalysts, are commonly used. The addition of Sn to Pt improves selectivity towards propene.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is practiced commercially to produce light olefins, which are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry.

However, the high reaction temperatures lead to challenges, primarily catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by reducing catalyst activity and selectivity.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using CeO2 as a support: CeO2 facilitates the redispersion of Pt atoms during regeneration without requiring corrosive halogens.

2. Adding water vapor: The redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which significantly reduces coke deposition during propane conversion.

3. Oxidative regeneration: Carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, though redispersion of Pt remains challenging.

4. Developing novel catalyst formulations: PtSn/CeO2 catalysts show improved stability and regenerability compared to traditional alumina-supported catalysts.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, improve process efficiency, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles in industrial PDH applications.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为化学工业对轻烯烃的需求不断增长。该过程涉及使用催化剂从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温。这对于实现经济可行的产率是必要的。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用基于铂的催化剂，特别是PtSn催化剂。向Pt中添加Sn可以提高对丙烯的选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH在商业上用于生产轻烯烃，这是化学工业中至关重要的建筑模块。

然而，高反应温度会导致挑战，主要是通过烧结和积碳造成催化剂失活。Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，降低了催化剂活性和选择性。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 使用CeO2作为支撑：CeO2在再生过程中促进Pt原子的再分散，无需使用腐蚀性卤素。

2. 添加水蒸气：CeO2的氧化还原特性允许使用水蒸气，这显著减少了丙烷转化过程中的积碳沉积。

3. 氧化再生：碳沉积物可以在空气中再生期间有效氧化，尽管Pt的再分散仍然具有挑战性。

4. 开发新型催化剂配方：与传统的氧化铝支撑催化剂相比，PtSn/CeO2催化剂显示出改善的稳定性和可再生性。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，提高过程效率，并减少工业PDH应用中再生周期的频率。
