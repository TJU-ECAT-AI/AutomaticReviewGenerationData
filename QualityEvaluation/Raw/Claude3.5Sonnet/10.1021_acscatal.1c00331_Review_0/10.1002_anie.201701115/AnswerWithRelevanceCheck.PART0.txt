          [1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

[5] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[6] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

[7] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped. The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to growing demand for light olefins in the chemical industry. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene using a catalyst. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (around 680°C) due to its endothermic nature. This is necessary to achieve economically viable yields.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn catalysts, are commonly used. The addition of Sn to Pt improves selectivity towards propene.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is practiced commercially to produce light olefins, which are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This leads to reduced catalytic activity and selectivity over time. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using CeO2 as a support: CeO2 facilitates the redispersion of Pt atoms without the need for corrosive halogens.

2. Adding water vapor: Co-feeding water vapor during the reaction can significantly reduce coke formation. Studies show coke content decreasing from 2.8wt% to 0.5wt% when water vapor is added.

3. Oxidative regeneration: Carbon deposits can be effectively removed by oxidation in air, though care must be taken to prevent Pt sintering.

4. Developing novel catalyst formulations: PtSn/CeO2 catalysts show improved stability and regenerability, with very low coke content (<1wt%) after extended use at high temperatures.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, improve process efficiency, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles in industrial PDH applications.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，这是由于化学工业对轻烯烃的需求不断增长。该过程涉及使用催化剂从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于PDH是吸热反应，需要高温（约680°C）。这对于实现经济可行的产率是必要的。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用基于铂的催化剂，特别是PtSn催化剂。向Pt中添加Sn可以提高对丙烯的选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH在商业上用于生产轻烯烃，这是化学工业中至关重要的建筑模块。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。这导致催化活性和选择性随时间降低。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 使用CeO2作为载体：CeO2促进Pt原子的再分散，无需使用腐蚀性卤素。

2. 添加水蒸气：在反应过程中共进料水蒸气可以显著减少积碳形成。研究表明，添加水蒸气时，积碳含量从2.8wt%降低到0.5wt%。

3. 氧化再生：碳沉积物可以通过空气中的氧化有效去除，但必须注意防止Pt烧结。

4. 开发新型催化剂配方：PtSn/CeO2催化剂显示出改善的稳定性和可再生性，在高温下长期使用后积碳含量很低（<1wt%）。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，提高过程效率，并减少工业PDH应用中再生周期的频率。
