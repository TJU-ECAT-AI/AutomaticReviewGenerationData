[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored."

[5] "The redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

[6] "The PtSn/CeO2 catalyst contains 1wt% Pt and 3wt% Sn, with an atomic ratio of about Pt:Sn=1:5 (as confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA))."

[7] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[8] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production, driven by the growing demand for light olefins in the chemical industry. The process involves the conversion of propane to propene using a catalyst, typically at high temperatures.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Typical temperatures are around 680°C to achieve economically attractive yields.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used, often modified with additives like tin (Sn) to improve selectivity and stability. The study focuses on PtSn/CeO2 catalysts, containing 1wt% Pt and 3wt% Sn.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is practiced commercially for the production of light olefins, which are important building blocks in the chemical industry.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This, along with sintering, is a major challenge in high-temperature PDH reactions. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using water vapor as a co-feed: This approach almost completely eliminates coke deposition during propane conversion at high temperatures.

2. Employing CeO2 as a support: The redox properties of CeO2 allow for the use of water vapor as an oxidant, suppressing coke formation.

3. Catalyst design: PtSn/CeO2 catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after extended runs at high temperatures.

4. Oxidative regeneration: Mild oxidative conditions can be used to redisperse Pt atoms on CeO2 support without the need for chlorine-containing molecules, providing a regenerable and thermally stable catalyst.

These strategies help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity over extended periods, improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法，这是由于化学工业对轻质烯烃需求的增长所驱动的。该过程涉及使用催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯，通常在高温下进行。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温。为了达到经济上有吸引力的产率，典型温度约为680°C。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用铂基催化剂，经常用锡（Sn）等添加剂改性以提高选择性和稳定性。该研究重点关注PtSn/CeO2催化剂，含有1wt%的Pt和3wt%的Sn。

3. 工业应用：PDH在商业上用于生产轻质烯烃，这是化学工业的重要基础原料。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响了过程效率，导致催化剂失活。这与烧结一起，是高温PDH反应面临的主要挑战。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 使用水蒸气作为共进料：这种方法几乎完全消除了高温下丙烷转化过程中的积碳沉积。

2. 使用CeO2作为载体：CeO2的氧化还原性质允许使用水蒸气作为氧化剂，抑制积碳形成。

3. 催化剂设计：PtSn/CeO2催化剂在高温下长时间运行后显示出很低的积碳含量（<1wt%）。

4. 氧化再生：可以使用温和的氧化条件在CeO2载体上重新分散Pt原子，无需使用含氯分子，提供了可再生和热稳定的催化剂。

这些策略有助于在长时间内保持催化剂的活性和选择性，提高PDH过程的整体效率和可持续性。
