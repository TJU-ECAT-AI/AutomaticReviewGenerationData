[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation. While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt."

[4] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[5] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst. When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped."

[6] "The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

[7] "To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored."

[8] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures due to its endothermic nature. This is necessary to achieve economically viable yields.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used. The addition of tin (Sn) to platinum can improve selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is commercially practiced to meet the growing demand for light olefins, which are crucial building blocks in the chemical industry.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding water vapor to the feed: This can substantially reduce coke formation, with studies showing coke content decreasing from 2.8wt% to 0.5wt% when water vapor is added.

2. Using CeO2 as a support: CeO2 facilitates the redispersion of Pt atoms during regeneration without requiring corrosive halogens, which are typically needed for other supports like Al2O3.

3. Oxidative regeneration: Carbon deposits can be effectively removed by oxidation in air, though care must be taken to prevent Pt sintering during this process.

4. Developing novel catalyst formulations: PtSn clusters on CeO2 supports have shown promise in maintaining small particle sizes and resisting sintering at high temperatures.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, improve process efficiency, and reduce the frequency and severity of regeneration cycles in industrial PDH applications.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于PDH是吸热反应，需要高温条件。这对于实现经济可行的产率是必要的。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用铂基催化剂。向铂中添加锡（Sn）可以提高选择性和稳定性。

3. 工业应用：PDH在商业上被广泛应用，以满足对轻烯烃日益增长的需求，这些轻烯烃是化学工业中至关重要的基础原料。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 向进料中添加水蒸气：这可以大大减少积碳形成，研究表明当添加水蒸气时，积碳含量从2.8wt%降低到0.5wt%。

2. 使用CeO2作为载体：CeO2在再生过程中促进铂原子的重新分散，而无需使用腐蚀性卤素，而这些卤素通常是其他载体（如Al2O3）所需要的。

3. 氧化再生：通过空气氧化可以有效去除碳沉积物，但在此过程中必须注意防止铂的烧结。

4. 开发新型催化剂配方：CeO2载体上的PtSn簇在保持小粒径和抵抗高温烧结方面表现出良好的前景。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，提高过程效率，并减少工业PDH应用中再生循环的频率和严重程度。
