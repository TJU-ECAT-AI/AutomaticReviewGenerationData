<quotes>

[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "Carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt."

[5] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[6] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

[7] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped. The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to growing demand for light olefins in the chemical industry. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (around 680°C) to achieve economically viable yields, as it is an endothermic reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn catalysts, are commonly used. The addition of Sn to Pt improves selectivity towards propene.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is practiced commercially to produce light olefins from abundant light alkanes, such as those from shale gas deposits.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This leads to reduced conversion rates and selectivity. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Co-feed water vapor: Adding water vapor during the reaction suppresses coke formation, reducing coke content from 2.8wt% to 0.5wt% in some cases.

2. Use of CeO2 as a support: CeO2 supports allow for easier redispersion of Pt atoms during regeneration without the need for chlorine-containing molecules.

3. Oxidative regeneration: Periodic oxidation in air can remove carbon deposits, though care must be taken to avoid sintering of Pt particles.

4. Develop thermally stable catalysts: PtSn clusters on CeO2 supports show improved thermal stability and resistance to sintering compared to traditional alumina-supported catalysts.

These strategies help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，这是由于化学工业对轻烯烃的需求不断增长。该过程涉及从丙烷中移除氢以形成丙烯。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH需要高温（约680°C）才能达到经济可行的产率，因为它是一个吸热反应。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用铂基催化剂，尤其是PtSn催化剂。向Pt中添加Sn可以提高对丙烯的选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH在商业上被用于从丰富的轻烷烃（如页岩气中的烷烃）生产轻烯烃。

在铂基催化剂上形成的焦炭显著影响了过程效率，导致催化剂失活。这会导致转化率和选择性降低。为了减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生：

1. 共进料水蒸气：在反应过程中添加水蒸气可抑制焦炭形成，在某些情况下可将焦炭含量从2.8wt%降至0.5wt%。

2. 使用CeO2作为载体：CeO2载体允许在再生过程中更容易地重新分散Pt原子，而无需使用含氯分子。

3. 氧化再生：定期在空气中氧化可以去除碳沉积物，但必须注意避免Pt颗粒烧结。

4. 开发热稳定性催化剂：与传统的氧化铝载体催化剂相比，CeO2载体上的PtSn簇显示出更好的热稳定性和抗烧结性。

这些策略有助于在多个反应-再生循环中保持催化剂的活性和选择性，从而提高PDH过程的整体效率和可持续性。

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production, driven by the growing demand for light olefins in the chemical industry. The process involves the conversion of propane to propene using a catalyst, typically at high temperatures.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Typical temperatures are around 680°C to achieve economically attractive yields.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used, often modified with additives like tin (Sn) to improve selectivity and stability. The study focuses on PtSn/CeO2 catalysts, containing 1wt% Pt and 3wt% Sn.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is practiced commercially for the production of light olefins, which are important building blocks in the chemical industry.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This, along with sintering, is a major challenge in high-temperature PDH reactions. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using water vapor as a co-feed: This approach almost completely eliminates coke deposition during propane conversion at high temperatures.

2. Employing CeO2 as a support: The redox properties of CeO2 allow for the use of water vapor as an oxidant, suppressing coke formation.

3. Catalyst design: PtSn/CeO2 catalysts show very low coke content (<1wt%) after extended runs at high temperatures.

4. Oxidative regeneration: Mild oxidative conditions can be used to redisperse Pt atoms on CeO2 support without the need for chlorine-containing molecules, providing a regenerable and thermally stable catalyst.

These strategies help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity over extended periods, improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.
