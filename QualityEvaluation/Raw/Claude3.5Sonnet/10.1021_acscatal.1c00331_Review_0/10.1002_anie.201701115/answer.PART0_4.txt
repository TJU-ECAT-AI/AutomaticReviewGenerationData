[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt."

[5] "To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored."

[6] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

[7] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[8] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. The process involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (around 680°C) due to its endothermic nature. These high temperatures are necessary to achieve economically viable yields.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts, particularly PtSn catalysts, are commonly used for PDH. The addition of Sn to Pt improves selectivity towards propene.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the growing demand for light olefins and the abundance of light alkanes from shale gas deposits.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This leads to reduced catalytic activity and selectivity over time. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using CeO2 as a support: CeO2 facilitates the redispersion of Pt atoms without the need for corrosive halogens, which are typically required for catalyst regeneration.

2. Adding water vapor: Co-feeding water vapor during the reaction can significantly reduce coke formation. This is due to the redox properties of CeO2, which allow water vapor to act as an oxidant.

3. Oxidative regeneration: Carbon deposits can be effectively removed by oxidation in air. However, this process is more challenging for Pt redispersion.

4. Developing stable catalysts: The PtSn/CeO2 catalyst described in the literature shows remarkable stability and regenerability, with very low coke content (<1 wt%) after extended use at high temperatures.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles, and improve overall process efficiency in industrial PDH applications.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。该过程涉及从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。这个过程的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于PDH是吸热反应，需要高温（约680°C）。这些高温是实现经济可行产率所必需的。

2. 催化剂类型：铂基催化剂，特别是PtSn催化剂，常用于PDH。向Pt中添加Sn可以提高对丙烯的选择性。

3. 工业应用：由于轻烯烃需求的增长和页岩气中轻烷烃的丰富，PDH变得越来越重要。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成对过程效率有显著影响，会导致催化剂失活。这导致催化活性和选择性随时间降低。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 使用CeO2作为载体：CeO2可以促进Pt原子的再分散，无需使用腐蚀性卤素，而后者通常用于催化剂再生。

2. 添加水蒸气：在反应过程中共进料水蒸气可以显著减少积碳形成。这是由于CeO2的氧化还原特性，使水蒸气可以作为氧化剂。

3. 氧化再生：碳沉积物可以通过空气中的氧化有效去除。然而，这个过程对Pt的再分散更具挑战性。

4. 开发稳定的催化剂：文献中描述的PtSn/CeO2催化剂表现出显著的稳定性和再生能力，在高温下长期使用后积碳含量很低（<1 wt%）。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少再生周期的频率，并提高工业PDH应用的整体过程效率。
