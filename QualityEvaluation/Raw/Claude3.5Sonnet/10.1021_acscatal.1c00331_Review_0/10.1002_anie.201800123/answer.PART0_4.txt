[1] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[5] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."

[6] "Clearly, the coke deposits more slowly on those catalysts covered with hydroxyl groups, and this is the reason why the catalysts with sufficient H2 pretreatment possess higher stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically occurs at high temperatures (e.g., 600°C as mentioned in the study).

2. Catalyst types: Industrial PDH catalysts include Pt-based, CrOx-based, and supported vanadium catalysts. Vanadium catalysts are considered promising alternatives due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has become more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production, especially with the increased availability of low-cost propane from shale gas.

Coke formation is a major factor in catalyst deactivation, impacting process efficiency. The study focuses on vanadium catalysts rather than Pt-based catalysts, but it demonstrates that coke formation can be mitigated by modifying the catalyst surface. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Pre-treatment with H2 to form hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, which slows coke deposition.

2. Tuning the oxidation state of the catalyst (e.g., maintaining V4+ rather than V3+) to balance activity and stability.

3. Optimizing catalyst structure to promote propylene desorption and prevent further dehydrogenation to coke precursors.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime and improve overall process efficiency in PDH reactions.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯来作为丙烯生产的一种方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行（例如，研究中提到的600°C）。

2. 催化剂类型：工业PDH催化剂包括基于Pt的、基于CrOx的和负载型钒催化剂。钒催化剂被认为是很有前景的替代品，因为它们具有良好的活性、选择性和再生性能。

3. 工业应用：随着页岩气生产的增长和低价丙烷的可用性增加，PDH在定向丙烯生产中变得更具商业吸引力。

积碳形成是催化剂失活的主要因素，影响过程效率。尽管这项研究主要关注钒催化剂而非基于Pt的催化剂，但它表明通过修改催化剂表面可以减少积碳形成。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 用H2预处理以在催化剂表面形成羟基，这可以减缓积碳沉积。

2. 调节催化剂的氧化态（例如，保持V4+而非V3+）以平衡活性和稳定性。

3. 优化催化剂结构，促进丙烯脱附并防止进一步脱氢形成积碳前体。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命并提高PDH反应的整体过程效率。
