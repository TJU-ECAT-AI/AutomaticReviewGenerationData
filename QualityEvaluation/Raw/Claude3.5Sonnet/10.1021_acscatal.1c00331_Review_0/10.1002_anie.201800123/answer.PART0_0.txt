Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has become more commercially attractive due to the low price of propane from shale gas production. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The literature mentions reactions carried out at 600°C, but doesn't provide detailed information on pressure or other conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Industrial PDH catalysts include Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, but these have limitations due to high cost and toxicity respectively. Supported vanadium catalysts are presented as a promising alternative due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

3. Industrial applications: Propene produced through PDH is used as a feedstock for various products including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and phenol.

The literature doesn't specifically discuss coke formation on Pt-based catalysts. However, it does mention that coke deposition is the main reason for deactivation of vanadium catalysts. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study explores the use of surface hydroxyl groups on supported vanadium catalysts. These hydroxyl groups were found to improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, albeit at the cost of some catalytic activity.

催化丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，由于页岩气生产使丙烷价格降低，该方法变得更具商业吸引力。这个过程涉及从丙烷中移除氢以形成丙烯。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：文献提到在600°C下进行反应，但没有提供关于压力或其他条件的详细信息。

2. 催化剂类型：工业PDH催化剂包括基于铂和基于氧化铬的催化剂，但这些催化剂由于高成本和毒性而受到限制。支持的钒催化剂被认为是一种有前景的替代品，因为它们具有良好的活性、选择性和再生性能。

3. 工业应用：通过PDH生产的丙烯用作各种产品的原料，包括聚丙烯、环氧丙烷、丙烯腈和苯酚。

文献没有具体讨论铂基催化剂上的积碳形成。然而，它确实提到积碳沉积是钒催化剂失活的主要原因。为了减少积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，该研究探讨了在支持的钒催化剂上使用表面羟基。这些羟基被发现可以通过抑制积碳沉积来改善催化剂稳定性，尽管会牺牲一些催化活性。
