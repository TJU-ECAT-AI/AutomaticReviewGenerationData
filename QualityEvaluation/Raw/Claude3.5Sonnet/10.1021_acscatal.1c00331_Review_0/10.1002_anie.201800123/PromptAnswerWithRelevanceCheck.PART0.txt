Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has become more commercially attractive due to the low price of propane from shale gas production. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The literature mentions reactions carried out at 600°C, but doesn't provide detailed information on pressure or other conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Industrial PDH catalysts include Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, but these have limitations due to high cost and toxicity respectively. Supported vanadium catalysts are presented as a promising alternative due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

3. Industrial applications: Propene produced through PDH is used as a feedstock for various products including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and phenol.

The literature doesn't specifically discuss coke formation on Pt-based catalysts. However, it does mention that coke deposition is the main reason for deactivation of vanadium catalysts. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study explores the use of surface hydroxyl groups on supported vanadium catalysts. These hydroxyl groups were found to improve catalyst stability by suppressing coke deposition, albeit at the cost of some catalytic activity.

催化丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)是一种生产丙烯的方法，由于页岩气生产使丙烷价格降低，该方法变得更具商业吸引力。这个过程涉及从丙烷中移除氢以形成丙烯。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：文献提到在600°C下进行反应，但没有提供关于压力或其他条件的详细信息。

2. 催化剂类型：工业PDH催化剂包括基于铂和基于氧化铬的催化剂，但这些催化剂由于高成本和毒性而受到限制。支持的钒催化剂被认为是一种有前景的替代品，因为它们具有良好的活性、选择性和再生性能。

3. 工业应用：通过PDH生产的丙烯用作各种产品的原料，包括聚丙烯、环氧丙烷、丙烯腈和苯酚。

文献没有具体讨论铂基催化剂上的积碳形成。然而，它确实提到积碳沉积是钒催化剂失活的主要原因。为了减少积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，该研究探讨了在支持的钒催化剂上使用表面羟基。这些羟基被发现可以通过抑制积碳沉积来改善催化剂稳定性，尽管会牺牲一些催化活性。

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[3] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[4] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."

[7] "Although V2O3 (structure III) is active for dehydrogenation, it also can easily induce coke formation because of its strong binding towards propylene."

[8] "In contrast, the formation of acetone is much harder over structure II, thus leading to favorable production of propylene (see FigureS32). Moreover, the existence of surface OH groups blocks the exposed V ion and thus enhances C3H6 desorption and prevents coke formation, resulting in higher stability of the catalyst."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propylene. This process has become more commercially attractive due to the low price of propane from shale gas production. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 600°C as mentioned in the study).

2. Catalyst types: Industrial PDH catalysts include Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, but these have limitations such as high cost and toxicity. Supported vanadium catalysts are promising alternatives due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used for on-purpose propylene production, which is an important feedstock for various products like polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and phenol.

Coke formation is a major issue affecting process efficiency in PDH. For vanadium-based catalysts:

1. Coke deposition is the main reason for catalyst deactivation.
2. Highly reduced V2O3 structures can induce coke formation due to strong binding with propylene.
3. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include:
   a. Controlling the oxidation state of vanadium.
   b. Introducing surface hydroxyl groups, which block exposed V ions, enhance propylene desorption, and prevent coke formation.
   c. Tuning the catalyst structure to favor propylene production over acetone formation.

These strategies can improve catalyst stability and regeneration performance. While the document doesn't specifically address Pt-based catalysts, similar principles of controlling surface structure and reaction conditions likely apply to mitigate coke formation and improve regeneration for those catalysts as well.

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 600°C as mentioned in the study).

2. Catalyst types: Industrial catalysts include Pt-based, CrOx-based, and supported vanadium catalysts. Each has its advantages and drawbacks:
   - Pt-based: Effective but expensive
   - CrOx-based: Effective but toxic
   - Supported vanadium catalysts: Considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance

3. Industrial applications: PDH has become more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production due to the low price of propane from shale gas production.

Coke formation is a significant issue in PDH, leading to catalyst deactivation. For vanadium-based catalysts, strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Pretreatment with H2: This creates hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, which slow down coke deposition and improve catalyst stability.

2. Controlling the oxidation state of vanadium: The study suggests that V4+ species (with hydroxyl groups) show better resistance to coke formation compared to V3+ species.

3. Balancing activity and stability: While hydroxyl groups improve stability, they slightly reduce initial activity. Optimizing this trade-off is crucial for overall process efficiency.

The study doesn't specifically address coke formation on Pt-based catalysts or their regeneration strategies. However, the principles of surface modification to resist coke formation may be applicable to other catalyst types as well.
