[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "Commercial production of propylene is mainly based on steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[3] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[4] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[5] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[6] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."

[7] "Clearly, the coke deposits more slowly on those catalysts covered with hydroxyl groups, and this is the reason why the catalysts with sufficient H2 pretreatment possess higher stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propylene. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 600°C as mentioned in the study).

2. Catalyst types: Industrial catalysts include Pt-based, CrOx-based, and supported vanadium catalysts. Each has its advantages and drawbacks:
   - Pt-based: Effective but expensive
   - CrOx-based: Effective but toxic
   - Supported vanadium catalysts: Considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity, and excellent regeneration performance

3. Industrial applications: PDH has become more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production due to the low price of propane from shale gas production.

Coke formation is a significant issue in PDH, leading to catalyst deactivation. For vanadium-based catalysts, strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Pretreatment with H2: This creates hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, which slow down coke deposition and improve catalyst stability.

2. Controlling the oxidation state of vanadium: The study suggests that V4+ species (with hydroxyl groups) show better resistance to coke formation compared to V3+ species.

3. Balancing activity and stability: While hydroxyl groups improve stability, they slightly reduce initial activity. Optimizing this trade-off is crucial for overall process efficiency.

The study doesn't specifically address coke formation on Pt-based catalysts or their regeneration strategies. However, the principles of surface modification to resist coke formation may be applicable to other catalyst types as well.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯来作为丙烯生产的一种方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行（例如，研究中提到的600°C）。

2. 催化剂类型：工业催化剂包括基于Pt、基于CrOx和负载型钒催化剂。每种都有其优缺点：
   - 基于Pt：有效但昂贵
   - 基于CrOx：有效但有毒
   - 负载型钒催化剂：活性可观，丙烯选择性适当，再生性能优异

3. 工业应用：由于页岩气生产使丙烷价格降低，PDH已成为更具商业吸引力的定向丙烯生产方法。

结焦是PDH中的一个重大问题，会导致催化剂失活。对于钒基催化剂，减少结焦形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 用H2预处理：这在催化剂表面形成羟基，减缓结焦沉积并提高催化剂稳定性。

2. 控制钒的氧化态：研究表明，V4+物种（带有羟基）比V3+物种表现出更好的抗结焦能力。

3. 平衡活性和稳定性：虽然羟基提高了稳定性，但略微降低了初始活性。优化这种权衡对整体过程效率至关重要。

该研究没有具体涉及Pt基催化剂的结焦形成或其再生策略。然而，表面改性以抵抗结焦形成的原理可能适用于其他类型的催化剂。
