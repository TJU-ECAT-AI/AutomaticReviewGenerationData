The provided literature does not contain sufficient information to fully answer the question about the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production. The document appears to focus on specific aspects of kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations and theoretical calculations related to PDH on Pt catalysts, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the process, reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications.

However, we can extract some relevant information:

1. The study focuses on propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) on Pt catalysts, indicating that Pt-based catalysts are used in this process.

2. The research investigates coke precursor formation during PDH, suggesting that coke formation is a significant issue in this process.

3. The study examines the effects of different H2 pressures on reaction rates, implying that hydrogen pressure is an important parameter in PDH.

4. The flow direction of C species in PDH is analyzed, providing insights into the reaction pathway and intermediate species formed during the process.

Without more comprehensive information, it is not possible to fully address the questions about reaction conditions, catalyst types, industrial applications, coke formation impact, and mitigation strategies. The document focuses on theoretical aspects and simulations rather than practical applications and process optimization.

提供的文献没有足够的信息来全面回答关于丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯的问题。该文件似乎主要关注Pt催化剂上PDH的动力学蒙特卡罗(kMC)模拟和理论计算的具体方面，而不是提供过程、反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用的全面概述。

然而，我们可以提取一些相关信息：

1. 该研究集中在Pt催化剂上的丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)，表明在这个过程中使用了基于Pt的催化剂。

2. 研究调查了PDH过程中焦炭前体的形成，表明焦炭形成是这个过程中的一个重要问题。

3. 该研究考察了不同H2压力对反应速率的影响，暗示氢气压力是PDH中的一个重要参数。

4. 分析了PDH中C物种的流动方向，提供了关于反应途径和过程中形成的中间物种的见解。

由于缺乏更全面的信息，无法完全解答关于反应条件、催化剂类型、工业应用、焦炭形成影响和缓解策略的问题。该文件主要集中在理论方面和模拟，而不是实际应用和过程优化。

The literature provided does not directly answer the detailed questions about the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production, reaction conditions, catalyst types, industrial applications, coke formation impact, and mitigation strategies. The document appears to be a supporting information section for a study on propane dehydrogenation using Pt catalysts, focusing on kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations.

However, we can infer a few relevant points:

1. The study involves propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) on Platinum (Pt) catalysts.

2. The research considers the effect of hydrogen pressure on the reaction, as evidenced by the comparison of reaction counts at different H2 pressures.

3. The study examines the flow of carbon species during PDH, which may relate to coke formation.

4. The simulation considers various elementary steps in the PDH process, including C-H and C-C bond breaking.

5. The research appears to be aimed at understanding the mechanisms of PDH and potentially the formation of coke precursors on Pt catalysts.

Without more comprehensive information, it's not possible to provide detailed answers about reaction conditions, industrial applications, specific impacts of coke formation, or mitigation strategies. The study seems to be focused on fundamental mechanistic understanding rather than practical industrial applications or process improvements.
