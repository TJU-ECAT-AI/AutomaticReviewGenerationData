The literature provided does not directly answer the question about the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) as a method for propene production. However, based on the information given, we can infer some aspects of the process:

1. The study focuses on propane direct dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts, indicating that Pt-based catalysts are used in this process.

2. The research involves kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to study the reaction mechanism and coke formation.

3. The study considers various reaction conditions, including different pressures of H2 (0 and 1 kPa), which suggests that hydrogen pressure is an important factor in the PDH process.

4. Coke formation is a significant concern in the process, as indicated by the title mentioning the "Janus character of the coke precursor."

5. The research examines various surface reactions, adsorption processes, and lateral interactions between species on the Pt(111) surface, which are crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanism.

6. The study analyzes the coverage of adsorption species over time and the flow direction of C species during PDH, providing insights into the reaction pathways and potential intermediates.

7. The research considers both forward and backward reactions, which is important for understanding the overall efficiency and selectivity of the process.

While the document doesn't provide direct information on industrial applications or specific strategies to mitigate coke formation, it does offer detailed insights into the fundamental aspects of the PDH process on Pt catalysts. This type of research is crucial for developing improved catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions in industrial applications.

虽然所提供的文献并未直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)作为丙烯生产方法的问题，但根据所给信息，我们可以推断出该过程的一些方面：

1. 该研究聚焦于Pt催化剂上的丙烷直接脱氢，表明PDH过程中使用了基于Pt的催化剂。

2. 研究涉及动力学蒙特卡罗(kMC)模拟，用于研究反应机理和积碳形成。

3. 研究考虑了各种反应条件，包括不同的H2压力（0和1 kPa），这表明氢气压力是PDH过程中的一个重要因素。

4. 积碳形成是该过程中的一个重要问题，这从标题中提到"焦炭前体的双面性"可以看出。

5. 研究考察了Pt(111)表面上的各种表面反应、吸附过程和物种间的侧向相互作用，这对理解催化机理至关重要。

6. 研究分析了吸附物种随时间的覆盖率和PDH过程中C物种的流动方向，为了解反应途径和潜在中间体提供了见解。

7. 研究考虑了正反应和逆反应，这对理解整个过程的效率和选择性很重要。

虽然文献没有提供关于工业应用或减缓积碳形成的具体策略的直接信息，但它确实对Pt催化剂上PDH过程的基本方面提供了详细的见解。这类研究对于开发改进的催化剂和优化工业应用中的反应条件至关重要。
