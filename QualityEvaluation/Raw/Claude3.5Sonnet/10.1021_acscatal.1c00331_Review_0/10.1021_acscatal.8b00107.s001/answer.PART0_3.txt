The literature provided does not directly answer the detailed questions about the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production, reaction conditions, catalyst types, industrial applications, coke formation impact, and mitigation strategies. The document appears to be a supporting information section for a study on propane dehydrogenation using Pt catalysts, focusing on kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations.

However, we can infer a few relevant points:

1. The study involves propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) on Platinum (Pt) catalysts.

2. The research considers the effect of hydrogen pressure on the reaction, as evidenced by the comparison of reaction counts at different H2 pressures.

3. The study examines the flow of carbon species during PDH, which may relate to coke formation.

4. The simulation considers various elementary steps in the PDH process, including C-H and C-C bond breaking.

5. The research appears to be aimed at understanding the mechanisms of PDH and potentially the formation of coke precursors on Pt catalysts.

Without more comprehensive information, it's not possible to provide detailed answers about reaction conditions, industrial applications, specific impacts of coke formation, or mitigation strategies. The study seems to be focused on fundamental mechanistic understanding rather than practical industrial applications or process improvements.

提供的文献并未直接回答关于丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）制丙烯的详细问题，包括反应条件、催化剂类型、工业应用、积碳形成的影响以及缓解策略。该文件似乎是一项关于使用铂（Pt）催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的研究的补充信息部分，重点关注动力学蒙特卡罗（kMC）模拟。

然而，我们可以推断出几个相关点：

1. 该研究涉及在铂（Pt）催化剂上进行丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）。

2. 研究考虑了氢气压力对反应的影响，这从不同H2压力下反应计数的比较可以看出。

3. 该研究考察了PDH过程中碳物种的流动，这可能与积碳形成有关。

4. 模拟考虑了PDH过程中的各种基本步骤，包括C-H和C-C键断裂。

5. 研究似乎旨在理解PDH的机理，以及可能在Pt催化剂上形成积碳前体。

没有更全面的信息，无法提供关于反应条件、工业应用、积碳形成的具体影响或缓解策略的详细答案。该研究似乎集中在基本机理理解上，而不是实际的工业应用或过程改进。
