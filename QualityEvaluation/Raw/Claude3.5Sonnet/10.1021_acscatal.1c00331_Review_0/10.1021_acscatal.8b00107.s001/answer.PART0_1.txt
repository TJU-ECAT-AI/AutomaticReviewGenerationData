The provided scientific literature does not contain comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production. The document appears to focus on specific aspects of kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations and calculations related to reactions on Pt catalysts, rather than providing an overview of the PDH process, reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications.

However, based on the limited information available:

1. The study involves propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) on Pt catalysts, which is a method for propene production.

2. The research considers the pressure of H2 as a variable in the reaction conditions, suggesting that hydrogen pressure is an important factor in the PDH process.

3. Platinum (Pt) is used as a catalyst for the PDH reaction.

4. The study examines the flow direction of C species during PDH, indicating that understanding the reaction pathways is crucial for process optimization.

5. Coke formation is mentioned in the title, suggesting it is a significant consideration in the PDH process on Pt catalysts.

The document does not provide specific information on industrial applications, strategies to mitigate coke formation, or catalyst regeneration methods. More comprehensive sources would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

提供的科学文献并不包含全面回答关于丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯的问题所需的全面信息。该文档似乎主要关注Pt催化剂上反应的动力学蒙特卡罗(kMC)模拟和计算的特定方面，而不是提供PDH过程、反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用的概述。

然而，基于有限的可用信息：

1. 该研究涉及Pt催化剂上的丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)，这是一种丙烯生产方法。

2. 研究将H2压力作为反应条件的一个变量，表明氢气压力是PDH过程中的一个重要因素。

3. 铂(Pt)被用作PDH反应的催化剂。

4. 该研究检查了PDH过程中C物种的流向，表明了解反应途径对于过程优化至关重要。

5. 标题中提到了积碳形成，表明这是Pt催化剂上PDH过程的一个重要考虑因素。

该文档没有提供关于工业应用、减缓积碳形成的策略或催化剂再生方法的具体信息。需要更全面的资料来充分解答这些问题的方面。
