Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial process for producing propylene. The reaction involves the conversion of propane to propylene and hydrogen. It is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low partial pressures to achieve higher propane conversions.

The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures (around 1 bar) are typically used to favor propane conversion.

2. Catalyst types: The main industrial catalysts are chromium oxide-based (CrOx/Al2O3) and platinum-based (Pt/Al2O3) catalysts. CrOx-based catalysts offer stable performance and high yields, while Pt-based catalysts are recyclable and environmentally friendly.

3. Industrial applications: The Oleflex (using Pt-based catalysts) and Catofin (using CrOx-based catalysts) processes are the most widely applied commercial PDH technologies.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering active sites and decreasing catalyst activity. This deactivation occurs more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles due to their higher proportion of uncoordinated active sites.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Facilitating propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene.
2. Increasing hydrogen pressure to lower the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors.
3. Developing new catalyst formulations or modifying existing ones to enhance stability and resistance to coking.
4. Implementing efficient regeneration processes to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Despite these strategies, improving the stability of both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts remain significant challenges in the field of PDH.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要工业过程。该反应涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。它是高度吸热的，需要高温（550-750°C）和低分压来实现更高的丙烷转化率。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：通常使用高温（550-750°C）和低压（约1巴）来有利于丙烷转化。

2. 催化剂类型：主要的工业催化剂是铬氧化物基（CrOx/Al2O3）和铂基（Pt/Al2O3）催化剂。CrOx基催化剂提供稳定的性能和高产率，而Pt基催化剂可循环使用且环保。

3. 工业应用：Oleflex（使用Pt基催化剂）和Catofin（使用CrOx基催化剂）工艺是最广泛应用的商业PDH技术。

在Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，覆盖活性位点并降低催化剂活性。这种失活在较小的纳米颗粒上发生得更快，因为它们具有更高比例的未配位活性位点。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 促进丙烯脱附和增加丙烯脱氢的能垒。
2. 增加氢气压力以降低深度脱氢积碳前体的覆盖率。
3. 开发新的催化剂配方或修改现有配方以提高稳定性和抗积碳能力。
4. 实施高效的再生过程以去除积碳沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

尽管有这些策略，但改善Pt基和CrOx基催化剂的稳定性以及寻找替代催化剂仍然是PDH领域的重大挑战。

[6] "Several strategies including oxidation state modulation, increasing dispersion, poisoning acid sites and cofeeding streams have been operated."

[7] "Cofeeding stream. As metal oxide-based catalysts, to promote propylene productivity, CO2 as a mild oxidant can be cofed during propane dehydrogenation. There are significant roles of CO2, including removal of coke deposition, reoxidation of the reduced metal oxides, and hydrogen consumption via the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)."

[9] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."

[10] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."

[6] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."

[7] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

[8] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke. As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial method for producing propylene. The process involves the catalytic conversion of propane to propylene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures to achieve high propane conversions. The reaction equilibrium is favored by increasing temperature and decreasing partial pressure.

Catalyst types: The main commercial catalysts are Pt-based and CrOx-based. Pt catalysts show excellent activity due to their affinity for C-H bonds, but suffer from coking, sintering, and high cost. CrOx catalysts are cheaper but have toxicity and environmental issues. Development of improved low-Pt content catalysts is an active area of research.

Industrial applications: PDH is used to produce propylene for various industrial products like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The Catofin and Oleflex processes are major commercial PDH technologies using CrOx and Pt catalysts respectively.

Coke formation on Pt catalysts is a major issue impacting process efficiency. It leads to catalyst deactivation by poisoning active sites and blocking pores. Strategies to mitigate coking include:

1. Modifying catalyst surface structures to facilitate propylene desorption and increase the dehydrogenation barrier. 

2. Alloying Pt with other metals to create geometric and electronic effects that inhibit coking.

3. Using promoters and supports to modify Pt properties.

4. Designing catalysts with specific ensembles to control coke formation.

5. Optimizing reaction conditions like temperature and feed composition.

6. Periodic regeneration of catalysts to remove coke deposits.
