[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below (eqn (1)): C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)"

[3] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a."

[4] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar."

[5] "To date, several representative processes for propane dehydrogenation have been emerging. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin processes have been commercialized and most widely applied,"

[6] "Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commercialized, respectively."

[7] "Carbon deposition and Cr3+ aggregation are the main deactivation causes of chromium oxide. At the beginning of the reaction, the carbon rapidly accumulates on the chromium oxide surface. As the reaction progresses, the reaction rate becomes slower, leading to a slower rate of coke formation."

[8] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."

[9] "Several explanations are suggested: (i) H2 reduces the coverage of coke precursors, (ii) reaction energies and barriers depend on H2 coverage in a beneficial way, (iii) an alternative and energetically favorable reaction pathway exists at increased H2 coverage and (iv) subsurface hydrogen that may have emerged at high H2 coverage has an effect."

[10] "In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propylene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low partial pressures to achieve higher propane conversions.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commercialized and are widely used in industrial applications.

3. Industrial applications: The Oleflex and Catofin processes are the most widely applied commercial PDH technologies.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering the active sites, particularly the uncoordinated ones on smaller nanoparticles. This leads to rapid activity decrease. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Co-feeding H2: This reduces the coverage of coke precursors and may create alternative reaction pathways.

2. Co-feeding CO2: Acting as a soft oxidant, CO2 can reduce coke formation via the reverse Boudouard reaction.

3. Optimizing catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are less prone to coking or can be more easily regenerated.

4. Periodic regeneration: Implementing effective regeneration cycles to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high propylene selectivity, and improve overall process efficiency in PDH reactions.

催化直接脱氢法（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来生产丙烯。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程高度吸热，需要高温（550-750°C）和低分压以实现更高的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：基于铂和基于氧化铬的催化剂已经商业化，并在工业应用中广泛使用。

3. 工业应用：Oleflex和Catofin工艺是最广泛应用的商业PDH技术。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过覆盖活性位点，特别是较小纳米颗粒上的非配位活性位点，显著影响了工艺效率。这导致活性快速下降。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 共进料H2：这可以减少积碳前体物的覆盖，并可能创造替代反应途径。

2. 共进料CO2：作为温和的氧化剂，CO2可以通过逆布德瓦反应减少积碳形成。

3. 优化催化剂设计：开发不易积碳或更容易再生的催化剂。

4. 定期再生：实施有效的再生循环以去除积碳沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高丙烯选择性，并提高PDH反应的整体工艺效率。
