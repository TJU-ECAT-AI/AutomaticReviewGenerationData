[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below (eqn (1)): C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)"

[3] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane"

[4] "Indeed, temperatures of 550750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar."

[5] "To date, several representative processes for propane dehydrogenation have been emerging. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin processes have been commercialized and most widely applied"

[6] "The chromium oxide/alumi-num catalysts, whose components include chromium oxide with mass fractions greater than 18%, exhibit stable dehydrogenation performance, high conversion rates of alkanes and high propylene yields."

[7] "Oleflex uses a fully recyclable platinum-based alumina catalyst and has low production costs, high returns on investment and low environmental footprints"

[8] "Carbon deposition and Cr3+ aggregation are the main deactivation causes of chromium oxide."

[9] "Therefore, the exploitation of new efficient strategies for improving the stability of Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts still remain great challenges."

[10] "Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."

[11] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."

[12] "Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehy-drogenated coke precursors on the surface"

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial process for producing propylene. The reaction involves the conversion of propane to propylene and hydrogen. It is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low partial pressures to achieve higher propane conversions.

The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures (around 1 bar) are typically used to favor propane conversion.

2. Catalyst types: The main industrial catalysts are chromium oxide-based (CrOx/Al2O3) and platinum-based (Pt/Al2O3) catalysts. CrOx-based catalysts offer stable performance and high yields, while Pt-based catalysts are recyclable and environmentally friendly.

3. Industrial applications: The Oleflex (using Pt-based catalysts) and Catofin (using CrOx-based catalysts) processes are the most widely applied commercial PDH technologies.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering active sites and decreasing catalyst activity. This deactivation occurs more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles due to their higher proportion of uncoordinated active sites.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Facilitating propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene.
2. Increasing hydrogen pressure to lower the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors.
3. Developing new catalyst formulations or modifying existing ones to enhance stability and resistance to coking.
4. Implementing efficient regeneration processes to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

Despite these strategies, improving the stability of both Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts and finding alternative catalysts remain significant challenges in the field of PDH.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要工业过程。该反应涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。它是高度吸热的，需要高温（550-750°C）和低分压来实现更高的丙烷转化率。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：通常使用高温（550-750°C）和低压（约1巴）来有利于丙烷转化。

2. 催化剂类型：主要的工业催化剂是铬氧化物基（CrOx/Al2O3）和铂基（Pt/Al2O3）催化剂。CrOx基催化剂提供稳定的性能和高产率，而Pt基催化剂可循环使用且环保。

3. 工业应用：Oleflex（使用Pt基催化剂）和Catofin（使用CrOx基催化剂）工艺是最广泛应用的商业PDH技术。

在Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，覆盖活性位点并降低催化剂活性。这种失活在较小的纳米颗粒上发生得更快，因为它们具有更高比例的未配位活性位点。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 促进丙烯脱附和增加丙烯脱氢的能垒。
2. 增加氢气压力以降低深度脱氢积碳前体的覆盖率。
3. 开发新的催化剂配方或修改现有配方以提高稳定性和抗积碳能力。
4. 实施高效的再生过程以去除积碳沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

尽管有这些策略，但改善Pt基和CrOx基催化剂的稳定性以及寻找替代催化剂仍然是PDH领域的重大挑战。
