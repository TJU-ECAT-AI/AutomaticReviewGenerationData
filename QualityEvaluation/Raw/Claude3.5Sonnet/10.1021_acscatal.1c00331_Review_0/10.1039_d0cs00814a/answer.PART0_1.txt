[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below (eqn (1)): C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)"

[3] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar."

[4] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[5] "Carbon deposition is the main reason for deactivation of VOx-based catalysts, which is intimately related to the dispersion of VOx species."

[6] "Several strategies including oxidation state modulation, increasing dispersion, poisoning acid sites and cofeeding streams have been operated."

[7] "Cofeeding stream. As metal oxide-based catalysts, to promote propylene productivity, CO2 as a mild oxidant can be cofed during propane dehydrogenation. There are significant roles of CO2, including removal of coke deposition, reoxidation of the reduced metal oxides, and hydrogen consumption via the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS)."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propylene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low partial pressures to achieve higher propane conversions.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used due to their excellent activity for CH bond activation. However, they are prone to coking and sintering, and their high cost necessitates the development of low Pt-content and stable alternatives.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an important industrial technology for direct propylene production, as propylene is a crucial raw material for various industrial products like polypropylene, acetone, and acrylonitrile.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Oxidation state manipulation of catalyst components
2. Increasing dispersion of active sites
3. Poisoning acid sites on catalyst supports
4. Cofeeding streams like CO2 or H2
5. Developing new catalyst formulations with improved stability

These approaches aim to enhance catalyst longevity, maintain activity, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles in industrial PDH processes.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来生产丙烯。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程高度吸热，需要高温（550-750°C）和低分压以实现更高的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：由于Pt基催化剂对CH键活化具有优异的活性，因此被广泛使用。然而，它们容易结焦和烧结，且成本高昂，需要开发低Pt含量和稳定的替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH是直接生产丙烯的重要工业技术，因为丙烯是多种工业产品（如聚丙烯、丙酮和丙烯腈）的关键原料。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 调控催化剂组分的氧化态
2. 增加活性位点的分散度
3. 毒化催化剂载体上的酸性位点
4. 共进料流（如CO2或H2）
5. 开发具有改进稳定性的新型催化剂配方

这些方法旨在提高催化剂寿命，保持活性，并减少工业PDH过程中再生循环的频率。
