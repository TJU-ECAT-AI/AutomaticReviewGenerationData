[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below (eqn (1)): C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)"

[3] "The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane, as shown by the thermodynamic analysis in Fig. 2a. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar."

[4] "Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commercialized, respectively. In the Catofin process, owing to their low price and high catalytic Lewis acid activity, CrOx-based catalysts have been utilized. However, in addition to their high toxicity and environmental hostility, the severe side reactions induce their quick deactivation and frequent regeneration."

[5] "Although the Pt catalyst shows excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic CH bonds and environmental friendliness, its high tendency to coking and sintering and high cost still require the development of low Pt-content and stable Pt-based catalysts via special preparation methods, and support and promoter effects."

[6] "In propane dehydrogenation, the reactions generally occur in four steps: reactant adsorption, surface reaction (first and second hydrogen abstraction), propylene desorption, and site regeneration."

[7] "In PDH reactions, coking behavior over Pt-based catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity follows via two mechanisms: poisoning the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to the partial or complete blockage of pores by coke."

[8] "Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke. As the adsorption configuration and strength of propylene can be both greatly perturbed by surface structures, coke formation is inherently governed by the surface geometric and electronic structures, and thus the construction of specific reaction ensembles is important."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial method for producing propylene. The process involves the catalytic conversion of propane to propylene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures to achieve high propane conversions. The reaction equilibrium is favored by increasing temperature and decreasing partial pressure.

Catalyst types: The main commercial catalysts are Pt-based and CrOx-based. Pt catalysts show excellent activity due to their affinity for C-H bonds, but suffer from coking, sintering, and high cost. CrOx catalysts are cheaper but have toxicity and environmental issues. Development of improved low-Pt content catalysts is an active area of research.

Industrial applications: PDH is used to produce propylene for various industrial products like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. The Catofin and Oleflex processes are major commercial PDH technologies using CrOx and Pt catalysts respectively.

Coke formation on Pt catalysts is a major issue impacting process efficiency. It leads to catalyst deactivation by poisoning active sites and blocking pores. Strategies to mitigate coking include:

1. Modifying catalyst surface structures to facilitate propylene desorption and increase the dehydrogenation barrier. 

2. Alloying Pt with other metals to create geometric and electronic effects that inhibit coking.

3. Using promoters and supports to modify Pt properties.

4. Designing catalysts with specific ensembles to control coke formation.

5. Optimizing reaction conditions like temperature and feed composition.

6. Periodic regeneration of catalysts to remove coke deposits.

Improving catalyst stability and developing efficient regeneration methods remain important goals for enhancing the overall PDH process.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要工业方法。该过程涉及丙烷向丙烯和氢气的催化转化。关键考虑因素包括：

反应条件：PDH是高度吸热的，需要高温（550-750°C）和低压来实现高丙烷转化率。提高温度和降低分压有利于反应平衡。

催化剂类型：主要的商业催化剂是基于铂和氧化铬的。铂催化剂由于对C-H键的亲和力而表现出优异的活性，但存在结焦、烧结和高成本的问题。氧化铬催化剂较便宜，但有毒性和环境问题。开发改进的低铂含量催化剂是一个活跃的研究领域。

工业应用：PDH用于生产各种工业产品所需的丙烯，如聚丙烯、丙烯腈和环氧丙烷。Catofin和Oleflex工艺是主要的商业PDH技术，分别使用氧化铬和铂催化剂。

铂催化剂上的结焦形成是影响过程效率的一个主要问题。它通过毒化活性位点和阻塞孔道导致催化剂失活。缓解结焦的策略包括：

1. 修改催化剂表面结构，以促进丙烯脱附和增加脱氢反应能垒。

2. 将铂与其他金属合金化，创造抑制结焦的几何和电子效应。

3. 使用助剂和载体来改变铂的性质。

4. 设计具有特定集合体的催化剂来控制焦炭形成。

5. 优化反应条件，如温度和进料组成。

6. 定期再生催化剂以去除焦炭沉积物。

提高催化剂稳定性和开发高效再生方法仍然是提高整体PDH过程的重要目标。
