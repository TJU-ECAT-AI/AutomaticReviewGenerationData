Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propylene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low partial pressures to achieve higher propane conversions.

2. Catalyst types: Commercially used catalysts include Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. Other catalysts like VOx-based have also been studied.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used to produce propylene, which is a basic raw material for various industrial products such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Transferring coke precursors from Pt to supports to prolong catalyst life.

2. Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing conditions followed by H2 reduction to remove coke and reactivate the catalysts.

3. Improving catalyst dispersion, as coke formation is related to the dispersion of catalyst species (e.g., VOx species).

These strategies aim to maintain catalyst activity and extend the operational lifetime of the PDH process.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来生产丙烯。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程高度吸热，需要高温（550-750°C）和低分压以实现更高的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：商业上使用的催化剂包括铂基和氧化铬基催化剂。其他催化剂如氧化钒基也有研究。

3. 工业应用：PDH用于生产丙烯，丙烯是多种工业产品的基本原料，如丙烯醛、聚丙烯、丙酮、丙烯腈和环氧丙烷。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过使催化剂失活显著影响过程效率。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将积碳前驱体从铂转移到载体上，以延长催化剂寿命。

2. 在氧化条件下再生催化剂，然后进行H2还原，以去除积碳并重新激活催化剂。

3. 改善催化剂分散度，因为积碳形成与催化剂物种（如VOx物种）的分散度有关。

这些策略旨在维持催化剂活性并延长PDH过程的运行寿命。
