[1] "The direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention. However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[3] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt. However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[4] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

[5] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM). This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is strongly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures (550-700°C) for high propane conversion. However, operating at lower temperatures is desirable to reduce energy costs and side reactions.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Cr- and Pt-based catalysts have shown the best performance. However, these have drawbacks like high cost, scarcity, and environmental concerns. Recent research focuses on developing more affordable and environmentally friendly catalysts, such as the CoSn/NC catalyst described in this study.

3. Industrial applications: PDH offers a route for high-value utilization of abundant propane resources. The development of more efficient catalysts and processes could make PDH more commercially viable.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue for Pt-based catalysts, causing deactivation and reduced efficiency over time. 

5. Mitigation strategies: Adding promoters like Sn can increase catalyst lifetime by reducing coking. The novel microwave-assisted approach described here, using a CoSn/NC catalyst, also shows promise for improved performance at lower temperatures.

6. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly discussed in the given text, efficient regeneration methods are crucial for maintaining long-term catalyst activity in industrial applications.

The study presents a novel microwave-assisted approach using a CoSn/NC catalyst, which shows potential for improved PDH performance at lower temperatures, potentially addressing some of the key challenges in this field.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法。关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是强吸热反应，受热力学限制，需要高温（550-700°C）才能获得高丙烷转化率。然而，在较低温度下操作是理想的，可以降低能源成本并减少副反应。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上，基于铬和铂的催化剂表现最佳。但这些催化剂有缺点，如成本高、稀缺和环境问题。最近的研究集中在开发更经济实惠和环境友好的催化剂，如本研究中描述的CoSn/NC催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH为丰富的丙烷资源提供了高附加值利用途径。更高效催化剂和工艺的开发可能使PDH在商业上更具可行性。

4. 积碳形成：这是铂基催化剂的一个主要问题，导致催化剂失活和效率随时间降低。

5. 缓解策略：添加锡等助剂可以通过减少积碳来延长催化剂寿命。这里描述的新型微波辅助方法，使用CoSn/NC催化剂，也显示出在较低温度下改善性能的潜力。

6. 催化剂再生：虽然在给定文本中没有明确讨论，但有效的再生方法对于在工业应用中维持长期催化剂活性至关重要。

该研究提出了一种使用CoSn/NC催化剂的新型微波辅助方法，显示出在较低温度下改善PDH性能的潜力，有可能解决该领域的一些关键挑战。
