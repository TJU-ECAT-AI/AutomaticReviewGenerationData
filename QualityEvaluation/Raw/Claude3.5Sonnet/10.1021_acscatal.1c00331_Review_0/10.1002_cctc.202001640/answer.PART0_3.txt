[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium."

[2] "According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C. Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[3] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt."

[4] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

[5] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM)."

[6] "The propane conversion is extremely low (3.2%) at 450C in the conventional reaction mode. Interestingly, the propane conversion can achieve 15% under microwave catalytic reaction mode."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for producing propene. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, typically requiring high temperatures (550-700°C) to achieve good propane conversion. However, such high temperatures can lead to side reactions and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Chromium and platinum-based catalysts have shown the best performance for PDH. Promoters like tin can be added to increase catalyst lifetime by reducing coking.

3. Industrial applications: PDH faces challenges in industrial use due to the high temperatures required and catalyst deactivation issues.

4. Coke formation impact: Coking significantly decreases catalyst activity and process efficiency over time.

5. Mitigation strategies: 
   - Using promoters like tin to reduce coking
   - Developing novel approaches like microwave-assisted catalysis, which can achieve higher conversions at lower temperatures (e.g., 15% conversion at 450°C vs 3.2% in conventional mode)
   - Improving catalyst regeneration techniques

The research presented here demonstrates a promising new direction using microwave catalytic reaction mode to improve PDH efficiency at lower temperatures, potentially addressing some key challenges in industrial application.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是高度吸热的，并受热力学限制，通常需要高温（550-700°C）才能实现良好的丙烷转化率。然而，如此高的温度可能导致副反应和积碳形成。

2. 催化剂类型：铬和铂基催化剂在PDH中表现最佳。可以添加锡等助剂来延长催化剂寿命，减少积碳。

3. 工业应用：由于所需的高温和催化剂失活问题，PDH在工业应用中面临挑战。

4. 积碳形成的影响：积碳会显著降低催化剂活性和过程效率。

5. 缓解策略：
   - 使用锡等助剂来减少积碳
   - 开发新方法，如微波辅助催化，可在较低温度下实现更高的转化率（例如，在450°C下实现15%的转化率，而常规模式下仅为3.2%）
   - 改进催化剂再生技术

这里介绍的研究展示了一个有前景的新方向，即使用微波催化反应模式在较低温度下提高PDH效率，有可能解决工业应用中的一些关键挑战。
