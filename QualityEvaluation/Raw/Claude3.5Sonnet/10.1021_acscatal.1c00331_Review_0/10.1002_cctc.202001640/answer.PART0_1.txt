[1] "The direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention. However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[3] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[4] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr and Pt. However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[5] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-700°C) for high conversion. However, high temperatures can lead to side reactions and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Cr and Pt-based catalysts show good performance but have drawbacks. Cr catalysts can be detrimental, while Pt catalysts are costly. Both suffer from coking and cracking issues over time.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is attractive for producing high-value propylene from abundant propane resources, but challenges remain in achieving good performance at lower temperatures.

4. Coke formation impact: Coking significantly reduces catalyst efficiency and lifespan, necessitating frequent regeneration.

5. Mitigation strategies: Adding promoters like Sn to Pt-based catalysts can increase catalyst lifetime by reducing coke formation. Developing novel catalysts that perform well at lower temperatures could also help mitigate coking issues.

6. Catalyst regeneration: Improving regeneration techniques is crucial for maintaining long-term catalyst efficiency in industrial applications.

Overall, while PDH shows promise for propene production, overcoming challenges related to reaction conditions, catalyst stability, and coking remains critical for widespread industrial adoption.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是吸热反应，需要高温（550-700°C）才能获得高转化率。然而，高温可能导致副反应和焦炭形成。

2. 催化剂类型：铬和铂基催化剂表现良好，但有缺点。铬催化剂可能有害，而铂催化剂成本高。两者都存在长期焦炭和裂解问题。

3. 工业应用：PDH可以从丰富的丙烷资源中生产高价值丙烯，但在较低温度下实现良好性能仍面临挑战。

4. 焦炭形成的影响：焦炭显著降低了催化剂的效率和寿命，需要频繁再生。

5. 缓解策略：向铂基催化剂中添加锡等助剂可以通过减少焦炭形成来延长催化剂寿命。开发在较低温度下性能良好的新型催化剂也可以帮助缓解焦炭问题。

6. 催化剂再生：改进再生技术对于在工业应用中保持催化剂的长期效率至关重要。

总的来说，虽然PDH在丙烯生产方面显示出前景，但克服与反应条件、催化剂稳定性和焦炭形成相关的挑战仍然是广泛工业应用的关键。
