[1] "The direct catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention. However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[3] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt.7 However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[4] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic reaction requiring high temperatures (550-700°C) to achieve good propane conversion. However, operating at lower temperatures is desirable to reduce energy costs and side reactions.

2. Catalyst types: Chromium and platinum-based catalysts have shown the best performance, but they have drawbacks. Chromium catalysts can be environmentally harmful, while platinum is expensive. Researchers are exploring alternative catalysts like cobalt, nickel, and gallium.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is attractive for utilizing abundant propane resources, especially from shale gas, to produce high-value propylene. However, the high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation pose challenges for large-scale implementation.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue for Pt-based catalysts, causing deactivation and reduced efficiency over time. 

5. Mitigation strategies: Adding promoters like tin (Sn) to Pt catalysts can help reduce coking and extend catalyst lifetime. Other approaches include optimizing reaction conditions, improving catalyst supports, and developing more coke-resistant formulations.

6. Catalyst regeneration: Periodic regeneration is necessary to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity. Efficient regeneration processes are crucial for maintaining long-term performance in industrial applications.

Overall, while PDH offers a promising route for propylene production, ongoing research aims to address challenges related to reaction conditions, catalyst stability, and coking to improve the process's industrial viability.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一种吸热反应，需要高温（550-700°C）才能达到良好的丙烷转化率。然而，在较低温度下操作是理想的，以降低能源成本和副反应。

2. 催化剂类型：铬和铂基催化剂表现最佳，但它们有缺点。铬催化剂可能对环境有害，而铂价格昂贵。研究人员正在探索钴、镍和镓等替代催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH对于利用丰富的丙烷资源（特别是来自页岩气的丙烷）生产高附加值丙烯具有吸引力。然而，高反应温度和催化剂失活对大规模实施构成挑战。

4. 积碳形成：这是Pt基催化剂的一个主要问题，会导致催化剂失活和效率随时间降低。

5. 缓解策略：向Pt催化剂中添加锡（Sn）等助剂可以帮助减少积碳并延长催化剂寿命。其他方法包括优化反应条件、改进催化剂载体和开发更耐积碳的配方。

6. 催化剂再生：需要定期再生以去除积碳沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。高效的再生过程对于在工业应用中保持长期性能至关重要。

总的来说，虽然PDH为丙烯生产提供了一条有前途的途径，但正在进行的研究旨在解决与反应条件、催化剂稳定性和积碳相关的挑战，以提高该工艺的工业可行性。
