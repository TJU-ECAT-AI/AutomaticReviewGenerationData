[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention. However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[3] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[4] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt. However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[5] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-700°C) for high propane conversion. However, these high temperatures can lead to side reactions and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: The best performing catalysts are typically based on Cr or Pt. However, these have drawbacks - Cr catalysts can be detrimental, while Pt catalysts are costly. 

3. Industrial applications: PDH is attractive for producing high-value propylene from abundant propane resources. However, challenges exist in achieving good performance at lower temperatures.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue for Pt-based catalysts, causing deactivation and reduced efficiency over time.

5. Mitigation strategies: Adding promoters like Sn to Pt-based catalysts can help reduce coking and increase catalyst lifetime. Developing novel catalyst systems that perform well at lower temperatures could also help address coking issues.

Overall, while PDH is promising, further catalyst and process developments are needed to improve its industrial viability by enhancing performance, reducing coking, and enabling lower temperature operation.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是吸热反应，需要高温（550-700°C）才能获得高丙烷转化率。然而，这些高温可能导致副反应和积碳形成。

2. 催化剂类型：性能最佳的催化剂通常基于Cr或Pt。但是，这些催化剂都有缺点 - Cr催化剂可能有害，而Pt催化剂成本高。

3. 工业应用：PDH对于从丰富的丙烷资源生产高附加值丙烯具有吸引力。然而，在较低温度下实现良好性能仍存在挑战。

4. 积碳形成：这是Pt基催化剂的一个主要问题，导致催化剂失活和效率随时间降低。

5. 缓解策略：向Pt基催化剂中添加Sn等助剂可以帮助减少积碳并延长催化剂寿命。开发在较低温度下表现良好的新型催化剂系统也可以帮助解决积碳问题。

总的来说，虽然PDH很有前景，但仍需要进一步的催化剂和工艺开发，通过提高性能、减少积碳和实现低温操作来提高其工业可行性。
