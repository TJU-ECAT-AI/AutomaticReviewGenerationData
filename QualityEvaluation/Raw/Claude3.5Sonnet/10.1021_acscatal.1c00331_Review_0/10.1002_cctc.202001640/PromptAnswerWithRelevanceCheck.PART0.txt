[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to value-added propylene (C3H6) has attracted much attention. However, direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 with outstanding catalytic performance at low temperature is a great challenge."

[2] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[3] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[4] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt. However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[5] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is endothermic and requires high temperatures (550-700°C) for high propane conversion. However, these high temperatures can lead to side reactions and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: The best performing catalysts are typically based on Cr or Pt. However, these have drawbacks - Cr catalysts can be detrimental, while Pt catalysts are costly. 

3. Industrial applications: PDH is attractive for producing high-value propylene from abundant propane resources. However, challenges exist in achieving good performance at lower temperatures.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue for Pt-based catalysts, causing deactivation and reduced efficiency over time.

5. Mitigation strategies: Adding promoters like Sn to Pt-based catalysts can help reduce coking and increase catalyst lifetime. Developing novel catalyst systems that perform well at lower temperatures could also help address coking issues.

Overall, while PDH is promising, further catalyst and process developments are needed to improve its industrial viability by enhancing performance, reducing coking, and enabling lower temperature operation.
