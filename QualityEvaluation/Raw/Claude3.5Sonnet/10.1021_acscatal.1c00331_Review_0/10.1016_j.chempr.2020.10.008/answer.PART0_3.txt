[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective. Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial technology for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. However, these high temperatures can decrease propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used. The paper describes a novel single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst that shows high selectivity and stability. Traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 are also used industrially.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes (e.g., from shale gas).

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue that impacts process efficiency:

1. Impact: Coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation, reducing propylene yield and necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration.

2. Mitigation strategies:
   - Active site isolation: Using single-atom catalysts (SACs) to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation.
   - Intermetallic alloys: The [PtZn4] catalyst described shows improved resistance to coking.
   - Optimized reaction conditions: Controlling temperature and using hydrogen in the feed can help reduce coke formation.

The novel [PtZn4] catalyst described in the paper demonstrates significant improvements in stability and coke resistance, operating for 160 hours without obvious deactivation under industrial conditions. This represents a major advance in catalyst design for PDH processes, potentially reducing the need for frequent regeneration cycles and improving overall process efficiency.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产技术。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，PDH需要高温（520-620°C）。然而，这些高温会降低丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用基于铂的催化剂。论文描述了一种新型的单点[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂，显示出高选择性和稳定性。传统的PtSn/Al2O3等催化剂也在工业上使用。

3. 工业应用：由于原料从石脑油转向轻烷烃（如页岩气），PDH变得越来越重要。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成是影响过程效率的一个重要问题：

1. 影响：积碳形成导致催化剂失活，降低丙烯产率，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

2. 缓解策略：
   - 活性位点隔离：使用单原子催化剂（SACs）来抑制导致积碳形成的结构敏感副反应。
   - 金属间化合物：所描述的[PtZn4]催化剂显示出改善的抗积碳能力。
   - 优化反应条件：控制温度并在进料中使用氢气可以帮助减少积碳形成。

论文中描述的新型[PtZn4]催化剂在稳定性和抗积碳性方面表现出显著改进，在工业条件下运行160小时而无明显失活。这代表了PDH过程催化剂设计的重大进展，有可能减少频繁再生循环的需求，提高整体过程效率。
