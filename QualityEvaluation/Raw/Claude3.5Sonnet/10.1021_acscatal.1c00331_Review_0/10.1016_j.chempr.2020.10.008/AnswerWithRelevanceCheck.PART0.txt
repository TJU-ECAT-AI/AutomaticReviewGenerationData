          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective. Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial technology for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction (DrH = 124 kJ mol-1). However, these high temperatures can decrease propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used, including traditional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 and newer single-site catalysts. The paper describes a novel single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst that shows high selectivity (>95%) and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes (e.g., from shale gas).

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue that impacts process efficiency:

1. Impact: Coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation, reducing propylene yield and necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration.

2. Causes: Larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke.

3. Mitigation strategies:
   - Active site isolation: Using single-atom catalysts (SACs) to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation.
   - Intermetallic alloys: The [PtZn4] catalyst described shows improved resistance to coking, with no obvious deactivation observed within 160 hours under industrial conditions.
   - Catalyst design: Low Pt loading (0.1 wt%) and atomic ordering in the PtZn intermetallic alloy contribute to improved performance.

These advancements in catalyst design aim to address the main challenges of PDH, namely improving propylene selectivity, increasing catalyst stability, and reducing coke formation, thereby enhancing overall process efficiency and potentially reducing the need for frequent regeneration cycles.

          丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产技术。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质（DrH = 124 kJ mol-1），PDH需要高温（520-620°C）。然而，这些高温会降低丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 催化剂类型：常用的是基于铂的催化剂，包括传统的PtSn/Al2O3催化剂和较新的单原子位点催化剂。论文描述了一种新型的单原子位点[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂，表现出高选择性（>95%）和稳定性。

3. 工业应用：由于原料从石脑油转向轻烷烃（如页岩气），PDH变得越来越重要。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成是一个影响过程效率的重要问题：

1. 影响：积碳形成导致催化剂失活，降低丙烯产率，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

2. 原因：较大的活性位点集合催化结构敏感的副反应，包括裂解和深度脱氢，导致C1和C2分子以及焦炭的生成。

3. 缓解策略：
   - 活性位点隔离：使用单原子催化剂（SACs）来抑制导致积碳形成的结构敏感副反应。
   - 金属间化合物：所描述的[PtZn4]催化剂显示出改善的抗积碳能力，在工业条件下运行160小时而无明显失活。
   - 催化剂设计：低铂负载量（0.1 wt%）和PtZn金属间化合物中的原子有序排列有助于提高性能。

这些催化剂设计的进展旨在解决PDH的主要挑战，即提高丙烯选择性，增加催化剂稳定性，减少积碳形成，从而提高整体过程效率，并可能减少频繁再生循环的需求。
