[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective. Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial method for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. However, these high temperatures can decrease propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used. The paper describes a novel single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst that shows high selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an energy-intensive process but has gained attention due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes (e.g., from shale gas).

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue that impacts process efficiency:

1. Impact: Coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced propylene selectivity.

2. Mitigation strategies:
   - Active site isolation: Using single-atom catalysts (SACs) to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation.
   - Novel catalyst design: The [PtZn4] catalyst described in the paper shows high resistance to coke formation and maintains stability for over 160 hours under industrial conditions.
   - Catalyst composition: Incorporating Zn with Pt helps improve selectivity and reduce coke formation.

3. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly discussed in the given text, the high stability of the novel [PtZn4] catalyst suggests reduced need for frequent regeneration compared to traditional Pt-based catalysts.

The development of advanced catalysts like the single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst represents a significant improvement in addressing the challenges of coke formation and catalyst stability in PDH processes.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，PDH需要高温（520-620°C）。然而，这些高温会降低丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 催化剂类型：常用的是基于铂的催化剂。该论文描述了一种新型的单位点[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂，表现出高选择性和稳定性。

3. 工业应用：PDH是一个能源密集型过程，但由于原料从石脑油转向轻烷烃（如页岩气），引起了广泛关注。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成是一个影响过程效率的重要问题：

1. 影响：积碳形成导致催化剂失活和丙烯选择性降低。

2. 缓解策略：
   - 活性位点隔离：使用单原子催化剂（SACs）来抑制导致积碳形成的结构敏感的副反应。
   - 新型催化剂设计：论文中描述的[PtZn4]催化剂表现出高度抗积碳能力，在工业条件下保持160多小时的稳定性。
   - 催化剂成分：将Zn与Pt结合有助于提高选择性并减少积碳形成。

3. 催化剂再生：虽然给定文本中没有明确讨论，但新型[PtZn4]催化剂的高稳定性表明，与传统铂基催化剂相比，需要频繁再生的需求减少。

开发诸如单位点[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂等先进催化剂代表了在解决PDH过程中积碳形成和催化剂稳定性挑战方面的重大进展。
