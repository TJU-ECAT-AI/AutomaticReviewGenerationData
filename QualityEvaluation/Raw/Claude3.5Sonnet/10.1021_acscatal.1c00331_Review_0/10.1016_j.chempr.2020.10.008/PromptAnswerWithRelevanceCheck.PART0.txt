[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective. Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial method for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. However, these high temperatures can decrease propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used. The paper describes a novel single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst that shows high selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an energy-intensive process but has gained attention due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes (e.g., from shale gas).

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue that impacts process efficiency:

1. Impact: Coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced propylene selectivity.

2. Mitigation strategies:
   - Active site isolation: Using single-atom catalysts (SACs) to inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation.
   - Novel catalyst design: The [PtZn4] catalyst described in the paper shows high resistance to coke formation and maintains stability for over 160 hours under industrial conditions.
   - Catalyst composition: Incorporating Zn with Pt helps improve selectivity and reduce coke formation.

3. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly discussed in the given text, the high stability of the novel [PtZn4] catalyst suggests reduced need for frequent regeneration compared to traditional Pt-based catalysts.

The development of advanced catalysts like the single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst represents a significant improvement in addressing the challenges of coke formation and catalyst stability in PDH processes.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial technology for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (typically 520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. However, these high temperatures can negatively impact propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used, with recent developments focusing on single-site catalysts like the [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst described in the paper. These catalysts aim to improve selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the availability of shale gas and natural gas.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue that impacts process efficiency. It occurs due to side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation, especially on larger ensembles of active sites. These reactions produce C1 and C2 molecules, as well as coke, which leads to catalyst deactivation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Active site isolation: Developing single-atom catalysts (SACs) or intermetallic alloys that isolate active metal components can inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Optimizing catalyst composition: The paper describes a PtZn intermetallic alloy catalyst with low Pt loading (0.1 wt%) that shows high selectivity and stability.

3. Temperature control: While high temperatures are necessary for the reaction, finding the optimal temperature range (e.g., 520-620°C for the described catalyst) can help balance conversion, selectivity, and coke formation.

4. Hydrogen co-feeding: Adding hydrogen to the feed can help suppress coke formation and maintain catalyst activity.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst longevity, reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles, and enhance overall process efficiency in industrial PDH applications.
