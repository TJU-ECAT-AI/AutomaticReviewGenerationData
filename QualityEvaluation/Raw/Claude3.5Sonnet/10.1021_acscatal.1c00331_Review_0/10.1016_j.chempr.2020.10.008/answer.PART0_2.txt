[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,46 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective."

[5] "This paper describes a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial technology for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. However, these high temperatures can negatively impact propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used, with recent innovations focusing on single-site catalysts like the [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst described in the paper. This catalyst shows high propylene selectivity (>95%) and productivity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the availability of shale gas and natural gas.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue that impacts process efficiency. It occurs due to side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation, which are catalyzed by larger ensembles of active sites. These reactions produce C1 and C2 molecules and coke, leading to catalyst deactivation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Active site isolation: This strategy has proven effective in inhibiting structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Development of novel catalysts: The single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst described in the paper shows excellent stability, with no obvious deactivation observed within 160 hours under industrial operating conditions.

3. Catalyst design: Creating catalysts that promote desorption of surface-bounded propylene and inhibit further dehydrogenation can improve selectivity and stability by prohibiting coke side reactions.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, improve propylene selectivity, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles, thereby enhancing overall process efficiency.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产技术。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，PDH需要高温（520-620°C）。然而，这些高温会对丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性产生负面影响。

2. 催化剂类型：常用的是基于铂的催化剂，最新创新集中在单原子位点催化剂上，如文中描述的[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂。这种催化剂显示出高丙烯选择性（>95%）和高生产力。

3. 工业应用：由于页岩气和天然气的可用性，原料从石脑油向轻烷烃转变，PDH变得越来越重要。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成是一个显著影响过程效率的问题。它由裂解和深度脱氢等副反应引起，这些反应由较大的活性位点集合催化。这些反应产生C1和C2分子以及焦炭，导致催化剂失活。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 活性位点隔离：这种策略已被证明在抑制导致积碳形成的结构敏感副反应方面是有效的。

2. 开发新型催化剂：文中描述的单原子位点[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂显示出优异的稳定性，在工业操作条件下160小时内未观察到明显失活。

3. 催化剂设计：创造能促进表面束缚丙烯脱附并抑制进一步脱氢的催化剂可以通过禁止焦炭副反应来提高选择性和稳定性。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，提高丙烯选择性，并减少再生周期的频率，从而提高整体过程效率。
