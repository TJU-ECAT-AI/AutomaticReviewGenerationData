[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective. Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial technology for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. However, these high temperatures can negatively impact propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Traditional Pt-based catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 are used, but newer catalysts like single-site [PtZn4] intermetallic catalysts show improved performance. These novel catalysts demonstrate higher propylene selectivity, productivity, and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the availability of shale gas and natural gas.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue for Pt-based catalysts, caused by side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation. Coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced process efficiency.

5. Mitigation strategies: The active site isolation strategy has proven effective in reducing coke formation. By isolating active metal components into single-atom sites, structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation can be inhibited. The development of single-atom catalysts (SACs) and intermetallic alloy (IMA) catalysts, such as the [PtZn4] catalyst described, shows promise in this regard.

6. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, the improved stability of newer catalysts like the [PtZn4] IMA (no obvious deactivation within 160 hours under industrial conditions) suggests that they may require less frequent regeneration compared to traditional catalysts.

These advancements in catalyst design aim to address the main challenges of PDH, namely improving propylene selectivity, increasing catalyst stability, and reducing coke formation, thereby enhancing overall process efficiency.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产技术。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，PDH需要高温（520-620°C）。然而，这些高温可能对丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性产生负面影响。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用Pt基催化剂如PtSn/Al2O3，但新型催化剂如单原子位[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂表现出更好的性能。这些新型催化剂展示了更高的丙烯选择性、生产力和稳定性。

3. 工业应用：由于原料从石脑油向轻烷烃转变，PDH变得越来越重要，这一转变是由页岩气和天然气的可用性驱动的。

4. 积碳形成：这是Pt基催化剂的一个主要问题，由裂解和深度脱氢等副反应引起。积碳形成导致催化剂失活和过程效率降低。

5. 缓解策略：活性位点隔离策略在减少积碳形成方面已被证明是有效的。通过将活性金属组分隔离成单原子位点，可以抑制导致积碳形成的结构敏感副反应。单原子催化剂（SACs）和金属间化合物（IMA）催化剂的开发，如所描述的[PtZn4]催化剂，在这方面显示了前景。

6. 催化剂再生：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但新型催化剂（如[PtZn4] IMA）的改进稳定性（在工业条件下160小时内无明显失活）表明，与传统催化剂相比，它们可能需要较少的再生频率。

这些催化剂设计的进展旨在解决PDH的主要挑战，即提高丙烯选择性，增加催化剂稳定性，减少积碳形成，从而提高整体过程效率。
