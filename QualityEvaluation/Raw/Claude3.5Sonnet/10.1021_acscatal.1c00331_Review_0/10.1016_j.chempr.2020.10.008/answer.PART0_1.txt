[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,46 which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective.911 Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial technology for propylene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (typically 520-620°C) due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. However, these high temperatures can negatively impact propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used, with recent developments focusing on single-site catalysts like the [PtZn4] intermetallic catalyst described in the paper. These catalysts aim to improve selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, driven by the availability of shale gas and natural gas.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue that impacts process efficiency. It occurs due to side reactions such as cracking and deep dehydrogenation, especially on larger ensembles of active sites. These reactions produce C1 and C2 molecules, as well as coke, which leads to catalyst deactivation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Active site isolation: Developing single-atom catalysts (SACs) or intermetallic alloys that isolate active metal components can inhibit structure-sensitive side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Optimizing catalyst composition: The paper describes a PtZn intermetallic alloy catalyst with low Pt loading (0.1 wt%) that shows high selectivity and stability.

3. Temperature control: While high temperatures are necessary for the reaction, finding the optimal temperature range (e.g., 520-620°C for the described catalyst) can help balance conversion, selectivity, and coke formation.

4. Hydrogen co-feeding: Adding hydrogen to the feed can help suppress coke formation and maintain catalyst activity.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst longevity, reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles, and enhance overall process efficiency in industrial PDH applications.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产技术。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，PDH需要高温（通常为520-620°C）。然而，这些高温会对丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性产生负面影响。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用基于铂的催化剂，最近的研究重点是开发单原子位点催化剂，如文中描述的[PtZn4]金属间化合物催化剂。这些催化剂旨在提高选择性和稳定性。

3. 工业应用：由于页岩气和天然气的可用性，原料从石脑油向轻烷烃转移，PDH变得越来越重要。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成是一个影响过程效率的重要问题。它由于副反应如裂解和深度脱氢而发生，特别是在较大的活性位点集合上。这些反应产生C1和C2分子以及焦炭，导致催化剂失活。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 活性位点隔离：开发单原子催化剂（SACs）或金属间合金，可以隔离活性金属组分，从而抑制导致积碳形成的结构敏感型副反应。

2. 优化催化剂组成：文中描述了一种低铂含量（0.1 wt%）的PtZn金属间合金催化剂，表现出高选择性和稳定性。

3. 温度控制：虽然反应需要高温，但找到最佳温度范围（例如，所描述催化剂的520-620°C）可以帮助平衡转化率、选择性和积碳形成。

4. 氢气共进料：向进料中添加氢气可以帮助抑制积碳形成并保持催化剂活性。

这些策略旨在改善催化剂寿命，减少再生循环的频率，并提高工业PDH应用的整体过程效率。
