[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas."

[5] "The activation of tungsten oxide by hydrogen is attributed to reduction of the metal oxide and presence of multivalent oxidation states."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by converting propane to propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve significant propane conversion due to the endothermic and thermodynamically limited nature of the reaction.

Catalyst types: Noble metals (e.g. platinum) and metal oxides are commonly used catalysts. Industrial processes typically use platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts due to their excellent performance. However, there are efforts to develop alternative catalysts to address issues like high costs of platinum and toxicity of chromium.

Industrial applications: PDH is used for the selective production of propene, which is an important feedstock for various chemicals and polymers.

Catalyst deactivation is a major challenge in PDH. Coke deposition on catalyst surfaces causes severe deactivation under high temperature conditions. While the document doesn't specifically discuss coke formation on Pt catalysts, it mentions this issue for catalysts in general.

Strategies to improve catalyst performance include:

1. Using hydrogen: For tungsten oxide catalysts, activation by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding hydrogen during the reaction improves catalytic activity. 

2. Controlling oxidation states: The presence of multivalent oxidation states in partially reduced tungsten oxide catalysts contributes to improved performance.

3. Optimizing pretreatment: For tungsten oxide, carefully controlling hydrogen pretreatment time can optimize catalyst activity.

These approaches help activate the catalyst and maintain its performance, potentially mitigating issues like coke formation, though more specific strategies for Pt catalysts are not detailed in the given text.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来生产丙烯的方法。关键考虑因素包括：

反应条件：由于反应的吸热性和热力学限制，PDH需要高温（超过550°C）才能实现显著的丙烷转化。

催化剂类型：贵金属（如铂）和金属氧化物是常用的催化剂。工业过程通常使用铂或铬氧化物基催化剂，因为它们具有优异的性能。然而，由于铂的高成本和铬的毒性，目前正在努力开发替代催化剂。

工业应用：PDH用于选择性生产丙烯，丙烯是多种化学品和聚合物的重要原料。

催化剂失活是PDH面临的一个主要挑战。在高温条件下，催化剂表面的积碳沉积会导致严重的失活。虽然文档没有具体讨论Pt催化剂上的积碳形成，但它提到了这个问题对催化剂的普遍影响。

改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 使用氢气：对于氧化钨催化剂，通过氢气预处理和/或在反应过程中共进料氢气可以提高催化活性。

2. 控制氧化态：部分还原的氧化钨催化剂中多价氧化态的存在有助于提高性能。

3. 优化预处理：对于氧化钨，精心控制氢气预处理时间可以优化催化剂活性。

这些方法有助于激活催化剂并维持其性能，可能缓解积碳形成等问题，尽管文本中没有详细说明Pt催化剂的具体策略。
