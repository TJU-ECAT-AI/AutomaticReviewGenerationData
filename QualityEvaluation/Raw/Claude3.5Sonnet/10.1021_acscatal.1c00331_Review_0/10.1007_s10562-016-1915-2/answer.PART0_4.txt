[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "The partially reduced WO3-x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3-x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600°C."

[5] "A rapid deactivation of metal oxide catalysts during propane dehydrogenation requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts. In the commercial Catofin process, CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is typically regenerated after 12 min of dehydrogenation at 575°C."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve good propane conversion. It is typically conducted at atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble metals (like platinum) and metal oxides are commonly used. The study shows that partially reduced tungsten oxide (WO3-x) exhibits superior activity and selectivity compared to traditional catalysts like chromium oxide and gallium oxide.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used commercially, with processes like Catofin employing chromium oxide-based catalysts. However, there are ongoing efforts to develop new catalysts due to the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns about chromium.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue leading to catalyst deactivation, especially under high-temperature conditions. It occurs on the surface of active materials.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve regeneration:
   - Frequent catalyst regeneration (e.g., every 12 minutes in the Catofin process)
   - Development of new catalyst materials (like the WO3-x shown in this study) that may be more resistant to coking
   - Optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst pretreatment methods (e.g., hydrogen pretreatment for tungsten oxide)
   - Exploring the use of promoters or support materials that can enhance catalyst stability

The study demonstrates that careful control of the catalyst's oxidation state through pretreatment can significantly improve its performance and potentially its resistance to deactivation, offering a promising direction for addressing the challenges of coke formation and catalyst regeneration in PDH processes.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程高度吸热，需要高温（550°C以上）才能实现良好的丙烷转化率。通常在大气压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：常用贵金属（如铂）和金属氧化物。研究表明，部分还原的氧化钨（WO3-x）比传统的氧化铬和氧化镓催化剂表现出更优越的活性和选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH已在商业上使用，如Catofin工艺采用氧化铬基催化剂。然而，由于铂的高成本和铬的环境问题，目前正在努力开发新的催化剂。

4. 积碳形成：这是导致催化剂失活的主要问题，尤其是在高温条件下。它发生在活性材料的表面。

5. 减少积碳形成和改善再生的策略：
   - 频繁的催化剂再生（如Catofin工艺中每12分钟一次）
   - 开发新的催化剂材料（如本研究中的WO3-x），可能更耐积碳
   - 优化反应条件和催化剂预处理方法（如氧化钨的氢气预处理）
   - 探索使用能增强催化剂稳定性的助剂或载体材料

该研究表明，通过预处理仔细控制催化剂的氧化态可以显著提高其性能，并可能增强其抗失活能力，为解决PDH过程中积碳形成和催化剂再生的挑战提供了一个有前景的方向。
