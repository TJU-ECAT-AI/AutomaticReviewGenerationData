[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas."

[5] "The partially reduced WO3-x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3-x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600°C."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene that involves the conversion of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) and hydrogen (H2). This reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve significant propane conversion at atmospheric pressure.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (>550°C) and atmospheric pressure are typically used to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst types: Noble metals (e.g., platinum) and metal oxides are commonly used catalysts. The study introduces tungsten oxide as a promising catalyst for PDH when partially reduced.

3. Industrial applications: Platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts are currently used in industrial processes due to their excellent performance. However, there are efforts to develop alternative catalysts due to the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns related to chromium.

4. Catalyst deactivation: Coke deposition and sintering of active phases are major issues causing catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions.

5. Catalyst activation: For tungsten oxide catalysts, activation can be achieved through hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen during the reaction. The catalytic activity depends on the hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas.

6. Catalyst performance: Partially reduced tungsten oxide (WO3-x) shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity compared to other metal oxides like Cr2O3 and Ga2O3.

To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration for Pt-based catalysts, strategies may include:

1. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.
2. Developing more coke-resistant catalyst formulations.
3. Implementing frequent regeneration cycles to remove coke deposits.
4. Using promoters or modifiers to enhance catalyst stability.
5. Exploring alternative catalyst systems, such as the partially reduced tungsten oxide described in the study, which may offer improved performance and regeneration characteristics.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及将丙烷（C3H8）转化为丙烯（C3H6）和氢气（H2）。这个反应是高度吸热的，并且在热力学上受到限制，需要在大气压下高温（超过550°C）才能实现显著的丙烷转化。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：通常使用高温（>550°C）和大气压来克服热力学限制。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属（如铂）和金属氧化物是常用的催化剂。该研究引入了部分还原的氧化钨作为PDH的潜在催化剂。

3. 工业应用：由于性能优异，铂基和氧化铬基催化剂目前在工业过程中使用。然而，由于铂的高成本和与铬相关的环境问题，人们正在努力开发替代催化剂。

4. 催化剂失活：在高温条件下，积碳和活性相烧结是导致催化剂失活的主要问题。

5. 催化剂活化：对于氧化钨催化剂，可以通过氢气预处理和/或在反应过程中共进料氢气来实现活化。催化活性取决于氢气预处理时间和进料气中氢气的分压。

6. 催化剂性能：部分还原的氧化钨（WO3-x）与其他金属氧化物如Cr2O3和Ga2O3相比，表现出更优越的催化活性和选择性。

为了减少Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，可采取以下策略：

1. 优化反应条件以最小化积碳形成。
2. 开发更耐积碳的催化剂配方。
3. 实施频繁的再生循环以去除积碳沉积物。
4. 使用助剂或改性剂来增强催化剂稳定性。
5. 探索替代催化剂系统，如研究中描述的部分还原氧化钨，可能提供更好的性能和再生特性。
