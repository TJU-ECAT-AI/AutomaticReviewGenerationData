[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "The partially reduced WO3-x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3-x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600°C."

[5] "A rapid deactivation of metal oxide catalysts during propane dehydrogenation requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts. In the commercial Catofin process, CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is typically regenerated after 12 min of dehydrogenation at 575°C."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve significant propane conversion at atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble metals and metal oxides are commonly used. Platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent performance and are used industrially. However, new catalysts are being developed due to the high cost of Pt and environmental concerns with Cr6+. Partially reduced tungsten oxide (WO3-x) has shown promising results, with higher activity and selectivity than Cr2O3 and Ga2O3.

3. Industrial applications: The process is used commercially, with the Catofin process being an example that uses CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue leading to catalyst deactivation, along with sintering of active phases at high temperatures. 

5. Mitigation strategies: Frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary. In the Catofin process, for example, the catalyst is regenerated every 12 minutes. Developing more coke-resistant catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation are ongoing areas of research.

6. Catalyst regeneration: This typically involves burning off the coke deposits in an oxidizing atmosphere at high temperatures. Improving regeneration efficiency and prolonging catalyst lifetime are important for process economics.

The development of new catalysts like WO3-x and optimizing reaction conditions and regeneration strategies are key areas for improving PDH process efficiency and sustainability.

催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是高度吸热反应，需要高温（550°C以上）才能在大气压下实现显著的丙烷转化。

2. 催化剂类型：常用贵金属和金属氧化物。铂和铬氧化物基催化剂表现优异，并在工业中使用。然而，由于铂的高成本和Cr6+的环境问题，正在开发新的催化剂。部分还原的氧化钨（WO3-x）显示出很有前景的结果，其活性和选择性高于Cr2O3和Ga2O3。

3. 工业应用：该工艺已商业化应用，Catofin工艺就是一个使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的例子。

4. 积碳形成：这是导致催化剂失活的主要问题，高温下活性相的烧结也是一个问题。

5. 缓解策略：需要频繁的催化剂再生。例如，在Catofin工艺中，每12分钟就要进行一次催化剂再生。开发更耐积碳的催化剂和优化反应条件以最小化积碳形成是正在进行的研究领域。

6. 催化剂再生：通常涉及在高温下的氧化性气氛中燃烧掉积碳沉积物。提高再生效率和延长催化剂寿命对工艺经济性很重要。

开发新的催化剂如WO3-x，优化反应条件和再生策略是提高PDH工艺效率和可持续性的关键领域。
