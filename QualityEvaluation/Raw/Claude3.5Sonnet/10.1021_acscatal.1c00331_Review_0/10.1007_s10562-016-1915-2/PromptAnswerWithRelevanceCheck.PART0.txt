<quotes>

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas."

[5] "The partially reduced WO3-x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3-x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600°C."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene that involves the conversion of propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) and hydrogen (H2). This reaction is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve significant propane conversion at atmospheric pressure.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (>550°C) and atmospheric pressure are typically used to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst types: Noble metals (e.g., platinum) and metal oxides are commonly used catalysts. The study introduces tungsten oxide as a promising catalyst for PDH when partially reduced.

3. Industrial applications: Platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts are currently used in industrial processes due to their excellent performance. However, there are efforts to develop alternative catalysts due to the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns related to chromium.

4. Catalyst deactivation: Coke deposition and sintering of active phases are major issues causing catalyst deactivation under high-temperature conditions.

5. Catalyst activation: For tungsten oxide catalysts, activation can be achieved through hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen during the reaction. The catalytic activity depends on the hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas.

6. Catalyst performance: Partially reduced tungsten oxide (WO3-x) shows superior catalytic activity and selectivity compared to other metal oxides like Cr2O3 and Ga2O3.

To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration for Pt-based catalysts, strategies may include:

1. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.
2. Developing more coke-resistant catalyst formulations.
3. Implementing frequent regeneration cycles to remove coke deposits.
4. Using promoters or modifiers to enhance catalyst stability.
5. Exploring alternative catalyst systems, such as the partially reduced tungsten oxide described in the study, which may offer improved performance and regeneration characteristics.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by converting propane to propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: PDH requires high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve significant propane conversion due to the endothermic and thermodynamically limited nature of the reaction.

Catalyst types: Noble metals (e.g. platinum) and metal oxides are commonly used catalysts. Industrial processes typically use platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts due to their excellent performance. However, there are efforts to develop alternative catalysts to address issues like high costs of platinum and toxicity of chromium.

Industrial applications: PDH is used for the selective production of propene, which is an important feedstock for various chemicals and polymers.

Catalyst deactivation is a major challenge in PDH. Coke deposition on catalyst surfaces causes severe deactivation under high temperature conditions. While the document doesn't specifically discuss coke formation on Pt catalysts, it mentions this issue for catalysts in general.

Strategies to improve catalyst performance include:

1. Using hydrogen: For tungsten oxide catalysts, activation by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding hydrogen during the reaction improves catalytic activity. 

2. Controlling oxidation states: The presence of multivalent oxidation states in partially reduced tungsten oxide catalysts contributes to improved performance.

3. Optimizing pretreatment: For tungsten oxide, carefully controlling hydrogen pretreatment time can optimize catalyst activity.

These approaches help activate the catalyst and maintain its performance, potentially mitigating issues like coke formation, though more specific strategies for Pt catalysts are not detailed in the given text.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used commercially, with processes like Catofin employing chromium oxide-based catalysts. However, there are ongoing efforts to develop new catalysts due to the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns about chromium.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue leading to catalyst deactivation, especially under high-temperature conditions. It occurs on the surface of active materials.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve regeneration:
   - Frequent catalyst regeneration (e.g., every 12 minutes in the Catofin process)
   - Development of new catalyst materials (like the WO3-x shown in this study) that may be more resistant to coking
   - Optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst pretreatment methods (e.g., hydrogen pretreatment for tungsten oxide)
   - Exploring the use of promoters or support materials that can enhance catalyst stability

The study demonstrates that careful control of the catalyst's oxidation state through pretreatment can significantly improve its performance and potentially its resistance to deactivation, offering a promising direction for addressing the challenges of coke formation and catalyst regeneration in PDH processes.
