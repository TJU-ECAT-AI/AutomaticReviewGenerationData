[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8  C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[3] "severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[4] "Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas."

[5] "The activation of tungsten oxide by hydrogen is attributed to reduction of the metal oxide and presence of multivalent oxidation states."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by converting propane to propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process requires high temperatures (above 550°C) due to its endothermic nature and thermodynamic limitations. This allows for over 50% propane conversion at atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts have been used industrially due to their excellent performance. However, there are efforts to develop new catalysts because of the high cost of platinum and environmental concerns related to chromium(VI) species.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an important industrial process for propene production, especially given the increasing demand for propene as a feedstock for various chemicals and polymers.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue affecting catalyst efficiency. Coke deposits on the active material surface and causes severe deactivation of catalysts. The high temperatures required for the reaction exacerbate this problem.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:
   - Developing new catalyst materials that are less prone to coking
   - Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation
   - Implementing effective regeneration processes to remove coke deposits
   - Using hydrogen pretreatment or co-feeding, as demonstrated with tungsten oxide catalysts, which can activate the catalyst and improve its performance

6. Catalyst activation: In the case of tungsten oxide catalysts, hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding can significantly enhance catalytic activity. This activation is attributed to the reduction of the metal oxide and the presence of multivalent oxidation states.

7. Catalyst performance optimization: The catalytic activity of materials like tungsten oxide strongly depends on factors such as hydrogen pretreatment time and the partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas. These parameters can be adjusted to optimize catalyst performance.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来生产丙烯的方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于其吸热性质和热力学限制，该过程需要高温（高于550°C）。这使得在大气压下可以实现超过50%的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上，铂和氧化铬基催化剂因其优异的性能而在工业上广泛使用。然而，由于铂的高成本和与六价铬物种相关的环境问题，目前正在努力开发新的催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH是一个重要的工业丙烯生产过程，特别是考虑到丙烯作为各种化学品和聚合物原料的需求不断增加。

4. 积碳形成：这是影响催化剂效率的主要问题。积碳沉积在活性材料表面，导致催化剂严重失活。反应所需的高温会加剧这个问题。

5. 减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略：
   - 开发不易积碳的新催化剂材料
   - 优化反应条件以最小化积碳形成
   - 实施有效的再生过程以去除积碳沉积物
   - 使用氢气预处理或共进料，如在氧化钨催化剂中所示，可以活化催化剂并改善其性能

6. 催化剂活化：对于氧化钨催化剂，氢气预处理和/或共进料可以显著提高催化活性。这种活化归因于金属氧化物的还原和多价氧化态的存在。

7. 催化剂性能优化：像氧化钨这样的材料的催化活性强烈依赖于氢气预处理时间和进料气中氢气的分压等因素。可以调整这些参数以优化催化剂性能。
