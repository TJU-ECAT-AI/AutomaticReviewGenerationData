[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[4] "Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected."

[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which corroborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 520°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble-metal alloys, particularly platinum-based catalysts, are widely used. The study introduces a novel Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst supported on γ-alumina.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an industrially important reaction for propylene production, with a focus on high selectivity and stability.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue affecting process efficiency and catalyst lifespan. Coke deposition leads to catalyst deactivation during PDH.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation:
   - Using SAA catalysts: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst showed improved coke resistance compared to traditional Pt catalysts.
   - Optimizing catalyst composition: The high Cu to Pt ratio in the SAA catalyst enhanced propylene desorption and inhibited further dehydrogenation, reducing coke formation.
   - Catalyst design: The single atom dispersion of Pt on Cu nanoparticles dramatically improved propylene selectivity (90%) and catalyst stability.

6. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly discussed, the study mentions the catalyst's excellent stability for over 120 hours of operation, suggesting improved resistance to deactivation and potentially reduced need for frequent regeneration.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst demonstrates a promising approach to addressing the challenges of coke formation and catalyst deactivation in PDH processes, offering high selectivity and stability at industrially relevant conditions.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（约520°C）和大气压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属合金，特别是铂基催化剂被广泛使用。该研究引入了一种新型的γ-氧化铝负载的铂/铜单原子合金（SAA）催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH是一种工业重要的丙烯生产反应，重点关注高选择性和稳定性。

4. 积碳形成：这是影响工艺效率和催化剂寿命的主要问题。在PDH过程中，积碳沉积会导致催化剂失活。

5. 减缓积碳形成的策略：
   - 使用SAA催化剂：与传统的Pt催化剂相比，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出更好的抗积碳能力。
   - 优化催化剂组成：SAA催化剂中高Cu/Pt比例增强了丙烯的脱附并抑制了进一步脱氢，从而减少了积碳形成。
   - 催化剂设计：Pt在Cu纳米颗粒上的单原子分散显著提高了丙烯选择性（90%）和催化剂稳定性。

6. 催化剂再生：虽然没有明确讨论，但研究提到催化剂在120小时以上的操作中表现出优异的稳定性，这表明其对失活的抗性有所提高，可能减少了频繁再生的需求。

Pt/Cu SAA催化剂展示了一种有前景的方法来解决PDH过程中积碳形成和催化剂失活的挑战，在工业相关条件下提供高选择性和稳定性。
