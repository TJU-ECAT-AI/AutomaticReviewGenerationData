[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[4] "Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation41, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected."

[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which corroborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 520°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble metal alloys, particularly Pt-based catalysts, are widely used. The study introduces a novel Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst supported on γ-alumina.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is industrially important for propylene production, with a focus on achieving high selectivity and stability.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue affecting process efficiency and catalyst deactivation. The study shows that coke formation varies among different catalysts, with Pt nanoparticles being most prone to coke formation, followed by Pt/Cu SAA, and then Cu nanoparticles.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:
   - Using SAA catalysts: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst showed improved propylene selectivity (90%) and stability (120 hours of operation at 520°C).
   - Enhancing propylene desorption: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst enhances the desorption of surface-bound propylene, reducing further dehydrogenation and coke formation.
   - Controlling metal dispersion: Single Pt atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles help prohibit further dehydrogenation of propylene, reducing coke formation.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst demonstrates a promising approach to breaking the scaling relationship between catalytic activity and selectivity, offering improved performance in PDH reactions with reduced coke formation.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（约520°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属合金，特别是基于铂的催化剂被广泛使用。该研究引入了一种新型的铂/铜单原子合金（SAA）催化剂，以γ-氧化铝为载体。

3. 工业应用：PDH对于丙烯生产具有重要的工业意义，重点在于实现高选择性和稳定性。

4. 积碳形成：这是影响工艺效率和催化剂失活的主要问题。研究表明，不同催化剂的积碳形成程度不同，铂纳米粒子最容易形成积碳，其次是铂/铜SAA，然后是铜纳米粒子。

5. 减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略：
   - 使用SAA催化剂：铂/铜SAA催化剂表现出改善的丙烯选择性（90%）和稳定性（在520°C下运行120小时）。
   - 增强丙烯脱附：铂/铜SAA催化剂增强了表面结合丙烯的脱附，减少了进一步脱氢和积碳形成。
   - 控制金属分散：分散在铜纳米粒子上的单个铂原子有助于抑制丙烯的进一步脱氢，减少积碳形成。

铂/铜SAA催化剂展示了打破催化活性和选择性之间比例关系的前景，在PDH反应中提供了改进的性能，同时减少了积碳形成。
