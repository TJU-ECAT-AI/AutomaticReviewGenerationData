          [1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[4] "Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected."

[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which corroborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations."

[6] "The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of propylene indicates that the interaction between the propylene and metal sites is weaker for Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA than that for Pt nanoparticles. This weak interaction minimizes carbon deposits on the active Pt sites to help remain the activity during reaction."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 520°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble-metal alloys, particularly platinum-based catalysts, are widely used. The study introduces a novel Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst supported on γ-alumina.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is industrially important for propylene production, with a focus on improving catalyst performance and stability.

4. Coke formation impact: Coke deposition is a major cause of catalyst deactivation during PDH, reducing process efficiency over time.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:
   - Using SAA catalysts: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst shows improved coke resistance compared to traditional Pt catalysts.
   - Optimizing catalyst composition: The high Cu to Pt ratio in the SAA catalyst helps prevent deep dehydrogenation, which leads to coke formation.
   - Catalyst design: Single Pt atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles enhance propylene desorption and inhibit further dehydrogenation, reducing coke formation.
   - Weakening propylene-metal interaction: Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA demonstrate weaker interaction with propylene compared to Pt nanoparticles, minimizing carbon deposits on active Pt sites and maintaining catalyst activity.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst developed in this study demonstrates high propylene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability for over 120 hours of operation, addressing key challenges in PDH catalysis, including coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

          催化直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（约520°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属合金，特别是铂基催化剂被广泛使用。该研究引入了一种新型的γ-氧化铝负载的铂/铜单原子合金（SAA）催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH对于丙烯生产具有重要的工业意义，重点是改善催化剂性能和稳定性。

4. 积碳形成的影响：积碳沉积是PDH过程中催化剂失活的主要原因，随时间推移降低了过程效率。

5. 减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略：
   - 使用SAA催化剂：与传统的Pt催化剂相比，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出更好的抗积碳性能。
   - 优化催化剂组成：SAA催化剂中的高Cu/Pt比有助于防止深度脱氢，从而减少积碳形成。
   - 催化剂设计：分散在Cu纳米颗粒上的单个Pt原子增强了丙烯的脱附并抑制了进一步的脱氢，减少了积碳形成。
   - 减弱丙烯-金属相互作用：Cu纳米颗粒和Pt/Cu SAA与丙烯的相互作用比Pt纳米颗粒弱，最大程度地减少了活性Pt位点上的碳沉积，保持了催化剂活性。

该研究开发的Pt/Cu SAA催化剂展示了高丙烯选择性（90%）和超过120小时的优异稳定性，解决了PDH催化中的关键挑战，包括积碳形成和催化剂失活。
