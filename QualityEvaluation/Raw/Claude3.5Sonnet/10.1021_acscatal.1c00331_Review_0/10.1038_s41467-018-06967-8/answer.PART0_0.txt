[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[4] "Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected."

[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which corroborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations."

[6] "The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of propylene indicates that the interaction between the propylene and metal sites is weaker for Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA than that for Pt nanoparticles. This weak interaction minimizes carbon deposits on the active Pt sites to help remain the activity during reaction."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. The key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 520°C) and atmospheric pressure. 

2. Catalyst types: Noble-metal alloys, particularly platinum-based catalysts, are commonly used. However, there is a trade-off between catalytic activity and selectivity due to scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces.

3. Industrial applications: The development of catalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and selectivity is crucial for industrial applications.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue affecting process efficiency and catalyst deactivation in PDH reactions using Pt-based catalysts.

To address these challenges, particularly coke formation, the following strategies can be implemented:

1. Use of Single Atom Alloys (SAAs): Pt/Cu SAA catalysts have shown high propylene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability for over 120 hours at 520°C.

2. Optimizing metal ratios: A high copper to platinum ratio in γ-alumina-supported Pt/Cu SAA catalysts enhances propylene desorption and inhibits further dehydrogenation.

3. Weakening propylene-metal interaction: Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA demonstrate weaker interaction with propylene compared to Pt nanoparticles, minimizing carbon deposits on active Pt sites and maintaining catalyst activity.

4. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that decrease deep dehydrogenation reactivity can reduce coke formation. The order of decreasing deep dehydrogenation reactivity is Pt nanoparticles > Pt/Cu SAA > Cu nanoparticles.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst performance, increase propylene selectivity, and enhance catalyst stability by mitigating coke formation in the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。这个过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（约520°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属合金，特别是基于铂的催化剂，是常用的。然而，由于过渡金属表面吸附能的缩放特性，催化活性和选择性之间存在权衡。

3. 工业应用：开发同时提高活性和选择性的催化剂对工业应用至关重要。

4. 积碳形成：这是影响基于Pt催化剂的PDH反应过程效率和催化剂失活的主要问题。

为解决这些挑战，特别是积碳形成，可以实施以下策略：

1. 使用单原子合金（SAAs）：Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在520°C下展现出高丙烯选择性（90%）和超过120小时的优异稳定性。

2. 优化金属比例：γ-氧化铝负载的Pt/Cu SAA催化剂中高铜铂比可增强丙烯脱附并抑制进一步脱氢。

3. 减弱丙烯-金属相互作用：Cu纳米颗粒和Pt/Cu SAA与丙烯的相互作用比Pt纳米颗粒弱，最大程度地减少了活性Pt位点上的碳沉积，保持了催化剂活性。

4. 催化剂设计：开发降低深度脱氢反应性的催化剂可以减少积碳形成。深度脱氢反应性降低的顺序为Pt纳米颗粒 > Pt/Cu SAA > Cu纳米颗粒。

这些策略旨在通过减轻PDH过程中的积碳形成来改善催化剂性能，提高丙烯选择性，并增强催化剂稳定性。
