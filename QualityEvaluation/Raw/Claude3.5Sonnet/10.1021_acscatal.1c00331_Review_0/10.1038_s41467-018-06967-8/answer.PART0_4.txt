[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[4] "The Raman spectra (Supplementary Figure 21) show that the ID/IG ratio increases in the order of 0.1Pt/Al2O3 (0.76) < 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3 (0.82) < 10Cu/Al2O3 (0.86), suggesting a reverse order of dehydrogenation degree of the coke."

[5] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles (Fig. 5f) indicate that there are two types of coke on each spent catalyst because of two peaks in each profile. We attribute the small high-temperature peaks centered at around 500 C to the combustion of the hard coke deposited on the support. While the main low-temperature peaks are described as the combustion of the soft coke formed on the metal, of which the temperatures decreased in the order of 0.1Pt (335 C) > 0.1Pt10Cu (265 C) > 10Cu (225 C)."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 520°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble-metal alloys, particularly platinum-based catalysts, are widely used. The study introduces a novel Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst supported on γ-alumina.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an industrially important reaction for propylene production, with a focus on high selectivity and stability.

4. Coke formation impact: Coke deposition on Pt-based catalysts is a major cause of deactivation, reducing process efficiency over time.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation:
   - Using SAA catalysts: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst showed improved coke resistance compared to pure Pt catalysts.
   - Catalyst design: Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles enhance propylene desorption and inhibit further dehydrogenation, reducing coke formation.
   - Optimizing metal ratios: A high copper to platinum ratio in the SAA catalyst improved selectivity and stability.

6. Catalyst regeneration: The study mentions that the initial activity of the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst can be largely restored after regeneration at 600°C, indicating good regeneration capability.

The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst demonstrated high propylene selectivity (90%) and excellent stability (over 120 hours) under industrial-relevant conditions, making it a promising candidate for improving PDH process efficiency.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（约520°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属合金，特别是基于铂的催化剂被广泛使用。该研究引入了一种新型的铂/铜单原子合金（SAA）催化剂，负载在γ-氧化铝上。

3. 工业应用：PDH是一种工业上重要的丙烯生产反应，主要关注高选择性和稳定性。

4. 积碳形成的影响：积碳沉积在基于铂的催化剂上是导致失活的主要原因，随时间推移降低了工艺效率。

5. 减少积碳形成的策略：
   - 使用SAA催化剂：与纯铂催化剂相比，Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出更好的抗积碳性。
   - 催化剂设计：分散在铜纳米粒子上的单铂原子增强了丙烯的解吸并抑制了进一步脱氢，减少了积碳形成。
   - 优化金属比例：SAA催化剂中高铜铂比改善了选择性和稳定性。

6. 催化剂再生：研究提到Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在600°C再生后，其初始活性可以在很大程度上恢复，表明具有良好的再生能力。

Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在工业相关条件下表现出高丙烯选择性（90%）和优异的稳定性（超过120小时），使其成为提高PDH工艺效率的有前景候选者。
