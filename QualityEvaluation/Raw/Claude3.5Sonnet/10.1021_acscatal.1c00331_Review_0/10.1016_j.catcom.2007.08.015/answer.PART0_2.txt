[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles. However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%)"

[5] "The initial rate of coking is an order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher (0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%)."

[6] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an on-purpose method for producing propylene to address supply shortfalls from conventional crackers. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 793 K and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial plants. The study focused on Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15.

3. Industrial applications: PDH can supplement propylene production from conventional sources.

4. Coke formation impact: Coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration. This increases process complexity and operational costs.

5. Catalyst particle size effects: Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher propane conversion but lower propylene selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm). Smaller particles also experienced much higher coking rates.

6. Mitigation strategies: 
- Optimizing Pt particle size: Larger particles showed better selectivity and lower coking rates.
- Catalyst regeneration: Frequent regeneration is necessary but challenging to maintain activity and selectivity.
- Understanding coke effects: Coke can act as a selectivity promoter by deactivating sites responsible for undesired C-C bond activation.

Improving catalyst design by balancing conversion, selectivity, and coking resistance is crucial for enhancing PDH efficiency.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有目的的生产丙烯的方法，用于弥补传统裂解装置的丙烯供应不足。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在793 K和大气压下进行实验。

2. 催化剂类型：商业工厂通常使用Pt或Cr基催化剂。该研究主要关注以SBA-15为载体的Pt催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH可以补充传统来源的丙烯生产。

4. 积碳形成的影响：积碳导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。这增加了工艺复杂性和运营成本。

5. 催化剂粒径效应：较小的Pt粒子（3纳米）显示出更高的丙烷转化率，但丙烯选择性较低，与较大粒子（21纳米）相比。较小的粒子也经历了更高的积碳速率。

6. 缓解策略：
- 优化Pt粒子尺寸：较大的粒子显示出更好的选择性和更低的积碳速率。
- 催化剂再生：需要频繁再生，但维持活性和选择性具有挑战性。
- 理解积碳效应：积碳可以作为选择性促进剂，通过使负责不需要的C-C键活化的位点失活。

改进催化剂设计，平衡转化率、选择性和抗积碳性能对提高PDH效率至关重要。
