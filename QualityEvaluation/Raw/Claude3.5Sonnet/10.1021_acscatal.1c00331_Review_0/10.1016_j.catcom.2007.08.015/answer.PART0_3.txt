[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[5] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."

[6] "In Pt-SBA-15-DP, C3H8 conversion decreases and selectivity to C3H6 increases sharply after a few minutes on stream (Fig. 2a and b) due to deactivation of highly active coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites, for instance at step and edge sites, by coke. This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an on-purpose technology for producing propylene to address supply shortfalls from conventional crackers. The process uses Pt- or Cr-based catalysts in commercial plants.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 793 K and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts on SBA-15 support were examined, with particle sizes impacting performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH can supplement propylene production from conventional sources.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency:

1. It causes catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration.
2. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher coking rates and amounts compared to larger particles (21 nm).
3. Coke formation increases process complexity and operational costs.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Optimizing Pt particle size: Larger particles (21 nm) showed lower coking rates and higher propylene selectivity.
2. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques like TEOM/GC systems to comprehensively study activity, selectivity, and coking behavior.
3. Understanding the dual role of coke: While it deactivates catalysts, it can also improve selectivity by deactivating sites responsible for C-C bond activation.

The study suggests that controlling Pt particle size is crucial for designing efficient PDH catalysts, balancing activity and selectivity while minimizing coking.

丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)是一种有目的的技术，用于生产丙烯以弥补传统裂解装置供应的不足。该过程在商业工厂中使用铂或铬基催化剂。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在793 K和大气压下进行实验。

2. 催化剂类型：研究了SBA-15载体上的铂基催化剂，粒子大小影响性能。

3. 工业应用：PDH可以补充传统来源的丙烯生产。

焦炭形成显著影响过程效率：

1. 它导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。
2. 较小的铂颗粒(3 nm)与较大颗粒(21 nm)相比，显示出更高的结焦速率和数量。
3. 焦炭形成增加了过程复杂性和运营成本。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略：

1. 优化铂颗粒大小：较大的颗粒(21 nm)显示出较低的结焦速率和较高的丙烯选择性。
2. 利用先进的分析技术，如TEOM/GC系统，全面研究活性、选择性和结焦行为。
3. 理解焦炭的双重作用：虽然它使催化剂失活，但也可以通过使负责C-C键活化的位点失活来提高选择性。

研究表明，控制铂颗粒大小对设计高效PDH催化剂至关重要，平衡活性和选择性的同时最小化结焦。
