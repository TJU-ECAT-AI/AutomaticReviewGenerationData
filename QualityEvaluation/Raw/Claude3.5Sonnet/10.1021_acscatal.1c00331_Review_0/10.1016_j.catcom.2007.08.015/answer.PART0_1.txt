[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Pt-SBA-15-DP that contains smaller particles shows much higher initial C3H8 conversion (ca. three times higher) than Pt-SBA-15-IMP which contains larger particles. However, initial selectivity to C3H6 is much lower (< 40%) over the former as compared over the latter ( 90%)"

[5] "The initial rate of coking is an order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher (0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%)."

[6] "These results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation [8,11], namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation [8,11], namely dehydrogenation reactions."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an on-purpose method for producing propylene to address supply shortfalls from conventional crackers. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 793 K and atmospheric pressure, with a specific feed composition and space velocity.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial plants. This study focused on Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used to produce propylene, but faces challenges in implementation.

4. Coke formation impact: Coking significantly affects process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst, necessitating frequent regeneration. This increases process complexity and operational costs.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation:
   - Optimizing Pt particle size: Larger Pt particles (21 nm) showed lower coking rates and higher propylene selectivity compared to smaller particles (3 nm).
   - Understanding structure-activity relationships: Larger Pt particles favor C-H bond activation (dehydrogenation), while smaller particles promote C-C bond activation (cracking and coking).
   - Catalyst design: Developing catalysts with optimal particle sizes and distributions could improve selectivity and reduce coking.

Improving catalyst regeneration was not directly addressed in the study, but the findings suggest that designing catalysts with larger Pt particles could potentially reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles by minimizing coke formation.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种专门生产丙烯的方法，用于弥补传统裂解装置供应的不足。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在793 K和大气压下进行实验，采用特定的进料组成和空速。

2. 催化剂类型：商业装置通常使用Pt或Cr基催化剂。本研究主要关注SBA-15载体上的Pt催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH用于生产丙烯，但在实施过程中面临挑战。

4. 积炭形成的影响：积炭显著影响过程效率，使催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。这增加了过程复杂性和运营成本。

5. 减少积炭形成的策略：
   - 优化Pt粒子尺寸：较大的Pt粒子（21 nm）与较小的粒子（3 nm）相比，表现出较低的积炭速率和较高的丙烯选择性。
   - 理解结构-活性关系：较大的Pt粒子有利于C-H键活化（脱氢），而较小的粒子促进C-C键活化（裂解和积炭）。
   - 催化剂设计：开发具有最佳粒子尺寸和分布的催化剂可以提高选择性并减少积炭。

该研究没有直接涉及改善催化剂再生的问题，但研究结果表明，设计具有较大Pt粒子的催化剂可能通过最小化积炭形成来减少再生周期的频率。
