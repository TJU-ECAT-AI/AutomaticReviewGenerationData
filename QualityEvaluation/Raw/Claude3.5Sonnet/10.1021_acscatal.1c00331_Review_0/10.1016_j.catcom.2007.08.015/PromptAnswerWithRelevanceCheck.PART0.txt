[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[5] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."

[6] "In Pt-SBA-15-DP, C3H8 conversion decreases and selectivity to C3H6 increases sharply after a few minutes on stream (Fig. 2a and b) due to deactivation of highly active coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites, for instance at step and edge sites, by coke. This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for on-purpose propylene production to address the shortfall in propylene supply from conventional crackers. The key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 793 K and atmospheric pressure, with a specific feed composition and flow rate.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. The study focused on monometallic Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is seen as a potential solution to meet the growing demand for propylene that cannot be satisfied by conventional crackers alone.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency:

1. It causes catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration.
2. It increases process complexity and operational costs.
3. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) show higher rates of coking and coke selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm).

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Optimize Pt particle size: Larger Pt particles (21 nm) showed lower coking rates and higher selectivity for propene formation.
2. Utilize coke as a selectivity promoter: Initial coke formation can improve selectivity by deactivating sites active for C-C bond activation.
3. Employ advanced characterization techniques: The study demonstrated the advantage of using TEOM/GC systems to obtain comprehensive information on activity, selectivity, and coking in a single experiment.
4. Develop catalysts with improved stability: Research efforts should focus on catalysts that can maintain activity, selectivity, and stability during regeneration cycles.

Further research into bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn, and understanding the role of additives like Sn could lead to improved catalyst performance and reduced coking.

1. 反应条件：研究在793 K和大气压下进行实验，使用特定的进料组成和流量。

2. 催化剂类型：商业脱氢装置通常使用Pt或Cr基催化剂。该研究主要关注了以SBA-15为载体的单金属Pt催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH被视为满足传统裂解装置无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求的潜在解决方案。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率：

1. 它导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。
2. 它增加了过程复杂性和运营成本。
3. 较小的Pt颗粒（3 nm）比较大的颗粒（21 nm）表现出更高的积碳速率和积碳选择性。

1. 优化Pt颗粒大小：较大的Pt颗粒（21 nm）表现出较低的积碳速率和较高的丙烯形成选择性。
2. 利用积碳作为选择性促进剂：初始积碳形成可以通过使活跃于C-C键活化的位点失活来提高选择性。
3. 采用先进的表征技术：研究展示了使用TEOM/GC系统在单次实验中获得活性、选择性和积碳综合信息的优势。
4. 开发稳定性更好的催化剂：研究努力应集中在可以在再生循环中保持活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂上。

[5] "The initial rate of coking is an order of magnitude higher on Pt-SBA-15-DP than that on Pt-SBA-15-IMP and the initial selectivity to coke on the former is almost two orders of magnitude higher (0.5%) than that on the latter (0.014%)."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an on-purpose method for producing propylene to address supply shortfalls from conventional crackers. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 793 K and atmospheric pressure, with a specific feed composition and space velocity.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial plants. This study focused on Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used to produce propylene, but faces challenges in implementation.

4. Coke formation impact: Coking significantly affects process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst, necessitating frequent regeneration. This increases process complexity and operational costs.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation:
   - Optimizing Pt particle size: Larger Pt particles (21 nm) showed lower coking rates and higher propylene selectivity compared to smaller particles (3 nm).
   - Understanding structure-activity relationships: Larger Pt particles favor C-H bond activation (dehydrogenation), while smaller particles promote C-C bond activation (cracking and coking).
   - Catalyst design: Developing catalysts with optimal particle sizes and distributions could improve selectivity and reduce coking.

Improving catalyst regeneration was not directly addressed in the study, but the findings suggest that designing catalysts with larger Pt particles could potentially reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles by minimizing coke formation.
