[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[5] "These results indicate that small Pt particles are very active for CC bond activation, namely cracking reactions, while relatively large Pt particles are more selective for CH bond activation, namely dehydrogenation reactions."

[6] "This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an on-purpose propylene production technology that can help address the shortfall in propylene supply from conventional crackers. The process typically uses Pt- or Cr-based catalysts in commercial plants.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 793 K and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used. The research examined Pt particles supported on SBA-15.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used as an alternative to conventional crackers for propylene production.

Regarding coke formation on Pt-based catalysts:

1. Impact on process efficiency: Coke formation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration. This increases process complexity and operating costs.

2. Factors affecting coke formation: Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed significantly higher rates of coking and coke selectivity compared to larger particles (21 nm).

3. Mitigation strategies:
   - Using larger Pt particles (21 nm) reduces coke formation while maintaining selectivity for propene.
   - Controlled coke formation can act as a promoter by deactivating sites responsible for undesired C-C bond activation.

4. Catalyst regeneration: The process must regenerate catalysts without losing activity, selectivity, and stability.

The study reveals that Pt particle size significantly influences activity, selectivity, and coke formation in PDH. Smaller particles are more active but less selective, while larger particles are less active but more selective for propene formation. This insight could be valuable for designing more efficient PDH catalysts and processes.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种定向丙烯生产技术，可以帮助解决传统裂解装置丙烯供应不足的问题。该工艺通常在商业装置中使用Pt或Cr基催化剂。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在793 K和大气压下进行实验。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用Pt基催化剂。研究考察了负载在SBA-15上的Pt颗粒。

3. 工业应用：PDH作为传统裂解装置的替代方案用于丙烯生产。

关于Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成：

1. 对工艺效率的影响：积碳形成导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。这增加了工艺复杂性和运营成本。

2. 影响积碳形成的因素：较小的Pt颗粒（3 nm）与较大颗粒（21 nm）相比，显示出显著更高的积碳速率和积碳选择性。

3. 缓解策略：
   - 使用较大的Pt颗粒（21 nm）可以减少积碳形成，同时保持对丙烯的选择性。
   - 控制积碳形成可以作为一种促进剂，通过使负责不需要的C-C键活化的位点失活来提高选择性。

4. 催化剂再生：该过程必须在不损失活性、选择性和稳定性的情况下再生催化剂。

研究表明，Pt颗粒尺寸显著影响PDH中的活性、选择性和积碳形成。较小的颗粒活性更高但选择性较低，而较大的颗粒活性较低但对丙烯形成的选择性更高。这一见解对设计更高效的PDH催化剂和工艺可能具有重要价值。
