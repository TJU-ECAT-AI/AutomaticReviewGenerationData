[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."

[2] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[3] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[4] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[5] "The activity of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In. The selectivities to ethene and propene are nearly 100% for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) 0.48."

[6] "The alloying of In with Pt causes a significant decrease in the accumulation of C during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation. The accumulation of carbon decreases most significantly as the bulk In/Pt ratio increases from 0 to 0.48, and more slowly for higher In/Pt ratios."

[7] "Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene using catalysts to remove hydrogen from propane molecules. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically occurs at high temperatures (around 873 K in this study) with a hydrogen-rich environment to promote the reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts supported on metal oxides are commonly used. In this study, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts were investigated, with the bulk In/Pt ratio being a crucial factor in catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking for producing light alkenes, offering potentially higher selectivity and lower operating temperatures.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. While coke deposition had minimal effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, it caused a 20% loss in propane dehydrogenation activity over 2 hours. This difference is attributed to the varying ease with which coke precursors migrate from metal particles to the support during ethane versus propane dehydrogenation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with promoter elements: In this study, alloying Pt with In significantly reduced coke deposition. The optimal In/Pt ratio was found to be 0.48, resulting in nearly 100% selectivity to propene and minimized coke formation.

2. Optimizing catalyst composition: The bulk In/Pt ratio strongly influences catalyst activity, selectivity, and coke resistance. Finding the optimal ratio (0.48 in this case) can maximize performance and minimize deactivation.

3. Periodic regeneration: The study showed that removing accumulated carbon through oxidation and subsequent reduction in H2 at 873 K could fully restore catalyst activity.

4. Support selection: Using a calcined hydrotalcite-like support (Mg(In)(Al)O) helped stabilize the metal particles and reduce carbon deposition.

By implementing these strategies, PDH processes can achieve higher efficiency, longer catalyst lifetimes, and improved overall performance in propene production.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种使用催化剂从丙烷分子中去除氢来生产丙烯的方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行（本研究中为873 K左右），并在富氢环境中进行以促进反应。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用负载在金属氧化物上的铂基催化剂。在本研究中，考察了Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂，其中体相In/Pt比例是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。

3. 工业应用：PDH是传统方法（如蒸汽裂解）生产轻烯烃的替代方法，可能提供更高的选择性和更低的操作温度。

焦炭形成显著影响过程效率，特别是对于丙烷脱氢。虽然焦炭沉积对乙烷脱氢活性影响较小，但在2小时内导致丙烷脱氢活性损失20%。这种差异归因于乙烷与丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭前体从金属颗粒迁移到载体的难易程度不同。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与助剂元素合金化：本研究表明，将Pt与In合金化显著减少了焦炭沉积。最佳In/Pt比例为0.48，导致丙烯选择性接近100%，并最大程度地减少焦炭形成。

2. 优化催化剂组成：体相In/Pt比例强烈影响催化剂活性、选择性和抗焦性。找到最佳比例（本例中为0.48）可以最大化性能并最小化失活。

3. 定期再生：研究表明，通过氧化去除累积的碳，然后在873 K下用H2还原，可以完全恢复催化剂活性。

4. 载体选择：使用类水滑石焙烧后的载体（Mg(In)(Al)O）有助于稳定金属颗粒并减少碳沉积。

通过实施这些策略，PDH过程可以实现更高的效率、更长的催化剂寿命和改进的整体性能，从而提高丙烯生产效率。
