[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes provides an alternative for producing light alkenes as well as hydrogen, a product required for many refinery operations, most notably heteroatom removal. While thermal dehydrogenation, like steam cracking, is an endothermic process, it occurs at lower temperatures, 9731073 K, but can also produce methane and coke as byproducts."

[2] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[3] "Bimetallic nanoparticles of Pt and the alloying element have also been found to produce less coke [1014], a product that can contribute to deactivation of the catalyst. Catalyst stability is further enhanced by using a metal oxide support free of acid sites that can promote carbon deposition through polymerization of the product alkene"

[4] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[5] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[6] "Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity. This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalysts was done by oxidizing the catalyst in a flow of 10% O2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 20 min and then reducing the catalyst in a flow of 20% H2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 30 min."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an alternative method for producing propene and hydrogen. It occurs at lower temperatures (973-1073 K) compared to thermal dehydrogenation, but can still produce methane and coke as byproducts.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is typically carried out at temperatures around 873 K, with a feed consisting of propane, hydrogen, and an inert gas.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation. However, it must be promoted with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys for high alkene selectivity. The support material is also crucial, with metal oxides free of acid sites being preferred to minimize carbon deposition.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used to produce propene and hydrogen, which are important for various refinery operations and chemical processes.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. It causes a loss in catalytic activity over time, leading to decreased propene production. The formation of coke is more problematic for propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation, as the coke tends to accumulate more on the catalyst surface rather than migrating to the support.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with elements like In, which greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited.
2. Optimizing the bulk ratio of the alloying element to Pt (e.g., In/Pt ratio of 0.48 for maximum activity and selectivity).
3. Using support materials that minimize carbon deposition.
4. Implementing regeneration procedures, such as oxidizing the catalyst in oxygen-containing gas followed by reduction in hydrogen-containing gas.

These strategies help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯和氢气的替代方法。与热脱氢相比，它在较低的温度（973-1073 K）下进行，但仍可能产生甲烷和焦炭副产品。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在873 K左右的温度下进行，原料由丙烷、氢气和惰性气体组成。

2. 催化剂类型：铂是促进烷烃脱氢最有效的过渡金属。然而，它必须与Sn、Zn、Ge、Ga或In等元素结合形成双金属合金，以获得高烯烃选择性。支撑材料也很重要，首选无酸性位点的金属氧化物以最大程度地减少碳沉积。

3. 工业应用：PDH用于生产丙烯和氢气，这对各种炼油操作和化学过程都很重要。

焦炭在基于Pt的催化剂上的形成显著影响过程效率，特别是对于丙烷脱氢。它导致催化活性随时间下降，从而降低丙烯产量。与乙烷脱氢相比，焦炭形成对丙烷脱氢更为问题，因为焦炭倾向于更多地积累在催化剂表面，而不是迁移到支撑材料上。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与In等元素合金化，大大减少焦炭沉积量。
2. 优化合金元素与Pt的体积比（例如，In/Pt比为0.48时活性和选择性最大）。
3. 使用能最大程度减少碳沉积的支撑材料。
4. 实施再生程序，如在含氧气体中氧化催化剂，然后在含氢气体中还原。

这些策略有助于维持催化剂的活性和选择性，从而提高PDH过程的整体效率和可持续性。
