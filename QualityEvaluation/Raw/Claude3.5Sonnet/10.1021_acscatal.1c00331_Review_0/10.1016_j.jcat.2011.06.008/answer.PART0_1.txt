[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."

[2] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[3] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[4] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[5] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[6] "Characterization of the deposit by Raman spectroscopy indicates that the coke is present as highly disordered graphite particles <30 nm in diameter."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that uses catalysts to selectively remove hydrogen from propane molecules. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted reactions at 873 K with a feed consisting of 20% propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance helium.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite-like materials (Mg(In)(Al)O) were used. The addition of indium to form PtIn alloys significantly improved catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the high selectivity and activity of these catalysts suggest potential for industrial use.

4. Coke formation impact: Coke deposition was observed to cause a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity, unlike in ethane dehydrogenation where it had minimal effect. This suggests coke formation is a significant challenge for PDH efficiency.

5. Mitigation strategies:
   - Alloying Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited.
   - Optimizing the In/Pt ratio (found to be 0.48 in this study) maximized activity and selectivity while minimizing coke formation.
   - Periodic catalyst regeneration through oxidation and reduction cycles was shown to restore activity.

6. Catalyst regeneration: The study demonstrated that removal of accumulated carbon after 2 hours of use, followed by H2 reduction at 873 K, fully restored the original catalyst activity.

The research highlights the importance of catalyst design in mitigating coke formation and maintaining high activity and selectivity in PDH processes. The use of bimetallic PtIn catalysts on specially prepared supports offers a promising approach to addressing these challenges in industrial applications.

催化直接脱氢法（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，它使用催化剂有选择性地从丙烷分子中移除氢。关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在873 K下进行反应，进料由20%丙烷、25%氢气和余量氦气组成。

2. 催化剂类型：使用了以焙烧类水滑石材料（Mg(In)(Al)O）为载体的铂基催化剂。添加铟形成PtIn合金显著提高了催化剂性能。

3. 工业应用：虽然没有明确讨论，但这些催化剂的高选择性和活性表明它们具有工业应用潜力。

4. 积碳形成的影响：观察到积碳沉积会导致丙烷脱氢活性下降，这与乙烷脱氢不同，后者几乎没有影响。这表明积碳形成是PDH效率的一个重大挑战。

5. 缓解策略：
   - 将Pt与In合金化大大减少了积碳沉积量。
   - 优化In/Pt比例（本研究中发现为0.48）可以最大化活性和选择性，同时最小化积碳形成。
   - 通过氧化和还原循环进行定期催化剂再生，可以恢复活性。

6. 催化剂再生：研究表明，使用2小时后去除累积的碳，然后在873 K下进行H2还原，可以完全恢复催化剂的原始活性。

该研究强调了催化剂设计在减少积碳形成和保持PDH过程中高活性和选择性方面的重要性。在特制载体上使用双金属PtIn催化剂为解决工业应用中的这些挑战提供了一种有前景的方法。
