[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."

[2] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[3] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[4] "Characterization of the deposit by Raman spectroscopy indicates that the coke is present as highly disordered graphite particles <30 nm in diameter."

[5] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[7] "The activity of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."

[8] "Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period."

[9] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that uses catalysts to remove hydrogen from propane molecules, forming propene. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 873 K with a specific gas composition and flow rate.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite-like materials containing indium (Mg(In)(Al)O) were used. The bulk In/Pt ratio significantly affects catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: The process produces propene with high selectivity, potentially offering an alternative to traditional production methods.

Coke formation impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with In: This significantly reduces coke deposition.

2. Optimizing In/Pt ratio: A bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48 showed maximum activity and nearly 100% selectivity to alkene.

3. Understanding coke accumulation patterns: Coke accumulates differently for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, affecting catalyst performance differently.

4. Catalyst regeneration: The study mentions oxidizing the catalyst to remove coke and then reducing it to restore activity.

5. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that promote coke migration to the support rather than accumulation on active metal sites could improve long-term stability.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles in industrial applications.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，它使用催化剂从丙烷分子中移除氢，形成丙烯。这个过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：研究在873 K下进行实验，使用特定的气体组成和流速。

2. 催化剂类型：使用了以铂为基础、以含铟的煅烧类水滑石材料（Mg(In)(Al)O）为载体的催化剂。体相In/Pt比对催化剂性能有显著影响。

3. 工业应用：该过程能高选择性地生产丙烯，可能为传统生产方法提供替代选择。

焦炭形成通过导致催化剂失活影响过程效率，尤其是对丙烷脱氢而言。减轻焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将铂与铟合金化：这显著减少了焦炭沉积。

2. 优化In/Pt比：体相In/Pt比为0.48时表现出最大活性和接近100%的烯烃选择性。

3. 了解焦炭累积模式：乙烷和丙烷脱氢的焦炭累积方式不同，对催化剂性能的影响也不同。

4. 催化剂再生：研究提到通过氧化催化剂去除焦炭，然后还原以恢复活性。

5. 催化剂设计：开发能促进焦炭向载体迁移而非在活性金属位点累积的催化剂，可以改善长期稳定性。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高活性和选择性，并在工业应用中减少再生周期的频率。
