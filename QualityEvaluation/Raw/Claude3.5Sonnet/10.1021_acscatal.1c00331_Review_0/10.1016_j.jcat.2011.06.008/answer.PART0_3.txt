[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes provides an alternative for producing light alkenes as well as hydrogen, a product required for many refinery operations, most notably heteroatom removal."

[2] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[3] "Bimetallic nanoparticles of Pt and the alloying element have also been found to produce less coke [1014], a product that can contribute to deactivation of the catalyst."

[4] "Catalyst stability is further enhanced by using a metal oxide support free of acid sites that can promote carbon deposition through polymerization of the product alkene"

[5] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[6] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[7] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically occurs at temperatures around 873-973 K.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts are most effective, but require promotion with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys. These alloys improve alkene selectivity and reduce coke formation.

3. Industrial applications: PDH provides an alternative to traditional steam cracking for light alkene production. It also generates hydrogen, which is useful for refinery operations.

4. Support material: Using a metal oxide support free of acid sites helps enhance catalyst stability by reducing carbon deposition.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency, particularly for propane dehydrogenation:

1. It causes deactivation of the catalyst, leading to loss of activity over time.
2. The effect is more pronounced for propane than ethane dehydrogenation.
3. Coke tends to accumulate on both the catalyst particles and the support material.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with elements like In, which greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited.
2. Optimizing the ratio of the alloying element to Pt (e.g., an In/Pt ratio of 0.48 showed optimal performance).
3. Using support materials that facilitate the migration of coke from catalyst particles to the support.
4. Implementing regeneration cycles involving oxidation to remove coke, followed by reduction to restore catalyst activity.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯和氢气的一种方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在873-973 K的温度下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：铂基催化剂最有效，但需要与Sn、Zn、Ge、Ga或In等元素结合形成双金属合金。这些合金可以提高烯烃选择性并减少焦炭形成。

3. 工业应用：PDH为传统蒸汽裂解生产轻质烯烃提供了一种替代方法。它还可以产生对炼油厂操作有用的氢气。

4. 载体材料：使用无酸性位点的金属氧化物载体有助于增强催化剂稳定性，减少碳沉积。

焦炭形成对工艺效率有显著影响，尤其是对丙烷脱氢：

1. 它会导致催化剂失活，使活性随时间降低。
2. 这种影响在丙烷脱氢中比乙烷脱氢更明显。
3. 焦炭倾向于在催化剂颗粒和载体材料上累积。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与In等元素合金化，这可以大大减少沉积的焦炭量。
2. 优化合金元素与Pt的比例（例如，In/Pt比为0.48时表现最佳）。
3. 使用有利于焦炭从催化剂颗粒迁移到载体的载体材料。
4. 实施再生循环，包括氧化去除焦炭，然后还原以恢复催化剂活性。
