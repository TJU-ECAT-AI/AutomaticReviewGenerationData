[1] "Catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes were prepared by dispersing Pt on the surface of a calcined hydrotalcite-like support containing indium, Mg(In)(Al)O."

[2] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[3] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[4] "Characterization of the deposit by Raman spectroscopy indicates that the coke is present as highly disordered graphite particles <30 nm in diameter."

[5] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[7] "The activity of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strong functions of the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactions, the maximum activity is achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a PtIn alloy containing 12% In."

[8] "Whereas only 0.1% of the initial activity for ethane dehydrogenation is lost in 2 h on stream, 20% of the initial activity for propane dehydrogenation is lost over the same period."

[9] "While small domains (30 nm) of graphitic carbon are formed during ethane and propane dehydrogenation, the location of their accumulation depends on the composition of the alkane undergoing dehydrogenation. During ethane dehydrogenation, carbon is accumulated primarily on the support, whereas during propane dehydrogenation, a part of the carbon also accumulates on the PtIn nanoparticles."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that uses catalysts to remove hydrogen from propane molecules, forming propene. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 873 K with a specific gas composition and flow rate.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite-like materials containing indium (Mg(In)(Al)O) were used. The bulk In/Pt ratio significantly affects catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: The process produces propene with high selectivity, potentially offering an alternative to traditional production methods.

Coke formation impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with In: This significantly reduces coke deposition.

2. Optimizing In/Pt ratio: A bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48 showed maximum activity and nearly 100% selectivity to alkene.

3. Understanding coke accumulation patterns: Coke accumulates differently for ethane and propane dehydrogenation, affecting catalyst performance differently.

4. Catalyst regeneration: The study mentions oxidizing the catalyst to remove coke and then reducing it to restore activity.

5. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that promote coke migration to the support rather than accumulation on active metal sites could improve long-term stability.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and reduce the frequency of regeneration cycles in industrial applications.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that uses catalysts to selectively remove hydrogen from propane molecules. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted reactions at 873 K with a feed consisting of 20% propane, 25% hydrogen, and the balance helium.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts supported on calcined hydrotalcite-like materials (Mg(In)(Al)O) were used. The addition of indium to form PtIn alloys significantly improved catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the high selectivity and activity of these catalysts suggest potential for industrial use.

4. Coke formation impact: Coke deposition was observed to cause a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity, unlike in ethane dehydrogenation where it had minimal effect. This suggests coke formation is a significant challenge for PDH efficiency.

5. Mitigation strategies:
   - Alloying Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited.
   - Optimizing the In/Pt ratio (found to be 0.48 in this study) maximized activity and selectivity while minimizing coke formation.
   - Periodic catalyst regeneration through oxidation and reduction cycles was shown to restore activity.

6. Catalyst regeneration: The study demonstrated that removal of accumulated carbon after 2 hours of use, followed by H2 reduction at 873 K, fully restored the original catalyst activity.

The research highlights the importance of catalyst design in mitigating coke formation and maintaining high activity and selectivity in PDH processes. The use of bimetallic PtIn catalysts on specially prepared supports offers a promising approach to addressing these challenges in industrial applications.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene using catalysts to remove hydrogen from propane molecules. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically occurs at high temperatures (around 873 K in this study) with a hydrogen-rich environment to promote the reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts supported on metal oxides are commonly used. In this study, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts were investigated, with the bulk In/Pt ratio being a crucial factor in catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking for producing light alkenes, offering potentially higher selectivity and lower operating temperatures.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. While coke deposition had minimal effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, it caused a 20% loss in propane dehydrogenation activity over 2 hours. This difference is attributed to the varying ease with which coke precursors migrate from metal particles to the support during ethane versus propane dehydrogenation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with promoter elements: In this study, alloying Pt with In significantly reduced coke deposition. The optimal In/Pt ratio was found to be 0.48, resulting in nearly 100% selectivity to propene and minimized coke formation.

2. Optimizing catalyst composition: The bulk In/Pt ratio strongly influences catalyst activity, selectivity, and coke resistance. Finding the optimal ratio (0.48 in this case) can maximize performance and minimize deactivation.

3. Periodic regeneration: The study showed that removing accumulated carbon through oxidation and subsequent reduction in H2 at 873 K could fully restore catalyst activity.

4. Support selection: Using a calcined hydrotalcite-like support (Mg(In)(Al)O) helped stabilize the metal particles and reduce carbon deposition.

By implementing these strategies, PDH processes can achieve higher efficiency, longer catalyst lifetimes, and improved overall performance in propene production.

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行（本研究中为873 K左右），并在富氢环境中进行以促进反应。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用负载在金属氧化物上的铂基催化剂。在本研究中，考察了Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O催化剂，其中体相In/Pt比例是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。

3. 工业应用：PDH是传统方法（如蒸汽裂解）生产轻烯烃的替代方法，可能提供更高的选择性和更低的操作温度。

焦炭形成显著影响过程效率，特别是对于丙烷脱氢。虽然焦炭沉积对乙烷脱氢活性影响较小，但在2小时内导致丙烷脱氢活性损失20%。这种差异归因于乙烷与丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭前体从金属颗粒迁移到载体的难易程度不同。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与助剂元素合金化：本研究表明，将Pt与In合金化显著减少了焦炭沉积。最佳In/Pt比例为0.48，导致丙烯选择性接近100%，并最大程度地减少焦炭形成。

2. 优化催化剂组成：体相In/Pt比例强烈影响催化剂活性、选择性和抗焦性。找到最佳比例（本例中为0.48）可以最大化性能并最小化失活。

3. 定期再生：研究表明，通过氧化去除累积的碳，然后在873 K下用H2还原，可以完全恢复催化剂活性。

4. 载体选择：使用类水滑石焙烧后的载体（Mg(In)(Al)O）有助于稳定金属颗粒并减少碳沉积。

通过实施这些策略，PDH过程可以实现更高的效率、更长的催化剂寿命和改进的整体性能，从而提高丙烯生产效率。

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an alternative method for producing propene and hydrogen. It occurs at lower temperatures (973-1073 K) compared to thermal dehydrogenation, but can still produce methane and coke as byproducts.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is typically carried out at temperatures around 873 K, with a feed consisting of propane, hydrogen, and an inert gas.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation. However, it must be promoted with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys for high alkene selectivity. The support material is also crucial, with metal oxides free of acid sites being preferred to minimize carbon deposition.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used to produce propene and hydrogen, which are important for various refinery operations and chemical processes.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. It causes a loss in catalytic activity over time, leading to decreased propene production. The formation of coke is more problematic for propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation, as the coke tends to accumulate more on the catalyst surface rather than migrating to the support.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with elements like In, which greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited.
2. Optimizing the bulk ratio of the alloying element to Pt (e.g., In/Pt ratio of 0.48 for maximum activity and selectivity).
3. Using support materials that minimize carbon deposition.
4. Implementing regeneration procedures, such as oxidizing the catalyst in oxygen-containing gas followed by reduction in hydrogen-containing gas.

These strategies help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯和氢气的替代方法。与热脱氢相比，它在较低的温度（973-1073 K）下进行，但仍可能产生甲烷和焦炭副产品。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在873 K左右的温度下进行，原料由丙烷、氢气和惰性气体组成。

2. 催化剂类型：铂是促进烷烃脱氢最有效的过渡金属。然而，它必须与Sn、Zn、Ge、Ga或In等元素结合形成双金属合金，以获得高烯烃选择性。支撑材料也很重要，首选无酸性位点的金属氧化物以最大程度地减少碳沉积。

3. 工业应用：PDH用于生产丙烯和氢气，这对各种炼油操作和化学过程都很重要。

焦炭在基于Pt的催化剂上的形成显著影响过程效率，特别是对于丙烷脱氢。它导致催化活性随时间下降，从而降低丙烯产量。与乙烷脱氢相比，焦炭形成对丙烷脱氢更为问题，因为焦炭倾向于更多地积累在催化剂表面，而不是迁移到支撑材料上。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与In等元素合金化，大大减少焦炭沉积量。
2. 优化合金元素与Pt的体积比（例如，In/Pt比为0.48时活性和选择性最大）。
3. 使用能最大程度减少碳沉积的支撑材料。
4. 实施再生程序，如在含氧气体中氧化催化剂，然后在含氢气体中还原。

这些策略有助于维持催化剂的活性和选择性，从而提高PDH过程的整体效率和可持续性。
