[1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[5] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH typically operates at high temperatures (600-700°C) to achieve economically viable conversions. Per-pass conversions range from 30-60% for propane.

2. Catalyst types: Historically, chromia-alumina catalysts were used. More recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts have become prevalent due to their higher activity and selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: As of 2000, there were several commercial PDH units in operation, producing significant amounts of polymer-grade propylene.

4. Coke formation: This is a major challenge in PDH processes. Coke deposition on catalysts leads to deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve regeneration:
   a) Using multiple reactors in parallel, allowing for continuous operation while some reactors undergo regeneration.
   b) Implementing continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology, which enables catalysts to maintain high activity for extended periods without shutting down the reactor.
   c) Modifying catalysts to reduce coke formation and improve stability.

These strategies have significantly improved process efficiency and catalyst longevity in industrial PDH applications.

丙烷的催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH通常在高温（600-700°C）下运行，以实现经济可行的转化率。丙烷的单程转化率范围为30-60%。

2. 催化剂类型：历史上使用铬-氧化铝催化剂。最近，由于活性和选择性更高，铂或改性铂催化剂变得普遍。

3. 工业应用：截至2000年，已有多个商业PDH装置投入运营，生产大量聚合物级丙烯。

4. 积碳形成：这是PDH过程中的主要挑战。催化剂上的积碳沉积导致失活，需要频繁再生。

5. 减少积碳形成和改善再生的策略：
   a) 使用多个并联反应器，允许在一些反应器进行再生时持续运行。
   b) 实施连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术，使催化剂能够在不关闭反应器的情况下长期保持高活性。
   c) 改性催化剂以减少积碳形成并提高稳定性。

这些策略显著提高了工业PDH应用中的过程效率和催化剂寿命。
