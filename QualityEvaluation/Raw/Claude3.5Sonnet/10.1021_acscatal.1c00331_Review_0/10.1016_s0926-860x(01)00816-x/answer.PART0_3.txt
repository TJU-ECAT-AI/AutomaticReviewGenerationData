[1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[5] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[6] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene using catalysts. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: Per-pass conversions typically range from 30-60% for propane. The process requires high temperatures (above 600°C) to achieve economically attractive conversions due to equilibrium limitations.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, chromia-alumina catalysts were used. More recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts have been employed. These catalysts aim to approach equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used commercially to produce propylene. As of 2000, nearly 7 million metric tons of C3-C4 olefins were produced via catalytic dehydrogenation.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. This necessitates frequent regeneration, which can lead to process downtime and reduced overall productivity.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst modification: Using modifiers like arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, or bismuth to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction, which helps reduce coke formation.

2. Continuous Catalyst Regeneration (CCR): This technology, introduced by UOP in the 1970s, allows noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutting down the reactor for regeneration.

3. Parallel reactor systems: Using multiple reactors in parallel, where some are used for dehydrogenation while others are being purged or regenerated, helps maintain continuous production.

4. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that balance activity and selectivity to minimize side reactions and coke formation.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst life, reduce downtime, and improve overall process efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)作为丙烯生产方法通过使用催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯来发挥作用。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：丙烷的单程转化率通常在30-60%范围内。由于平衡限制，该过程需要高温（高于600°C）才能达到经济上有吸引力的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用铬-氧化铝催化剂。近来，铂或改性铂催化剂被广泛应用。这些催化剂旨在接近平衡或接近平衡转化，同时最小化副反应。

3. 工业应用：PDH商业用于生产丙烯。截至2000年，通过催化脱氢生产了近700万公吨的C3-C4烯烃。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过使催化剂失活显著影响过程效率。这需要频繁再生，可能导致工艺停机时间和整体生产力降低。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂改性：使用砷、锡、锗、铅或铋等改性剂来弱化铂-烯烃相互作用，有助于减少积碳形成。

2. 连续催化剂再生(CCR)：这项技术由UOP在20世纪70年代引入，允许贵金属催化剂在不关闭反应器进行再生的情况下保持稳定活性数年。

3. 并联反应器系统：使用多个并联反应器，其中一些用于脱氢，而其他则进行清洗或再生，有助于维持连续生产。

4. 催化剂设计：开发平衡活性和选择性的催化剂，以最小化副反应和积碳形成。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少停机时间，并提高丙烷脱氢过程的整体效率。
