[1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[5] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important industrial method for propene production. The process typically achieves per-pass conversions of 30-60% using chromia-alumina or platinum-based catalysts. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process aims to approach equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation. This requires careful control of temperature, pressure, and residence time.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, chromia-alumina catalysts were used, but more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts have been employed due to their higher activity and selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: As of 2000, there were several commercial PDH units in operation, producing significant quantities of polymer-grade propylene.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a major challenge in PDH, as it leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced process efficiency. To mitigate this issue and improve catalyst regeneration, several strategies have been implemented:

1. Parallel reactor systems: Multiple reactors are used in parallel, allowing some to undergo dehydrogenation while others are being purged or regenerated.

2. Continuous Catalyst Regeneration (CCR) technology: Introduced by UOP in the 1970s, this technology enables noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutting down the reactor for regeneration.

3. Catalyst modifications: Researchers continue to develop improved catalyst formulations that are more resistant to coke formation and can be more easily regenerated.

These strategies have significantly improved the efficiency and longevity of PDH processes, making them more economically viable for industrial-scale propene production.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是丙烯生产的重要工业方法。该过程通常使用铬-氧化铝或铂基催化剂，实现30-60%的单程转化率。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程旨在接近平衡或接近平衡转化，同时最大程度地减少副反应和焦炭形成。这需要精心控制温度、压力和停留时间。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用铬-氧化铝催化剂，但最近由于活性和选择性更高，开始使用铂或改性铂催化剂。

3. 工业应用：截至2000年，已有多个商业PDH装置投入运营，生产大量聚合物级丙烯。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成是PDH的一个主要挑战，因为它会导致催化剂失活和降低工艺效率。为了缓解这个问题并改善催化剂再生，已实施了几种策略：

1. 并联反应器系统：使用多个并联反应器，允许一些进行脱氢，而其他的进行清洗或再生。

2. 连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术：由UOP在20世纪70年代引入，该技术使贵金属催化剂能够保持稳定活性数年，无需关闭反应器进行再生。

3. 催化剂改性：研究人员继续开发改进的催化剂配方，这些配方对焦炭形成更具抗性，并且可以更容易地再生。

这些策略显著提高了PDH过程的效率和寿命，使其在工业规模丙烯生产中更具经济可行性。
