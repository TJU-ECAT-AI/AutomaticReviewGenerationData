          [1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[5] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."

[6] "UOPs catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts."

[7] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[8] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene using catalysts. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH typically operates at high temperatures (above 600°C) to achieve economically viable conversions due to equilibrium limitations. Commercial processes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 30-60% for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Catalyst types: Initially, chromia-alumina catalysts were used. More recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts have become prevalent due to their higher activity and selectivity. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but not selective to dehydrogenation. Modifiers such as arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, and bismuth are used to weaken the platinum-olefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinum-paraffin interaction.

3. Industrial applications: As of 2000, there were several commercial PDH units in operation, producing significant amounts of polymer-grade propylene. The aggregate operating capacity was 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene.

4. Reactor design: UOP's processes typically use radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed or slowly moving bed reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst modification: Using modified platinum catalysts to minimize side reactions and coke formation.

2. Continuous Catalyst Regeneration (CCR) technology: Introduced by UOP in the 1970s, this allows noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutting down the reactor for regeneration.

3. Parallel reactor systems: Using multiple reactors in parallel, where some are used for dehydrogenation while others are being purged or regenerated, helps maintain continuous production.

4. Optimizing reaction conditions: Balancing temperature and conversion levels to minimize coke formation while maintaining economically viable propene yields.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst life, reduce downtime, and improve overall process efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种使用催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯的丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于平衡限制，PDH通常在高温（超过600°C）下运行，以实现经济可行的转化率。商业过程中丙烷脱氢的单程转化率达到30-60%。

2. 催化剂类型：最初使用铬-氧化铝催化剂。近年来，铂或改性铂催化剂因其更高的活性和选择性而变得普遍。未改性的氧化铝负载铂催化剂活性很高，但对脱氢反应不具选择性。使用砷、锡、锗、铅和铋等改性剂来选择性地弱化铂-烯烃相互作用，而不影响铂-烷烃相互作用。

3. 工业应用：截至2000年，已有多个商业PDH装置投入运营，生产大量聚合物级丙烯。总运营能力为90万吨/年聚合物级丙烯和230万吨/年异丁烯。

4. 反应器设计：UOP的工艺通常使用径向流绝热固定床或缓慢移动床反应器，配备改性铂-氧化铝催化剂。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过使催化剂失活显著影响过程效率。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂改性：使用改性铂催化剂以最大程度地减少副反应和积碳形成。

2. 连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术：这项由UOP在20世纪70年代引入的技术允许贵金属催化剂在不关闭反应器进行再生的情况下保持稳定活性数年。

3. 并联反应器系统：使用多个并联反应器，其中一些用于脱氢，而其他则进行清洗或再生，有助于维持连续生产。

4. 优化反应条件：平衡温度和转化水平，以最大程度地减少积碳形成，同时保持经济可行的丙烯产率。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少停机时间，并提高丙烷脱氢过程的整体效率。
