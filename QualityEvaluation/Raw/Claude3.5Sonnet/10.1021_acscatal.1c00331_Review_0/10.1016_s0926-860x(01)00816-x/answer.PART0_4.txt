[1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[5] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH typically operates at high temperatures (above 600°C) to achieve economically attractive conversions. Per-pass conversions range from 30-60% for propane.

2. Catalyst types: Historically, chromia-alumina catalysts were used. More recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts have been employed due to their higher activity and selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: As of 2000, there were several commercial PDH units in operation, producing significant amounts of polymer-grade propylene.

4. Coke formation: This is a major challenge in PDH processes. Coke deposits on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, leading to deactivation.

5. Mitigation strategies: To address coke formation and maintain catalyst activity, several approaches are used:
   a. Multiple reactors in parallel: Some reactors perform dehydrogenation while others are purged or regenerated.
   b. Continuous Catalyst Regeneration (CCR): This technology, introduced by UOP, allows noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for years without shutting down the reactor.

These strategies help to improve process efficiency by ensuring continuous operation and maintaining catalyst performance over extended periods.

丙烷的催化直接脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH通常在高温（超过600°C）下运行，以实现经济可观的转化率。丙烷的单程转化率范围为30-60%。

2. 催化剂类型：历史上使用铬-氧化铝催化剂。最近，由于活性和选择性更高，开始使用铂或改性铂催化剂。

3. 工业应用：截至2000年，已有多个商业PDH装置投入运营，生产大量的聚合级丙烯。

4. 积碳形成：这是PDH过程中的一个主要挑战。在脱氢步骤中，积碳沉积在催化剂上，导致催化剂失活。

5. 缓解策略：为解决积碳形成并保持催化剂活性，采用了几种方法：
   a. 多个并联反应器：一些反应器进行脱氢，而其他反应器进行清洗或再生。
   b. 连续催化剂再生(CCR)：这项由UOP引入的技术允许贵金属催化剂在数年内保持稳定活性，无需关闭反应器。

这些策略通过确保连续运行和长期保持催化剂性能来帮助提高过程效率。
