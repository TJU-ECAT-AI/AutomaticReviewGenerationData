[1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "UOPs catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propene using catalysts. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (typically above 600°C) are required to achieve economically attractive conversions due to equilibrium limitations.

2. Catalyst types: Chromia-alumina catalysts were initially used, but platinum or modified platinum catalysts have become more common in recent years.

3. Industrial applications: Commercial processes achieve per-pass conversions of 30-60% for propane dehydrogenation.

4. Reactor design: Radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed or slowly moving bed reactors are typically used in UOP's processes.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst modification: Using modified platinum catalysts to minimize side reactions and coke formation.

2. Continuous Catalyst Regeneration (CCR) technology: This allows noble metal catalysts to maintain stable activity for several years without shutting down the reactor for regeneration.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions: Balancing temperature and conversion levels to minimize coke formation while maintaining economically viable propene yields.

4. Reactor design: Using multi-stage reactor systems with interstage reheating to control temperature profiles and minimize coke formation.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种使用催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯的丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于平衡限制，需要高温（通常高于600°C）才能达到经济上有吸引力的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：最初使用铬-氧化铝催化剂，但近年来铂或改性铂催化剂变得更加普遍。

3. 工业应用：商业过程中丙烷脱氢的单程转化率达到30-60%。

4. 反应器设计：UOP的工艺通常使用径向流绝热固定床或缓慢移动床反应器。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过使催化剂失活显著影响过程效率。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂改性：使用改性铂催化剂以最大程度地减少副反应和积碳形成。

2. 连续催化剂再生（CCR）技术：这允许贵金属催化剂在不关闭反应器进行再生的情况下保持稳定活性数年。

3. 优化反应条件：平衡温度和转化水平，以最大程度地减少积碳形成，同时保持经济可行的丙烯产率。

4. 反应器设计：使用多级反应器系统和级间再加热，以控制温度分布并最小化积碳形成。
