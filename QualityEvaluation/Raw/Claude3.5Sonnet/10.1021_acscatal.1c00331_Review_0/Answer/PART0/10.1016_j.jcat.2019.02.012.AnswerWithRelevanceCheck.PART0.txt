          [1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[3] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[5] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[6] "The selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

[7] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol1."

[8] "For all materials, a near to zero selectivity to cracking products will be achieved when the conversion approaches to zero. The selectivity-conversion dependences can be interpreted as follows. Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations. They include formation of carbon deposits over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples"

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production through the following key aspects:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH typically operates at high temperatures (around 550°C) under non-oxidative conditions to achieve sufficient conversion.

2. Catalyst types:
   - Traditional industrial catalysts: CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin process) and Pt/Al2O3 (Oleflex process)
   - Emerging alternative: ZrO2-based catalysts, which are more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient

3. Active sites: Coordinatively unsaturated metal cations (e.g., Zrcus in ZrO2) are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation. These can be created by doping, high-temperature reduction, or loading small amounts of metal nanoparticles.

4. Reaction mechanism: Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations, including coke formation and cracking reactions.

5. Catalyst structure effects: 
   - Monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity and selectivity than tetragonal ZrO2. 
   - Smaller crystallite sizes generally lead to higher propene formation rates.

6. Industrial applications: PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production, offering high propene selectivity.

7. Activation energy: The activation energy (Ea) for the PDH reaction is around 150 kJ/mol, regardless of the catalyst used, suggesting similar reaction mechanisms across different catalysts.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst regeneration: Pt/Al2O3 catalysts require treatment under a chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species.

2. Alternative catalysts: ZrO2-based catalysts are being developed as more coke-resistant alternatives.

3. Optimizing catalyst structure: Increasing the ratio of active sites (e.g., Zrcus) to coke-forming sites can improve selectivity and reduce coking.

4. Controlling reaction conditions: Lower conversions generally lead to less coke formation and fewer cracking products.

5. Understanding coke formation mechanisms: Different active sites are responsible for propene formation and coke formation, which could inform catalyst design to minimize coking.

Overall, research is focused on developing more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly catalysts for PDH, with ZrO2-based materials showing promise as alternatives to traditional Pt and Cr-based catalysts.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）作为丙烯生产方法的功能通过以下关键方面实现：

1. 反应条件：PDH通常在高温（约550°C）和非氧化条件下运行，以实现足够的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：
   - 传统工业催化剂：CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin工艺）和Pt/Al2O3（Oleflex工艺）
   - 新兴替代品：基于ZrO2的催化剂，更环保和成本效益高

3. 活性位点：配位不饱和金属阳离子（如ZrO2中的Zrcus）被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。这些可以通过掺杂、高温还原或负载少量金属纳米粒子来创建。

4. 反应机理：丙烯直接由丙烷形成，然后undergo连续转化，包括焦炭形成和裂解反应。

5. 催化剂结构效应：
   - 单斜相ZrO2表现出比四方相ZrO2更高的活性和选择性。
   - 晶粒尺寸越小，通常丙烯形成速率越高。

6. 工业应用：PDH是最大的定向丙烯生产工艺之一，提供高丙烯选择性。

7. 活化能：PDH反应的活化能（Ea）约为150 kJ/mol，无论使用何种催化剂，这表明不同催化剂的反应机理相似。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂再生：Pt/Al2O3催化剂需要在氯气氛围下处理以重新分散铂物种。

2. 替代催化剂：正在开发基于ZrO2的催化剂作为更耐积碳的替代品。

3. 优化催化剂结构：增加活性位点（如Zrcus）与积碳形成位点的比例可以提高选择性并减少积碳。

4. 控制反应条件：较低的转化率通常导致较少的积碳形成和较少的裂解产物。

5. 理解积碳形成机制：不同的活性位点负责丙烯形成和积碳形成，这可以为催化剂设计提供信息以最小化结焦。

总的来说，研究重点是开发更高效、更稳定和更环保的PDH催化剂，其中基于ZrO2的材料作为传统Pt和Cr基催化剂的替代品显示出很大潜力。
