          [1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[2] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[3] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt. However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[4] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

[5] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM)."

[6] "The propane conversion is extremely low (3.2%) at 450C in the conventional reaction mode. Interestingly, the propane conversion can achieve 15% under microwave catalytic reaction mode."

[7] "This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production through the following key aspects:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is a strongly endothermic reaction requiring high temperatures (550-700°C) to achieve good propane conversion due to thermodynamic limitations. However, these high temperatures can lead to side reactions and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, chromium and platinum-based catalysts have shown the best performance for PDH. However, these catalysts have drawbacks such as high cost, scarcity, and potential environmental concerns. Recent research focuses on developing more affordable and environmentally friendly catalysts, such as the CoSn/NC catalyst.

3. Industrial applications: PDH offers a route for high-value utilization of abundant propane resources, especially from shale gas. However, the high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation pose challenges for large-scale implementation.

4. Coke formation impact: Coking is a major issue for Pt-based catalysts, causing deactivation and reduced efficiency over time. This significantly impacts process efficiency and necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration.

5. Mitigation strategies:
   - Adding promoters like tin (Sn) to Pt catalysts can help reduce coking and extend catalyst lifetime.
   - Developing novel approaches like microwave-assisted catalysis, which can achieve higher conversions at lower temperatures (e.g., 15% conversion at 450°C vs 3.2% in conventional mode).
   - Creating new catalyst formulations, such as the CoSn/NC catalyst, which shows promise for improved performance at lower temperatures.

6. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly discussed in the given text, efficient regeneration methods are crucial for maintaining long-term catalyst activity in industrial applications.

The development of new catalysts and reaction modes, such as the microwave-assisted approach with CoSn/NC catalyst, shows potential for addressing key challenges in PDH by improving performance at lower temperatures and reducing coking issues.

          催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产方法的功能体现在以下几个关键方面：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一种强吸热反应，由于热力学限制，需要高温（550-700°C）才能获得良好的丙烷转化率。然而，这些高温可能导致副反应和积碳形成。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上，铬和铂基催化剂在PDH中表现最佳。但是，这些催化剂存在成本高、稀缺和潜在环境问题等缺点。最近的研究集中在开发更经济实惠和环境友好的催化剂，如CoSn/NC催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH为丰富的丙烷资源（特别是来自页岩气的丙烷）提供了高附加值利用途径。然而，高反应温度和催化剂失活对大规模实施构成挑战。

4. 积碳形成的影响：积碳是铂基催化剂的一个主要问题，导致催化剂失活和效率随时间降低。这显著影响了工艺效率，需要频繁进行催化剂再生。

5. 缓解策略：
   - 向铂催化剂中添加锡（Sn）等助剂可以帮助减少积碳并延长催化剂寿命。
   - 开发新方法，如微波辅助催化，可在较低温度下实现更高的转化率（例如，在450°C下实现15%的转化率，而常规模式下仅为3.2%）。
   - 创造新的催化剂配方，如CoSn/NC催化剂，显示出在较低温度下改善性能的潜力。

6. 催化剂再生：虽然在给定文本中没有明确讨论，但有效的再生方法对于在工业应用中维持长期催化剂活性至关重要。

新催化剂和反应模式的开发，如使用CoSn/NC催化剂的微波辅助方法，显示出通过改善低温性能和减少积碳问题来解决PDH关键挑战的潜力。
