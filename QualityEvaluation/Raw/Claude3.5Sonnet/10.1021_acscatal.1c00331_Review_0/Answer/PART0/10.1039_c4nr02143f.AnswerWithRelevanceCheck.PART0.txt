          "Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

"Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives. The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."

"However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

"Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

"Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

"The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into value-added olefins (propylene). This process has become increasingly important due to the growing demand for propylene and decreasing fossil oil reserves.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction requiring high temperatures to achieve high propylene yields. However, these conditions can lead to undesired thermal cracking and rapid coke deposition.

2. Catalyst types: The main commercial catalysts are chromium- and platinum-based. Cr-based catalysts show excellent performance but are limited by toxicity concerns. Pt-based catalysts offer high activity and stability but face challenges with coke formation.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is considered one of the most promising alternatives to traditional propylene production methods like steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Adding promoters: Elements like Sn, La, Ga, and Zn have been shown to enhance catalyst performance.

2. Developing bimetallic catalysts: For example, PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrate improved anti-coking ability by inhibiting propylene adsorption and suppressing cracking reactions.

3. Optimizing catalyst composition: Finding the right balance of metals and promoters to maximize propylene selectivity and minimize deactivation.

These strategies aim to enhance propylene yields while maintaining catalyst stability and longevity in industrial PDH applications.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种通过将低成本饱和烃（丙烷）转化为高附加值烯烃（丙烯）的丙烯生产方法。由于丙烯需求不断增长和化石油储量减少，这一过程变得越来越重要。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个吸热和平衡受限的反应，需要高温才能获得高丙烯产率。然而，这些条件可能导致不希望的热裂解和快速积碳。

2. 催化剂类型：主要的商业催化剂是铬基和铂基催化剂。铬基催化剂性能优异，但受毒性问题限制。铂基催化剂具有高活性和稳定性，但面临积碳形成的挑战。

3. 工业应用：PDH被认为是传统丙烯生产方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解和重油流化催化裂解）的最有前景的替代方法之一。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过导致催化剂失活显著影响过程效率。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：已证明Sn、La、Ga和Zn等元素可以提高催化剂性能。

2. 开发双金属催化剂：例如，PtCu/Al2O3催化剂通过抑制丙烯吸附和抑制裂解反应，表现出更好的抗积碳能力。

3. 优化催化剂组成：找到金属和助剂的适当平衡，以最大化丙烯选择性并最小化失活。

这些策略旨在提高丙烯产率，同时在工业PDH应用中保持催化剂的稳定性和寿命。
