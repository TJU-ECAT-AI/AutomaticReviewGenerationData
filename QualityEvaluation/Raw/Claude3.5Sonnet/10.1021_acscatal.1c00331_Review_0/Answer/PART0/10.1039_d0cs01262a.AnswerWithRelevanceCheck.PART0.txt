          "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

"Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

"The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 1C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts."

"Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

"The strongly endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

"The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."

"Carbon deposition is also dependent on the particle size of Pt and PtSn alloy, as well as the Sn content. In general, carbon deposition under reaction conditions increases with increasing particle size, but higher Sn content suppresses carbon formation."

"To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

"Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

"The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an emerging method for propene production, driven by increasing global demand for propylene and the availability of shale gas. The process involves an endothermic reaction typically performed at high temperatures (around 600-980 K) using Al2O3-supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures are required due to the strongly endothermic nature of the reaction (ΔrH° = 1.28 eV at 298 K).

2. Catalyst types: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are the main commercial options, with Pt-based catalysts being more common due to their high activity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming a promising alternative to conventional propylene production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

The main challenges in PDH are:

1. Propylene selectivity: Reducing byproduct formation and improving selectivity to propylene.
2. Catalyst deactivation: Rapid deactivation occurs due to coke formation and sintering at high temperatures.
3. Catalyst stability: Maintaining catalytic stability is crucial for efficient operation.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and reducing propylene selectivity. The extent of carbon deposition increases with larger particle sizes.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Alloying Pt with other metals: Adding metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In can improve catalytic performance and suppress carbon formation.
2. Controlling particle size and shape of Pt nanoparticles.
3. Optimizing Sn content: Higher Sn content in PtSn alloys has been shown to suppress carbon formation.
4. Selecting appropriate catalyst supports.
5. Catalyst regeneration: Sn addition helps Pt re-disperse during regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the Al2O3 support.

These strategies aim to enhance propylene selectivity, reduce byproduct formation, and improve overall catalyst stability and longevity in the PDH process.

          催化丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)是一种新兴的丙烯生产方法，其发展受到全球丙烯需求增长和页岩气可用性的推动。该过程涉及一个吸热反应，通常在高温（约600-980 K）下使用Al2O3负载的PtSn或CrOx催化剂进行。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的强吸热性质（在298 K时ΔrH° = 1.28 eV），需要高温。

2. 催化剂类型：Pt和Cr基催化剂是主要的商业选择，其中Pt基催化剂因其高活性而更为常见。

3. 工业应用：PDH正成为蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化等传统丙烯生产方法的有力替代方案。

PDH的主要挑战是：

1. 丙烯选择性：减少副产物形成并提高对丙烯的选择性。
2. 催化剂失活：由于高温下的积碳和烧结，催化剂快速失活。
3. 催化剂稳定性：保持催化稳定性对于高效运行至关重要。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活和降低丙烯选择性。碳沉积的程度随着颗粒尺寸的增大而增加。

缓解积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与其他金属合金化：添加如Sn、Ti、Ga、Cu、Co、Zn、Ir和In等金属可以改善催化性能并抑制碳形成。
2. 控制Pt纳米颗粒的尺寸和形状。
3. 优化Sn含量：在PtSn合金中，较高的Sn含量已被证明可以抑制碳的形成。
4. 选择适当的催化剂载体。
5. 催化剂再生：Sn的添加通过在Al2O3载体上提供成核位点，有助于Pt在再生过程中重新分散。

这些策略旨在提高丙烯选择性，减少副产物形成，并改善PDH过程中催化剂的整体稳定性和寿命。
