          [1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas."

[5] "The partially reduced WO3-x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3-x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600°C."

[6] "A rapid deactivation of metal oxide catalysts during propane dehydrogenation requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts. In the commercial Catofin process, CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is typically regenerated after 12 min of dehydrogenation at 575°C."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by converting propane to propene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve significant propane conversion at atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble metals (e.g., platinum) and metal oxides are commonly used catalysts. Industrial processes typically use platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts due to their excellent performance. However, there are efforts to develop alternative catalysts to address issues like high costs of platinum and toxicity of chromium. Partially reduced tungsten oxide (WO3-x) has shown promising results, with higher activity and selectivity than traditional catalysts like Cr2O3 and Ga2O3.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used commercially for the selective production of propene, which is an important feedstock for various chemicals and polymers. The Catofin process is an example that uses CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.

4. Catalyst deactivation: Coke deposition on catalyst surfaces and sintering of active phases cause severe deactivation under high temperature conditions. This is a major challenge in PDH.

5. Strategies to improve catalyst performance and mitigate coke formation include:
   - Frequent catalyst regeneration (e.g., every 12 minutes in the Catofin process)
   - Developing new catalyst materials that are less prone to coking
   - Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation
   - Using hydrogen pretreatment or co-feeding, as demonstrated with tungsten oxide catalysts
   - Controlling oxidation states of the catalyst

6. Catalyst activation: For tungsten oxide catalysts, activation by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding hydrogen during the reaction improves catalytic activity. The catalytic activity depends on the hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas.

7. Catalyst performance optimization: Carefully controlling factors such as pretreatment conditions and reaction parameters can significantly enhance catalyst performance and potentially improve resistance to deactivation.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是通过将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气来生产丙烯的方法。关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是高度吸热的反应，需要高温（超过550°C）才能在大气压下实现显著的丙烷转化。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属（如铂）和金属氧化物是常用的催化剂。工业过程通常使用铂或铬氧化物基催化剂，因为它们具有优异的性能。然而，由于铂的高成本和铬的毒性，目前正在努力开发替代催化剂。部分还原的氧化钨（WO3-x）显示出很有前景的结果，其活性和选择性高于传统的Cr2O3和Ga2O3催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH在商业上用于选择性生产丙烯，丙烯是多种化学品和聚合物的重要原料。Catofin工艺是一个使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的例子。

4. 催化剂失活：在高温条件下，催化剂表面的积碳沉积和活性相的烧结会导致严重的失活。这是PDH面临的一个主要挑战。

5. 改善催化剂性能和减少积碳形成的策略包括：
   - 频繁的催化剂再生（例如，在Catofin工艺中每12分钟一次）
   - 开发不易积碳的新催化剂材料
   - 优化反应条件以最小化积碳形成
   - 使用氢气预处理或共进料，如在氧化钨催化剂中所示
   - 控制催化剂的氧化态

6. 催化剂活化：对于氧化钨催化剂，通过氢气预处理和/或在反应过程中共进料氢气可以提高催化活性。催化活性取决于氢气预处理时间和进料气中氢气的分压。

7. 催化剂性能优化：仔细控制预处理条件和反应参数等因素可以显著提高催化剂性能，并可能改善其抗失活能力。
