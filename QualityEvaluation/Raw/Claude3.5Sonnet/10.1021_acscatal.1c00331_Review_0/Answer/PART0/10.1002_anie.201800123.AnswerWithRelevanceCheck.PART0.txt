          [1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[5] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."

[6] "Clearly, the coke deposits more slowly on those catalysts covered with hydroxyl groups, and this is the reason why the catalysts with sufficient H2 pretreatment possess higher stability."

[7] "Although V2O3 (structure III) is active for dehydrogenation, it also can easily induce coke formation because of its strong binding towards propylene."

[8] "In contrast, the formation of acetone is much harder over structure II, thus leading to favorable production of propylene (see FigureS32). Moreover, the existence of surface OH groups blocks the exposed V ion and thus enhances C3H6 desorption and prevents coke formation, resulting in higher stability of the catalyst."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propylene. This process has become more commercially attractive due to the low price of propane from shale gas production. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 600°C as mentioned in the study).

2. Catalyst types: Industrial PDH catalysts include Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, but these have limitations such as high cost and toxicity. Supported vanadium catalysts are promising alternatives due to their activity, selectivity, and regeneration performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used for on-purpose propylene production, which is an important feedstock for various products like polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and phenol.

Coke formation is a major issue affecting process efficiency in PDH. For vanadium-based catalysts:

1. Coke deposition is the main reason for catalyst deactivation.
2. Highly reduced V2O3 structures can induce coke formation due to strong binding with propylene.
3. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include:
   a. Controlling the oxidation state of vanadium.
   b. Introducing surface hydroxyl groups, which block exposed V ions, enhance propylene desorption, and prevent coke formation.
   c. Tuning the catalyst structure to favor propylene production over acetone formation.
   d. Pretreatment with H2 to create hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface, which slow down coke deposition and improve catalyst stability.

These strategies can improve catalyst stability and regeneration performance. While the document doesn't specifically address Pt-based catalysts, similar principles of controlling surface structure and reaction conditions likely apply to mitigate coke formation and improve regeneration for those catalysts as well.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）通过将丙烷转化为丙烯来作为丙烯生产的一种方法。由于页岩气生产使丙烷价格降低，这一过程在商业上变得更具吸引力。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行（如研究中提到的600°C）。

2. 催化剂类型：工业PDH催化剂包括基于Pt和CrOx的催化剂，但这些催化剂存在成本高和毒性等限制。负载型钒催化剂是有前景的替代品，因为它们具有良好的活性、选择性和再生性能。

3. 工业应用：PDH用于定向丙烯生产，丙烯是多种产品的重要原料，如聚丙烯、环氧丙烷、丙烯腈和苯酚。

焦炭形成是影响PDH过程效率的主要问题。对于钒基催化剂：

1. 焦炭沉积是催化剂失活的主要原因。
2. 高度还原的V2O3结构由于与丙烯的强结合而易于诱导焦炭形成。
3. 减少焦炭形成的策略包括：
   a. 控制钒的氧化态。
   b. 引入表面羟基，阻挡暴露的V离子，增强丙烯脱附，防止焦炭形成。
   c. 调整催化剂结构，有利于丙烯生产而非丙酮形成。
   d. 用H2预处理以在催化剂表面形成羟基，这可以减缓积碳沉积并提高催化剂稳定性。

这些策略可以提高催化剂的稳定性和再生性能。虽然文献没有具体讨论基于Pt的催化剂，但类似的控制表面结构和反应条件的原理可能也适用于减少焦炭形成和改善这些催化剂的再生。
