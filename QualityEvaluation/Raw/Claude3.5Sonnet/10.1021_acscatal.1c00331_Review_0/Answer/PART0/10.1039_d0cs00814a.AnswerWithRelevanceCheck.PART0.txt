          "Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below (eqn (1)): C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)"

"The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane"

"Indeed, temperatures of 550750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar."

"To date, several representative processes for propane dehydrogenation have been emerging. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin processes have been commercialized and most widely applied"

"Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commercialized, respectively."

"Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."

"Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."

"Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface"

"In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."

"Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a process that converts propane into propylene and hydrogen. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures (550-750°C) and low partial pressures to achieve higher propane conversions.

2. Catalyst types: Commercially used catalysts include Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. Pt catalysts show excellent activity but are prone to coking and sintering. CrOx catalysts are cheaper but have environmental issues.

3. Industrial applications: The Oleflex and Catofin processes are the most widely applied commercial PDH technologies.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering active sites, particularly on smaller nanoparticles. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Facilitating propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene.
2. Co-feeding H2 to reduce the coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors.
3. Co-feeding CO2 as a soft oxidant to reduce coke formation via the reverse Boudouard reaction.
4. Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing conditions followed by H2 reduction to remove coke and reactivate the catalysts.
5. Optimizing catalyst design to enhance stability and resistance to coking.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high propylene selectivity, and improve overall process efficiency in PDH reactions.

          催化直接脱氢法（PDH）是一种将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气的过程。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程高度吸热，需要高温（550-750°C）和低分压以实现更高的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：商业使用的催化剂包括基于铂和基于氧化铬的催化剂。铂催化剂显示出优异的活性，但容易结焦和烧结。氧化铬催化剂较便宜，但存在环境问题。

3. 工业应用：Oleflex和Catofin工艺是最广泛应用的商业PDH技术。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过覆盖活性位点显著影响了工艺效率，特别是在较小的纳米颗粒上。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 促进丙烯脱附和增加丙烯脱氢的能垒。
2. 共进料H2以减少深度脱氢积碳前体的覆盖。
3. 共进料CO2作为温和的氧化剂，通过逆布德瓦反应减少积碳形成。
4. 在氧化条件下再生催化剂，然后进行H2还原，以去除积碳并重新激活催化剂。
5. 优化催化剂设计以提高稳定性和抗积碳能力。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高丙烯选择性，并提高PDH反应的整体工艺效率。
