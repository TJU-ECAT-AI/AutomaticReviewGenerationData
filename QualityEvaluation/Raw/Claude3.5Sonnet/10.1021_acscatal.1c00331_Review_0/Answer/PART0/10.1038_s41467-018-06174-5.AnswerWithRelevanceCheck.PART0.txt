          "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

"In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

"Due to the thermodynamic constrains, methane activation was investigated at 800 C, while the tests with other alkanes were carried out at 550 C, where PDH was also performed."

"A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds"

"Carbon deposits were the main side product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction"

"When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites caused by temperature-induced sintering process"

"The yield of propene within one PDH cycle initially increased and then decreased with rising time on stream at 550 C but continuously decreased at higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 9). The increase is related to the formation of Zrcus sites, while the decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by formation of carbon deposits, which could be removed upon oxidative catalyst regeneration as proven by stable catalyst performance within first 20 cycles at 550 C (Fig. 4b)."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an environmentally friendly process for propene production, using natural/shale gas feedstock with fewer impurities compared to oil-based cracking. It addresses the gap between propene demand and supply.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Typically performed at 550°C-625°C. Higher temperatures increase productivity but reduce catalyst durability due to sintering.

2. Catalyst types: 
   - Traditional catalysts: Supported CrOx or Pt species
   - Novel catalyst: ZrO2 (introduced in the study)
   
   Drawbacks of traditional catalysts:
   - CrOx: Health risks due to Cr(VI) exposure
   - Pt-based: High cost and deactivation through sintering

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for propene production.

4. Coke formation: A major challenge causing catalyst deactivation. However, in some processes (e.g., CATOFIN), coke deposits can indirectly contribute to cost minimization by providing heat during regeneration.

5. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration:
   - Pt catalysts: Regeneration often involves using harmful chlorine-containing compounds.
   - ZrO2 catalyst: Oxidative regeneration can effectively remove carbon deposits and restore performance.

6. Reaction mechanism: The dehydrogenation process involves breaking C-H bonds, with the formation of intermediates affecting the reaction kinetics.

Strategies to improve PDH efficiency include optimizing reaction conditions, developing coke-resistant catalysts, and finding environmentally friendly regeneration methods. The novel ZrO2 catalyst shows promise in addressing some of these challenges by offering improved activity, durability, and easier regeneration.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种环境友好的丙烯生产方法，使用天然气/页岩气作为原料，相比于基于石油的裂解含有更少的杂质。它旨在解决丙烯供需之间的差距。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：通常在550°C-625°C下进行。较高的温度会提高生产率，但由于烧结会降低催化剂的耐久性。

2. 催化剂类型：
   - 传统催化剂：负载的CrOx或Pt物种
   - 新型催化剂：ZrO2（研究中引入）
   
   传统催化剂的缺点：
   - CrOx：由于Cr(VI)暴露带来健康风险
   - 基于Pt的催化剂：成本高昂且易因烧结而失活

3. 工业应用：PDH在丙烯生产中变得越来越重要。

4. 积碳形成：导致催化剂失活的主要挑战。然而，在某些工艺中（如CATOFIN），积碳可以间接贡献于降低成本，通过在再生过程中提供热量。

5. 催化剂失活和再生：
   - Pt催化剂：再生常常涉及使用有害的含氯化合物。
   - ZrO2催化剂：氧化再生可以有效去除碳沉积物并恢复性能。

6. 反应机理：脱氢过程涉及断裂C-H键，中间体的形成影响反应动力学。

提高PDH效率的策略包括优化反应条件、开发耐焦炭的催化剂，以及寻找环境友好的再生方法。新型ZrO2催化剂在解决这些挑战方面显示出前景，提供了改进的活性、耐久性和更容易的再生。
