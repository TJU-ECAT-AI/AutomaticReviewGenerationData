          [1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13 15]."

[2] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[3] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 580°C) to achieve good conversion rates.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, due to their high cost, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns (especially for Cr), researchers are exploring alternatives such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts. V-based catalysts are particularly promising due to their reasonable price and environmental friendliness.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been successfully implemented in commercial settings, with ongoing research to improve catalyst performance and process efficiency.

Coke formation is a significant challenge in PDH, particularly for Pt-based catalysts. It leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced process efficiency. To mitigate this issue and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies include:

1. Developing alternative catalyst formulations, such as V-based catalysts (e.g., VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, VOX/Al2O3), which have shown better stability and regeneration capabilities.

2. Implementing periodic regeneration cycles to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity. For example, the VOX-SiO2 catalyst showed remarkable long-term stability over eight reaction-regeneration cycles.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene selectivity. The study reported propene selectivity remaining at approximately 91% even as conversion decreased.

4. Using oxidative regeneration to fully recover catalyst activity, as demonstrated with the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high propene selectivity, and ensure stable propane conversion rates over extended periods of operation, ultimately improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process for propene production.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（如580°C）下进行，以获得良好的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用Pt和Cr基催化剂。然而，由于它们的高成本、失活问题和环境问题（特别是Cr），研究人员正在探索V、Ga和Sn基催化剂等替代品。V基催化剂因其合理的价格和环境友好性而特别有前景。

3. 工业应用：PDH已成功应用于商业环境，并持续进行研究以提高催化剂性能和工艺效率。

结焦是PDH面临的一个重大挑战，特别是对于Pt基催化剂。它导致催化剂失活和工艺效率降低。为了缓解这个问题并改善催化剂再生，采取的策略包括：

1. 开发替代催化剂配方，如V基催化剂（例如VOX/MCM-41、VOX/SiO2-Al2O3、VOX/Al2O3），它们表现出更好的稳定性和再生能力。

2. 实施周期性再生循环，以去除焦炭沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。例如，VOX-SiO2催化剂在八个反应-再生循环中表现出显著的长期稳定性。

3. 优化反应条件，以最小化结焦形成，同时保持高丙烯选择性。研究报告显示，即使转化率下降，丙烯选择性仍保持在约91%。

4. 使用氧化再生完全恢复催化剂活性，如VOX/MCM-41催化剂所示。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，维持高丙烯选择性，并确保在长期运行中保持稳定的丙烷转化率，最终提高PDH工艺在丙烯生产中的整体效率和可持续性。
