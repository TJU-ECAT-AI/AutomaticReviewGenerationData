          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years"

[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process. This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation"

[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."

[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."

[5] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."

[6] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."

[7] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."

[8] "Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and assigned to coke on the metal and the support, respectively. Coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic."

[9] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces. A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose technique for propylene production, commercially developed since the 1980s. It significantly contributes to global propylene supply. The process primarily uses Pt-based catalysts, with PtSn/Al2O3 being common in commercial applications like the Oleflex process.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature is crucial, affecting coke formation regardless of gas composition. Pressure and gas composition (propane, propylene, and hydrogen concentrations) also impact reaction kinetics and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts, especially those modified with Sn or alkali metals, are widely used due to their high activity and selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is implemented in commercial processes like Oleflex, contributing substantially to propylene production.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a major challenge, causing rapid catalyst deactivation. Two types of coke are formed: aliphatic coke on the metal surface and aromatic coke on the support. Only a small part of the formed coke is responsible for catalyst deactivation, but it necessitates frequent regeneration cycles.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling temperature and gas composition, especially hydrogen concentration, can help reduce coke formation.

2. Catalyst design: Modifying catalysts (e.g., adding Sn to Pt) can help reduce coking rates while maintaining activity and selectivity.

3. Understanding formation mechanisms: Knowledge of coke formation pathways on both metal and support surfaces can guide process optimization and catalyst design.

4. Hydrogen addition: Adding hydrogen to the reaction mixture can suppress coke precursor formation, though it cannot remove already formed coke.

5. Periodic regeneration: Implementing efficient regeneration cycles to remove coke and restore catalyst activity is crucial for maintaining process efficiency.

By addressing these factors and implementing appropriate strategies, PDH processes can achieve better catalyst stability, longer operation times between regenerations, and improved overall efficiency in propylene production.

          催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产技术，自20世纪80年代开始商业化应用。它对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。该工艺主要使用基于铂的催化剂，其中PtSn/Al2O3在Oleflex等商业应用中很常见。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：温度至关重要，影响积碳形成，且不受气体组成影响。压力和气体组成（丙烷、丙烯和氢气浓度）也影响反应动力学和积碳形成。

2. 催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂，特别是经锡或碱金属改性的催化剂，由于其高活性和选择性而被广泛使用。

3. 工业应用：PDH在Oleflex等商业工艺中得到应用，为丙烯生产做出重要贡献。

在基于铂的催化剂上形成积碳是PDH面临的主要挑战，导致催化剂快速失活。形成的积碳有两种类型：金属表面上的脂肪族积碳和载体上的芳香族积碳。虽然只有一小部分形成的积碳导致催化剂失活，但它仍需要频繁的再生循环。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 优化反应条件：控制温度和气体组成，特别是氢气浓度，可以帮助减少积碳形成。

2. 催化剂设计：改性催化剂（如向铂中添加锡）可以帮助减少积碳速率，同时保持活性和选择性。

3. 了解形成机理：对金属和载体表面积碳形成途径的了解可以指导工艺优化和催化剂设计。

4. 添加氢气：向反应混合物中添加氢气可以抑制积碳前体的形成，虽然它不能去除已形成的积碳。

5. 定期再生：实施高效的再生循环以去除积碳并恢复催化剂活性对于维持过程效率至关重要。

通过解决这些因素并实施适当的策略，PDH工艺可以实现更好的催化剂稳定性，延长再生之间的操作时间，并提高丙烯生产的整体效率。
