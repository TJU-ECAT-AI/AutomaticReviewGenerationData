          [1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[5] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."

[6] "In Pt-SBA-15-DP, C3H8 conversion decreases and selectivity to C3H6 increases sharply after a few minutes on stream (Fig. 2a and b) due to deactivation of highly active coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites, for instance at step and edge sites, by coke. This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an on-purpose technology for producing propylene to address supply shortfalls from conventional crackers. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 793 K and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are typically used in commercial plants. The study focused on Pt catalysts supported on SBA-15.

3. Industrial applications: PDH can supplement propylene production from conventional sources.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency:

1. It causes catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration.
2. This increases process complexity and operational costs.
3. Smaller Pt particles (3 nm) showed higher coking rates and amounts compared to larger particles (21 nm).

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Optimizing Pt particle size: Larger particles (21 nm) showed lower coking rates and higher propylene selectivity.
2. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques like TEOM/GC systems to comprehensively study activity, selectivity, and coking behavior.
3. Understanding the dual role of coke: While it deactivates catalysts, it can also improve selectivity by deactivating sites responsible for C-C bond activation.
4. Controlled coke formation: Initial coke formation can act as a promoter to improve selectivity.
5. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that maintain activity, selectivity, and stability during regeneration cycles.

The study suggests that controlling Pt particle size is crucial for designing efficient PDH catalysts, balancing activity and selectivity while minimizing coking. Further research into bimetallic catalysts and additives could lead to improved catalyst performance and reduced coking.

          丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种有目的的技术，用于生产丙烯以弥补传统裂解装置供应的不足。PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在793 K和大气压下进行实验。

2. 催化剂类型：商业工厂通常使用Pt或Cr基催化剂。该研究主要关注以SBA-15为载体的Pt催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH可以补充传统来源的丙烯生产。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率：

1. 它导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。
2. 这增加了工艺复杂性和运营成本。
3. 较小的Pt粒子（3纳米）与较大粒子（21纳米）相比，显示出更高的积碳速率和数量。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略：

1. 优化Pt粒子尺寸：较大的粒子（21纳米）显示出较低的积碳速率和较高的丙烯选择性。
2. 利用先进的分析技术，如TEOM/GC系统，全面研究活性、选择性和积碳行为。
3. 理解积碳的双重作用：虽然它使催化剂失活，但也可以通过使负责C-C键活化的位点失活来提高选择性。
4. 控制积碳形成：初始积碳形成可以作为促进剂来提高选择性。
5. 催化剂设计：开发在再生循环中保持活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。

研究表明，控制Pt粒子大小对设计高效PDH催化剂至关重要，平衡活性和选择性的同时最小化积碳。对双金属催化剂和添加剂的进一步研究可能会导致催化剂性能的改善和积碳的减少。
