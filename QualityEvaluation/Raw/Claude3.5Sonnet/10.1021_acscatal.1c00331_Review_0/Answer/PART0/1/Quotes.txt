[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[5] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."

[6] "In Pt-SBA-15-DP, C3H8 conversion decreases and selectivity to C3H6 increases sharply after a few minutes on stream (Fig. 2a and b) due to deactivation of highly active coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites, for instance at step and edge sites, by coke. This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

"The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

"Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

"β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."

"The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

"The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."

"Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity"

[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic, respectively."

[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."

[4] "We find that carbon-rich surfaces show much higher selectivity for propylene production over competing cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces"

[5] "Tan et al. found that phosphate-stabilized Fe3C can achieve PDH selectivity to propylene as high as 80% and 20% conversion of propane."

[6] "Finally, we investigated the role of phosphate in suppressing coke formation and found that the electron-withdrawing character of phosphate destabilizes surface carbon."

[7] "The suppression of surface carbon by phosphate and analysis of charge transfer shows that phosphate weakens the FeC interaction to destabilize surface carbon atom and prevent coking."

"Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

"Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

"The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 1C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts."

"Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

"The strongly endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

"The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."

"Carbon deposition is also dependent on the particle size of Pt and PtSn alloy, as well as the Sn content. In general, carbon deposition under reaction conditions increases with increasing particle size, but higher Sn content suppresses carbon formation."

"To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

"Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

"The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

"In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

"In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

"Due to the thermodynamic constrains, methane activation was investigated at 800 C, while the tests with other alkanes were carried out at 550 C, where PDH was also performed."

"A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds"

"Carbon deposits were the main side product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction"

"When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites caused by temperature-induced sintering process"

"The yield of propene within one PDH cycle initially increased and then decreased with rising time on stream at 550 C but continuously decreased at higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 9). The increase is related to the formation of Zrcus sites, while the decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by formation of carbon deposits, which could be removed upon oxidative catalyst regeneration as proven by stable catalyst performance within first 20 cycles at 550 C (Fig. 4b)."

[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

[5] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[6] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

[7] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped. The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

"Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

"PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

"Developing an economically viable and eco-friendly catalyst is essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. In this context, cobalt-based catalysts supported on different morphologies of γ-Al2O3, nano-sheet (Al2O3NS), nano-fiber (Al2O3NF) and nano-plate (Al2O3NP) were synthesized using wetness impregnation method and tested for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction."

"The presence of tetrahedral coordinated Co+2 in Co/Al2O3NS leads to higher selectivity towards propylene. The formation of metallic cobalt from Co3O4 precursor present in Co/Al2O3NP promoted side reactions to form lower hydrocarbons and carbon, which caused catalyst deactivation."

"There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

"For further development of cobalt based catalyst, lower cobalt loading should be preferred, and modification of support with TiO2, ZrO2 or SiO2 might help to suppress the strong Lewis acidic center and prevent coke deposition."

[1] "Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines."

[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[4] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[5] "There are two undesirable aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction: one is high energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, and a large amount of unconverted propane must be recycled back to the reactor after separation, leading to large equipment investment and high energy consumption."

[6] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."

[7] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."

[8] "The catalyst deactivates quickly due to coke deposition, because the strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions."

[9] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."

[10] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[11] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions."

[3] "Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[4] "The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/ or electronic effect"

[5] "Zinc can give a remarkable improvement in dehydrogenation performance of catalysts. High propylene selectivity (97%) can be obtained over zinc-doped catalysts."

[6] "The presence of zinc modifies the metallic phase, mainly by geometric and electronic modifications of the metallic phase. These modifications could be responsible for the improvement of catalytic performance."

[7] "Coke was analyzed by TPO and O2-pulse experiments. O2-pulse experiment is a special technology used for quantitative coke analysis."

[8] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."

[9] "Firstly, Zn can decrease the size of surface Pt ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydrogenated species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles. Secondly, the Zn presence brings about an increase in the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, which will weaken the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and repulse coke precursors."

[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[4] "Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected."

[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which corroborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations."

[6] "The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of propylene indicates that the interaction between the propylene and metal sites is weaker for Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA than that for Pt nanoparticles. This weak interaction minimizes carbon deposits on the active Pt sites to help remain the activity during reaction."

[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[2] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[3] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt. However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[4] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

[5] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM)."

[6] "The propane conversion is extremely low (3.2%) at 450C in the conventional reaction mode. Interestingly, the propane conversion can achieve 15% under microwave catalytic reaction mode."

[7] "This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

"Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

"Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives. The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."

"However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

"Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

"Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

"The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[3] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[5] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[6] "The selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

[7] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol1."

[8] "For all materials, a near to zero selectivity to cracking products will be achieved when the conversion approaches to zero. The selectivity-conversion dependences can be interpreted as follows. Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations. They include formation of carbon deposits over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples"

"Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below (eqn (1)): C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)"

"The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane"

"Indeed, temperatures of 550750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar."

"To date, several representative processes for propane dehydrogenation have been emerging. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin processes have been commercialized and most widely applied"

"Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commercialized, respectively."

"Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."

"Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."

"Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface"

"In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."

"Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature."

[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."

[5] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."

[6] "The coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability. The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."

[7] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site. Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."

[8] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[9] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation. For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization."

[10] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[5] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."

[6] "Clearly, the coke deposits more slowly on those catalysts covered with hydroxyl groups, and this is the reason why the catalysts with sufficient H2 pretreatment possess higher stability."

[7] "Although V2O3 (structure III) is active for dehydrogenation, it also can easily induce coke formation because of its strong binding towards propylene."

[8] "In contrast, the formation of acetone is much harder over structure II, thus leading to favorable production of propylene (see FigureS32). Moreover, the existence of surface OH groups blocks the exposed V ion and thus enhances C3H6 desorption and prevents coke formation, resulting in higher stability of the catalyst."

[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13 15]."

[2] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[3] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."

[2] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production."

[3] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O3 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst."

[5] "We postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed."

[6] "The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke. The coke could be completely removed within only 5min by an air stream at the PDH temperature."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective. Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes provides an alternative for producing light alkenes as well as hydrogen, a product required for many refinery operations, most notably heteroatom removal."

[2] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[3] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[4] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[5] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalysts was done by oxidizing the catalyst in a flow of 10% O2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 20 min and then reducing the catalyst in a flow of 20% H2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 30 min."

"Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production"

"Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions"

"Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation"

"For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH"

"Here, we report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures. Intermetallic PtGa displays three-hold-Pt ensembles and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface, the former of which can be selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition."

"The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas."

[5] "The partially reduced WO3-x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3-x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600°C."

[6] "A rapid deactivation of metal oxide catalysts during propane dehydrogenation requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts. In the commercial Catofin process, CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is typically regenerated after 12 min of dehydrogenation at 575°C."

[1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[5] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."

[6] "UOPs catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts."

[7] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[8] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory."

[3] "The critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability."

[4] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties."

[5] "The multiple PtPt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.)."

[6] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years"

[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process. This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation"

[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."

[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."

[5] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."

[6] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."

[7] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."

[8] "Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and assigned to coke on the metal and the support, respectively. Coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic."

[9] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces. A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."

"From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

"However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."

"Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

"Temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

"Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."

"Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

"To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

[1] "On-purpose propylene production technologies such as dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) have the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers"

[2] "Typically, Pt- or Cr-based catalysts are used in commercial dehydrogenation plants. However, major problems associated with these catalytic systems are cracking of long chain hydrocarbons and coke formation."

[3] "The deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing activity, selectivity and stability which increases the process complexity and operation costs."

[4] "Catalyst with smaller particles (3 nm) is much more active and less selective than that with larger particles (21 nm). Rate of coking, selectivity to coke formation and the amount of coke formed are significantly higher over the former than that on the latter."

[5] "These results clearly demonstrate the advantage of using TEOM/GC system for deriving comprehensive information (activity, selectivity and coking) from a single catalysis experiment."

[6] "In Pt-SBA-15-DP, C3H8 conversion decreases and selectivity to C3H6 increases sharply after a few minutes on stream (Fig. 2a and b) due to deactivation of highly active coordinatively unsaturated surface Pt sites, for instance at step and edge sites, by coke. This indicates that coke acts as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating those sites that are active for CC bond activation."

"The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes into their corresponding alkenes is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for alkenes. Propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

"Dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic reaction that requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. The high reaction temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."

"β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."

"The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."

"The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts measured by TGA and the specific surface areas of the catalysts after reaction are listed in Table 3. The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."

"Recently, carbon dioxide has been utilized as an oxidant in several partial oxidation reactions, such as reforming and oxidative coupling of methane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide has also been reported to give rather high propene selectivity"

[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic, respectively."

[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."

[4] "We find that carbon-rich surfaces show much higher selectivity for propylene production over competing cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces"

[5] "Tan et al. found that phosphate-stabilized Fe3C can achieve PDH selectivity to propylene as high as 80% and 20% conversion of propane."

[6] "Finally, we investigated the role of phosphate in suppressing coke formation and found that the electron-withdrawing character of phosphate destabilizes surface carbon."

[7] "The suppression of surface carbon by phosphate and analysis of charge transfer shows that phosphate weakens the FeC interaction to destabilize surface carbon atom and prevent coking."

"Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

"Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

"The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 1C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts."

"Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

"The strongly endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

"The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."

"Carbon deposition is also dependent on the particle size of Pt and PtSn alloy, as well as the Sn content. In general, carbon deposition under reaction conditions increases with increasing particle size, but higher Sn content suppresses carbon formation."

"To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

"Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

"The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

"In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

"In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

"Due to the thermodynamic constrains, methane activation was investigated at 800 C, while the tests with other alkanes were carried out at 550 C, where PDH was also performed."

"A key drawback of Pt-based catalysts is their cost and deactivation triggered by sintering of Pt species. To re-disperse platinum, the catalysts are treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds"

"Carbon deposits were the main side product with the selectivity of about 10%. Although they are not desired, such deposits indirectly contribute to minimizing overall costs in the course of CATOFIN process through using the heat released upon their combustion during catalyst regeneration phase for the endothermic PDH reaction"

"When performing PDH at higher temperatures, the catalyst was less durable but showed high productivity. Such change of catalyst durability is due to increasing the size of crystallites caused by temperature-induced sintering process"

"The yield of propene within one PDH cycle initially increased and then decreased with rising time on stream at 550 C but continuously decreased at higher temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 9). The increase is related to the formation of Zrcus sites, while the decrease is due to catalyst deactivation caused by formation of carbon deposits, which could be removed upon oxidative catalyst regeneration as proven by stable catalyst performance within first 20 cycles at 550 C (Fig. 4b)."

[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

[5] "The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents."

[6] "All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst."

[7] "When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped. The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature."

"Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

"PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

"Developing an economically viable and eco-friendly catalyst is essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. In this context, cobalt-based catalysts supported on different morphologies of γ-Al2O3, nano-sheet (Al2O3NS), nano-fiber (Al2O3NF) and nano-plate (Al2O3NP) were synthesized using wetness impregnation method and tested for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction."

"The presence of tetrahedral coordinated Co+2 in Co/Al2O3NS leads to higher selectivity towards propylene. The formation of metallic cobalt from Co3O4 precursor present in Co/Al2O3NP promoted side reactions to form lower hydrocarbons and carbon, which caused catalyst deactivation."

"There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

"For further development of cobalt based catalyst, lower cobalt loading should be preferred, and modification of support with TiO2, ZrO2 or SiO2 might help to suppress the strong Lewis acidic center and prevent coke deposition."

[1] "Dehydrogenation includes a vast class of reactions, concerning the partial hydrogen abstracted from organic compounds, such as alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols and amines, to form various compounds including olefins, cycloalkenes, aldehydes, ketones and imines."

[2] "Under suitable conditions, the supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts widely used in industry exhibit satisfactory dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[3] "The dehydrogenation of alkane to olefin and H2 is endothermic, and the conversion for a single pass is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium."

[4] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[5] "There are two undesirable aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction: one is high energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, and a large amount of unconverted propane must be recycled back to the reactor after separation, leading to large equipment investment and high energy consumption."

[6] "In the commercial processes OleflexTM, CatofinTM, STARTM, LindeTM, and FBD-4, either supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts have been applied."

[7] "Coking deactivation is classified into two distinct stages, quick deactivation and steady state."

[8] "The catalyst deactivates quickly due to coke deposition, because the strong interaction between Pt and alkenes leads to severe side reactions."

[9] "Increasing the partial pressure of H2 is the most common measure to inhibit coke formation. In Honeywell UOPs OleflexTM process, this measure is taken to control the coking rate and adjust the time between regenerations."

[10] "To recover the activity completely, the sintered Pt particles must be redispersed. Generally, simple coke burning-offby air cannot realize redispersion, but aggravates the sintering of Pt particles. For the commercial dehydrogenation units using supported Pt catalyst, the spent catalyst is regenerated by air in the presence of a halide (generally, chlorine), the role of which is to redisperse sintered Pt particles."

[11] "The addition of a second metal has been found to be highly effective for the sintering resistance of Pt particles. The introduced metal forms alloys with Pt around Pt particles, and the alloys anchor them on the surface of the carriers, making them not easy to migrate and coalesce."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions."

[3] "Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[4] "The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/ or electronic effect"

[5] "Zinc can give a remarkable improvement in dehydrogenation performance of catalysts. High propylene selectivity (97%) can be obtained over zinc-doped catalysts."

[6] "The presence of zinc modifies the metallic phase, mainly by geometric and electronic modifications of the metallic phase. These modifications could be responsible for the improvement of catalytic performance."

[7] "Coke was analyzed by TPO and O2-pulse experiments. O2-pulse experiment is a special technology used for quantitative coke analysis."

[8] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."

[9] "Firstly, Zn can decrease the size of surface Pt ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydrogenated species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles. Secondly, the Zn presence brings about an increase in the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, which will weaken the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and repulse coke precursors."

[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "We synthesize γ-alumina-supported platinum/copper SAA catalysts by incipient wetness co-impregnation method with a high copper to platinum ratio. Single platinum atoms dispersed on copper nanoparticles dramatically enhance the desorption of surface-bounded propylene and prohibit its further dehydrogenation, resulting in high propylene selectivity (90%)."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400 C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120 h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520 C."

[4] "Considering that coke deposition is another reason for catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation, the information on the coke formed on the surface of 0.1Pt/Al2O3, 0.1Pt10Cu/Al2O3, and 10Cu/Al2O3 were collected."

[5] "The good consistence between the dehydrogenation degree of the coke and the burning temperature of the soft coke on the metal implies that the deep dehydrogenation reactivity decreases in the order of Pt nanoparticles, Pt/Cu SAA, and Cu nanoparticles, which corroborates the trend of deep dehydrogenation barrier identified by the DFT calculations."

[6] "The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of propylene indicates that the interaction between the propylene and metal sites is weaker for Cu nanoparticles and Pt/Cu SAA than that for Pt nanoparticles. This weak interaction minimizes carbon deposits on the active Pt sites to help remain the activity during reaction."

[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a strongly endothermic reaction(ΔH298K=124kJmol1) restricted by thermodynamic equilibrium. According to Le Chatelier, a high propane conversion depends largely on a high temperature of 550700C."

[2] "Unfortunately, CC bond is more reactive than CH bond at high temperature, which will lead to unnecessary side reactions, and even result in coke deposition and sinter."

[3] "To date, many of the best catalytic performance of direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Cr6 and Pt. However, these catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and these catalysts have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term."

[4] "In previous studies, the promoter of Sn was known to increase the lifetime of Pt-based catalysts due to the reduced deactivation by coking."

[5] "Herein, we develop a novel approach for direct propane dehydrogenation reaction at low temperature under microwave catalytic reaction mode (MCRM)."

[6] "The propane conversion is extremely low (3.2%) at 450C in the conventional reaction mode. Interestingly, the propane conversion can achieve 15% under microwave catalytic reaction mode."

[7] "This work develops non-precious CoSn/NC catalyst as a novel microwave catalyst in propane direct dehydrogenation reaction for the first time, and thus opens a new route for high-value utilization of abundant C3H8 resources at low temperature."

"Propylene is commercially produced by steam cracking of naphtha and uidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, the imbalance between the continuously increasing propylene demand and the decreasing fossil oil reserves has become an obstacle to the development of the propylene markets, which stimulates the motivation to seek a more economical route for propylene production."

"Among the commercially operated processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most promising alternatives. The PDH process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons into value-added olefins, which makes this route more economically competitive."

"However, the dehydrogenation of propane is an endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, and a relatively high reaction temperature is required thermodynamically to obtain high yields of propylene. Such reaction conditions will result in undesired thermal cracking that generates lighter hydrocarbons as well as notoriously rapid coke deposition causing catalyst deactivation."

"Currently, chromium- and platinum-based catalysts are the prevailing commercial catalysts for PDH. Cr-based catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance and good anti-poisoning ability, but their application is limited by the toxicity of chromium. Pt-based catalysts show high catalytic activity and thermal stability, and the coke formation rate is much lower than that of Cr-based catalysts."

"Extensive investigations have been performed to improve the catalytic performance and stability of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The addition of promoters such as Sn, La, Ga and Zn species has been reported to be effective."

"The improved anti-coking ability of the PtCu/Al2O3 catalysts is due to the inhibition of propylene adsorption, which diminishes the possibility of coke formation and suppresses the cracking reactions towards lighter hydrocarbons on PtCu/Al2O3."

[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[3] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[5] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[6] "The selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

[7] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol1."

[8] "For all materials, a near to zero selectivity to cracking products will be achieved when the conversion approaches to zero. The selectivity-conversion dependences can be interpreted as follows. Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations. They include formation of carbon deposits over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples"

"Fundamentally, PDH is a process of catalytic conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen, as illustrated below (eqn (1)): C3H8 2 C3H6 + H2 (DHy298 = 124.3 kJ mol1)"

"The reaction is highly endothermic and a process that the number of gas molecules increases, which implies that increasing reaction temperatures and/or decreasing partial pressures contribute to higher conversions of propane"

"Indeed, temperatures of 550750 1C are typically required for PDH at 1 bar."

"To date, several representative processes for propane dehydrogenation have been emerging. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin processes have been commercialized and most widely applied"

"Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts have been commercialized, respectively."

"Coke preferentially covers the surface uncoordinated active sites, which might be the possible reason why the activity tends to decrease more rapidly on smaller nanoparticles."

"Both facilitating the propylene desorption and increasing the dehydrogenation barrier of propylene result in less coke."

"Increasing hydrogen pressure leads to a lower coverage of deeply dehydrogenated coke precursors on the surface"

"In addition to H2, cofeeding CO2 is an attractive method, where CO2 acts as a soft oxidant, and can reduce the amount of coke formed at elevated temperature on the catalysts via the reverse Boudouard reaction, thereby increasing conversion and maintaining the stability of the catalysts."

"Regenerating catalysts under oxidizing (or oxychlorination) conditions followed by H2 reduction is supposed to be an effective method to remove the coke and reactivate the catalysts."

[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature."

[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."

[5] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."

[6] "The coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability. The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."

[7] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site. Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."

[8] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[9] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation. For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization."

[10] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."

[1] "Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile and phenol."

[2] "With the growing production of shale gas, the low price of propane makes the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process more commercially attractive for on-purpose propylene production."

[3] "For the industrial PDH catalysts, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high price tag and highly toxic nature, respectively."

[4] "The supported vanadium catalysts can serve as an alternate because of its considerable activity, proper propylene selectivity and excellent regeneration performance."

[5] "Previous studies have shown that the main reason responsible for the deactivation of vanadium catalysts is coke deposition."

[6] "Clearly, the coke deposits more slowly on those catalysts covered with hydroxyl groups, and this is the reason why the catalysts with sufficient H2 pretreatment possess higher stability."

[7] "Although V2O3 (structure III) is active for dehydrogenation, it also can easily induce coke formation because of its strong binding towards propylene."

[8] "In contrast, the formation of acetone is much harder over structure II, thus leading to favorable production of propylene (see FigureS32). Moreover, the existence of surface OH groups blocks the exposed V ion and thus enhances C3H6 desorption and prevents coke formation, resulting in higher stability of the catalyst."

[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13 15]."

[2] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[3] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."

[2] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production."

[3] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O3 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst."

[5] "We postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed."

[6] "The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke. The coke could be completely removed within only 5min by an air stream at the PDH temperature."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (DrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[4] "To tackle these challenges, the active site isolation strategy has been proved to be effective. Isolating the active metal components into the single-atom site and the resulting single-atom catalysts (SACs) could inhibit the structure-sensitive side reactions."

[5] "This paper describes a selective and ultrastable single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling atomically ordered PtZn IMA with trace Pt loadings of 0.1 wt %, which enables more than 95% selectivity of propylene over a broad temperature range of 520C to 620C and the highest propylene productivity of 83.2 mol C3H6 gPt1 h1."

[6] "No obvious deactivation was observed within 160-h under industrial operating conditions, superior to PtSn/Al2O3 and state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts."

          "performing at 600 oC with 2.5% C3H8 and 2.5% H2 at a total flow of 100 mL/min."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes provides an alternative for producing light alkenes as well as hydrogen, a product required for many refinery operations, most notably heteroatom removal."

[2] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[3] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[4] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[5] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalysts was done by oxidizing the catalyst in a flow of 10% O2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 20 min and then reducing the catalyst in a flow of 20% H2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 30 min."

"Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production"

"Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions"

"Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation"

"For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH"

"Here, we report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures. Intermetallic PtGa displays three-hold-Pt ensembles and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface, the former of which can be selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition."

"The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propene (C3H8 → C3H6+H2) is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Hence, it requires high reaction temperature above 550°C to achieve propane conversion over 50% at atmospheric pressure"

[2] "Noble metals and metal oxides exhibit catalytic activity and selectivity for C–H bond activation for propane dehydrogenation. However, severe deactivation of catalysts occurs by coke deposition on the surface of active materials and sintering of active phases of catalysts under the high temperature conditions"

[3] "In spite of the fact that platinum- and chromium oxide-based catalysts show excellent catalytic performance and they are currently used in industrial processes, there have been attempts to develop new catalysts for propane dehydrogenation due to a high cost of the noble metal Pt and environmental toxicity of Cr6+ species"

[4] "Tungsten oxide is activated by hydrogen pretreatment and/or co-feeding of hydrogen. Its catalytic activity strongly depends on hydrogen pretreatment time and partial pressure of hydrogen in the feed gas."

[5] "The partially reduced WO3-x, obtained by 2.5 h H2 pretreatment, has more than three times higher initial activity than air-pretreated Cr2O3 and Ga2O3. The WO3-x sample also exhibits superior C3H6 selectivity of 96% than other metal oxides for the propane dehydrogenation at 600°C."

[6] "A rapid deactivation of metal oxide catalysts during propane dehydrogenation requires frequent regeneration of the catalysts. In the commercial Catofin process, CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is typically regenerated after 12 min of dehydrogenation at 575°C."

[1] "Commercial processes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and butanes attain per-pass conversions in the range of 3060%, while the catalytic dehydrogenation of C10C14 paraffins typically operates at conversion levels of 1020%."

[2] "Dehydrogenation employs chromia-alumina catalysts and, more recently, platinum or modified platinum catalysts. Important aspects in dehydrogenation entail approaching equilibrium or near-equilibrium conversions while minimizing side reactions and coke formation."

[3] "A significant amount of coke is deposited on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation step, therefore, a number of reactors are used in parallelsome for dehydrogenation while the rest are being purged or regenerated."

[4] "In the early 1970s, UOP introduced continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) technology that enabled noble metal catalysts to remain at their most desirable stable activity for several years without having to shut down the reactor for catalyst regeneration."

[5] "As of late 2000, there were four propane dehydrogenation units, five isobutane dehydrogenation units, and one combined propane/isobutane dehydrogenation unit of this type in commercial operation, with an aggregate operating capacity of 900,000 MTA polymer grade propylene and 2.3 million MTA isobutylene."

[6] "UOPs catalytic dehydrogenation processes typically make use of radial flow adiabatic fixed-bed (or slowly moving bed) reactors with modified Pt-alumina catalysts."

[7] "The key role of dehydrogenation catalysts is to accelerate the main reaction while controlling other reactions. Unmodified alumina-supported platinum catalysts are highly active but are not selective to dehydrogenation."

[8] "The role of platinum modifiers is to weaken the platinumolefin interaction selectively without affecting the platinumparaffin interaction. Arsenic, tin, germanium, lead, bismuth are among metals reported as platinum activity modifiers."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory."

[3] "The critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability."

[4] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties."

[5] "The multiple PtPt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.)."

[6] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases."

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years"

[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process. This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation"

[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."

[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."

[5] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."

[6] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."

[7] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."

[8] "Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and assigned to coke on the metal and the support, respectively. Coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic."

[9] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces. A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."

"From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

"However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."

"Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

"Temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

"Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."

"Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

"To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."
