          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory."

[3] "The critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability."

[4] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties."

[5] "The multiple PtPt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.)."

[6] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as an important alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 575°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble platinum (Pt) is widely used as the active component due to its superior activity. However, efforts are being made to improve its selectivity and reduce noble metal usage.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the petrochemical industry for on-purpose propylene production.

The main challenge in PDH is coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Coke formation is influenced by catalyst particle size and structure. Larger Pt particles and multiple Pt-Pt sites promote deep dehydrogenation, cracking, and secondary reactions that lead to coke formation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Atomic-level dispersion of Pt particles: This reduces multiple Pt-Pt sites, inhibiting undesired side reactions and coke formation.

2. Optimizing Pt particle size: Smaller particles, especially atomically dispersed Pt, show higher activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. Modifying catalyst support: Using appropriate supports can enhance catalyst stability and reduce coke formation.

4. Adding promoters: Elements like Sn can be added to improve selectivity and stability.

5. Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling temperature, pressure, and feed composition can help minimize coke formation.

By implementing these strategies, researchers aim to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH, improving the overall process efficiency and economics of propene production.

          催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产替代方法，满足了传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足的日益增长的需求。PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（如575°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：由于其优越的活性，贵金属铂（Pt）被广泛用作活性组分。然而，目前正在努力提高其选择性并减少贵金属的使用。

3. 工业应用：PDH在石油化工行业中越来越重要，用于定向生产丙烯。

PDH的主要挑战是Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成，这显著影响了过程效率，导致催化剂失活。积碳形成受催化剂粒径和结构的影响。较大的Pt颗粒和多个Pt-Pt位点促进深度脱氢、裂解和导致积碳形成的二次反应。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. Pt颗粒的原子级分散：这减少了多个Pt-Pt位点，抑制了不期望的副反应和积碳形成。

2. 优化Pt颗粒尺寸：较小的颗粒，特别是原子分散的Pt，表现出更高的活性、选择性和稳定性。

3. 改性催化剂载体：使用适当的载体可以增强催化剂稳定性并减少积碳形成。

4. 添加促进剂：可以添加如Sn等元素来提高选择性和稳定性。

5. 优化反应条件：控制温度、压力和进料组成可以帮助最小化积碳形成。

通过实施这些策略，研究人员旨在开发更高效、更稳定的PDH催化剂，提高丙烯生产的整体过程效率和经济性。
