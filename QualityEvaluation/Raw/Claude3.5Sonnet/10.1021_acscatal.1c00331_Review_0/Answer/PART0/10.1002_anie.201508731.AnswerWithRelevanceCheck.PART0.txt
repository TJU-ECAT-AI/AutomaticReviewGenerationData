          [1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."

[2] "Propene production via PDH in 2012 amounted to about 5million metric tons (mmt) from the total 80mmt production."

[3] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O3 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus, where cus=coordinatively unsaturated) are the active sites possessing PDH activity and selectivity comparable to those of an industrially relevant CrOx-containing catalyst."

[5] "We postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed."

[6] "The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke. The coke could be completely removed within only 5min by an air stream at the PDH temperature."

          The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts use CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges due to toxicity (Cr) or limited availability and high cost (Pt). Novel ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites have been introduced, showing comparable activity and selectivity to industrial CrOx catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry. In 2012, it accounted for about 5 million metric tons out of the total 80 million metric tons of propene production.

4. Reaction mechanism: For ZrO2-based catalysts, Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen activate the C-H bond, forming ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. Propene and hydrogen are then formed through β-hydrogen elimination.

Coke formation is a significant issue impacting process efficiency. The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study demonstrates a strategy of oxidative regeneration. The coke formed on the catalyst can be completely removed within only 5 minutes by passing an air stream at the PDH reaction temperature. This quick regeneration process allows for efficient cyclic operation of the catalyst, maintaining its activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的成熟大规模工艺。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（550-625°C）和非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂使用负载在Al2O3上的CrOx或PtSn物种。然而，这些催化剂面临毒性（Cr）或有限供应和高成本（Pt）的挑战。研究引入了新型ZrO2基催化剂，其中配位不饱和的Zr阳离子（Zrcus）作为活性位点，显示出与工业CrOx催化剂相当的活性和选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH在化学工业中变得越来越重要。2012年，在总计8000万公吨的丙烯产量中，PDH约占500万公吨。

4. 反应机理：对于ZrO2基催化剂，Zrcus和相邻的晶格氧活化C-H键，形成ZrcusC3H7和OH表面物种。然后通过β-氢消除形成丙烯和氢。

积碳形成是影响工艺效率的一个重要问题。主要副产品是轻烃和积碳。为了减少积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，该研究展示了一种氧化再生策略。在催化剂上形成的积碳可以通过在PDH反应温度下通入空气流，在仅5分钟内完全去除。这种快速再生过程允许催化剂进行高效的循环操作，在多个脱氢-再生循环中保持其活性。
