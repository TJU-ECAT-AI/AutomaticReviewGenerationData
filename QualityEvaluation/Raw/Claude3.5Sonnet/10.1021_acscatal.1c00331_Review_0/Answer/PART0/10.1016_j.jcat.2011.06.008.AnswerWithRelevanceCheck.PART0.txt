          [1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes provides an alternative for producing light alkenes as well as hydrogen, a product required for many refinery operations, most notably heteroatom removal."

[2] "Platinum is the most effective transition metal for promoting alkane dehydrogenation; however, in order to achieve high alkene selectivity, it must be promoted with an element, such as Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In, which interacts with the Pt to form a bimetallic alloy"

[3] "The activity and selectivity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation reactions are strongly dependent on the bulk In/Pt ratio. For both reactants, maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, and at this In/Pt ratio, the selectivity to alkene was nearly 100%."

[4] "Coke deposition was observed after catalyst use for either ethane or propane dehydrogenation, and it was observed that the alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the amount of coke deposited."

[5] "While the amount of coke deposited during ethane and propane dehydrogenation are comparable, the effects on activity are dependent on reactant composition. Coke deposition had no effect on ethane dehydrogenation activity, but caused a loss in propane dehydrogenation activity."

[6] "This difference is attributed to the greater ease with which coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles migrates to the support during ethane dehydrogenation versus propane dehydrogenation."

[7] "Regeneration of the catalysts was done by oxidizing the catalyst in a flow of 10% O2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 20 min and then reducing the catalyst in a flow of 20% H2 in He (100 cm3/min) for 30 min."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by using catalysts to selectively remove hydrogen from propane molecules. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically occurs at temperatures around 873-973 K, with a feed consisting of propane, hydrogen, and an inert gas.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts are most effective but require promotion with elements like Sn, Zn, Ge, Ga, or In to form bimetallic alloys. These alloys improve alkene selectivity and reduce coke formation. The support material is also crucial, with metal oxides free of acid sites being preferred to minimize carbon deposition.

3. Industrial applications: PDH provides an alternative to traditional methods for producing light alkenes and hydrogen, which are important for various refinery operations and chemical processes.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency, particularly for propane dehydrogenation:

1. It causes deactivation of the catalyst, leading to loss of activity over time.
2. The effect is more pronounced for propane than ethane dehydrogenation.
3. Coke tends to accumulate more on the catalyst surface for propane dehydrogenation, rather than migrating to the support as easily as in ethane dehydrogenation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Alloying Pt with elements like In, which greatly reduces the amount of coke deposited.
2. Optimizing the ratio of the alloying element to Pt (e.g., an In/Pt ratio of 0.48 showed optimal performance).
3. Using support materials that facilitate the migration of coke from catalyst particles to the support.
4. Implementing regeneration cycles involving oxidation to remove coke, followed by reduction to restore catalyst activity.

These strategies help maintain catalyst activity and selectivity, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

          催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种通过使用催化剂选择性地从丙烷分子中去除氢来生产丙烯的方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在873-973 K的温度下进行，原料由丙烷、氢气和惰性气体组成。

2. 催化剂类型：铂基催化剂最有效，但需要与Sn、Zn、Ge、Ga或In等元素结合形成双金属合金。这些合金可以提高烯烃选择性并减少焦炭形成。载体材料也很重要，首选无酸性位点的金属氧化物以最大程度地减少碳沉积。

3. 工业应用：PDH为生产轻质烯烃和氢气提供了一种替代方法，这对各种炼油操作和化学过程都很重要。

焦炭在基于Pt的催化剂上的形成显著影响过程效率，特别是对于丙烷脱氢：

1. 它会导致催化剂失活，使活性随时间降低。
2. 这种影响在丙烷脱氢中比乙烷脱氢更明显。
3. 在丙烷脱氢中，焦炭更倾向于在催化剂表面累积，而不像在乙烷脱氢中那样容易迁移到载体上。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与In等元素合金化，这可以大大减少沉积的焦炭量。
2. 优化合金元素与Pt的比例（例如，In/Pt比为0.48时表现最佳）。
3. 使用有利于焦炭从催化剂颗粒迁移到载体的载体材料。
4. 实施再生循环，包括氧化去除焦炭，然后还原以恢复催化剂活性。

这些策略有助于维持催化剂的活性和选择性，从而提高PDH过程的整体效率和可持续性。
