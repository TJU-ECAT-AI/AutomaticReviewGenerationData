{"Quotes": "\"From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:\"\n\n\"However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions.\"\n\n\"Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use.\"\n\n\"Temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar\"\n\n\"Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity.\"\n\n\"Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation\"\n\n\"To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures.\"", "English": "Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene and hydrogen in a single-step reaction. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications are:\n\n1. Reaction conditions:\n   - High temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures are required to achieve high conversions due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction.\n   - Modifications such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2 can help reduce coke formation.\n\n2. Catalyst types:\n   - Two main types are used: noble metal-based (primarily platinum) and metal oxide-based (particularly chromium oxide) catalysts.\n   - Each type has advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.\n\n3. Industrial applications:\n   - PDH has become increasingly important for on-purpose propylene production, especially with the availability of low-cost propane from shale gas.\n   - Several industrial processes have been developed, such as the Catofin and Oleflex processes.\n\nCoke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by:\n- Covering active sites and blocking pores, leading to decreased catalytic activity.\n- Necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration, which can lead to catalyst deactivation over time.\n\nStrategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:\n1. Using supports with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to reduce coke formation.\n2. Modifying reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.\n3. Adding promoters like tin to platinum catalysts to reduce coke formation and facilitate regeneration.\n4. Implementing periodic regeneration cycles under oxidative atmospheres to burn off coke deposits.\n5. Optimizing regeneration conditions to prevent irreversible catalyst deactivation.\n\nThese strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and improve overall process efficiency in industrial PDH operations.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"}
