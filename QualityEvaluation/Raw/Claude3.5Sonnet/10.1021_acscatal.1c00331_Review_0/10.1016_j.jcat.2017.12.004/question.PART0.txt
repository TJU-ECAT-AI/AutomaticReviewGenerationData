VOX-doped porous SiO2 solids (VOX-SiO2) were synthesized at different gelation and calcination temper-
atures through an in-situ one-step synthesis and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation
(PDH), exhibiting excellent catalytic performance. VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized by XRD, low-
temperature N2 adsorption/desorption, SEM, TEM, UVVis, Raman, XPS, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and TGA.
The structural and performance results for the catalysts reveal that gelation temperature has only a slight
effect on the surface acidity, textural properties and VOX species dispersion of VOX-SiO2 catalysts within a
reasonable temperature range (3060 C). The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, with a gelation temperature of
60 C, a calcination temperature of 580 C, and prepared by the one-step synthesis method, obviously
shortens gelation process time by half compared to catalyst gelled at 30 C and exhibits superior catalytic
performance for PDH. Over high gelation temperature (75 C) leads to the loss of integrity and decreases
catalytic activity of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts. Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst prepared by a one-
step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts exhibit better catalytic activity and stability. Importantly,
at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term cat-
alytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow
decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approxi-
mately 91%. The results of this work will be beneficial for further industrial development and application
of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.

1. Introduction
Lower olefins are essential petrochemical intermediates, espe-
cially propene, which is widely used as a feedstock in the produc-
tion of a variety of chemicals. Propene is mainly produced by steam
cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [14]. Besides these two
approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alter-
native with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its
derivatives [58]. DH processes can be classified into non-
oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of pro-
pane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages,
such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and
decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably gen-
erates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene [9,10]. Non-
oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in
commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are fre-
quently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvan-
tages
of
both
catalysts,
especially
the
pollution
problem
associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate
novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13
15].
V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to
Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably
priced and environmentally friendly. In previous studies, these cat-
alysts have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reac-
tions
[1722].
Moreover,
catalyst
performance
was
strongly
affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3,
were used [23,24]. To the authors knowledge, the use of Al2O3
and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts,
which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH [23,2528].
Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chem-
istry of mesoporous c-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where

the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability
[27]. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and cat-
alyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3
catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of
V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic prop-
erties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the
absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxida-
tive regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high sta-
bility of VOX species [23,25,26]. Rodemerck et al. also reported a
relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in
the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior cat-
alytic properties for PDH [28]. Hence, it can be concluded that V-
based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial
PDH process.
A mesoporous silica monolith has been reported and possesses
superior textural properties, but needs a lengthy gelation period at
room temperature (at least six weeks) [29,30]. Fortunately, Yang
et al. shortened the solvent evaporation process by using a
liquid-paraffin medium to seal the ethanol solution, meaning that
the prepared silica monolith can exactly copy the shape of the
reactor [31]. They also proposed a one-step method to synthesize
silica monoliths by doping various nanocrystals and found that
the prepared materials had potential catalytic applications, but
that vanadium species were not included [32].
Taking inspiration from the preparation and applications of
mesoporous
silica
monoliths,
the
authors
have
prepared
vanadium-doped porous silica solids (VOX-SiO2) by a one-step syn-
thesis in this study. The preparation method is environmentally-
friendly, without loss of the VOX precursor. The influence of gela-
tion and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic
performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts for PDH reaction was studied
in detail. The prepared VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized using
a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated by a non-
oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of porous VOX-SiO2 solids
Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were prepared by an in-situ one-step
synthesis [32]. Catalyst preparation was performed as follows.
NH4VO3
(0.14 g,
99.95%,
Aladdin)
was
dissolved
in
ethanol
(10.00 g, Shanghai Chemical Agent Co. Ltd (China)) under mechan-
ical stirring. Subsequently, anhydrous oxalic acid (0.14 g, 98%,
Aladdin) was added to promote dissolution of NH4VO3, and the
mixed solutions were stirred for 30 min at 40 C. When the mix-
ture was cooled to room temperature, 2.00 g of triblock copoly-
mers P123 (EO20PO70EO20, average Mn = 5800, Aladdin) was
added and stirred until well mixed; 4.32 g of TEOS (tetraethoxysi-
lane, 99.99%, Aladdin) and 0.40 g of aqueous HCl solution (0.8 M,
Shanghai Chemical Agent Co. Ltd (China)) were slowly dripped into
the mixture and stirred to dissolve them completely. Then the pel-
lucid solution was poured into a porcelain crucible and heated
under different temperatures (30 C, 45 C, 60 C, 75 C, and 90
C) to form a silica gel. The prepared gel was sealed by a liquid-
paraffin medium (Aladdin) and heated at 60 C for 18 h to remove
most of the ethanol and to form a rigid silica solid. Afterwards, the
liquid-paraffin was captured on filter paper and collected for reuse.
Finally, the obtained materials were calcined at 580 C for 6 h
under air atmosphere to remove P123 from the silica solids. The
resulting catalysts of porous VOX-SiO2 solids (VOX-SiO2) with dif-
ferent
gelation
temperatures
(recorded
as
GT-VOX-SiO2-580)
denoted as 30-VOX-SiO2-580, 45-VOX-SiO2-580, 60-VOX-SiO2-580,
75-VOX-SiO2-580, and 90-VOX-SiO2-580, respectively, where the
content of doping V is 5 wt%. Before the catalytic test, the catalysts
were crushed and then tested in powder form due to the limits of
the actual PDH reactor (8 mm inner diameter). As gelation temper-
ature increased, the gelation process time gradually became
shorter, as shown in Fig. 1. By the same preparation process, pure
silica solid (SiO2) was synthesized at a gelation temperature of 30
C and a calcination temperature of 580 C. In addition, the cata-
lysts with a gelation temperature of 60 C were calcined at temper-
atures (recorded as 60-VOX-SiO2-CT) of 550 C, 580 C, 620 C, and
650 C. These catalysts were denoted as 60-VOX-SiO2-550, 60-VOX-
SiO2-580, 60-VOX-SiO2-620, and 60-VOX-SiO2-650, respectively.
For comparison, VOX-MCM-41 was also synthesized by a one-
step hydrothermal method. A certain amount of NH4VO3 was dis-
solved in deionized water (10.0 g) under mechanical stirring to dis-
solve it completely. CTAB (1.7 g) and NaOH (0.27 g) were dissolved
in deionized water (100.0 g) as a template solution. The NH4VO3
solution was added to the template solution under mechanical stir-
ring for 30 min. Then TEOS (10.5 g) was added dropwise to the
mixed solution under stirring at 60 C for 4 h. The synthesized
gel was cooled overnight. Afterwards, it was transferred into a
Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 120 C for 48 h. The obtained
materials were washed five times with deionized water (750 ml)
and dried at 60 C for 12 h. Finally, it was calcined at 550 C for
4 h to form a V-MCM-41 sample, where the content of V is 5 wt%
according to the ICP result.
2.2. Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was collected on a Bragg-
Brentano diffractometer (monochromatic Cu Ka radiation, k =
1.5418 Å). The catalysts were scanned from 10 to 70 (2h value)
using a scan speed of 5/min at 40 kV and 30 mA. The vanadium
and silicon contents of the catalysts were obtained with induc-
tively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)
with Varian Vista MPX. Low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorp-
tion isotherms were measured using a NOVA4000 analyzer (Quan-
tachrome, USA) at 77 K. Before analysis, the catalysts were
degassed under vacuum at 300 C for 4 h. The multipoint BET
method was utilized to calculate the surface areas. The pore vol-
umes of the catalysts were obtained at the maximum relative pres-
sure (P/P0). The pore size distributions of the catalysts were
derived from the desorption branch of the isotherms using the
BJH model. For micropore analysis, the pore volume and pore

diameter of catalysts were measured by DFT method and V-t
method (t-plot Method Micropore Analysis). Morphological prop-
erties of the catalysts were determined using an S-4800 field emis-
sion scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) at 5.0 kV. XPS spectra
were performed on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using an Al
Ka source. The binding energy (BE) was detected with the C1s level
at 284.9 eV as a reference. Raman spectra were collected using a
Jobin Yvon confocal laser Raman spectrometer (SuperLabRam II)
with a 632.8 nm HeNe ion laser beam. Before measurements,
the catalysts were dried at 100 C for 5 h. The spectra were
acquired within 20 s by three accumulations. H2-TPR experiments
were carried using an autosorb-iQ Instruments with a thermal con-
duction detector (TCD) (Quantachrome, USA). The powered cata-
lysts (60 mg) were added to a U-shape quartz tube reactor and
supported with quartz wool. Prior to measurements, the catalysts
were treated with an Ar flow (15 ml/min) at 500 C for 1 h. Then
the catalysts were reduced under a mixture gas of 10% H2 and
90% (v/v) Ar from room temperature to 800 C (10 C/min). NH3-
TPD investigations were carried out on a TP-5080 adsorption
instrument to evaluate surface acidity. Before NH3-TPD analysis,
catalysts (0.1 g) were pretreated for 1 h at 400 C with a 30 ml/
min of He flow. When cooling to 120 C, high purified NH3 (20
ml/min, 99.9999%) was adsorbed and saturated over all the acid
sites for 30 min. Afterwards, the catalysts were blown for another
45 min to remove the physical absorption of NH3. During desorp-
tion, the analysis was performed from 120 to 600 C (10 C/min).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the spent catalysts was per-
formed with a DTG-60H analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan) in an air atmo-
sphere to evaluate coke deposition. The measurement was carried
out from 50 C to 800 C (10 C/min) in a ceramic crucible as a
