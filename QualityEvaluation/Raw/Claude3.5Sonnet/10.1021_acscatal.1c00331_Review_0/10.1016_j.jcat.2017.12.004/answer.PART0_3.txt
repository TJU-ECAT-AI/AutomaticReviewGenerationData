[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[2] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[3] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH."

[4] "By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[5] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 580°C) to achieve good conversion rates.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, V-based catalysts are emerging as potential alternatives due to their lower cost and environmental friendliness.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been implemented commercially, with ongoing research to improve catalyst performance and process efficiency.

4. Coke formation: This is a significant issue affecting catalyst performance, especially for Pt-based catalysts. The literature doesn't provide specific details on coke formation for Pt catalysts.

5. Mitigation strategies: 
   - Using alternative catalysts: V-based catalysts, particularly VOX/MCM-41, have shown good stability and can be fully regenerated through oxidative treatment.
   - Periodic regeneration: The study mentions "reaction-regeneration cycles," indicating that periodic regeneration is used to maintain catalyst activity.
   - Catalyst design: The VOX-SiO2 catalyst prepared at specific gelation and calcination temperatures (60-VOX-SiO2-580) showed remarkable long-term stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

While the document doesn't provide extensive information on Pt-based catalysts and coke formation, it suggests that alternative catalysts like V-based ones may offer advantages in terms of stability and regeneration capability.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（如580°C）下进行，以获得良好的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用Pt和Cr基催化剂。然而，由于成本较低和环境友好性，V基催化剂正成为潜在的替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH已经实现了商业化应用，目前仍在进行研究以改善催化剂性能和提高工艺效率。

4. 积碳形成：这是影响催化剂性能的一个重要问题，特别是对于Pt基催化剂。文献中没有提供Pt催化剂积碳形成的具体细节。

5. 缓解策略：
   - 使用替代催化剂：V基催化剂，特别是VOX/MCM-41，表现出良好的稳定性，可以通过氧化处理完全再生。
   - 定期再生：研究提到了"反应-再生循环"，表明定期再生被用来维持催化剂活性。
   - 催化剂设计：在特定凝胶化和焙烧温度下制备的VOX-SiO2催化剂（60-VOX-SiO2-580）在多个反应-再生循环中表现出显著的长期稳定性。

虽然文档没有提供关于Pt基催化剂和积碳形成的大量信息，但它表明像V基催化剂这样的替代品在稳定性和再生能力方面可能具有优势。
