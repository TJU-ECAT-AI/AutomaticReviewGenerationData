[1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives [58]. DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)."

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [1315]."

[3] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[4] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an attractive method for propene production due to the growing demand for propene and its derivatives. It functions as a non-oxidative dehydrogenation process, which has been commercially realized.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures without the presence of oxygen.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, due to their high cost, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns (especially for Cr), research is shifting towards novel catalysts like V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been implemented in commercial settings, particularly using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, is a significant issue affecting process efficiency. It leads to catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration. To mitigate this problem and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Alternative catalysts: V-based catalysts have shown promise as they are more reasonably priced and environmentally friendly.

2. Catalyst supports: Different supports like MCM-41, SiO2-Al2O3, and Al2O3 have been studied to improve catalyst stability and regeneration.

3. Regeneration methods: Oxidative regeneration has been found effective, particularly for VOX/MCM-41 catalysts, which showed stable catalytic properties and full recovery after regeneration.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst life, reduce downtime for regeneration, and improve overall process efficiency in PDH operations.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有吸引力的丙烯生产方法，这是由于丙烯及其衍生物的需求不断增长。它作为一种非氧化脱氢过程，已经在商业上实现。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行，且无氧存在。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用Pt和Cr基催化剂。然而，由于它们的高成本、失活问题和环境问题（尤其是Cr），研究正在转向新型催化剂，如V-、Ga-和Sn基催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH已在商业环境中实施，特别是使用Pt和Cr基催化剂。

催化剂上的积碳形成，包括Pt基催化剂，是影响过程效率的一个重大问题。它导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。为了缓解这个问题并改善催化剂再生：

1. 替代催化剂：V基催化剂表现出潜力，因为它们价格更合理且环境友好。

2. 催化剂载体：研究了不同的载体，如MCM-41、SiO2-Al2O3和Al2O3，以提高催化剂的稳定性和再生能力。

3. 再生方法：氧化再生被发现是有效的，特别是对于VOX/MCM-41催化剂，它们表现出稳定的催化性能，并在再生后可以完全恢复。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少再生停机时间，并提高PDH操作的整体过程效率。
