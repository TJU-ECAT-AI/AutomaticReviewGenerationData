[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13 15]."

[2] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[3] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 580°C) to achieve good conversion rates.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, due to their high cost, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns (especially for Cr), researchers are exploring alternatives such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been successfully implemented in commercial settings, with ongoing research to improve catalyst performance and process efficiency.

V-based catalysts are emerging as promising alternatives for PDH due to their reasonable price and environmental friendliness. They have shown good stability and can be fully regenerated through oxidative treatment.

Coke formation is a significant challenge in PDH, particularly for Pt-based catalysts. It leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced process efficiency. To mitigate this issue and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies include:

1. Developing alternative catalyst formulations, such as V-based catalysts, which have shown better stability and regeneration capabilities.

2. Implementing periodic regeneration cycles to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation while maintaining high propene selectivity.

4. Exploring catalyst supports and preparation methods that enhance stability and resistance to coking.

By addressing these factors, researchers aim to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process for propene production.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种商业化的丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（如580°C）下进行，以获得良好的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用Pt和Cr基催化剂。然而，由于它们的高成本、失活问题和环境问题（特别是Cr），研究人员正在探索V、Ga和Sn基催化剂等替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH已成功应用于商业环境，并持续进行研究以提高催化剂性能和工艺效率。

V基催化剂因其合理的价格和环境友好性而成为PDH的有前景的替代品。它们表现出良好的稳定性，可以通过氧化处理完全再生。

结焦是PDH面临的一个重大挑战，特别是对于Pt基催化剂。它导致催化剂失活和工艺效率降低。为了缓解这个问题并改善催化剂再生，采取的策略包括：

1. 开发替代催化剂配方，如V基催化剂，它们表现出更好的稳定性和再生能力。

2. 实施周期性再生循环，以去除焦炭沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

3. 优化反应条件，以最小化结焦形成，同时保持高丙烯选择性。

4. 探索能够提高稳定性和抗结焦能力的催化剂载体和制备方法。

通过解决这些因素，研究人员旨在提高PDH工艺在丙烯生产中的整体效率和可持续性。
