[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13 15]."

[2] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[3] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 580°C) to achieve sufficient propane conversion.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, due to their high cost, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns (particularly for Cr-based catalysts), researchers are exploring alternatives such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been implemented commercially, with ongoing research to improve catalyst performance and process efficiency.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue impacting process efficiency. It leads to catalyst deactivation, reducing propane conversion over time. To mitigate this problem and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies include:

1. Developing alternative catalysts: V-based catalysts, for example, have shown promising stability and regeneration capabilities.

2. Oxidative regeneration: This technique has been effective in fully recovering catalyst activity, especially for VOX-based catalysts.

3. Optimizing catalyst structure: The study demonstrates that carefully designed catalysts like VOX-SiO2 can maintain high propene selectivity (around 91%) even as conversion decreases, indicating improved resistance to coking.

4. Implementing reaction-regeneration cycles: The VOX-SiO2 catalyst showed remarkable long-term stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, suggesting that periodic regeneration can effectively manage coke formation and maintain catalyst performance.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been commercially implemented. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene using catalysts.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The literature mentions a reaction temperature of 580°C for one catalyst.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, due to cost, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns, research is shifting towards alternatives like V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts. V-based catalysts are particularly promising due to their reasonable price and environmental friendliness.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been realized in commercial applications, indicating its viability for industrial-scale propene production.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, is a significant issue in PDH. It leads to catalyst deactivation, reducing process efficiency. To mitigate this problem and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies include:

1. Using alternative catalysts: V-based catalysts, particularly VOX/MCM-41, have shown stable catalytic properties and can be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration.

2. Optimizing catalyst composition and structure: The study describes a VOX-SiO2 catalyst (60-VOX-SiO2-580) that exhibits remarkable long-term stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

3. Implementing regeneration cycles: The literature mentions eight reaction-regeneration cycles for the VOX-SiO2 catalyst, indicating that periodic regeneration can help maintain catalyst activity.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high propene selectivity, and ensure stable propane conversion rates over extended periods of operation.
