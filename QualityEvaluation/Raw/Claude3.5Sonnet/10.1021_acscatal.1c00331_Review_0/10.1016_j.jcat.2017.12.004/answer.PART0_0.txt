[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11,12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13 15]."

[2] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[3] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[4] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a commercial process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 580°C) to achieve sufficient propane conversion.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, due to their high cost, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns (particularly for Cr-based catalysts), researchers are exploring alternatives such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been implemented commercially, with ongoing research to improve catalyst performance and process efficiency.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue impacting process efficiency. It leads to catalyst deactivation, reducing propane conversion over time. To mitigate this problem and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies include:

1. Developing alternative catalysts: V-based catalysts, for example, have shown promising stability and regeneration capabilities.

2. Oxidative regeneration: This technique has been effective in fully recovering catalyst activity, especially for VOX-based catalysts.

3. Optimizing catalyst structure: The study demonstrates that carefully designed catalysts like VOX-SiO2 can maintain high propene selectivity (around 91%) even as conversion decreases, indicating improved resistance to coking.

4. Implementing reaction-regeneration cycles: The VOX-SiO2 catalyst showed remarkable long-term stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles, suggesting that periodic regeneration can effectively manage coke formation and maintain catalyst performance.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种商业化工艺。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（如580°C）下运行，以实现足够的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用Pt和Cr基催化剂。但由于其高成本、失活问题和环境问题（特别是Cr基催化剂），研究人员正在探索V、Ga和Sn基催化剂等替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH已实现商业化应用，目前仍在进行研究以改进催化剂性能和提高工艺效率。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成是影响工艺效率的一个重要问题。它导致催化剂失活，使丙烷转化率随时间降低。为缓解这个问题并改善催化剂再生，采取的策略包括：

1. 开发替代催化剂：例如，V基催化剂已显示出良好的稳定性和再生能力。

2. 氧化再生：这种技术在完全恢复催化剂活性方面非常有效，尤其是对VOX基催化剂。

3. 优化催化剂结构：研究表明，精心设计的催化剂（如VOX-SiO2）即使在转化率下降的情况下也能保持高丙烯选择性（约91%），表明其对积碳的抗性有所提高。

4. 实施反应-再生循环：VOX-SiO2催化剂在多个反应-再生循环中表现出卓越的长期稳定性，表明周期性再生可以有效管理积碳形成并保持催化剂性能。
