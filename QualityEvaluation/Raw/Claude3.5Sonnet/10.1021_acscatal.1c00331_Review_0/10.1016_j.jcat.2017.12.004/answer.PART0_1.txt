[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[2] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[3] "V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH, are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly."

[4] "Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration."

[5] "Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that has been commercially implemented. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene using catalysts.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The literature mentions a reaction temperature of 580°C for one catalyst.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have been used. However, due to cost, deactivation issues, and environmental concerns, research is shifting towards alternatives like V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts. V-based catalysts are particularly promising due to their reasonable price and environmental friendliness.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been realized in commercial applications, indicating its viability for industrial-scale propene production.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, is a significant issue in PDH. It leads to catalyst deactivation, reducing process efficiency. To mitigate this problem and improve catalyst regeneration, strategies include:

1. Using alternative catalysts: V-based catalysts, particularly VOX/MCM-41, have shown stable catalytic properties and can be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration.

2. Optimizing catalyst composition and structure: The study describes a VOX-SiO2 catalyst (60-VOX-SiO2-580) that exhibits remarkable long-term stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

3. Implementing regeneration cycles: The literature mentions eight reaction-regeneration cycles for the VOX-SiO2 catalyst, indicating that periodic regeneration can help maintain catalyst activity.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high propene selectivity, and ensure stable propane conversion rates over extended periods of operation.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种已经商业化实施的丙烯生产方法。该过程涉及使用催化剂从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：文献提到一种催化剂的反应温度为580°C。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上使用Pt和Cr基催化剂。然而，由于成本、失活问题和环境问题，研究正转向V-、Ga-和Sn基催化剂等替代品。V基催化剂由于价格合理且环保，特别有前景。

3. 工业应用：PDH已在商业应用中实现，表明其适用于工业规模的丙烯生产。

催化剂上的积碳形成，包括Pt基催化剂，是PDH中的一个重要问题。它导致催化剂失活，降低了过程效率。为了缓解这个问题并改善催化剂再生，采取的策略包括：

1. 使用替代催化剂：V基催化剂，特别是VOX/MCM-41，已显示出稳定的催化性能，并可通过氧化再生完全恢复。

2. 优化催化剂组成和结构：研究描述了一种VOX-SiO2催化剂（60-VOX-SiO2-580），在多个反应-再生循环中表现出卓越的长期稳定性。

3. 实施再生循环：文献提到VOX-SiO2催化剂的八个反应-再生循环，表明定期再生可以帮助维持催化剂活性。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，维持高丙烯选择性，并确保在长期运行中保持稳定的丙烷转化率。
