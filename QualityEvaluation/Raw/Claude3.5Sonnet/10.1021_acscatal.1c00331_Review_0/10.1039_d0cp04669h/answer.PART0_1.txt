[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."

[4] "Tan et al. found that phosphate-stabilized Fe3C can achieve PDH selectivity to propylene as high as 80% and 20% conversion of propane."

[5] "The stability of the surface itself is not causally related to the selectivity, but the carbon-rich surfaces tend to be more stable under carbon-rich conditions and they exhibit higher selectivity."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production, driven by increasing demand for propylene and decreasing production from traditional steam cracking processes. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH typically operates under carbon-rich conditions at high temperatures.

2. Catalyst types: Commercially used catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, but these have drawbacks of being expensive or toxic. Recent research has focused on developing earth-abundant and environmentally-friendly alternatives, such as iron-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming more important as an alternative route to meet market demand for propylene.

4. Catalyst performance: High selectivity and conversion are crucial. For example, phosphate-stabilized Fe3C has shown propylene selectivity up to 80% with 20% propane conversion.

5. Reaction mechanism: The stability of carbon-rich surfaces under reaction conditions and their impact on selectivity is an important consideration.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue impacting process efficiency. While the document doesn't specifically discuss coke formation on Pt catalysts, it does mention strategies to mitigate coking on iron-based catalysts:

1. Use of phosphate: Phosphate has been shown to prevent the accumulation of surface carbon and suppress coking on iron surfaces.

2. Formation of carbide phases: In-situ formation of carbide phases (e.g., Fe3C) can lead to improved activity and selectivity, potentially reducing coke formation.

3. Surface chemistry: Understanding the role of carbon-rich surfaces and their stability under reaction conditions can help in designing catalysts resistant to coking.

These strategies could potentially be adapted or provide insights for improving Pt-based catalysts as well. However, specific methods for catalyst regeneration are not discussed in the given literature.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，由于丙烯需求的增加和传统蒸汽裂解工艺产量的减少而变得更加重要。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH通常在高温和富碳条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：商业使用的催化剂基于Pt或Cr，但这些催化剂存在昂贵或有毒的缺点。近期研究致力于开发丰富且环境友好的替代品，如铁基催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH正成为满足丙烯市场需求的重要替代路线。

4. 催化剂性能：高选择性和转化率至关重要。例如，磷酸盐稳定的Fe3C已显示出高达80%的丙烯选择性和20%的丙烷转化率。

5. 反应机理：反应条件下富碳表面的稳定性及其对选择性的影响是一个重要考虑因素。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成是影响过程效率的一个重要问题。虽然文献没有具体讨论铂催化剂上的焦炭形成，但它确实提到了减少铁基催化剂焦炭形成的策略：

1. 使用磷酸盐：磷酸盐已被证明可以防止表面碳的积累并抑制铁表面的焦炭形成。

2. 碳化物相的形成：原位形成的碳化物相（如Fe3C）可以提高活性和选择性，可能减少焦炭形成。

3. 表面化学：理解富碳表面的作用及其在反应条件下的稳定性可以帮助设计抗焦炭的催化剂。

这些策略可能适用于或为改进铂基催化剂提供见解。然而，给定的文献中没有讨论具体的催化剂再生方法。
