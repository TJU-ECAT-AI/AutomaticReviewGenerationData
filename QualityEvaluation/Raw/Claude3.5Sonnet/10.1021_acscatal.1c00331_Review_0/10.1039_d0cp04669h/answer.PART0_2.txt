[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic, respectively."

[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."

[4] "On Fe3C surfaces, Tan et al. found 80% selectivity and 20% conversion, which qualitatively agrees with the activity and selectivity trends predicted by our calculations."

[5] "Tan et al. observe the formation of Fe3C from pure Fe, where phosphate was added in the preparation of the catalysts."

[6] "Thus, the phosphates role is primarily to suppress coke formation as the Fe catalyst is transformed into the selective Fe3C phase."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to increasing demand for propylene and decreasing production from traditional steam cracking. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst types: Commercially, Pt and Cr-based catalysts are used, but they have drawbacks of being expensive or toxic. Recent research has focused on earth-abundant and environmentally-friendly alternatives like iron-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming more important as an alternative route to meet market demand for propylene.

4. Coke formation: This is a significant issue for Pt-based catalysts, impacting process efficiency and requiring frequent catalyst regeneration.

5. Mitigation strategies: For iron-based catalysts, the addition of phosphate has been shown to suppress coke formation. The phosphate helps transform pure Fe into the selective Fe3C phase, which exhibits good activity and high selectivity for PDH.

6. Catalyst performance: Iron carbide (Fe3C) catalysts have shown promising results, with reported selectivity of 80% and conversion of 20% in experimental studies.

The development of more efficient and cost-effective catalysts, along with strategies to mitigate coke formation, are key areas of ongoing research to improve the PDH process for industrial applications.

丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为丙烯需求不断增加，而传统蒸汽裂解的丙烯产量则在下降。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行，以克服热力学限制。

2. 催化剂类型：商业上使用Pt和Cr基催化剂，但它们存在昂贵或有毒的缺点。最近的研究集中在铁基等丰富且环保的替代品上。

3. 工业应用：PDH正成为满足丙烯市场需求的重要替代路线。

4. 积碳形成：这是Pt基催化剂的一个重大问题，影响工艺效率并需要频繁的催化剂再生。

5. 缓解策略：对于铁基催化剂，添加磷酸盐已被证明可以抑制积碳形成。磷酸盐有助于将纯Fe转化为选择性Fe3C相，该相对PDH表现出良好的活性和高选择性。

6. 催化剂性能：碳化铁(Fe3C)催化剂显示出有前景的结果，实验研究报告的选择性为80%，转化率为20%。

开发更高效和更具成本效益的催化剂，以及缓解积碳形成的策略，是持续研究的关键领域，以改进PDH工艺的工业应用。
