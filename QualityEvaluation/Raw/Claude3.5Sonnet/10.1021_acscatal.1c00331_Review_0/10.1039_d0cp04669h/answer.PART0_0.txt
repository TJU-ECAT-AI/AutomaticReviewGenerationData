Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to increasing demand for propylene and decreasing production from traditional steam cracking. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures and low pressures to favor propylene formation.

2. Catalyst types: Commercially used catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, but these have drawbacks of being expensive or toxic. Recent research has shown promise in using earth-abundant and environmentally-friendly metals like iron, which form carbide phases in situ.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming more significant as an alternative route to meet market demand for propylene, especially with the shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks.

4. Selectivity: Carbon-rich surfaces of catalysts show higher selectivity for propylene production compared to iron-rich surfaces, by suppressing competing cracking reactions.

5. Coke formation: This is a major issue affecting process efficiency, especially for Pt-based catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

   a) Using phosphate additives, which can suppress coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon through their electron-withdrawing character.
   b) Developing catalysts with carbon-rich surfaces, which show higher resistance to coking.
   c) Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.
   d) Implementing periodic catalyst regeneration cycles to remove coke deposits.

These considerations aim to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process for industrial propylene production.

催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为丙烯需求不断增加，而传统蒸汽裂解的丙烯产量在减少。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温低压下进行，以有利于丙烯的形成。

2. 催化剂类型：商业使用的催化剂基于Pt或Cr，但这些催化剂有昂贵或有毒的缺点。最近的研究表明，使用地球上丰富且环境友好的金属（如铁）很有前景，这些金属在原位形成碳化物相。

3. 工业应用：随着向轻质烃原料的转变，PDH作为满足丙烯市场需求的替代路线变得越来越重要。

4. 选择性：催化剂的富碳表面与富铁表面相比，对丙烯生产表现出更高的选择性，通过抑制竞争性裂解反应。

5. 焦炭形成：这是影响工艺效率的一个主要问题，尤其是对于基于Pt的催化剂。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

   a) 使用磷酸盐添加剂，通过其吸电子特性destabilizing表面碳来抑制焦炭形成。
   b) 开发具有富碳表面的催化剂，这些催化剂表现出更高的抗焦性。
   c) 优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成。
   d) 实施定期催化剂再生循环，以去除焦炭沉积物。

这些考虑因素旨在提高PDH工艺在工业丙烯生产中的整体效率和可持续性。
