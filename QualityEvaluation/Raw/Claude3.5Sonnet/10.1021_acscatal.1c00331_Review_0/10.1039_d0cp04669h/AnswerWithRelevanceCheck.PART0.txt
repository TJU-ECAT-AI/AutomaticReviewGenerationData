          [1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic, respectively."

[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."

[4] "We find that carbon-rich surfaces show much higher selectivity for propylene production over competing cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces"

[5] "Tan et al. found that phosphate-stabilized Fe3C can achieve PDH selectivity to propylene as high as 80% and 20% conversion of propane."

[6] "Finally, we investigated the role of phosphate in suppressing coke formation and found that the electron-withdrawing character of phosphate destabilizes surface carbon."

[7] "The suppression of surface carbon by phosphate and analysis of charge transfer shows that phosphate weakens the FeC interaction to destabilize surface carbon atom and prevent coking."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production due to increasing demand and decreasing production from traditional steam cracking. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures to overcome thermodynamic limitations and low pressures to favor dehydrogenation.

2. Catalyst types: Commercially used catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic. Recent research has focused on developing earth-abundant and environmentally-friendly alternatives, such as iron-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming more significant as an alternative route to meet market demand for propylene, especially with the shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks.

4. Catalyst performance: High selectivity and conversion are crucial. For example, phosphate-stabilized Fe3C has shown propylene selectivity up to 80% with 20% propane conversion.

5. Reaction mechanism: Carbon-rich surfaces on catalysts show higher selectivity for propylene production compared to iron-rich surfaces, by suppressing competing cracking reactions.

6. Coke formation: This is a major issue affecting process efficiency, especially for Pt-based catalysts. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

   a) Using phosphate additives, which can suppress coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon through their electron-withdrawing character.
   b) Developing catalysts with carbon-rich surfaces, which show higher resistance to coking.
   c) Formation of in-situ carbide phases (e.g., Fe3C) that exhibit good activity and high selectivity.
   d) Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.
   e) Implementing periodic catalyst regeneration cycles to remove coke deposits.

These considerations aim to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process for industrial propylene production.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为丙烯需求不断增加，而传统蒸汽裂解的丙烯产量在减少。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行以克服热力学限制，并在低压下进行以有利于脱氢反应。

2. 催化剂类型：商业使用的催化剂基于Pt或Cr，但这些催化剂有昂贵或有毒的缺点。最近的研究致力于开发丰富且环境友好的替代品，如铁基催化剂。

3. 工业应用：随着向轻质烃原料的转变，PDH作为满足丙烯市场需求的替代路线变得越来越重要。

4. 催化剂性能：高选择性和转化率至关重要。例如，磷酸盐稳定的Fe3C已显示出高达80%的丙烯选择性和20%的丙烷转化率。

5. 反应机理：催化剂的富碳表面与富铁表面相比，对丙烯生产表现出更高的选择性，通过抑制竞争性裂解反应。

6. 焦炭形成：这是影响工艺效率的一个主要问题，尤其是对于基于Pt的催化剂。缓解焦炭形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

   a) 使用磷酸盐添加剂，通过其吸电子特性使表面碳不稳定来抑制焦炭形成。
   b) 开发具有富碳表面的催化剂，这些催化剂表现出更高的抗焦性。
   c) 形成原位碳化物相（如Fe3C），表现出良好的活性和高选择性。
   d) 优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成。
   e) 实施定期催化剂再生循环，以去除焦炭沉积物。

这些考虑因素旨在提高PDH工艺在工业丙烯生产中的整体效率和可持续性。
