[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production, driven by increasing demand for propylene and decreasing production from traditional steam cracking. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH typically occurs at high temperatures under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Commercial catalysts are based on platinum or chromium, but these have drawbacks of being expensive or toxic. Recent research has focused on more earth-abundant and environmentally friendly alternatives like iron-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming more important as an alternative route to meet market demand for propylene.

4. Catalyst performance: High selectivity towards propylene and good conversion of propane are crucial. For example, phosphate-stabilized Fe3C has shown up to 80% selectivity and 20% conversion.

5. Coke formation: This is a significant issue for PDH catalysts, including Pt-based ones. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include:

   - Using carbon-rich surfaces, which show higher selectivity for propylene production over competing cracking reactions.
   - Adding phosphate to the catalyst, which can weaken Fe-C interactions and destabilize surface carbon atoms, thereby preventing coking.
   - Developing catalysts with specific surface structures that limit deep dehydrogenation and unselective cracking.

6. Catalyst regeneration: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, efficient catalyst regeneration processes are crucial for maintaining long-term catalyst performance in industrial applications.

The development of iron-based catalysts, particularly iron carbides, shows promise in addressing many of these considerations, offering high selectivity, good activity, and improved resistance to coking compared to traditional catalysts.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，由于丙烯需求的增加和传统蒸汽裂解生产的减少而变得越来越重要。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH通常在高温非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：商业催化剂基于铂或铬，但这些催化剂昂贵或有毒。最近的研究集中在更丰富和环境友好的替代品上，如铁基催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH正成为满足丙烯市场需求的重要替代路线。

4. 催化剂性能：对丙烯的高选择性和良好的丙烷转化率至关重要。例如，磷酸盐稳定的Fe3C已显示出高达80%的选择性和20%的转化率。

5. 积碳形成：这是PDH催化剂（包括基于Pt的催化剂）的一个重要问题。减少积碳形成的策略包括：

   - 使用富碳表面，它对丙烯生产的选择性比竞争性裂解反应更高。
   - 向催化剂中添加磷酸盐，可以削弱Fe-C相互作用并使表面碳原子不稳定，从而防止积碳。
   - 开发具有特定表面结构的催化剂，限制深度脱氢和非选择性裂解。

6. 催化剂再生：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但有效的催化剂再生过程对于在工业应用中维持长期催化剂性能至关重要。

铁基催化剂，特别是碳化铁的开发，在解决许多这些考虑因素方面显示出前景，与传统催化剂相比，它提供了高选择性、良好的活性和改善的抗积碳性能。
