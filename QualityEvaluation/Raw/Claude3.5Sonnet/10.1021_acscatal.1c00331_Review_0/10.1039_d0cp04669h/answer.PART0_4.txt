[1] "Identifying catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation has become increasingly important due to the increasing demand for propylene coupled to decreasing propylene production from steam cracking as we shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, which are expensive or toxic, respectively."

[3] "Recent experimental work has demonstrated that earth-abundant and environmentally-benign metals, such as iron, form in situ carbide phases that exhibit good activity and high selectivity for PDH."

[4] "We find that carbon-rich surfaces show much higher selectivity for propylene production over competing cracking reactions compared to iron-rich surfaces"

[5] "Finally, we investigated the role of phosphate in suppressing coke formation and found that the electron-withdrawing character of phosphate destabilizes surface carbon."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production due to increasing demand and decreasing production from traditional steam cracking. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures and low pressures to favor dehydrogenation.

2. Catalyst types: Commercialized catalysts are based on Pt or Cr, but there is interest in developing more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternatives like iron-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming more important as a dedicated process for propylene production, especially with the shift to lighter hydrocarbon feedstocks.

4. Selectivity: Carbon-rich surfaces on iron carbide catalysts show higher selectivity for propylene production compared to iron-rich surfaces.

5. Coke formation: This is a significant issue for Pt-based catalysts, impacting process efficiency. Strategies to mitigate coke formation include:

   a) Developing alternative catalysts like iron carbides that are more resistant to coking.
   b) Using additives like phosphate, which can suppress coke formation by destabilizing surface carbon.
   c) Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.
   d) Implementing efficient catalyst regeneration processes to remove coke deposits.

These considerations aim to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process for industrial propylene production.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为需求不断增加，而传统蒸汽裂解的产量在下降。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温低压下进行，以有利于脱氢反应。

2. 催化剂类型：商业化催化剂基于铂或铬，但目前有兴趣开发更具成本效益和环境友好的替代品，如铁基催化剂。

3. 工业应用：随着向轻质烃原料的转变，PDH作为一种专门的丙烯生产工艺变得越来越重要。

4. 选择性：铁碳化物催化剂上的富碳表面比富铁表面表现出更高的丙烯生产选择性。

5. 积碳形成：这是铂基催化剂的一个重要问题，影响过程效率。减少积碳形成的策略包括：

   a) 开发更耐积碳的替代催化剂，如铁碳化物。
   b) 使用添加剂如磷酸盐，通过使表面碳不稳定来抑制积碳形成。
   c) 优化反应条件以最小化积碳形成。
   d) 实施高效的催化剂再生过程以去除积碳沉积物。

这些考虑因素旨在提高PDH过程在工业丙烯生产中的整体效率和可持续性。
