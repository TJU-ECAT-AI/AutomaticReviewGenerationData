[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."

[2] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."

[3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."

[4] "The Catofin process, by CB&I Lummus, is based on the Houdry Catadiene process, which originally was exclusively used for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene."

[5] "The Oleflex process by UOP uses a very different reactor design comprising fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section."

[6] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[7] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."

[8] "Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply. Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."

[9] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."

[10] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene and hydrogen in a single step reaction. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process requires high temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures to achieve high conversions due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Two main industrial catalysts are used - Pt-based catalysts (e.g., PtSn/Al2O3 in the Oleflex process) and CrOx-based catalysts (e.g., CrOx/Al2O3 in the Catofin process). Each catalyst type has its own reactor design and operating conditions.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has become increasingly important due to the availability of cheap propane from shale gas and the growing demand for propene. The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene.

4. Market conditions: There is a favorable market situation for PDH due to increased demand for propylene and butadiene, especially from the automotive industry, combined with decreased supply from traditional sources like naphtha cracking.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering active sites and causing a drop in catalyst activity. This is one of the main causes of catalyst deactivation in PDH processes.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using supports with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to reduce coke formation.
2. Modifying reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.
3. Controlling olefin and paraffin partial pressures in the reactor.
4. Adding promoters like Sn to Pt-based catalysts to reduce coke formation.
5. Implementing periodic regeneration cycles to burn off coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and improve overall process efficiency in industrial PDH operations.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）作为丙烯生产方法，通过单步反应将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于热力学限制和反应的吸热性质，该过程需要高温（550-750°C）和低压才能达到高转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：主要使用两种工业催化剂 - 铂基催化剂（如Oleflex工艺中的PtSn/Al2O3）和氧化铬基催化剂（如Catofin工艺中的CrOx/Al2O3）。每种催化剂类型都有其特定的反应器设计和操作条件。

3. 工业应用：由于页岩气提供的廉价丙烷和不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH变得越来越重要。PDH的盈利能力主要取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异。

4. 市场条件：由于丙烯和丁二烯需求的增加（特别是来自汽车行业），以及传统来源（如石脑油裂解）供应的减少，PDH面临有利的市场形势。

焦炭在铂基催化剂上的形成通过覆盖活性位点并导致催化剂活性下降，显著影响了工艺效率。这是PDH过程中催化剂失活的主要原因之一。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 使用低Brønsted酸性载体或毒化酸性位点以减少焦炭形成。
2. 修改反应条件，如共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2。
3. 控制反应器中烯烃和烷烃的分压。
4. 向铂基催化剂中添加促进剂（如Sn）以减少焦炭形成。
5. 实施定期再生循环，燃烧焦炭沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高活性和选择性，并提高工业PDH操作的整体工艺效率。
