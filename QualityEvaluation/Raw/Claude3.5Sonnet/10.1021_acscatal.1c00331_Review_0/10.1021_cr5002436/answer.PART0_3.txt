[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[2] "Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[3] "Temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

[4] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."

[5] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by removing hydrogen from propane molecules. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: High temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures are required to achieve good conversion rates. 

Catalyst types: Two main types are used - noble metal-based (primarily platinum) and metal oxide-based (particularly chromium oxide) catalysts. Each has advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

Industrial applications: PDH has become increasingly important for on-purpose propylene production, especially with the availability of low-cost propane from shale gas.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by blocking active sites and pores, reducing catalytic activity over time. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using supports with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites
2. Modifying reaction conditions (e.g. cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2)
3. Adding promoters like tin to platinum catalysts
4. Implementing frequent catalyst regeneration cycles
5. Optimizing regeneration conditions to remove coke without damaging the catalyst

These approaches aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and improve the overall economics of the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是通过从丙烷分子中移除氢来生产丙烯的方法。主要考虑因素包括：

反应条件：需要高温（550-750°C）和低压才能达到良好的转化率。

催化剂类型：主要使用两种类型 - 贵金属基（主要是铂）和金属氧化物基（特别是氧化铬）催化剂。每种类型在活性、选择性和稳定性方面都有优势。

工业应用：PDH在定向丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，特别是随着页岩气提供的低成本丙烷的可用性增加。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过阻塞活性位点和孔道显著影响工艺效率，随时间降低催化活性。减轻积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 使用低Brønsted酸性的载体或毒化酸性位点
2. 修改反应条件（如共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2）
3. 向铂催化剂中添加锡等助剂
4. 实施频繁的催化剂再生循环
5. 优化再生条件以去除积碳而不损坏催化剂

这些方法旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高活性和选择性，并改善PDH过程的整体经济性。
