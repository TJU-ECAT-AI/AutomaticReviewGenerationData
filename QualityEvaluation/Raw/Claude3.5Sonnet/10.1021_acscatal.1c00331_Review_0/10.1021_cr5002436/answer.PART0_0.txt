[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[2] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[3] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."

[4] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."

[5] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."

[6] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

[7] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for producing propene by removing hydrogen from propane molecules using a catalyst. This process is important because light olefins like propene are crucial chemical building blocks in the industry.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically requires high temperatures and low pressures to favor propene formation. Cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2 can help reduce coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based and chromium oxide-based catalysts are commonly used in industrial PDH processes. Each type has its advantages and challenges.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has gained importance due to the shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane in steam cracking installations, especially in the United States. This shift has created a need for on-purpose propene production methods like PDH.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering active sites and blocking pores, leading to decreased catalytic activity. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, several strategies can be implemented:

1. Using support materials with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to reduce coke formation.

2. Modifying reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.

3. Incorporating a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere to combust coke deposits.

4. Careful catalyst design to control the location and nature of coke deposits.

5. Optimizing regeneration conditions to prevent irreversible catalyst deactivation.

By implementing these strategies, the efficiency and longevity of PDH catalysts can be improved, leading to more sustainable and economical propene production.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种使用催化剂从丙烷分子中去除氢以生产丙烯的方法。这个过程很重要，因为像丙烯这样的轻烯烃是工业中至关重要的化学建筑模块。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常需要高温和低压以有利于丙烯的形成。共进料蒸汽、氢气或二氧化碳可以帮助减少积碳形成。

2. 催化剂类型：工业PDH过程中常用铂基和氧化铬基催化剂。每种类型都有其优点和挑战。

3. 工业应用：由于蒸汽裂解装置从油基石脑油向页岩基乙烷的转变，特别是在美国，PDH变得越来越重要。这种转变创造了对有目的性丙烯生产方法（如PDH）的需求。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成通过覆盖活性位点和堵塞孔道显著影响过程效率，导致催化活性降低。为了减轻积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，可以实施几种策略：

1. 使用具有低Brønsted酸性的支撑材料或毒化酸性位点以减少积碳形成。

2. 修改反应条件，如共进料蒸汽、氢气或二氧化碳。

3. 在氧化气氛下引入再生步骤以燃烧积碳沉积物。

4. 仔细设计催化剂以控制积碳沉积的位置和性质。

5. 优化再生条件以防止不可逆的催化剂失活。

通过实施这些策略，可以提高PDH催化剂的效率和寿命，从而实现更可持续和经济的丙烯生产。
