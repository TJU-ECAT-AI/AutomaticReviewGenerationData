[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "Catalytic dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[3] "Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

[4] "Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."

[5] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for producing propene, which is a crucial chemical building block in the industry. The process involves removing hydrogen from propane to form propene.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The reaction is typically carried out at high temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures to achieve high conversions. However, these conditions also promote side reactions and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Two main types of catalysts are used - noble metal-based (primarily platinum) and metal oxide-based (primarily chromium oxide). Each has its advantages and challenges.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has gained importance due to the increased availability of low-cost propane from shale gas. Several industrial processes have been developed, such as the Catofin and Oleflex processes.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by:
- Blocking active sites and pores, reducing catalyst activity
- Necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration, which can lead to catalyst deactivation over time

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:
- Using supports with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites
- Modifying reaction conditions (e.g., cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2)
- Adding promoters like tin to platinum catalysts
- Developing more sophisticated regeneration processes using operando spectroscopy for real-time monitoring

These approaches aim to extend catalyst lifetime, reduce regeneration frequency, and improve overall process efficiency.

催化直接脱氢是生产丙烯的重要方法，丙烯是工业中至关重要的化学原料。这个过程涉及从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：反应通常在高温（550-750°C）和低压下进行，以获得高转化率。然而，这些条件也促进了副反应和积碳的形成。

2. 催化剂类型：主要使用两种类型的催化剂 - 贵金属基（主要是铂）和金属氧化物基（主要是氧化铬）。每种都有其优势和挑战。

3. 工业应用：由于页岩气带来的低成本丙烷供应增加，PDH变得越来越重要。已经开发了几种工业工艺，如Catofin和Oleflex工艺。

积碳对铂基催化剂的影响显著影响过程效率：
- 阻塞活性位点和孔隙，降低催化剂活性
- 需要频繁进行催化剂再生，这可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：
- 使用低Brønsted酸性的载体或毒化酸性位点
- 修改反应条件（如共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2）
- 向铂催化剂中添加锡等助剂
- 开发使用原位光谱技术进行实时监测的更复杂的再生过程

这些方法旨在延长催化剂寿命，减少再生频率，并提高整体过程效率。
