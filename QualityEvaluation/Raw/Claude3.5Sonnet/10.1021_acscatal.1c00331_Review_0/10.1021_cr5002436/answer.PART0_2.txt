[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[3] "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

[4] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."

[5] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[6] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."

[7] "To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

[8] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation,"

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production due to the high demand for light olefins as chemical building blocks. The process involves converting propane into propene and hydrogen in a single step reaction.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures and low partial pressures of propane are required to achieve high conversions due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used in industrial applications. Other catalysts like chromium oxide have also been developed.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has become increasingly important, with about 5 million tons of propylene produced annually through this process. The shale gas boom in the US has made PDH more economically viable.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by covering active sites and causing a drop in activity. To mitigate this issue and improve catalyst regeneration:

1. Regeneration steps using oxidative atmospheres are incorporated into industrial processes to combust coke deposits.

2. Catalyst supports with low Brønsted acidity are used to reduce coke formation.

3. Reaction conditions are modified, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.

4. Promoters like tin are added to Pt catalysts to reduce coke formation and facilitate regeneration.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity, and improve overall process efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法，因为轻烯烃作为化学建筑块的需求很高。该过程涉及将丙烷在单步反应中转化为丙烯和氢气。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于热力学限制和反应的吸热性质，需要高温和低丙烷分压才能实现高转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：工业应用中常用铂基催化剂。其他催化剂如氧化铬也已开发。

3. 工业应用：PDH变得越来越重要，每年通过这一过程生产约500万吨丙烯。美国页岩气繁荣使PDH在经济上更加可行。

Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过覆盖活性位点并导致活性下降，显著影响了过程效率。为了缓解这个问题并改善催化剂再生：

1. 在工业过程中加入使用氧化性气氛的再生步骤，以燃烧焦炭沉积物。

2. 使用具有低Brønsted酸性的催化剂载体来减少焦炭形成。

3. 修改反应条件，如共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2。

4. 向Pt催化剂中添加锡等助剂，以减少焦炭形成并促进再生。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高活性，并改善丙烷脱氢过程的整体效率。
