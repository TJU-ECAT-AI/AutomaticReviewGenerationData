          "From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:"

"However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."

"Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use."

"Temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar"

"Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."

"Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation"

"To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane into propene and hydrogen in a single-step reaction. The key considerations regarding reaction conditions, catalyst types, and industrial applications are:

1. Reaction conditions:
   - High temperatures (550-750°C) and low pressures are required to achieve high conversions due to thermodynamic limitations and the endothermic nature of the reaction.
   - Modifications such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2 can help reduce coke formation.

2. Catalyst types:
   - Two main types are used: noble metal-based (primarily platinum) and metal oxide-based (particularly chromium oxide) catalysts.
   - Each type has advantages in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. Industrial applications:
   - PDH has become increasingly important for on-purpose propylene production, especially with the availability of low-cost propane from shale gas.
   - Several industrial processes have been developed, such as the Catofin and Oleflex processes.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by:
- Covering active sites and blocking pores, leading to decreased catalytic activity.
- Necessitating frequent catalyst regeneration, which can lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:
1. Using supports with low Brønsted acidity or poisoning acid sites to reduce coke formation.
2. Modifying reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.
3. Adding promoters like tin to platinum catalysts to reduce coke formation and facilitate regeneration.
4. Implementing periodic regeneration cycles under oxidative atmospheres to burn off coke deposits.
5. Optimizing regeneration conditions to prevent irreversible catalyst deactivation.

These strategies aim to extend catalyst lifetime, maintain high activity and selectivity, and improve overall process efficiency in industrial PDH operations.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种通过单步反应将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气的丙烯生产方法。关于反应条件、催化剂类型和工业应用的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：
   - 由于热力学限制和反应的吸热性质，需要高温（550-750°C）和低压才能达到高转化率。
   - 共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2等修改可以帮助减少积碳形成。

2. 催化剂类型：
   - 主要使用两种类型：贵金属基（主要是铂）和金属氧化物基（特别是氧化铬）催化剂。
   - 每种类型在活性、选择性和稳定性方面都有优势。

3. 工业应用：
   - PDH在定向丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，特别是随着页岩气提供的低成本丙烷的可用性增加。
   - 已开发了几种工业工艺，如Catofin和Oleflex工艺。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率：
- 覆盖活性位点和堵塞孔道，导致催化活性降低。
- 需要频繁进行催化剂再生，这可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：
1. 使用低Brønsted酸性的载体或毒化酸性位点以减少积碳形成。
2. 修改反应条件，如共进料蒸汽、氢气或CO2。
3. 向铂催化剂中添加锡等助剂，以减少积碳形成并促进再生。
4. 在氧化性气氛下实施定期再生循环，以燃烧积碳沉积物。
5. 优化再生条件以防止不可逆的催化剂失活。

这些策略旨在延长催化剂寿命，保持高活性和选择性，并提高工业PDH操作的整体过程效率。
