[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions."

[3] "However, the rate of hydrogenolysis and coking reactions becomes significant at these high temperatures. Accordingly, the selectivity toward dehydrogenation becomes low at high temperatures required for favorable dehydrogenation thermodynamics."

[4] "Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[5] "Zinc can give a remarkable improvement in dehydrogenation performance of catalysts. High propylene selectivity (97%) can be obtained over zinc-doped catalysts."

[6] "The presence of zinc modifies the metallic phase, mainly by geometric and electronic modifications of the metallic phase. These modifications could be responsible for the improvement of catalytic performance."

[7] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."

[8] "Firstly, Zn can decrease the size of surface Pt ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydrogenated species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles. Secondly, the Zn presence brings about an increase in the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, which will weaken the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and repulse coke precursors."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production due to the growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (over 550°C) are required to achieve high conversions, as the reaction is endothermic.

2. Catalyst types: Platinum-based catalysts are commonly used, often with additives like tin (Sn) or zinc (Zn) to improve performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the production of propylene and other light olefins.

The main challenge in PDH is balancing high conversion with high selectivity. At high temperatures, side reactions like hydrogenolysis and coking become significant, reducing selectivity towards propylene.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts severely impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn or Zn to Pt catalysts, which can suppress coke formation and improve selectivity.

2. Using Zn as a promoter, which modifies the Pt metallic phase both geometrically and electronically, leading to improved catalytic performance.

3. Decreasing the size of surface Pt ensembles through the addition of Zn, which inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated species that lead to coking.

4. Increasing the electronic density of the Pt metal phase through Zn addition, which weakens the Pt-C bond strength and repels coke precursors.

These strategies not only reduce coke formation but also improve overall catalyst performance, leading to higher propylene selectivity and better catalyst stability in the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为对轻质烯烃的需求不断增长。这个过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应是吸热的，需要高温（超过550°C）才能获得高转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用铂基催化剂，常常添加锡（Sn）或锌（Zn）等添加剂来提高性能。

3. 工业应用：PDH在丙烯和其他轻质烯烃的生产中变得越来越重要。

PDH的主要挑战是平衡高转化率和高选择性。在高温下，副反应如氢解和结焦变得显著，降低了对丙烯的选择性。

铂基催化剂上的结焦形成严重影响了工艺效率，使催化剂失活。减少结焦形成和提高催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 向铂催化剂中添加锡或锌等助剂，可以抑制结焦形成并提高选择性。

2. 使用锌作为助剂，它在几何和电子方面修饰铂金属相，从而提高催化性能。

3. 通过添加锌减小表面铂集合体的尺寸，抑制导致结焦的高度脱氢物种的形成。

4. 通过添加锌增加铂金属相的电子密度，削弱Pt-C键强度并排斥焦炭前体。

这些策略不仅减少了结焦形成，还提高了整体催化剂性能，导致PDH过程中丙烯选择性更高，催化剂稳定性更好。
