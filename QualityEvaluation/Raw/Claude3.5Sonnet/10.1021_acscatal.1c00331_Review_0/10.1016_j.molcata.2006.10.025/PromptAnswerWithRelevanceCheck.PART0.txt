[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions."

[3] "Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[4] "The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies. The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/ or electronic effect"

[5] "Addition of Zn to Pt-based catalysts can lead to an obvious change of catalytic performance."

[6] "Coke was analyzed by TPO and O2-pulse experiments. O2-pulse experiment is a special technology used for quantitative coke analysis."

[7] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."

[8] "Firstly, Zn can decrease the size of surface Pt ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydrogenated species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles. Secondly, the Zn presence brings about an increase in the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, which will weaken the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and repulse coke precursors."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important process for producing propylene due to the growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The reaction is endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve high conversions.

2. Catalyst types: Supported platinum catalysts are commonly used, often with additives like tin (Sn) or zinc (Zn) to improve performance.

3. Industrial applications: The process is becoming increasingly important in the production of propylene and other light olefins.

The main challenge in PDH is coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Sn and Zn are added to Pt catalysts to inhibit coking reactions.

2. Modifying catalyst properties: Zn decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated species that lead to coke.

3. Altering electronic properties: Zn increases the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, weakening the Pt-C bond and repelling coke precursors.

4. Catalyst characterization: Techniques like TPO and O2-pulse experiments are used to analyze coke formation and guide improvements in catalyst design.

These strategies aim to suppress coke formation, extend catalyst life, and improve overall process efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important process for producing propylene due to growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (over 550°C) are needed for high conversions, but this also increases undesired side reactions like hydrogenolysis and coking.

2. Catalyst types: Supported platinum catalysts are effective, with additives like tin and zinc used to improve performance. Pt-Sn catalysts are common, while zinc-doped catalysts show high propylene selectivity (up to 97%).

3. Industrial applications: The process is becoming increasingly important for meeting propylene demand.

Catalyst design focuses on:
- Geometric effects: Modifying platinum ensemble size
- Electronic effects: Altering electron density of platinum surface

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters like zinc, which can remarkably suppress coke formation
2. Optimizing promoter deposition sequence, as this strongly influences catalytic performance and coke resistance
3. Modifying catalyst acidity to reduce coke-forming side reactions
4. Increasing electron density of platinum to weaken Pt-C bonds and promote olefin desorption

Catalyst regeneration typically involves burning off coke deposits under controlled conditions. Characterization techniques like TPO and O2-pulse experiments are used to analyze coke formation and removal.

The main challenge in PDH is balancing high conversion with high selectivity. At high temperatures, side reactions like hydrogenolysis and coking become significant, reducing selectivity towards propylene.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts severely impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn or Zn to Pt catalysts, which can suppress coke formation and improve selectivity.

2. Using Zn as a promoter, which modifies the Pt metallic phase both geometrically and electronically, leading to improved catalytic performance.

3. Decreasing the size of surface Pt ensembles through the addition of Zn, which inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated species that lead to coking.

4. Increasing the electronic density of the Pt metal phase through Zn addition, which weakens the Pt-C bond strength and repels coke precursors.

These strategies not only reduce coke formation but also improve overall catalyst performance, leading to higher propylene selectivity and better catalyst stability in the PDH process.
