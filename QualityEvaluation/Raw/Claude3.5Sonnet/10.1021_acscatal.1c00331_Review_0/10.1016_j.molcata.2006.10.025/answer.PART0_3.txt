Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production due to growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (over 550°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Supported platinum catalysts are effective, with tin (Sn) added to promote dehydrogenation and inhibit coking. Zinc-doped PtSn catalysts show further improvements.

3. Industrial applications: PDH addresses the increasing demand for propylene and other light olefins.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters like zinc to suppress coke formation.
2. Optimizing catalyst composition and preparation methods.
3. Developing more efficient regeneration techniques.

These approaches aim to extend catalyst lifetime and maintain high propylene selectivity and conversion rates.

丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为对轻质烯烃的需求不断增长。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温(超过550°C)。

2. 催化剂类型：负载型铂催化剂有效，添加锡(Sn)可促进脱氢并抑制结焦。掺锌的PtSn催化剂显示出进一步的改进。

3. 工业应用：PDH满足了对丙烯和其他轻质烯烃日益增长的需求。

结焦形成显著影响过程效率，因为它会使催化剂失活。减少结焦形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加锌等助剂以抑制结焦形成。
2. 优化催化剂组成和制备方法。
3. 开发更高效的再生技术。

这些方法旨在延长催化剂寿命，并保持高丙烯选择性和转化率。
