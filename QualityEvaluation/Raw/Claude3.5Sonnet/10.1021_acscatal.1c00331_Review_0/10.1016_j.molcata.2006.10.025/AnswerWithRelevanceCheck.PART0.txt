          [1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions."

[3] "Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[4] "The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/ or electronic effect"

[5] "Zinc can give a remarkable improvement in dehydrogenation performance of catalysts. High propylene selectivity (97%) can be obtained over zinc-doped catalysts."

[6] "The presence of zinc modifies the metallic phase, mainly by geometric and electronic modifications of the metallic phase. These modifications could be responsible for the improvement of catalytic performance."

[7] "Coke was analyzed by TPO and O2-pulse experiments. O2-pulse experiment is a special technology used for quantitative coke analysis."

[8] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."

[9] "Firstly, Zn can decrease the size of surface Pt ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydrogenated species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles. Secondly, the Zn presence brings about an increase in the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, which will weaken the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and repulse coke precursors."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production due to the growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process requires high temperatures (over 550°C) to achieve high conversions, as it is an endothermic reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Supported platinum catalysts are commonly used, often with additives like tin (Sn) or zinc (Zn) to improve performance. Pt-Sn catalysts are well-known, while zinc-doped catalysts can achieve high propylene selectivity (up to 97%).

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the production of propylene and other light olefins.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Adding promoters like Sn or Zn to Pt catalysts, which can suppress coke formation and improve selectivity.

2. Using Zn as a promoter, which modifies the Pt metallic phase both geometrically and electronically, leading to improved catalytic performance.

3. Decreasing the size of surface Pt ensembles through the addition of Zn, which inhibits the formation of highly dehydrogenated species that lead to coking.

4. Increasing the electronic density of the Pt metal phase through Zn addition, which weakens the Pt-C bond strength and repels coke precursors.

5. Employing characterization techniques like TPO and O2-pulse experiments to analyze coke formation and guide improvements in catalyst design.

These strategies aim to reduce coke formation, extend catalyst lifetime, and improve overall process efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

          催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，这是由于对轻质烯烃需求的增长。该过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于是吸热反应，需要高温（超过550°C）才能获得高转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用负载型铂催化剂，常常添加锡（Sn）或锌（Zn）等添加剂以提高性能。Pt-Sn催化剂广为人知，而掺锌催化剂可以实现高丙烯选择性（高达97%）。

3. 工业应用：PDH在丙烯和其他轻质烯烃的生产中变得越来越重要。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过使催化剂失活而显著影响过程效率。减少焦炭形成和提高催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 向铂催化剂中添加锡或锌等助剂，可以抑制焦炭形成并提高选择性。

2. 使用锌作为助剂，它在几何和电子方面修饰铂金属相，从而提高催化性能。

3. 通过添加锌减小表面铂集合体的尺寸，抑制导致结焦的高度脱氢物种的形成。

4. 通过添加锌增加铂金属相的电子密度，削弱Pt-C键强度并排斥焦炭前体。

5. 采用TPO和O2-脉冲实验等表征技术来分析焦炭形成，并指导催化剂设计的改进。

这些策略旨在减少焦炭形成，延长催化剂寿命，并提高丙烷脱氢过程的整体效率。
