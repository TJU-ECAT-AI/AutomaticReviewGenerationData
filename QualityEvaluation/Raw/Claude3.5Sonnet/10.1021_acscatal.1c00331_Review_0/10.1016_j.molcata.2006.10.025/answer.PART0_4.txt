[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions. However, the rate of hydrogenolysis and coking reactions becomes significant at these high temperatures."

[3] "Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[4] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn catalysts depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, especially, the interactions between platinum and tin species."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production due to the growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process requires high temperatures (over 550°C) to achieve high conversions, as it is an endothermic reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Supported platinum catalysts are commonly used, often with additives like tin (Sn) or zinc (Zn) to improve performance.

3. Industrial applications: The process is becoming increasingly important in the production of propylene and other light olefins.

The main challenges in PDH involve balancing conversion rates with unwanted side reactions. At high temperatures, hydrogenolysis and coking reactions become significant, reducing selectivity and catalyst lifespan.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts negatively impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) can be added to platinum catalysts to inhibit coking reactions.

2. Optimizing catalyst composition: The performance of PtSn catalysts depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio and preparation method.

3. Utilizing zinc as a promoter: Zinc addition can significantly suppress coke formation and change catalytic performance.

4. Monitoring and quantifying coke formation: Techniques like TPO (Temperature Programmed Oxidation) and O2-pulse experiments can be used to analyze coke deposition.

By implementing these strategies, researchers and industry professionals can work towards improving the efficiency and longevity of catalysts in the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，因为轻烯烃的需求不断增长。这个过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于是吸热反应，需要高温（超过550°C）才能获得高转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用负载型铂催化剂，常常添加锡（Sn）或锌（Zn）等添加剂以提高性能。

3. 工业应用：该过程在丙烯和其他轻烯烃的生产中变得越来越重要。

PDH的主要挑战在于平衡转化率和不想要的副反应。在高温下，加氢分解和结焦反应变得显著，降低了选择性和催化剂寿命。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成通过使催化剂失活而对过程效率产生负面影响。减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：可以向铂催化剂中添加锡（Sn）和锌（Zn）以抑制结焦反应。

2. 优化催化剂组成：PtSn催化剂的性能取决于Sn/Pt原子比和制备方法。

3. 利用锌作为助剂：添加锌可以显著抑制焦炭形成并改变催化性能。

4. 监测和量化焦炭形成：可以使用TPO（程序升温氧化）和O2-脉冲实验等技术来分析焦炭沉积。

通过实施这些策略，研究人员和行业专业人士可以致力于提高PDH过程中催化剂的效率和寿命。
