[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions. However, the rate of hydrogenolysis and coking reactions becomes significant at these high temperatures."

[3] "Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[4] "The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/ or electronic effect"

[5] "Zinc can give a remarkable improvement in dehydrogenation performance of catalysts. High propylene selectivity (97%) can be obtained over zinc-doped catalysts."

[6] "The presence of zinc modifies the metallic phase, mainly by geometric and electronic modifications of the metallic phase. These modifications could be responsible for the improvement of catalytic performance."

[7] "The effect of zinc deposition sequence on the dehydrogenation performance was investigated and the results are shown in Table 2. Clearly, the sequence of zinc deposition can strongly influence the catalytic performance."

[8] "Coke was analyzed by TPO and O2-pulse experiments."

[9] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important process for producing propylene due to growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (over 550°C) are needed for high conversions, but this also increases undesired side reactions like hydrogenolysis and coking.

2. Catalyst types: Supported platinum catalysts are effective, with additives like tin and zinc used to improve performance. Pt-Sn catalysts are common, while zinc-doped catalysts show high propylene selectivity (up to 97%).

3. Industrial applications: The process is becoming increasingly important for meeting propylene demand.

Catalyst design focuses on:
- Geometric effects: Modifying platinum ensemble size
- Electronic effects: Altering electron density of platinum surface

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters like zinc, which can remarkably suppress coke formation
2. Optimizing promoter deposition sequence, as this strongly influences catalytic performance and coke resistance
3. Modifying catalyst acidity to reduce coke-forming side reactions
4. Increasing electron density of platinum to weaken Pt-C bonds and promote olefin desorption

Catalyst regeneration typically involves burning off coke deposits under controlled conditions. Characterization techniques like TPO and O2-pulse experiments are used to analyze coke formation and removal.

丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)是生产丙烯的一个重要过程，因为轻烯烃需求不断增长。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：需要高温（超过550°C）来获得高转化率，但这也会增加不希望的副反应，如氢解和结焦。

2. 催化剂类型：负载型铂催化剂效果很好，添加锡和锌等可以提高性能。Pt-Sn催化剂很常见，而掺锌催化剂显示出高丙烯选择性（高达97%）。

3. 工业应用：该过程对满足丙烯需求变得越来越重要。

催化剂设计关注：
- 几何效应：修改铂集合体大小
- 电子效应：改变铂表面电子密度

结焦形成显著影响过程效率，使催化剂失活。减少结焦形成和改善再生的策略包括：

1. 添加锌等助剂，可以显著抑制结焦形成
2. 优化助剂沉积顺序，因为这强烈影响催化性能和抗焦性
3. 修改催化剂酸度以减少形成焦炭的副反应
4. 增加铂的电子密度，弱化Pt-C键并促进烯烃脱附

催化剂再生通常涉及在受控条件下燃烧焦炭沉积物。使用TPO和O2-脉冲实验等表征技术来分析焦炭形成和去除。
