[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation processes are of increasing importance because of growing demand for light olefins such as propylene and isobutene."

[2] "Since the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is an endothermic reaction, temperatures in excess of 550 C are needed to obtain high conversions."

[3] "Supported platinum is a good catalyst for reforming and dehydrogenation reactions. Addition of Sn to Pt/Al2O3 naphtha-reforming catalysts is well known to promote desired dehydrogenation reactions and inhibit coking reactions"

[4] "The role of Sn in PtSn catalysts has been extensively investigated in many studies. The effect of tin has been explained in terms of geometric effect and/ or electronic effect"

[5] "Addition of Zn to Pt-based catalysts can lead to an obvious change of catalytic performance."

[6] "Coke was analyzed by TPO and O2-pulse experiments. O2-pulse experiment is a special technology used for quantitative coke analysis."

[7] "Clearly, the presence of zinc can remarkably suppress the formation of coke."

[8] "Firstly, Zn can decrease the size of surface Pt ensembles, thereby inhibiting the formation on the surface of highly dehydrogenated species required for hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reactions which require large Pt ensembles. Secondly, the Zn presence brings about an increase in the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, which will weaken the strength of the Pt(C C) bond and repulse coke precursors."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important process for producing propylene due to the growing demand for light olefins. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The reaction is endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C) to achieve high conversions.

2. Catalyst types: Supported platinum catalysts are commonly used, often with additives like tin (Sn) or zinc (Zn) to improve performance.

3. Industrial applications: The process is becoming increasingly important in the production of propylene and other light olefins.

The main challenge in PDH is coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Adding promoters: Sn and Zn are added to Pt catalysts to inhibit coking reactions.

2. Modifying catalyst properties: Zn decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, inhibiting the formation of highly dehydrogenated species that lead to coke.

3. Altering electronic properties: Zn increases the electronic density of the platinum metal phase, weakening the Pt-C bond and repelling coke precursors.

4. Catalyst characterization: Techniques like TPO and O2-pulse experiments are used to analyze coke formation and guide improvements in catalyst design.

These strategies aim to suppress coke formation, extend catalyst life, and improve overall process efficiency in propane dehydrogenation.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的一个重要过程，这是由于对轻质烯烃需求的增长。该过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该反应是吸热的，需要高温（超过550°C）才能获得高转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用负载型铂催化剂，常常添加锡（Sn）或锌（Zn）等添加剂以提高性能。

3. 工业应用：该过程在丙烯和其他轻质烯烃的生产中变得越来越重要。

PDH的主要挑战是在铂基催化剂上形成焦炭，这会通过使催化剂失活而影响过程效率。减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 添加助剂：向铂催化剂中添加Sn和Zn以抑制焦化反应。

2. 修改催化剂性质：Zn减少了表面铂集合体的大小，抑制了导致焦炭的高度脱氢物种的形成。

3. 改变电子性质：Zn增加了铂金属相的电子密度，削弱了Pt-C键并排斥焦炭前体。

4. 催化剂表征：使用TPO和O2-脉冲实验等技术来分析焦炭形成，并指导催化剂设计的改进。

这些策略旨在抑制焦炭形成，延长催化剂寿命，并提高丙烷脱氢过程的整体效率。
