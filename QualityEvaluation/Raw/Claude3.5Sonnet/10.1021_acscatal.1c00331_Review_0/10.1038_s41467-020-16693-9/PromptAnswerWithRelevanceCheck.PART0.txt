[1] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production1–3. Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 °C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields."

[2] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."

[3] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further C–H(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation6–10."

[4] "For Pt-based catalysts, Pt–Pt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis1. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH11."

[5] "Here, we report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures. Intermetallic PtGa displays three-hold-Pt ensembles and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface, the former of which can be selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition."

[6] "The PtGa–Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second C–H activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for producing propylene to meet increasing global demand. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 600°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials are commonly used. The study introduces a novel PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst with single-atom Pt sites.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an on-purpose technique for propylene production, addressing the supply reduction caused by the shift to shale-based ethane feedstock.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing severe catalyst deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration in practical applications.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Isolation of Pt atoms: This inhibits undesired side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Use of intermetallic compounds: The PtGa intermetallic provides thermal stability and allows for single-atom Pt sites.

3. Selective blocking: Pb deposition is used to selectively block three-fold Pt ensembles, leaving single-atom Pt sites active.

4. Optimized catalyst design: The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates high conversion (30%), excellent selectivity (99.6%), and remarkable stability (96 hours without performance loss) at 600°C.

These strategies result in a catalyst that effectively catalyzes the first and second C-H activations while inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions and coke formation, thus drastically improving selectivity and stability in the PDH process.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production, addressing the increasing global demand for this crucial chemical building block. PDH uses Pt- or Cr2O3-based catalysts to convert propane into propylene.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 600°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. This ensures sufficient propylene yields.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based and Cr2O3-based materials are commonly used. The study introduces a novel catalyst: single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa, specifically PtGa-Pb/SiO2.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane, which has reduced propylene supply.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by causing severe catalyst deactivation. This deactivation, along with sintering, is inevitable under the harsh reaction conditions required for PDH. The formation of coke is a result of undesired side reactions, such as further C-H(C) scissions of propylene.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Using single-atom catalysts: The study demonstrates that single-atom Pt in PtGa effectively catalyzes the first and second C-H activations while inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Catalyst design: The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits high stability and selectivity, maintaining 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600°C for 96 hours without performance degradation.

3. Isolation of active sites: By isolating Pt atoms and blocking certain sites (e.g., Pt3 sites) with Pb, the catalyst becomes more selective and resistant to coke formation.

These strategies aim to improve the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, thereby enhancing selectivity and stability in the PDH process.

1. 使用单原子催化剂：研究表明，PtGa中的单原子Pt有效地催化第一和第二个C-H活化，同时抑制第三个，最大限度地减少导致焦炭形成的副反应。

2. 催化剂设计：PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂表现出高稳定性和选择性，在600°C下96小时内保持30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性，性能没有降低。

3. 活性位点的隔离：通过隔离Pt原子并用Pb阻断某些位点（如Pt3位点），催化剂变得更具选择性和抗焦炭形成能力。

这些策略旨在改善丙烯脱附和不需要的副反应之间的平衡，从而提高PDH过程的选择性和稳定性。
