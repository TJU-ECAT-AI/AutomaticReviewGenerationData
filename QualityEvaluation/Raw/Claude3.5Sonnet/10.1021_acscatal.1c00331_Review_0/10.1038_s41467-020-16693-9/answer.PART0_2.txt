[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for the production of a wide range of chemicals, such as polymers, resins, surfactants, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. The supply of propylene has been reduced because of the recent shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production"

[2] "Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."

[3] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation"

[4] "For Pt-based catalysts, PtPt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH"

[5] "Here, we report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures. Intermetallic PtGa displays three-hold-Pt ensembles and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface, the former of which can be selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition."

[6] "The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising technique for propylene production, addressing the increasing global demand due to reduced supply from traditional steam cracking methods. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 600°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. This allows for sufficient propylene yields but also creates challenges for catalyst stability.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials are commonly used. The study focuses on a novel PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst, which exhibits superior performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important as an on-purpose technique for propylene production, especially given the shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing severe catalyst deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration in practical applications, either continuously or in short cycles.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Isolation of Pt atoms: This inhibits undesired side reactions such as over-dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, which contribute to coke formation.

2. Use of intermetallic compounds: The study presents a thermally stable intermetallic PtGa catalyst, which provides both isolated single Pt atoms and three-fold Pt ensembles.

3. Selective blocking: By depositing Pb on the catalyst surface, the three-fold Pt ensembles can be selectively blocked, leaving only the single-atom Pt sites active.

4. Optimizing catalyst composition: The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst demonstrated high conversion (30%), exceptional selectivity (99.6%), and remarkable stability (96 hours without performance loss) at 600°C.

These strategies result in a catalyst that effectively catalyzes the first and second C-H activations while inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation and significantly improving selectivity and stability.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有前景的丙烯生产技术，可以满足由于传统蒸汽裂解方法供应减少而导致的全球需求增加。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温（约600°C）。这可以获得足够的丙烯产量，但也给催化剂的稳定性带来挑战。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料。该研究重点关注一种新型的PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂，表现出优异的性能。

3. 工业应用：随着蒸汽裂解装置原料从石油基石脑油向页岩基乙烷转变，PDH作为一种定向技术在丙烯生产中变得越来越重要。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂严重失活。这在实际应用中需要频繁进行催化剂再生，要么连续进行，要么在短周期内进行。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. Pt原子的隔离：这可以抑制不期望的副反应，如过度脱氢和氢解，这些反应会导致积碳形成。

2. 使用金属间化合物：该研究提出了一种热稳定的金属间PtGa催化剂，它既提供了孤立的单原子Pt，也提供了三重Pt集合体。

3. 选择性阻断：通过在催化剂表面沉积Pb，可以选择性地阻断三重Pt集合体，只留下单原子Pt位点活性。

4. 优化催化剂组成：PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下表现出高转化率（30%），优异的选择性（99.6%）和显著的稳定性（96小时内性能无损失）。

这些策略产生了一种催化剂，能有效催化第一和第二个C-H活化，同时抑制第三个，最大限度地减少导致积碳形成的副反应，显著提高了选择性和稳定性。
