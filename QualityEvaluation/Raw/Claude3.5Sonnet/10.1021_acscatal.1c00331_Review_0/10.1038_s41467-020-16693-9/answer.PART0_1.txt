[1] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production"

[2] "Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions"

[3] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation"

[4] "The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH"

[5] "We report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures."

[6] "The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 C for 96 h without lowering the performance."

[7] "The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production to meet increasing global demand. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 600°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. This allows for sufficient propylene yields.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials are commonly used. However, the study introduces a novel PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst with single-atom Pt, which shows superior performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an on-purpose technique for propylene production, addressing the supply reduction caused by the shift to shale-based ethane feedstock in steam crackers.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing severe catalyst deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration in practical applications.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Isolation of Pt atoms: This inhibits undesired side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Use of thermally stable intermetallic compounds: PtGa provides a stable structure for isolated Pt atoms.

3. Modification with appropriate elements: The addition of Pb to PtGa helps block certain Pt sites prone to coke formation while leaving single-atom Pt sites active.

4. Optimizing catalyst structure: The single-atom Pt effectively catalyzes the first and second C-H activations while inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions that lead to coke.

These strategies result in improved selectivity and stability, as demonstrated by the PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst, which maintained high conversion (30%) and selectivity (99.6%) at 600°C for 96 hours without performance degradation.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的重要生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温（约600°C）。这允许获得足够的丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂类型：常用Pt或Cr2O3基材料。然而，研究引入了一种新型的单原子Pt的PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂，表现出优异的性能。

3. 工业应用：PDH是一种定向丙烯生产技术，解决了蒸汽裂解炉转向页岩基乙烷原料导致的供应减少问题。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致严重的催化剂失活。这在实际应用中需要频繁的催化剂再生。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. Pt原子的隔离：这抑制了导致积碳形成的不需要的副反应。

2. 使用热稳定的金属间化合物：PtGa为隔离的Pt原子提供了稳定的结构。

3. 适当元素的改性：向PtGa添加Pb有助于封闭容易形成积碳的某些Pt位点，同时保留单原子Pt位点的活性。

4. 优化催化剂结构：单原子Pt有效催化第一和第二个C-H活化，同时抑制第三个，最大限度地减少导致积碳的副反应。

这些策略提高了选择性和稳定性，如PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂所展示的，在600°C下96小时内保持高转化率（30%）和选择性（99.6%），且性能不降低。
