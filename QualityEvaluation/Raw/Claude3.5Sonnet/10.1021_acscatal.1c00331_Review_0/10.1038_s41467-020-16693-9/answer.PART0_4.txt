[1] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production"

[2] "Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields. However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions"

[3] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further CH(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation"

[4] "For instance, alloying of active main metal (mostly Pt) with a certain inactive metal (mostly typical elements such as Sn) has been a conventional approach to dilute PtPt ensembles and enhance propylene selectivity and stability"

[5] "PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second CH activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production to meet increasing global demand. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 600°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. This allows for sufficient propylene yields.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials are commonly used. Pt-based catalysts are often alloyed with inactive metals like Sn to enhance selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is considered a promising on-purpose technique for propylene production, especially given the reduced supply from traditional steam cracking methods.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing severe catalyst deactivation under the harsh reaction conditions. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration or replacement.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Alloying Pt with inactive metals to dilute PtPt ensembles.
2. Developing single-atom catalysts, such as the PtGaPb/SiO2 catalyst described, which inhibits the third C-H activation that leads to coke formation.
3. Optimizing catalyst design to balance propylene desorption and undesired side reactions.

These approaches aim to improve propylene selectivity and catalyst stability, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，用于满足不断增长的全球需求。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温（约600°C）。这允许获得足够的丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用基于Pt或Cr2O3的材料。Pt基催化剂经常与Sn等惰性金属合金化，以提高选择性和稳定性。

3. 工业应用：PDH被认为是一种有前景的定向丙烯生产技术，特别是在传统蒸汽裂解方法供应减少的情况下。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，在苛刻的反应条件下导致严重的催化剂失活。这需要频繁的催化剂再生或更换。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与惰性金属合金化，以稀释PtPt集合体。
2. 开发单原子催化剂，如所描述的PtGaPb/SiO2催化剂，它抑制导致积碳形成的第三次C-H活化。
3. 优化催化剂设计，平衡丙烯脱附和不良副反应。

这些方法旨在提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性，最终提高PDH过程的效率和可持续性。
