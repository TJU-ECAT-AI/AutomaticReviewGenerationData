Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propylene production, addressing the increasing global demand for this crucial chemical building block. PDH uses Pt- or Cr2O3-based catalysts to convert propane into propylene.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 600°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. This ensures sufficient propylene yields.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based and Cr2O3-based materials are commonly used. The study introduces a novel catalyst: single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa, specifically PtGa-Pb/SiO2.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important due to the shift in feedstock for steam crackers from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane, which has reduced propylene supply.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by causing severe catalyst deactivation. This deactivation, along with sintering, is inevitable under the harsh reaction conditions required for PDH. The formation of coke is a result of undesired side reactions, such as further C-H(C) scissions of propylene.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Using single-atom catalysts: The study demonstrates that single-atom Pt in PtGa effectively catalyzes the first and second C-H activations while inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Catalyst design: The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits high stability and selectivity, maintaining 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600°C for 96 hours without performance degradation.

3. Isolation of active sites: By isolating Pt atoms and blocking certain sites (e.g., Pt3 sites) with Pb, the catalyst becomes more selective and resistant to coke formation.

These strategies aim to improve the balance between propylene desorption and undesired side reactions, thereby enhancing selectivity and stability in the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法，可满足全球对这种关键化学建筑材料日益增长的需求。PDH使用Pt或Cr2O3基催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温（约600°C）。这确保了足够的丙烯产量。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用Pt基和Cr2O3基材料。该研究引入了一种新型催化剂：包含在热稳定金属间化合物PtGa中的单原子Pt，特别是PtGa-Pb/SiO2。

3. 工业应用：由于蒸汽裂解原料从基于石油的石脑油转向基于页岩的乙烷，减少了丙烯供应，PDH变得越来越重要。

焦炭形成通过导致严重的催化剂失活显著影响过程效率。在PDH所需的苛刻反应条件下，这种失活以及烧结是不可避免的。焦炭的形成是由于不需要的副反应，如丙烯的进一步C-H(C)断裂。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 使用单原子催化剂：研究表明，PtGa中的单原子Pt有效地催化第一和第二个C-H活化，同时抑制第三个，最大限度地减少导致焦炭形成的副反应。

2. 催化剂设计：PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂表现出高稳定性和选择性，在600°C下96小时内保持30%的转化率和99.6%的丙烯选择性，性能没有降低。

3. 活性位点的隔离：通过隔离Pt原子并用Pb阻断某些位点（如Pt3位点），催化剂变得更具选择性和抗焦炭形成能力。

这些策略旨在改善丙烯脱附和不需要的副反应之间的平衡，从而提高PDH过程的选择性和稳定性。
