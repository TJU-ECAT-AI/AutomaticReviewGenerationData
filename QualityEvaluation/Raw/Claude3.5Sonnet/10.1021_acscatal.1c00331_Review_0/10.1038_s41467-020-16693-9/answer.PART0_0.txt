[1] "Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is a promising on-purpose technique to satisfy the increasing global demand of propylene production1–3. Owing to the endothermicity, high reaction temperatures (preferably 600 °C) are required to obtain sufficient propylene yields."

[2] "However, severe catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering is inevitable under such harsh conditions; therefore, the catalysts in practical use must be regenerated continuously or in short cycles."

[3] "Generally, selectivity and stability in PDH are determined by the balance between whether the product propylene desorbs or undergoes undesired side reactions, such as further C–H(C) scissions and the subsequent coke formation6–10."

[4] "For Pt-based catalysts, Pt–Pt ensembles are known to be active for over-dehydrogenation of propylene and its hydrogenolysis1. The isolation of Pt atoms is a promising strategy to inhibit these undesired side reactions in PDH11."

[5] "Here, we report that single-atom Pt included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa works as an ultrastable and selective catalyst for PDH at high temperatures. Intermetallic PtGa displays three-hold-Pt ensembles and single Pt atoms isolated by catalytically inert Ga at the surface, the former of which can be selectively blocked and disabled by Pb deposition."

[6] "The PtGa–Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits 30% conversion with 99.6% propylene selectivity at 600 °C for 96 h without lowering the performance. The single-atom Pt well catalyzes the first and second C–H activation, while effectively inhibits the third one, which minimizes the side reactions to coke and drastically improves the selectivity and stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for producing propylene to meet increasing global demand. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 600°C) are required due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.

2. Catalyst types: Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials are commonly used. The study introduces a novel PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst with single-atom Pt sites.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is an on-purpose technique for propylene production, addressing the supply reduction caused by the shift to shale-based ethane feedstock.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing severe catalyst deactivation. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration in practical applications.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Isolation of Pt atoms: This inhibits undesired side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Use of intermetallic compounds: The PtGa intermetallic provides thermal stability and allows for single-atom Pt sites.

3. Selective blocking: Pb deposition is used to selectively block three-fold Pt ensembles, leaving single-atom Pt sites active.

4. Optimized catalyst design: The PtGa-Pb/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates high conversion (30%), excellent selectivity (99.6%), and remarkable stability (96 hours without performance loss) at 600°C.

These strategies result in a catalyst that effectively catalyzes the first and second C-H activations while inhibiting the third, minimizing side reactions and coke formation, thus drastically improving selectivity and stability in the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的生产丙烯的方法，以满足不断增长的全球需求。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：由于反应的吸热性质，需要高温（约600°C）。

2. 催化剂类型：通常使用Pt或Cr2O3基材料。该研究引入了一种新型的PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂，具有单原子Pt位点。

3. 工业应用：PDH是一种定向生产丙烯的技术，解决了由页岩基乙烷原料转变导致的供应减少问题。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响了工艺效率，导致严重的催化剂失活。这在实际应用中需要频繁的催化剂再生。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 隔离Pt原子：这抑制了导致积碳形成的不良副反应。

2. 使用金属间化合物：PtGa金属间化合物提供热稳定性，并允许单原子Pt位点的形成。

3. 选择性阻断：使用Pb沉积选择性地阻断三重Pt集合，保留活性单原子Pt位点。

4. 优化催化剂设计：PtGa-Pb/SiO2催化剂在600°C下表现出高转化率（30%），优异的选择性（99.6%），和显著的稳定性（96小时内性能无损失）。

这些策略结果是催化剂有效地催化第一和第二个C-H活化，同时抑制第三个，最大限度地减少副反应和积碳形成，从而大大提高PDH过程中的选择性和稳定性。
