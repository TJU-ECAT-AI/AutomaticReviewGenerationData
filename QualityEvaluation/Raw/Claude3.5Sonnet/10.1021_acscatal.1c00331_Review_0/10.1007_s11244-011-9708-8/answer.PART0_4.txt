[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years"

[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process. This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."

[3] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."

[4] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."

[5] "Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and assigned to coke on the metal and the support, respectively. Coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic."

[6] "A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces. A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose technique for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s and is making significant contributions to the global propylene supply. The process primarily uses Pt-based catalysts, with PtSn/Al2O3 being a common choice in commercial applications like the Oleflex process.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and gas composition (propane, propylene, and hydrogen concentrations) significantly affect the reaction kinetics and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts, especially those modified with Sn, are widely used due to their high activity and selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is implemented in commercial processes like Oleflex, contributing substantially to propylene production.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a major challenge in PDH, impacting process efficiency by causing rapid catalyst deactivation. Two types of coke are formed: aliphatic coke on the metal surface and aromatic coke on the support. The formation of coke reduces catalyst activity and selectivity, necessitating frequent regeneration cycles.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling gas composition, especially hydrogen concentration, can help reduce coke formation.

2. Catalyst design: Modifying catalysts (e.g., adding Sn to Pt) can help reduce coking rates while maintaining activity and selectivity.

3. Understanding formation mechanisms: Detailed knowledge of coke formation pathways on both metal and support surfaces can guide process optimization and catalyst design.

4. Regeneration techniques: Developing efficient methods to remove coke without damaging the catalyst structure is crucial for maintaining long-term catalyst performance.

5. Kinetic modeling: Developing accurate models of coke formation kinetics can help predict and control coking rates under various operating conditions.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to extend catalyst lifetime, reduce regeneration frequency, and ultimately improve the overall efficiency and economics of the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢法（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产技术，自20世纪80年代开始商业化应用以来，对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。该工艺主要使用基于铂的催化剂，其中PtSn/Al2O3是商业应用中常见的选择，如Oleflex工艺。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：温度、压力和气体组成（丙烷、丙烯和氢气浓度）显著影响反应动力学和积碳形成。

2. 催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂，特别是经锡改性的催化剂，由于其高活性和选择性而被广泛使用。

3. 工业应用：PDH在Oleflex等商业工艺中得到应用，为丙烯生产做出重要贡献。

在基于铂的催化剂上形成积碳是PDH面临的主要挑战，通过导致催化剂快速失活影响工艺效率。形成的积碳有两种类型：金属表面上的脂肪族积碳和载体上的芳香族积碳。积碳的形成降低了催化剂的活性和选择性，需要频繁进行再生循环。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 优化反应条件：控制气体组成，特别是氢气浓度，可以帮助减少积碳形成。

2. 催化剂设计：改性催化剂（如向铂中添加锡）可以帮助减少积碳速率，同时保持活性和选择性。

3. 了解形成机理：对金属和载体表面积碳形成途径的详细了解可以指导工艺优化和催化剂设计。

4. 再生技术：开发高效的方法去除积碳而不损害催化剂结构对维持催化剂长期性能至关重要。

5. 动力学建模：开发准确的积碳形成动力学模型可以帮助预测和控制不同操作条件下的积碳速率。

通过实施这些策略，可以延长催化剂寿命，减少再生频率，最终提高PDH工艺的整体效率和经济性。
