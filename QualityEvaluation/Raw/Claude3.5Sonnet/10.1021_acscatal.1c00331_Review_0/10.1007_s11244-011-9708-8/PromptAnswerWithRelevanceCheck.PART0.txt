Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose technique for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s. It has become a significant contributor to the global propylene supply in recent years.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Catalyst type: Pt-based catalysts are the most popular and are used in commercial processes like Oleflex. These catalysts are often modified with elements like Sn or alkali metals to improve performance.

2. Reaction conditions: Operating conditions significantly affect the rate of coke formation. Temperature is a crucial factor, as it influences coke formation regardless of gas composition.

3. Coke formation: This is a major challenge in PDH, as it quickly deactivates the catalyst. Coke can form on both the metal and support of the catalyst, with different characteristics and impacts.

4. Hydrogen's role: Adding hydrogen to the reaction mixture can reduce the rate of coke formation and slow catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation. However, it cannot remove already-formed coke.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst modification: Adding elements like Sn or alkali metals to Pt catalysts can help reduce coking rates.

2. Support selection: Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can help suppress propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization, reducing coke formation.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions: Carefully controlling temperature and gas composition can help minimize coke formation while maintaining productivity.

4. Hydrogen addition: Including hydrogen in the feed gas can help suppress coke precursor formation, though it won't remove existing coke.

5. Regular regeneration: Implementing efficient regeneration cycles to remove coke and restore catalyst activity is crucial for maintaining process efficiency.

By addressing these factors and implementing appropriate strategies, the efficiency and longevity of PDH catalysts can be improved, enhancing the overall process performance.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产技术，自20世纪80年代以来已实现商业化。近年来，它已成为全球丙烯供应的重要贡献者。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂最受欢迎，并在商业流程（如Oleflex）中使用。这些催化剂通常会通过添加锡或碱金属等元素进行改性以提高性能。

2. 反应条件：操作条件显著影响积炭速率。温度是一个关键因素，因为它影响积炭形成，而不受气体组成的影响。

3. 积炭形成：这是PDH面临的主要挑战，因为它会快速使催化剂失活。积炭可以在催化剂的金属和载体上形成，具有不同的特性和影响。

4. 氢气的作用：向反应混合物中添加氢气可以通过抑制积炭前体的形成来降低积炭速率并减缓催化剂失活。然而，它不能去除已经形成的积炭。

减少积炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂改性：向铂催化剂中添加锡或碱金属等元素可以帮助降低积炭速率。

2. 载体选择：使用弱酸性载体（如SBA-15）可以帮助抑制丙烯脱氢或聚合，从而减少积炭形成。

3. 优化反应条件：仔细控制温度和气体组成可以帮助最小化积炭形成，同时保持生产力。

4. 添加氢气：在进料气中包含氢气可以帮助抑制积炭前体的形成，尽管它不会去除现有的积炭。

5. 定期再生：实施高效的再生循环以去除积炭并恢复催化剂活性对于维持过程效率至关重要。

通过解决这些因素并实施适当的策略，可以提高PDH催化剂的效率和寿命，从而提高整体过程性能。

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s and is making significant contributions to the global propylene supply. The process typically uses Pt-based catalysts, with Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 being common choices.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature is a critical factor affecting coke formation. The gas composition, including propane, propylene, and hydrogen concentrations, also impacts the process efficiency and coke formation rates.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are most popular, often modified with elements like Sn or alkali metals to reduce coking rates. The choice of support material (e.g., Al2O3) also affects catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used in commercial processes like Oleflex for on-purpose propylene production.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by causing rapid catalyst deactivation. Only a small portion of the formed coke is responsible for deactivation, but it necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, reducing overall process efficiency.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst modification: Adding elements like Sn or alkali metals to Pt catalysts can reduce coking rates.

2. Support material selection: Using supports with weak acidity can help suppress propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization, reducing coke formation.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling temperature and gas composition, particularly by adding hydrogen, can help suppress coke precursor formation and reduce coking rates.

4. Periodic regeneration: Although hydrogen cannot remove already-formed coke, periodic regeneration processes can be implemented to restore catalyst activity.

5. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to coking or easier to regenerate can improve overall process efficiency.

By implementing these strategies, PDH processes can achieve better catalyst stability, longer operation times between regenerations, and improved overall efficiency in propylene production.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose technique for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s and is making significant contributions to the global propylene supply. The process primarily uses Pt-based catalysts, with PtSn/Al2O3 being a common choice in commercial applications like the Oleflex process.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature, pressure, and gas composition (propane, propylene, and hydrogen concentrations) significantly affect the reaction kinetics and coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts, especially those modified with Sn, are widely used due to their high activity and selectivity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is implemented in commercial processes like Oleflex, contributing substantially to propylene production.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a major challenge in PDH, impacting process efficiency by causing rapid catalyst deactivation. Two types of coke are formed: aliphatic coke on the metal surface and aromatic coke on the support. The formation of coke reduces catalyst activity and selectivity, necessitating frequent regeneration cycles.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling gas composition, especially hydrogen concentration, can help reduce coke formation.

2. Catalyst design: Modifying catalysts (e.g., adding Sn to Pt) can help reduce coking rates while maintaining activity and selectivity.

3. Understanding formation mechanisms: Detailed knowledge of coke formation pathways on both metal and support surfaces can guide process optimization and catalyst design.

4. Regeneration techniques: Developing efficient methods to remove coke without damaging the catalyst structure is crucial for maintaining long-term catalyst performance.

5. Kinetic modeling: Developing accurate models of coke formation kinetics can help predict and control coking rates under various operating conditions.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to extend catalyst lifetime, reduce regeneration frequency, and ultimately improve the overall efficiency and economics of the PDH process.
