[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."

[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."

[5] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose technique for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s. It has become a significant contributor to the global propylene supply in recent years.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Catalyst type: Pt-based catalysts are the most popular and are used in commercial processes like Oleflex. These catalysts are often modified with elements like Sn or alkali metals to improve performance.

2. Reaction conditions: Operating conditions significantly affect the rate of coke formation. Temperature is a crucial factor, as it influences coke formation regardless of gas composition.

3. Coke formation: This is a major challenge in PDH, as it quickly deactivates the catalyst. Coke can form on both the metal and support of the catalyst, with different characteristics and impacts.

4. Hydrogen's role: Adding hydrogen to the reaction mixture can reduce the rate of coke formation and slow catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation. However, it cannot remove already-formed coke.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst modification: Adding elements like Sn or alkali metals to Pt catalysts can help reduce coking rates.

2. Support selection: Using supports with weak acidity, such as SBA-15, can help suppress propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization, reducing coke formation.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions: Carefully controlling temperature and gas composition can help minimize coke formation while maintaining productivity.

4. Hydrogen addition: Including hydrogen in the feed gas can help suppress coke precursor formation, though it won't remove existing coke.

5. Regular regeneration: Implementing efficient regeneration cycles to remove coke and restore catalyst activity is crucial for maintaining process efficiency.

By addressing these factors and implementing appropriate strategies, the efficiency and longevity of PDH catalysts can be improved, enhancing the overall process performance.

催化丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产技术，自20世纪80年代以来已实现商业化。近年来，它已成为全球丙烯供应的重要贡献者。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂最受欢迎，并在商业流程（如Oleflex）中使用。这些催化剂通常会通过添加锡或碱金属等元素进行改性以提高性能。

2. 反应条件：操作条件显著影响积炭速率。温度是一个关键因素，因为它影响积炭形成，而不受气体组成的影响。

3. 积炭形成：这是PDH面临的主要挑战，因为它会快速使催化剂失活。积炭可以在催化剂的金属和载体上形成，具有不同的特性和影响。

4. 氢气的作用：向反应混合物中添加氢气可以通过抑制积炭前体的形成来降低积炭速率并减缓催化剂失活。然而，它不能去除已经形成的积炭。

减少积炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂改性：向铂催化剂中添加锡或碱金属等元素可以帮助降低积炭速率。

2. 载体选择：使用弱酸性载体（如SBA-15）可以帮助抑制丙烯脱氢或聚合，从而减少积炭形成。

3. 优化反应条件：仔细控制温度和气体组成可以帮助最小化积炭形成，同时保持生产力。

4. 添加氢气：在进料气中包含氢气可以帮助抑制积炭前体的形成，尽管它不会去除现有的积炭。

5. 定期再生：实施高效的再生循环以去除积炭并恢复催化剂活性对于维持过程效率至关重要。

通过解决这些因素并实施适当的策略，可以提高PDH催化剂的效率和寿命，从而提高整体过程性能。
