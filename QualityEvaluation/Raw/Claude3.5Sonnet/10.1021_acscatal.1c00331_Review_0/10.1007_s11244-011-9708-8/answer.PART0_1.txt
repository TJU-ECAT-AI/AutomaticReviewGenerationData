[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process. This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation"

[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."

[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."

[5] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s and is making significant contributions to the global propylene supply. The process typically uses Pt-based catalysts, with Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 being common choices.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature is a critical factor affecting coke formation. The gas composition, including propane, propylene, and hydrogen concentrations, also impacts the process efficiency and coke formation rates.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are most popular, often modified with elements like Sn or alkali metals to reduce coking rates. The choice of support material (e.g., Al2O3) also affects catalyst performance.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used in commercial processes like Oleflex for on-purpose propylene production.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by causing rapid catalyst deactivation. Only a small portion of the formed coke is responsible for deactivation, but it necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, reducing overall process efficiency.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst modification: Adding elements like Sn or alkali metals to Pt catalysts can reduce coking rates.

2. Support material selection: Using supports with weak acidity can help suppress propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization, reducing coke formation.

3. Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling temperature and gas composition, particularly by adding hydrogen, can help suppress coke precursor formation and reduce coking rates.

4. Periodic regeneration: Although hydrogen cannot remove already-formed coke, periodic regeneration processes can be implemented to restore catalyst activity.

5. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts that are more resistant to coking or easier to regenerate can improve overall process efficiency.

By implementing these strategies, PDH processes can achieve better catalyst stability, longer operation times between regenerations, and improved overall efficiency in propylene production.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产方法，自20世纪80年代以来已实现商业化，并对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。该过程通常使用以铂为基础的催化剂，Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3是常见的选择。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：温度是影响积碳形成的关键因素。气体组成，包括丙烷、丙烯和氢气的浓度，也会影响过程效率和积碳形成速率。

2. 催化剂类型：以铂为基础的催化剂最为流行，通常用锡或碱金属等元素改性以降低积碳速率。载体材料的选择（如Al2O3）也会影响催化剂性能。

3. 工业应用：PDH用于商业流程，如Oleflex，用于定向丙烯生产。

积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂快速失活。尽管只有一小部分形成的积碳导致失活，但它需要频繁的催化剂再生，降低了整体过程效率。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂改性：向铂催化剂中添加锡或碱金属等元素可以降低积碳速率。

2. 载体材料选择：使用弱酸性载体可以帮助抑制丙烯脱氢或聚合，减少积碳形成。

3. 优化反应条件：控制温度和气体组成，特别是添加氢气，可以帮助抑制积碳前体的形成并降低积碳速率。

4. 定期再生：虽然氢气不能去除已形成的积碳，但可以实施定期再生过程以恢复催化剂活性。

5. 催化剂设计：开发更耐积碳或更易再生的催化剂可以提高整体过程效率。

通过实施这些策略，PDH过程可以实现更好的催化剂稳定性，延长再生之间的操作时间，并提高丙烯生产的整体效率。
