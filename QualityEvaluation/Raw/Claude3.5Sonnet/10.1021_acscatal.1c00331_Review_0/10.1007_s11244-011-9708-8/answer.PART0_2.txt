[1] "Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years"

[2] "Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process. This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear."

[3] "Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation."

[4] "Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."

[5] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature. They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s and is making significant contributions to the global propylene supply. The process typically uses Pt-based catalysts, with the Oleflex process being a prominent commercial application.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature is a crucial factor affecting coke formation. The composition of the gas feed, particularly the presence of hydrogen, can influence coke formation rates.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are most commonly used, often modified with additives like Sn or alkali metals to improve performance. The choice of support material (e.g., Al2O3) also affects catalyst behavior.

3. Industrial applications: The Oleflex process is a notable commercial application of PDH technology.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a major challenge in PDH, causing rapid catalyst deactivation and thus impacting process efficiency. Only a small portion of the coke formed is responsible for deactivation, but it necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration cycles.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Modifying the Pt catalyst with additives like Sn or alkali metals.
2. Optimizing support materials.
3. Controlling reaction conditions, particularly temperature and gas composition.
4. Adding hydrogen to the feed to suppress coke precursor formation.

Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions, reducing regeneration frequency, and designing more coke-resistant catalysts while maintaining high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation.

催化直接丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种重要的定向丙烯生产方法，自20世纪80年代开始商业化开发，目前对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。该过程通常使用基于铂的催化剂，其中Oleflex工艺是一个突出的商业应用。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：温度是影响积碳形成的关键因素。气体进料的组成，特别是氢气的存在，可以影响积碳形成速率。

2. 催化剂类型：最常用的是基于铂的催化剂，通常通过添加锡或碱金属等添加剂来改善性能。支撑材料的选择（如Al2O3）也会影响催化剂的行为。

3. 工业应用：Oleflex工艺是PDH技术的一个著名商业应用。

基于铂的催化剂上的积碳形成是PDH中的一个主要挑战，导致催化剂快速失活，从而影响过程效率。虽然只有一小部分形成的积碳负责失活，但它需要频繁的催化剂再生循环。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 用锡或碱金属等添加剂改性铂催化剂。
2. 优化支撑材料。
3. 控制反应条件，特别是温度和气体组成。
4. 在进料中添加氢气以抑制积碳前体的形成。

了解积碳形成机制对于优化反应条件、减少再生频率以及设计更耐积碳的催化剂同时保持丙烷脱氢的高活性和选择性至关重要。
