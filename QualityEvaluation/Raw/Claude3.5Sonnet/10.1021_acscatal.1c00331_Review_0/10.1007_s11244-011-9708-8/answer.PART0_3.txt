[3] "Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports."

[4] "The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature."

[5] "They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an on-purpose technique for propylene production that has been commercially developed since the 1980s and is making significant contributions to the global propylene supply. The process involves the use of catalysts, with Pt-based catalysts being the most popular and widely used in commercial applications like the Oleflex process.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: Temperature is a crucial factor affecting coke formation. Gas composition also impacts the process, with hydrogen playing a role in reducing coke formation.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are most common, often modified with elements like Sn or alkali metals to improve performance. The choice of catalyst support is also important.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is used in commercial processes like Oleflex for on-purpose propylene production.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing rapid catalyst deactivation. However, only a small portion of the formed coke is responsible for this deactivation. 

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Modifying Pt catalysts with elements like Sn or alkali metals.
2. Optimizing catalyst supports.
3. Controlling reaction conditions, particularly temperature and gas composition.
4. Adding hydrogen to the reaction mixture to suppress coke precursor formation.

It's important to note that while hydrogen can reduce the rate of coke formation, it cannot remove coke that has already formed on the catalyst. Therefore, periodic catalyst regeneration is still necessary for maintaining process efficiency.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种有目的的丙烯生产技术，自20世纪80年代开始商业化，现在对全球丙烯供应做出了重大贡献。该过程涉及使用催化剂，其中基于铂的催化剂最为常见，广泛应用于商业应用，如Oleflex工艺。

PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：温度是影响积碳形成的关键因素。气体组成也影响该过程，氢气在减少积碳形成中起着重要作用。

2. 催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂最为常见，通常通过添加锡或碱金属等元素来改善性能。催化剂载体的选择也很重要。

3. 工业应用：PDH用于Oleflex等商业工艺中，用于有目的的丙烯生产。

基于铂催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂快速失活。然而，只有一小部分形成的积碳负责这种失活。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 用锡或碱金属等元素修饰铂催化剂。
2. 优化催化剂载体。
3. 控制反应条件，特别是温度和气体组成。
4. 向反应混合物中添加氢气以抑制积碳前体的形成。

需要注意的是，虽然氢气可以减少积碳形成的速率，但它无法去除已经在催化剂上形成的积碳。因此，定期进行催化剂再生仍然是保持过程效率的必要措施。
