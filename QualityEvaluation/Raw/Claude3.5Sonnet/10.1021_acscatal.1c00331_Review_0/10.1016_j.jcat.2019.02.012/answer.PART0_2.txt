[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species"

[3] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[5] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[6] "The selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH typically operates at high temperatures (around 550°C) under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: 
   - Traditional industrial catalysts: CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin process) and Pt/Al2O3 (Oleflex process)
   - Emerging alternative: ZrO2-based catalysts

3. Industrial applications: PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production, offering high propene selectivity.

4. Active sites: Coordinatively unsaturated metal cations (e.g., Zrcus in ZrO2) are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation.

5. Catalyst structure effects: Monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity and selectivity than tetragonal ZrO2. Smaller crystallite sizes generally lead to higher propene formation rates.

Regarding coke formation on Pt-based catalysts:

1. Impact on process efficiency: Coke formation decreases catalyst activity and selectivity over time.

2. Mitigation strategies:
   - Catalyst regeneration: Pt/Al2O3 catalysts require treatment under a chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species.
   - Alternative catalysts: ZrO2-based catalysts are being developed as more coke-resistant alternatives.
   - Optimizing catalyst structure: Increasing the ratio of active sites (e.g., Zrcus) to coke-forming sites can improve selectivity and reduce coking.

3. Improving catalyst regeneration:
   - Developing catalysts with better stability and easier regeneration processes.
   - Exploring new materials and structures that are less prone to coking.

Overall, research is focused on developing more efficient, stable, and environmentally friendly catalysts for PDH, with ZrO2-based materials showing promise as alternatives to traditional Pt and Cr-based catalysts.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH通常在高温（约550°C）和非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：
   - 传统工业催化剂：CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin工艺）和Pt/Al2O3（Oleflex工艺）
   - 新兴替代品：基于ZrO2的催化剂

3. 工业应用：PDH是最大的定向丙烯生产工艺之一，提供高丙烯选择性。

4. 活性位点：配位不饱和金属阳离子（如ZrO2中的Zrcus）被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。

5. 催化剂结构效应：单斜相ZrO2表现出比四方相ZrO2更高的活性和选择性。晶粒尺寸越小，通常丙烯形成速率越高。

关于Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成：

1. 对工艺效率的影响：积碳形成会随时间降低催化剂活性和选择性。

2. 缓解策略：
   - 催化剂再生：Pt/Al2O3催化剂需要在氯气氛围下处理以重新分散铂物种。
   - 替代催化剂：正在开发基于ZrO2的催化剂作为更耐积碳的替代品。
   - 优化催化剂结构：增加活性位点（如Zrcus）与积碳形成位点的比例可以提高选择性并减少积碳。

3. 改进催化剂再生：
   - 开发稳定性更好、再生过程更简单的催化剂。
   - 探索不易积碳的新材料和结构。

总的来说，研究重点是开发更高效、更稳定和更环保的PDH催化剂，其中基于ZrO2的材料作为传统Pt和Cr基催化剂的替代品显示出很大潜力。
