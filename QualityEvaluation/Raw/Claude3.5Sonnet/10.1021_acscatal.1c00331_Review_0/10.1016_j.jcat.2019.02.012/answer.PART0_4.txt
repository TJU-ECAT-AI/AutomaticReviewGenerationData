[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[3] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[5] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition."

[6] "For all materials, a near to zero selectivity to cracking products will be achieved when the conversion approaches to zero. The selectivity-conversion dependences can be interpreted as follows. Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations. They include formation of carbon deposits over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples"

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures (around 550°C) are typically used. The process is conducted under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Traditionally, CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin process) and Pt/Al2O3 (Oleflex process) are the main industrial catalysts. However, ZrO2-based catalysts have been developed as environmentally friendly and cost-efficient alternatives.

3. Industrial applications: PDH offers high propene selectivity and is one of the largest on-purpose propene production processes.

4. Active sites: For ZrO2 catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are believed to be the active sites. These can be created by doping, high-temperature reduction, or loading small amounts of metal nanoparticles.

5. Reaction mechanism: Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations, including coke formation and cracking reactions.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency. Pt/Al2O3 catalysts require treatment under a chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, which is likely related to coke formation and deactivation.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Developing alternative catalysts: ZrO2-based catalysts show promise as they are less prone to coking.

2. Optimizing catalyst structure: Smaller crystallite sizes in ZrO2 catalysts lead to higher activity and lower coke formation.

3. Controlling reaction conditions: Lower conversions generally lead to less coke formation.

4. Understanding coke formation mechanisms: The study shows that different active sites are responsible for propene formation and coke formation, which could inform catalyst design to minimize coking.

5. Periodic regeneration: Although not explicitly mentioned in the text, industrial processes typically include periodic catalyst regeneration to remove coke deposits.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：通常使用高温（约550°C）。该过程在非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：传统上，CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin工艺）和Pt/Al2O3（Oleflex工艺）是主要的工业催化剂。然而，ZrO2基催化剂已被开发为环境友好和成本效益高的替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH提供高丙烯选择性，是最大的定向丙烯生产工艺之一。

4. 活性位点：对于ZrO2催化剂，配位不饱和的锆阳离子（Zrcus）被认为是活性位点。这些可以通过掺杂、高温还原或负载少量金属纳米粒子来创建。

5. 反应机理：丙烯直接由丙烷形成，然后undergo连续转化，包括焦炭形成和裂解反应。

Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成显著影响过程效率。Pt/Al2O3催化剂需要在氯气氛围下处理以重新分散铂物种，这可能与焦炭形成和失活有关。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 开发替代催化剂：ZrO2基催化剂显示出前景，因为它们不太容易结焦。

2. 优化催化剂结构：ZrO2催化剂中较小的晶粒尺寸导致更高的活性和更低的焦炭形成。

3. 控制反应条件：较低的转化率通常导致较少的焦炭形成。

4. 理解焦炭形成机制：研究表明，不同的活性位点负责丙烯形成和焦炭形成，这可以为催化剂设计提供信息以最小化结焦。

5. 定期再生：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但工业过程通常包括定期催化剂再生以去除焦炭沉积物。
