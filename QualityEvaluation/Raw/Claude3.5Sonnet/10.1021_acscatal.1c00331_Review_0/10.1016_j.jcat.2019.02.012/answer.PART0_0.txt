[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species, while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

[3] "As this amount correlates with the concentration of generated Zrcus sites, a correlation between the rate of propene formation and the concentration of removed oxygen species can exist if Zrcus is responsible for propane activation."

[4] "For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2."

[5] "In addition, the selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propene production, offering high propene selectivity. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 550°C) and low pressures to favor the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Catalyst types: The main industrial catalysts are CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin process) and Pt/Al2O3 (Oleflex process). However, these catalysts have drawbacks - Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and requires chlorine treatment, while Cr(VI) poses health risks.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is one of the largest on-purpose propene production processes, helping to meet the growing demand for propene that cannot be fulfilled by traditional production methods.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue affecting process efficiency, particularly for Pt-based catalysts. Coke deposits on the catalyst surface, reducing its activity and selectivity over time.

5. Mitigation strategies: To address coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration:
   - Catalyst design: Developing catalysts with higher resistance to coking, such as ZrO2-based materials.
   - Optimizing reaction conditions: Controlling temperature and feed composition to minimize coke formation.
   - Periodic regeneration: Implementing efficient regeneration cycles to burn off coke deposits.
   - Novel catalyst structures: Exploring materials like monoclinic ZrO2, which show higher propene selectivity and potentially lower coking tendency compared to tetragonal ZrO2.

The research on ZrO2-based catalysts, particularly the role of Zrcus sites and the effect of crystal structure (monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size, provides new insights for designing more efficient PDH catalysts with improved activity and reduced coking tendency.

催化直接脱氢丙烷(PDH)是一种重要的定向丙烯生产方法，具有高丙烯选择性。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温(约550°C)和低压下进行，以有利于脱氢反应。

2. 催化剂类型：主要的工业催化剂是CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin工艺）和Pt/Al2O3（Oleflex工艺）。然而，这些催化剂都有缺点 - Pt/Al2O3昂贵且需要氯气处理，而Cr(VI)存在健康风险。

3. 工业应用：PDH是最大的定向丙烯生产工艺之一，有助于满足传统生产方法无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。

4. 结焦形成：这是影响工艺效率的主要问题，尤其是对于基于Pt的催化剂。焦炭沉积在催化剂表面，随时间降低其活性和选择性。

5. 缓解策略：为解决结焦问题并改善催化剂再生：
   - 催化剂设计：开发具有更高抗结焦能力的催化剂，如基于ZrO2的材料。
   - 优化反应条件：控制温度和进料组成以最小化结焦形成。
   - 定期再生：实施高效的再生周期以燃烧掉焦炭沉积物。
   - 新型催化剂结构：探索如单斜ZrO2等材料，与四方ZrO2相比，它们表现出更高的丙烯选择性和潜在的更低结焦倾向。

关于ZrO2基催化剂的研究，特别是Zrcus位点的作用以及晶体结构（单斜vs四方）和晶粒尺寸的影响，为设计更高效的PDH催化剂提供了新的见解，以提高活性并减少结焦倾向。
