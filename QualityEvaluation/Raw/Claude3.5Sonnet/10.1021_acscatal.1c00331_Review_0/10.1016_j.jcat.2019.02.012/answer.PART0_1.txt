[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species"

[3] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[4] "Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh."

[5] "The selectivity to propene over m-ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 550°C) under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Industrial processes mainly use CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) and Pt/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. However, ZrO2-based catalysts have been developed as environmentally friendly and cost-efficient alternatives.

3. Industrial applications: PDH offers high propene selectivity and is one of the largest on-purpose propene production processes.

4. Active sites: For ZrO2 catalysts, coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Catalyst design: Developing catalysts with a higher ratio of active sites to coke-forming sites, as demonstrated by monoclinic ZrO2 compared to tetragonal ZrO2.

2. Catalyst treatment: For Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, treatment under a chlorine atmosphere helps re-disperse platinum species, potentially reducing coke formation.

3. Alternative catalysts: ZrO2-based catalysts show promise in reducing coke formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity.

4. Catalyst modification: Doping zirconia with metal oxides or loading small amounts of metal nanoparticles (e.g., Ru, Rh) can create active sites while potentially minimizing coke formation.

These strategies aim to balance high catalytic activity with reduced coke formation, thereby improving overall process efficiency and catalyst lifetime in PDH reactions.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（约550°C）非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：工业过程主要使用CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin）和Pt/Al2O3（Oleflex）催化剂。然而，ZrO2基催化剂已被开发为环境友好和成本效益高的替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH提供高丙烯选择性，是最大的定向丙烯生产工艺之一。

4. 活性位点：对于ZrO2催化剂，配位不饱和的锆阳离子（Zrcus）被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。

在Pt基催化剂上的积炭形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。减少积炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 催化剂设计：开发具有更高活性位点与积炭形成位点比率的催化剂，如单斜ZrO2相比四方ZrO2所展示的那样。

2. 催化剂处理：对于Pt/Al2O3催化剂，在氯气氛围下处理有助于重新分散铂物种，可能减少积炭形成。

3. 替代催化剂：ZrO2基催化剂在减少积炭形成的同时保持高活性和选择性方面显示出潜力。

4. 催化剂改性：用金属氧化物掺杂氧化锆或负载少量金属纳米粒子（如Ru，Rh）可以创建活性位点，同时可能最小化积炭形成。

这些策略旨在平衡高催化活性与减少积炭形成，从而提高PDH反应的整体过程效率和催化剂寿命。
