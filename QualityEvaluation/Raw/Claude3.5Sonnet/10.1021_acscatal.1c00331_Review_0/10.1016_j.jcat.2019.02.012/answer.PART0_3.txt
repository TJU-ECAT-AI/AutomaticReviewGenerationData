[1] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively"

[2] "Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species"

[3] "Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes"

[4] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJmol1."

[5] "For all materials, a near to zero selectivity to cracking products will be achieved when the conversion approaches to zero. The selectivity-conversion dependences can be interpreted as follows. Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations. They include formation of carbon deposits over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples"

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important on-purpose method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 550°C) to achieve sufficient conversion. 

2. Catalyst types: Industrial processes mainly use CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or Pt/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. However, ZrO2-based catalysts have been developed as environmentally friendly and cost-efficient alternatives.

3. Industrial applications: PDH offers high propene selectivity and is one of the largest on-purpose propene production processes.

4. Coke formation: This is a significant issue for Pt-based catalysts. It impacts process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst.

5. Mitigation strategies: 
   - Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are treated under a chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species.
   - Development of alternative catalysts like ZrO2-based materials that may have different coking behaviors.
   - Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize coke formation.

6. Catalyst regeneration: For Pt-based catalysts, this involves treatment in a chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species.

The process efficiency is significantly impacted by coke formation, as it leads to catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate this include developing new catalyst formulations (like ZrO2-based catalysts), optimizing reaction conditions, and improving regeneration processes. The activation energy for the PDH reaction is around 150 kJ/mol, regardless of the catalyst used, suggesting similar reaction mechanisms across different catalysts.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种重要的定向丙烯生产方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（约550°C）下运行，以实现足够的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：工业过程主要使用CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin）或Pt/Al2O3（Oleflex）催化剂。然而，ZrO2基催化剂已被开发为环境友好和成本效益高的替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH提供高丙烯选择性，是最大的定向丙烯生产过程之一。

4. 焦炭形成：这是Pt基催化剂的一个重大问题。它通过使催化剂失活影响过程效率。

5. 缓解策略：
   - Pt/Al2O3催化剂在氯气氛围下处理以重新分散铂物种。
   - 开发可能具有不同结焦行为的替代催化剂，如ZrO2基材料。
   - 优化反应条件以最小化焦炭形成。

6. 催化剂再生：对于Pt基催化剂，这涉及在氯气氛围下处理以重新分散铂物种。

焦炭形成显著影响过程效率，因为它导致催化剂失活。缓解这一问题的策略包括开发新的催化剂配方（如ZrO2基催化剂），优化反应条件，以及改进再生过程。PDH反应的活化能约为150 kJ/mol，无论使用何种催化剂，这表明不同催化剂的反应机理相似。
