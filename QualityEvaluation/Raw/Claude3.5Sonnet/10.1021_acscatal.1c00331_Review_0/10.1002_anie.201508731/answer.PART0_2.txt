Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) to achieve sufficient conversion.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts include CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges due to toxicity (chromium) or limited availability and high cost (platinum). The study introduces novel ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites, offering comparable activity and selectivity to industrial CrOx catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important, with production via this method reaching 5 million metric tons in 2012, about 6.25% of total propene production.

The study does not directly address coke formation on Pt-based catalysts. However, it mentions that coke is a side product in the novel ZrO2-based catalysts. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study demonstrates that coke can be completely removed within 5 minutes using an air stream at the PDH temperature. This suggests that periodic oxidative regeneration can effectively maintain catalyst activity.

The research presents an alternative approach to catalyst design, focusing on bulk metal oxides with lattice defects as active sites, which may offer improved performance and durability compared to traditional supported catalysts.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的成熟大规模工艺。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（550-625°C）下运行，以达到足够的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂包括负载在Al2O3上的CrOx或PtSn物种。然而，这些催化剂面临毒性（铬）或有限供应和高成本（铂）的挑战。该研究引入了新型ZrO2基催化剂，其中配位不饱和的Zr阳离子（Zrcus）作为活性位点，提供了与工业CrOx催化剂相当的活性和选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH变得越来越重要，2012年通过这种方法的产量达到500万公吨，约占丙烯总产量的6.25%。

该研究没有直接涉及Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成问题。然而，它提到积碳是新型ZrO2基催化剂的副产物。为了减少积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，研究表明可以在PDH温度下使用空气流在5分钟内完全去除积碳。这表明定期的氧化再生可以有效维持催化剂活性。

该研究提出了一种催化剂设计的替代方法，着重于具有晶格缺陷作为活性位点的块状金属氧化物，这可能比传统的负载型催化剂提供更好的性能和耐久性。
