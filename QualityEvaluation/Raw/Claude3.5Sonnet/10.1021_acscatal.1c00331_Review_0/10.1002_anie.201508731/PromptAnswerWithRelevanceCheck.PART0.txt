[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene is an established large-scale process that, however, faces challenges, particularly in catalyst development; these are the toxicity of chromium compounds, high cost of platinum, and catalyst durability."

[2] "Commercial catalysts with CrOx or PtSn species typically supported on Al2O33 are either toxic or have a limited availability of the active components."

[3] "Herein, we elucidated and provide general fundamentals for designing alternative catalysts composed of unconventional PDH components, in which lattice defects of the support are the catalytically active sites."

[4] "We postulate that Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen participate in the CH bond activation resulting in the formation of ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. After the elimination of the β-hydrogen, propene and hydrogen are formed."

[5] "The main side products were light hydrocarbons and coke. The coke could be completely removed within only 5min by an air stream at the PDH temperature."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts use CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges due to toxicity (Cr) or limited availability and high cost (Pt). The study introduces novel ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for propene production, with several plants under construction. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons out of 80 million metric tons total propene production.

4. Reaction mechanism: For ZrO2-based catalysts, Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen activate the C-H bond, forming ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. Propene and hydrogen are then formed through β-hydrogen elimination.

Coke formation is a significant issue for Pt-based catalysts, impacting process efficiency. The study doesn't provide detailed information on coke formation for Pt catalysts. However, for the novel ZrO2-based catalysts, coke is mentioned as a side product along with light hydrocarbons.

To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study demonstrates a strategy using oxidative regeneration cycles. For the Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx catalyst, coke could be completely removed within 5 minutes using an air stream at the PDH temperature. This approach allows for efficient catalyst regeneration and maintains catalyst performance over multiple PDH/regeneration cycles.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的成熟大规模工艺。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（550-625°C）和非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂使用负载在Al2O3上的CrOx或PtSn物种。然而，这些催化剂面临毒性（Cr）或有限可用性和高成本（Pt）的挑战。该研究引入了新型ZrO2基催化剂，其中配位不饱和的Zr阳离子（Zrcus）作为活性位点。

3. 工业应用：PDH在丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，目前有几家工厂正在建设中。2012年，PDH在总计8000万公吨的丙烯生产中占约500万公吨。

4. 反应机理：对于ZrO2基催化剂，Zrcus和相邻的晶格氧活化C-H键，形成ZrcusC3H7和OH表面物种。然后通过β-氢消除形成丙烯和氢。

焦炭形成是Pt基催化剂的一个重要问题，影响工艺效率。该研究没有提供关于Pt催化剂焦炭形成的详细信息。然而，对于新型ZrO2基催化剂，焦炭被提及为轻烃的副产物。

为了减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，该研究展示了一种使用氧化再生循环的策略。对于Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx催化剂，可以在PDH温度下使用空气流在5分钟内完全去除焦炭。这种方法允许高效的催化剂再生，并在多个PDH/再生循环中保持催化剂性能。

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) to achieve sufficient conversion.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts include CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges due to toxicity (chromium) or limited availability and high cost (platinum). The study introduces novel ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites, offering comparable activity and selectivity to industrial CrOx catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important, with production via this method reaching 5 million metric tons in 2012, about 6.25% of total propene production.

The study does not directly address coke formation on Pt-based catalysts. However, it mentions that coke is a side product in the novel ZrO2-based catalysts. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study demonstrates that coke can be completely removed within 5 minutes using an air stream at the PDH temperature. This suggests that periodic oxidative regeneration can effectively maintain catalyst activity.

The research presents an alternative approach to catalyst design, focusing on bulk metal oxides with lattice defects as active sites, which may offer improved performance and durability compared to traditional supported catalysts.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale industrial process for propene production. It involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts include CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges such as toxicity (chromium) and high cost (platinum). The study proposes alternative ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry, with propene production via PDH amounting to about 5 million metric tons in 2012, out of a total 80 million metric tons of propene produced.

4. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves CH bond activation by Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen, forming ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species, followed by β-hydrogen elimination to produce propene and hydrogen.

Coke formation is a significant issue in PDH, impacting process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. The study mentions coke as one of the main side products. To mitigate its impact and improve catalyst regeneration, the researchers implemented a strategy of oxidative regeneration cycles. They demonstrated that coke could be completely removed within just 5 minutes by passing an air stream at the PDH reaction temperature. This rapid regeneration allows for maintaining catalyst activity over extended periods, as shown in the 60 PDH/regeneration cycles conducted over approximately 240 hours on stream.
