Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale industrial process for propene production. It involves the removal of hydrogen from propane to form propene. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts include CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges such as toxicity (chromium) and high cost (platinum). The study proposes alternative ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry, with propene production via PDH amounting to about 5 million metric tons in 2012, out of a total 80 million metric tons of propene produced.

4. Reaction mechanism: The proposed mechanism involves CH bond activation by Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen, forming ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species, followed by β-hydrogen elimination to produce propene and hydrogen.

Coke formation is a significant issue in PDH, impacting process efficiency by deactivating the catalyst. The study mentions coke as one of the main side products. To mitigate its impact and improve catalyst regeneration, the researchers implemented a strategy of oxidative regeneration cycles. They demonstrated that coke could be completely removed within just 5 minutes by passing an air stream at the PDH reaction temperature. This rapid regeneration allows for maintaining catalyst activity over extended periods, as shown in the 60 PDH/regeneration cycles conducted over approximately 240 hours on stream.

丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)是一种成熟的大规模工业丙烯生产工艺。它涉及从丙烷中去除氢以形成丙烯。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温(550-625°C)下运行，以克服热力学限制。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂包括负载在Al2O3上的CrOx或PtSn物种。然而，这些催化剂面临诸如毒性(铬)和高成本(铂)等挑战。该研究提出了以ZrO2为基础的替代催化剂，其中配位不饱和的Zr阳离子(Zrcus)作为活性位点。

3. 工业应用：PDH在化学工业中变得越来越重要，2012年通过PDH生产的丙烯约为500万公吨，占总丙烯产量8000万公吨的一部分。

4. 反应机理：提出的机理涉及Zrcus和相邻的晶格氧参与CH键活化，形成ZrcusC3H7和OH表面物种，随后β-氢消除产生丙烯和氢气。

焦炭形成是PDH中的一个重要问题，通过使催化剂失活影响工艺效率。研究提到焦炭是主要副产品之一。为了减轻其影响并改善催化剂再生，研究人员实施了氧化再生循环策略。他们证明，在PDH反应温度下通入空气流，仅需5分钟就能完全去除焦炭。这种快速再生允许在长时间运行中保持催化剂活性，如研究中展示的在约240小时内进行的60次PDH/再生循环。
