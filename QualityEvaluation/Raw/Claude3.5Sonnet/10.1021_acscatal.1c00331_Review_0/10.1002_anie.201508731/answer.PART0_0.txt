Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts use CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges due to toxicity (Cr) or limited availability and high cost (Pt). The study introduces novel ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for propene production, with several plants under construction. In 2012, PDH accounted for about 5 million metric tons out of 80 million metric tons total propene production.

4. Reaction mechanism: For ZrO2-based catalysts, Zrcus and neighboring lattice oxygen activate the C-H bond, forming ZrcusC3H7 and OH surface species. Propene and hydrogen are then formed through β-hydrogen elimination.

Coke formation is a significant issue for Pt-based catalysts, impacting process efficiency. The study doesn't provide detailed information on coke formation for Pt catalysts. However, for the novel ZrO2-based catalysts, coke is mentioned as a side product along with light hydrocarbons.

To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study demonstrates a strategy using oxidative regeneration cycles. For the Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx catalyst, coke could be completely removed within 5 minutes using an air stream at the PDH temperature. This approach allows for efficient catalyst regeneration and maintains catalyst performance over multiple PDH/regeneration cycles.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的成熟大规模工艺。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（550-625°C）和非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂使用负载在Al2O3上的CrOx或PtSn物种。然而，这些催化剂面临毒性（Cr）或有限可用性和高成本（Pt）的挑战。该研究引入了新型ZrO2基催化剂，其中配位不饱和的Zr阳离子（Zrcus）作为活性位点。

3. 工业应用：PDH在丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，目前有几家工厂正在建设中。2012年，PDH在总计8000万公吨的丙烯生产中占约500万公吨。

4. 反应机理：对于ZrO2基催化剂，Zrcus和相邻的晶格氧活化C-H键，形成ZrcusC3H7和OH表面物种。然后通过β-氢消除形成丙烯和氢。

焦炭形成是Pt基催化剂的一个重要问题，影响工艺效率。该研究没有提供关于Pt催化剂焦炭形成的详细信息。然而，对于新型ZrO2基催化剂，焦炭被提及为轻烃的副产物。

为了减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，该研究展示了一种使用氧化再生循环的策略。对于Cu(0.05wt%)/LaZrOx催化剂，可以在PDH温度下使用空气流在5分钟内完全去除焦炭。这种方法允许高效的催化剂再生，并在多个PDH/再生循环中保持催化剂性能。
