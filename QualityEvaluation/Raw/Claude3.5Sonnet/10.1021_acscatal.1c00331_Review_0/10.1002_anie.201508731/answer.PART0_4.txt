The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established industrial process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) to achieve sufficient conversion.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts use CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges due to toxicity (chromium) or limited availability and high cost (platinum). The research presents alternative ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important, with propene production via this method reaching about 5 million metric tons in 2012, representing a significant portion of total propene production.

4. Process efficiency: The efficiency is impacted by factors such as catalyst activity, selectivity, and durability.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, is a significant issue in PDH. While the document doesn't specifically discuss coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, it mentions coke as a side product. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study demonstrates a strategy using air stream oxidation at the PDH temperature, which completely removed coke within 5 minutes. This quick regeneration process helps maintain catalyst activity and improve overall process efficiency.

The research also presents novel approaches to catalyst design, focusing on bulk metal oxides with lattice defects as active sites, which may offer alternatives to traditional supported catalysts and potentially address some of the challenges associated with coke formation and catalyst regeneration.

丙烷的催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种成熟的工业丙烯生产工艺。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（550-625°C）下进行，以获得足够的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂使用负载在Al2O3上的CrOx或PtSn物种。然而，由于毒性（铬）或有限的可用性和高成本（铂），这些催化剂面临挑战。该研究提出了以配位不饱和Zr阳离子（Zrcus）为活性位点的替代ZrO2基催化剂。

3. 工业应用：PDH变得越来越重要，2012年通过这种方法生产的丙烯达到约500万公吨，占丙烯总产量的重要部分。

4. 工艺效率：效率受到催化剂活性、选择性和耐久性等因素的影响。

催化剂上的积碳形成，包括基于Pt的催化剂，是PDH中的一个重要问题。虽然文件没有具体讨论Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成，但它提到积碳是一种副产品。为了减少积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，该研究展示了一种在PDH温度下使用空气流氧化的策略，可以在5分钟内完全去除积碳。这种快速再生过程有助于维持催化剂活性并提高整体工艺效率。

该研究还提出了催化剂设计的新方法，聚焦于以晶格缺陷为活性位点的块状金属氧化物，这可能为传统负载型催化剂提供替代方案，并可能解决一些与积碳形成和催化剂再生相关的挑战。
