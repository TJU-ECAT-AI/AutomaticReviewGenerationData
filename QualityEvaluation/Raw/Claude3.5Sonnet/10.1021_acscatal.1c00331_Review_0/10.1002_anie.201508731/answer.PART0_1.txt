The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an established large-scale process for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) under non-oxidative conditions.

2. Catalyst types: Conventional catalysts use CrOx or PtSn species supported on Al2O3. However, these face challenges due to toxicity (Cr) or limited availability and high cost (Pt). The study introduces novel ZrO2-based catalysts with coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) as active sites, showing comparable activity and selectivity to industrial CrOx catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry. In 2012, it accounted for about 5 million metric tons out of the total 80 million metric tons of propene production.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts is a significant issue impacting process efficiency. While the study focuses more on ZrO2-based catalysts, it mentions that coke is one of the main side products in the PDH process. To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the study demonstrates a strategy of oxidative regeneration. The coke formed on the catalyst can be completely removed within only 5 minutes by passing an air stream at the PDH reaction temperature. This quick regeneration process allows for efficient cyclic operation of the catalyst, maintaining its activity over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种用于生产丙烯的成熟大规模工艺。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（550-625°C）下在非氧化条件下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：传统催化剂使用负载在Al2O3上的CrOx或PtSn物种。然而，这些催化剂面临毒性（Cr）或有限供应和高成本（Pt）的挑战。该研究引入了新型ZrO2基催化剂，其中配位不饱和的Zr阳离子（Zrcus）作为活性位点，显示出与工业CrOx催化剂相当的活性和选择性。

3. 工业应用：PDH在化学工业中变得越来越重要。2012年，在总计8000万公吨的丙烯产量中，PDH约占500万公吨。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成是影响工艺效率的一个重要问题。虽然该研究更多地关注ZrO2基催化剂，但它提到积碳是PDH过程中的主要副产品之一。为了减少积碳形成并改善催化剂再生，该研究展示了一种氧化再生策略。在催化剂上形成的积碳可以通过在PDH反应温度下通入空气流，在仅5分钟内完全去除。这种快速再生过程允许催化剂进行高效的循环操作，在多个脱氢-再生循环中保持其活性。
