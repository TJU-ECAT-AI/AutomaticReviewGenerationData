[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature."

[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."

[5] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades. However, there is still much room for further improvements of Pt catalysts in PDH. In particular, the coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability."

[6] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site. Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."

[7] "In fact, there are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH. The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation. For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization. Therefore, the modification of nature of support is a useful way to improve coke resistance."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising and effective method for producing propylene on an industrial scale. The process involves converting propane (C3H8) to propene (C3H6) and hydrogen (H2). 

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic, requiring temperatures above 500°C. Propene yields can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature.

2. Catalyst types: PDH catalysts are primarily divided into metal and metal oxide categories. Platinum and chromium oxide are the most representative catalysts, respectively. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used in industrial applications, such as the Oleflex commercial PDH process.

3. Industrial applications: PDH has been implemented in industrial processes like Oleflex (using Pt-based catalysts) and Catofin (using chromium oxide catalysts).

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by:

1. Undermining catalytic performance and stability
2. Covering metal catalysts and blocking access to active sites
3. Complicating catalyst regeneration

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Cofeeding reductive gases (e.g., hydrogen) with propane
2. Alloying platinum with second metals (e.g., Sn, Cu, Zn) to reduce coke formation
3. Modifying catalyst supports to control coke formation, such as addressing acid sites that favor side reactions like polymerization
4. Optimizing catalyst particle size and geometry
5. Developing more effective regeneration techniques to remove coke without damaging the catalyst

These strategies aim to enhance the overall efficiency and longevity of Pt-based catalysts in PDH processes.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种有前景且有效的工业规模生产丙烯的方法。该过程涉及将丙烷（C3H8）转化为丙烯（C3H6）和氢气（H2）。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是高度吸热的，需要500°C以上的温度。通过降低丙烷分压或提高温度可以增加丙烯产量。

2. 催化剂类型：PDH催化剂主要分为金属和金属氧化物两类。铂和铬氧化物分别是最具代表性的催化剂。铂基催化剂在工业应用中被广泛使用，如Oleflex商业PDH工艺。

3. 工业应用：PDH已在Oleflex（使用铂基催化剂）和Catofin（使用铬氧化物催化剂）等工业过程中实施。

铂基催化剂上的焦炭形成对过程效率的显著影响包括：

1. 降低催化性能和稳定性
2. 覆盖金属催化剂并阻塞活性位点
3. 使催化剂再生变得复杂

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 与丙烷共同进料还原性气体（如氢气）
2. 将铂与第二种金属（如Sn、Cu、Zn）合金化以减少焦炭形成
3. 修改催化剂载体以控制焦炭形成，例如处理有利于聚合等副反应的酸性位点
4. 优化催化剂粒子大小和几何形状
5. 开发更有效的再生技术，在不损坏催化剂的情况下去除焦炭

这些策略旨在提高铂基催化剂在PDH过程中的整体效率和寿命。
