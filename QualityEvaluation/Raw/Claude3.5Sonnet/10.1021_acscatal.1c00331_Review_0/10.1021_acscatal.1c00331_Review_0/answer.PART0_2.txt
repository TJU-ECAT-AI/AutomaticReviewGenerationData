[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature."

[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."

[5] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."

[6] "The coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability. The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."

[7] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site. Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."

[8] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[9] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation. For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production. It involves the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen. The process is endothermic and typically operates at temperatures above 500°C. Reaction conditions can be optimized by lowering propane partial pressure or increasing temperature to improve propene yields.

Two main types of catalysts are used in PDH: metal (primarily platinum) and metal oxide (primarily chromium oxide). Platinum-based catalysts are widely used due to their high selectivity and durability, and have been implemented in commercial processes like UOP's Oleflex technology.

However, a major challenge in PDH is coke formation on catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones. Coke deposits cover active sites, reducing catalyst performance and stability. The complex reaction network in PDH leads to various intermediates that can form coke at high temperatures.

To mitigate coke formation and improve process efficiency, several strategies can be employed:

1. Cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane
2. Alloying platinum with other metals (e.g., Sn, Cu, Zn) to reduce coke formation
3. Modifying catalyst supports to control coke formation, such as addressing acid sites that promote side reactions
4. Optimizing catalyst particle size

Catalyst regeneration is challenging, often requiring extensive time and potentially causing catalyst agglomeration. Improving coke resistance and developing more efficient regeneration methods are crucial for enhancing the overall PDH process.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法。它涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。该过程是吸热的，通常在500°C以上的温度下进行。可以通过降低丙烷分压或提高温度来优化反应条件，以提高丙烯产量。

PDH主要使用两种类型的催化剂：金属（主要是铂）和金属氧化物（主要是铬氧化物）。由于铂基催化剂具有高选择性和耐久性，被广泛使用，并已在UOP公司的Oleflex等商业工艺中得到应用。

然而，PDH面临的一个主要挑战是催化剂上的积碳形成，特别是在铂基催化剂上。积碳沉积物覆盖活性位点，降低催化剂性能和稳定性。PDH复杂的反应网络导致各种中间体在高温下形成积碳。

为了减少积碳形成并提高工艺效率，可以采用以下几种策略：

1. 将还原性气体（如氢气）与丙烷共进料
2. 将铂与其他金属（如Sn、Cu、Zn）合金化，以减少积碳形成
3. 改性催化剂载体以控制积碳形成，例如处理促进副反应的酸性位点
4. 优化催化剂粒径

催化剂再生具有挑战性，通常需要大量时间，并可能导致催化剂团聚。提高抗积碳能力和开发更高效的再生方法对于提升整体PDH工艺至关重要。
