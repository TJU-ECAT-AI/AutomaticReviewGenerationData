[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature."

[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."

[5] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."

[6] "The coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability. The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."

[7] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site. Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."

[8] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[9] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation. For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production. It involves the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen. The reaction is endothermic and typically occurs at temperatures above 500°C. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures and low propane partial pressures favor propene yield.

2. Catalyst types: Two main classes are used - metal (primarily platinum) and metal oxide (primarily chromium oxide). Platinum-based catalysts are widely used due to their high selectivity and durability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is already implemented in industry, with processes like Oleflex from UOP using platinum-based catalysts.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by:

1. Undermining catalytic performance and stability
2. Covering the metal catalysts and blocking access to active sites
3. Complicating catalyst regeneration

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane
2. Alloying platinum with other metals, such as tin
3. Modifying catalyst supports to control acid sites that favor side reactions
4. Optimizing catalyst particle size and geometry

These approaches aim to reduce coke formation, enhance catalyst stability, and improve the overall efficiency of the PDH process.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法。它涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。该反应是吸热的，通常在500°C以上的温度下进行。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：高温和低丙烷分压有利于丙烯产量。

2. 催化剂类型：主要使用两类 - 金属（主要是铂）和金属氧化物（主要是铬氧化物）。由于铂基催化剂具有高选择性和耐久性，被广泛使用。

3. 工业应用：PDH已在工业中实施，如UOP公司的Oleflex工艺使用铂基催化剂。

铂基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响过程效率：

1. 降低催化性能和稳定性
2. 覆盖金属催化剂并阻塞活性位点
3. 使催化剂再生变得复杂

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 与丙烷共进料还原性气体（如氢气）
2. 将铂与其他金属（如锡）合金化
3. 修改催化剂载体以控制有利于副反应的酸性位点
4. 优化催化剂粒子大小和几何形状

这些方法旨在减少积碳形成，增强催化剂稳定性，并提高PDH过程的整体效率。
