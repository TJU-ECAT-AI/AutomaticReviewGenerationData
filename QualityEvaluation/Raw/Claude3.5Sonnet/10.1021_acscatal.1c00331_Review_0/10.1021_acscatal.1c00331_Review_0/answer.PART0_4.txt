[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature."

[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."

[5] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."

[6] "The coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability. The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1. The various intermediates and propylene in PDH are prone to precede the deep reaction at elevated temperature, which ultimately leads to coke."

[7] "There are several different methods proposed in literature to lessen the coke formation in PDH. The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[8] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation. For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization. Therefore, the modification of nature of support is a useful way to improve coke resistance."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production. It involves the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen. The reaction is highly endothermic and typically occurs at temperatures above 500°C. Reaction conditions can be optimized by lowering propane partial pressure or increasing temperature to improve propene yields.

Two main types of catalysts are used in PDH: metal (primarily platinum) and metal oxide (primarily chromium oxide). Platinum-based catalysts are widely used due to their high selectivity and durability, and have been implemented in commercial processes like UOP's Oleflex technology.

Coke formation is a significant challenge in PDH, severely impacting catalyst performance and stability. Various intermediates and propylene can undergo further reactions at high temperatures, leading to coke deposition on the catalyst surface. This coke formation blocks active sites and reduces catalyst efficiency.

To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, several strategies can be implemented:

1. Cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane.
2. Alloying platinum with other metals, such as tin, to reduce coke formation and provide other benefits.
3. Modifying catalyst supports to control coke formation, for example, by addressing acid sites that favor side reactions like polymerization.
4. Optimizing catalyst particle size and exploring novel catalyst structures, such as single-atom catalysts.

These strategies aim to improve catalyst stability, reduce coke formation, and enhance the overall efficiency of the PDH process for propene production.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种很有前景的丙烯生产方法。它涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。这个反应是高度吸热的，通常在500°C以上的温度下进行。可以通过降低丙烷分压或提高温度来优化反应条件，以提高丙烯产率。

PDH主要使用两种类型的催化剂：金属（主要是铂）和金属氧化物（主要是铬氧化物）。由于铂基催化剂具有高选择性和耐久性，被广泛使用，并已在UOP公司的Oleflex等商业工艺中得到应用。

焦炭形成是PDH面临的一个重大挑战，严重影响催化剂性能和稳定性。在高温下，各种中间体和丙烯可能进一步反应，导致焦炭沉积在催化剂表面。这种焦炭形成会阻塞活性位点，降低催化剂效率。

为了减少焦炭形成并改善催化剂再生，可以采取以下几种策略：

1. 与丙烷共进料还原性气体，如氢气。
2. 将铂与其他金属（如锡）合金化，以减少焦炭形成并提供其他益处。
3. 修改催化剂载体以控制焦炭形成，例如，通过处理有利于聚合等副反应的酸性位点。
4. 优化催化剂粒子尺寸，探索新型催化剂结构，如单原子催化剂。

这些策略旨在提高催化剂稳定性，减少焦炭形成，并提高PDH工艺在丙烯生产中的整体效率。
