[1] "The on-purpose catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, C3H8  C3H6 + H2) is one of the most promising and effective routes to massively produce propylene, which has been already exploited in industry."

[2] "PDH is highly endothermic (ΔH298 = 124.3 kJ/mol), and the reaction temperature is normally above 500 C. The reaction is limited by thermodynamics, and the yields of propene can be increased by lowering propane partial pressure or raising temperature."

[3] "The catalysts of PDH could be divided into two classes: metal and metal oxide. The most representative catalysts of these two categories are platinum and chromium oxide, respectively."

[4] "Platinum-based catalysts have been already employed in Oleflex commercial PDH process from the UOP company."

[5] "Because of its high selectivity and decent durability in PDH, Pt-based catalysts have been extensively investigated for several decades."

[6] "The coke formation during the reaction severely undermine the catalytic performance and stability. The deceptively simple reaction formula of PDH, in which two hydrogens are abstracted from propane, does not fully represent the complex network as shown in Figure 1."

[7] "Consequently, coke covers the metal catalysts and blocks access to the active site. Even worse, the removal of coke is not trivial."

[8] "The cofeeding reductive gas such as hydrogen with propane can significantly reduce the coke formation. The alloying Pt with second metal such as Sn is extensively explored to reduce coke besides other beneficial effects."

[9] "Supports are also of relevance to control coke formation. For example, the acid sites on the support are suggested to favor side reaction like polymerization."

[10] "The size of the Pt catalyst is also a factor with significant influence on the reactivity and side reactions in PDH."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. It involves the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen. The process is highly endothermic and typically occurs at temperatures above 500°C. Reaction conditions can be optimized by lowering propane partial pressure or increasing temperature to improve propene yields.

Two main types of catalysts are used in PDH: metal (primarily platinum) and metal oxide (such as chromium oxide). Platinum-based catalysts are particularly notable due to their high selectivity and durability, and are used in commercial processes like UOP's Oleflex technology.

The main challenge in PDH is coke formation, which significantly impacts process efficiency by covering the catalyst and blocking access to active sites. This deactivation reduces catalytic performance and stability over time.

Several strategies can be implemented to mitigate coke formation:

1. Co-feeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane
2. Alloying platinum with secondary metals (e.g., Sn, Cu, Zn)
3. Modifying catalyst supports to reduce acid sites that promote side reactions
4. Optimizing catalyst particle size

Catalyst regeneration is necessary but can be challenging, often requiring harsh conditions that may lead to catalyst agglomeration and activity loss. Improving coke resistance and developing more efficient regeneration methods are crucial areas for future research and development in PDH technology.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产方法。它涉及将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气。该过程高度吸热，通常在500°C以上的温度下进行。可以通过降低丙烷分压或提高温度来优化反应条件，以提高丙烯产量。

PDH主要使用两种类型的催化剂：金属（主要是铂）和金属氧化物（如氧化铬）。铂基催化剂因其高选择性和耐久性而特别值得注意，并在UOP公司的Oleflex等商业工艺中得到应用。

PDH的主要挑战是焦炭形成，它通过覆盖催化剂和阻塞活性位点显著影响过程效率。这种失活会随时间推移降低催化性能和稳定性。

可以采取几种策略来减少焦炭形成：

1. 与丙烷共进料还原性气体（如氢气）
2. 将铂与第二金属（如Sn、Cu、Zn）合金化
3. 修改催化剂载体以减少促进副反应的酸性位点
4. 优化催化剂粒径

催化剂再生是必要的，但可能具有挑战性，通常需要在严苛条件下进行，这可能导致催化剂团聚和活性损失。提高抗焦性能和开发更高效的再生方法是PDH技术未来研究和开发的关键领域。

However, a major challenge in PDH is coke formation on catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones. Coke deposits cover active sites, reducing catalyst performance and stability. The complex reaction network in PDH leads to various intermediates that can form coke at high temperatures.

To mitigate coke formation and improve process efficiency, several strategies can be employed:

1. Cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane
2. Alloying platinum with other metals (e.g., Sn, Cu, Zn) to reduce coke formation
3. Modifying catalyst supports to control coke formation, such as addressing acid sites that promote side reactions
4. Optimizing catalyst particle size

Catalyst regeneration is challenging, often requiring extensive time and potentially causing catalyst agglomeration. Improving coke resistance and developing more efficient regeneration methods are crucial for enhancing the overall PDH process.

1. Cofeeding reductive gases like hydrogen with propane.
2. Alloying platinum with other metals, such as tin, to reduce coke formation and provide other benefits.
3. Modifying catalyst supports to control coke formation, for example, by addressing acid sites that favor side reactions like polymerization.
4. Optimizing catalyst particle size and exploring novel catalyst structures, such as single-atom catalysts.
