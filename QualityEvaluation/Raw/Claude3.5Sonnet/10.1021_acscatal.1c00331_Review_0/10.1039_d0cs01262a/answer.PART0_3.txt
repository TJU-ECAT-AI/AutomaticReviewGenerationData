[1] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[2] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."

[3] "The strongly endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

[4] "Carbon deposition is also dependent on the particle size of Pt and PtSn alloy, as well as the Sn content. In general, carbon deposition under reaction conditions increases with increasing particle size, but higher Sn content suppresses carbon formation."

[5] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[6] "The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. The process involves several key considerations:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is a strongly endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures (800-980 K) to achieve reasonable propane conversion. These high temperatures pose challenges for catalyst stability and selectivity.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used in commercial PDH processes due to their high catalytic activity. However, they face issues with propylene selectivity, rapid deactivation, and poor stability at high reaction temperatures.

3. Industrial applications: While PDH is a promising route for propylene production, its industrial application is limited by the challenges mentioned above, particularly catalyst deactivation and selectivity issues.

4. Coke formation: This is a major problem for Pt-based catalysts in PDH. Coke formation leads to catalyst deactivation and poor stability. It increases with increasing particle size of Pt and PtSn alloys.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance:

   a. Alloying Pt with other metals: Adding metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In can improve catalytic performance, including reducing coke formation.
   
   b. Controlling particle size: Smaller particle sizes generally lead to less coke formation.
   
   c. Optimizing Sn content: Higher Sn content in PtSn alloys has been shown to suppress carbon formation.
   
   d. Catalyst regeneration: The addition of Sn can aid in Pt re-dispersion during catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the support surface (e.g., γ-Al2O3), leading to improved catalyst stability.

These strategies aim to address the main challenges of PDH: improving propylene selectivity, reducing byproduct formation, maintaining catalyst stability, and mitigating coke formation. The goal is to develop catalysts that can maintain high activity and selectivity while resisting deactivation under the harsh reaction conditions required for PDH.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的重要方法。该过程涉及几个关键考虑因素：

1. 反应条件：PDH是一个强吸热反应，需要高温（800-980 K）才能实现合理的丙烷转化率。这些高温条件对催化剂的稳定性和选择性造成挑战。

2. 催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂因其高催化活性而常用于商业PDH过程。然而，它们在高反应温度下面临丙烯选择性低、快速失活和稳定性差等问题。

3. 工业应用：虽然PDH是丙烯生产的一条有前景的路线，但其工业应用受到上述挑战的限制，特别是催化剂失活和选择性问题。

4. 积碳形成：这是PDH中基于铂催化剂的一个主要问题。积碳形成导致催化剂失活和稳定性差。随着铂和铂锡合金颗粒尺寸的增加，积碳也会增加。

5. 减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略：

   a. 将铂与其他金属合金化：添加锡、钛、镓、铜、钴、锌、铱和铟等金属可以改善催化性能，包括减少积碳形成。
   
   b. 控制颗粒尺寸：较小的颗粒尺寸通常会导致较少的积碳形成。
   
   c. 优化锡含量：在铂锡合金中，较高的锡含量已被证明可以抑制碳的形成。
   
   d. 催化剂再生：添加锡可以通过在支撑体表面（如γ-Al2O3）提供成核位点来帮助铂在催化剂再生过程中重新分散，从而提高催化剂稳定性。

这些策略旨在解决PDH的主要挑战：提高丙烯选择性，减少副产物形成，保持催化剂稳定性，并减轻积碳形成。目标是开发出能在PDH所需的苛刻反应条件下保持高活性和选择性，同时抗失活的催化剂。
