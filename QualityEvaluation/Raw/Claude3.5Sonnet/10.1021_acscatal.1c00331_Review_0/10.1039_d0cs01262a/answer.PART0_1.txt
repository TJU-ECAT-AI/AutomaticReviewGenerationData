[1] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[2] "The strongly endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

[3] "Carbon deposition is also dependent on the particle size of Pt and PtSn alloy, as well as the Sn content. In general, carbon deposition under reaction conditions increases with increasing particle size, but higher Sn content suppresses carbon formation."

[4] "The critical challenge to gain a high selectivity to propylene and stable catalysts is to weaken the propylene adsorption strength and suppress the deep dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts."

[5] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures (800-980 K) to achieve reasonable propane conversion. However, these high temperatures can promote side reactions and coke formation.

Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used commercially due to their high activity. However, they have issues with propylene selectivity, rapid deactivation, and poor stability.

Industrial applications: While PDH offers a route to propylene production, challenges exist in maintaining catalyst performance over time.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency for Pt-based catalysts. It leads to catalyst deactivation and reduced stability, especially at high temperatures required for the reaction.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Modifying Pt catalyst structure by controlling nanoparticle size/shape
2. Alloying Pt with transition metals or main-group elements (e.g. Sn) 
3. Selecting appropriate catalyst supports
4. Weakening propylene adsorption strength to reduce deep dehydrogenation
5. Suppressing carbon deposition through catalyst design (e.g. higher Sn content in PtSn alloys)

These approaches aim to improve propylene selectivity, reduce coke formation, and enhance catalyst stability/regeneration, allowing for more efficient industrial PDH processes.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

反应条件：PDH是高度吸热的，需要高温（800-980 K）才能实现合理的丙烷转化率。然而，这些高温可能会促进副反应和积碳形成。

催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂因其高活性而被广泛用于商业用途。然而，它们在丙烯选择性、快速失活和稳定性差等方面存在问题。

工业应用：虽然PDH为丙烯生产提供了一条途径，但在长期维持催化剂性能方面仍存在挑战。

对于基于铂的催化剂，积碳形成显著影响了过程效率。它导致催化剂失活和稳定性降低，特别是在反应所需的高温下。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 通过控制纳米粒子的大小/形状来修改铂催化剂结构
2. 将铂与过渡金属或主族元素（如锡）合金化
3. 选择适当的催化剂载体
4. 减弱丙烯吸附强度以减少深度脱氢
5. 通过催化剂设计抑制碳沉积（例如，PtSn合金中更高的Sn含量）

这些方法旨在提高丙烯选择性，减少积碳形成，并增强催化剂稳定性/再生能力，从而实现更高效的工业PDH过程。
