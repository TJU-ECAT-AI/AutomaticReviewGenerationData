[1] "Propylene is one of the vital petrochemical building blocks for producing various chemical products, such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile. The conventional production processes of propylene are mainly steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of light diesel, naphtha, and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Along with the large-scale revolution of shale gas and the growth of the global propylene demand (which is expected to increase to 130 million metric tons by 2023), on-purpose propylene production, specifically propane dehydrogenation (PDH), seems to be a promising alternative."

[3] "The PDH process is an endothermic reaction, and successfully commercialized PDH catalysts can be categorized into two groups: Pt- and Cr-based catalysts. The reaction is normally performed at around 600 1C on Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts."

[4] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[5] "Unpromoted Pt catalysts suffer from low alkene selectivity and rapid deactivation due to coking. Both undesired phenomena are mainly a consequence of deep dehydrogenation of surface C2H4*, leading to CC bond breaking."

[6] "Improvements of catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability can be achieved by alloying Pt with Sn and by adding hydrogen to the alkane feed."

[7] "Alloying of Pt with one or more TMs, such as Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, and In, is an effective way to improve the catalytic performance in PDH."

[8] "The work also reported that the addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising alternative method for propene production, especially given the increasing global demand for propylene. The process involves an endothermic reaction typically performed at around 600°C using Al2O3 supported PtSn or CrOx catalysts.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures are required (around 600°C), and the process is endothermic.

2. Catalyst types: Primarily Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are used commercially. Pt-based catalysts are preferred due to their high catalytic activity.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important as an on-purpose propylene production method, particularly in light of the shale gas revolution and growing propylene demand.

However, Pt-based catalysts face challenges in terms of propylene selectivity, rapid deactivation, and poor stability. These issues are largely due to coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures. Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and reducing selectivity.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Alloying Pt with other metals: Combining Pt with metals like Sn, Ti, Ga, Cu, Co, Zn, Ir, or In can enhance catalytic performance.

2. Adding hydrogen to the feed: This can help improve catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.

3. Using promoters: Sn, in particular, has been shown to improve catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the Al2O3 support, leading to better catalyst stability.

4. Optimizing catalyst design: Efforts are made to balance activity, selectivity, and stability while minimizing coke formation.

These approaches aim to address the challenges associated with coke formation, thereby improving overall process efficiency and catalyst longevity in industrial PDH applications.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有前景的丙烯生产替代方法，特别是考虑到全球对丙烯的需求不断增加。该过程涉及一个吸热反应，通常在约600°C下使用Al2O3负载的PtSn或CrOx催化剂进行。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：需要高温（约600°C），且过程是吸热的。

2. 催化剂类型：主要使用Pt和Cr基商业催化剂。由于具有高催化活性，Pt基催化剂更受青睐。

3. 工业应用：PDH作为一种定向丙烯生产方法正变得越来越重要，特别是在页岩气革命和丙烯需求增长的背景下。

然而，Pt基催化剂在丙烯选择性、快速失活和稳定性差等方面面临挑战。这些问题主要是由于高反应温度下的积碳形成和催化剂烧结造成的。积碳形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活和选择性降低。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 将Pt与其他金属合金化：将Pt与Sn、Ti、Ga、Cu、Co、Zn、Ir或In等金属结合可以提高催化性能。

2. 向进料中添加氢气：这可以帮助提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。

3. 使用助剂：特别是Sn，已被证明可以通过在Al2O3载体上提供成核位点来改善催化剂再生，从而提高催化剂稳定性。

4. 优化催化剂设计：努力平衡活性、选择性和稳定性，同时最小化积碳形成。

这些方法旨在解决与积碳形成相关的挑战，从而提高工业PDH应用中的整体过程效率和催化剂寿命。
