[1] "Pt-Based catalysts are commonly used commercial catalysts for PDH because of their high catalytic activity. Still, they suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, fast deactivation, and poor catalyst stability caused by coke formation and catalyst sintering at high reaction temperatures."

[2] "The strongly endothermic nature of PDH (DrH1 = 1.28 eV, under standard conditions at 298 K) requires high reaction temperature (800980 K) to achieve a reasonable propane conversion."

[3] "The critical challenge for the catalysis of PDH is to reduce the selectivity to byproducts and to maintain the catalytic stability of the catalyst."

[4] "The coke precursors are mainly formed during the quick deactivation, and the active sites are mainly occupied by C2 and C1 species, which are hardly removed from the surface."

[5] "To increase the selectivity toward propylene at relatively high catalytic activity, various attempts have been made to modify the geometrical and electronic structures of Pt-based catalysts, such as controlling the size and shape of Pt NPs, alloying Pt with TMs or main-group metals, and selecting appropriate catalyst supports."

[6] "The addition of Sn can help Pt re-disperse in the catalyst regeneration by providing nucleation sites on the g-Al2O3 surface to achieve superior catalyst stability."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important method for propene production. Key considerations include:

1. Reaction conditions: PDH is highly endothermic, requiring temperatures of 800-980 K for reasonable propane conversion.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are commonly used due to their high activity. However, they face challenges with propylene selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: The process needs to balance high conversion with selectivity and catalyst longevity.

4. Coke formation impact: It leads to fast deactivation and poor catalyst stability, occupying active sites with hard-to-remove C1 and C2 species.

5. Mitigation strategies:
   - Modifying Pt catalyst structures (size, shape, alloying)
   - Selecting appropriate supports
   - Adding promoters like Sn to improve dispersion and regeneration

6. Catalyst regeneration: Additives like Sn can provide nucleation sites on supports (e.g., γ-Al2O3) to aid Pt re-dispersion during regeneration, improving long-term stability.

The main challenge in PDH is balancing high activity with improved selectivity to propylene, reduced byproduct formation, and enhanced catalyst stability against coking and sintering at high temperatures.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要方法。主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：PDH是高度吸热的，需要800-980 K的温度才能实现合理的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：基于铂的催化剂因其高活性而被广泛使用。然而，它们面临着丙烯选择性和稳定性的挑战。

3. 工业应用：该过程需要在高转化率、选择性和催化剂寿命之间取得平衡。

4. 积碳形成的影响：它导致催化剂快速失活和稳定性差，活性位被难以去除的C1和C2物种占据。

5. 缓解策略：
   - 改变铂催化剂结构（尺寸、形状、合金化）
   - 选择适当的载体
   - 添加如锡等助剂以提高分散性和再生能力

6. 催化剂再生：添加剂如锡可以在载体（如γ-Al2O3）上提供成核位点，有助于再生过程中铂的重新分散，提高长期稳定性。

PDH的主要挑战是在高活性、提高丙烯选择性、减少副产品形成以及增强催化剂在高温下抗积碳和烧结的稳定性之间取得平衡。
