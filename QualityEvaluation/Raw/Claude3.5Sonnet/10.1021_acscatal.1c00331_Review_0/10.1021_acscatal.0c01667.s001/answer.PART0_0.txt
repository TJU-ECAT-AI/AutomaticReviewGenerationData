The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the conversion of propane to propylene using specific catalysts. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The literature mentions temperatures of 550°C and 600°C, atmospheric pressure, and a C3H8/H2 ratio of 1:1 with balance N2 for a total flow rate of 100 mL/min.

2. Catalyst types: The study focuses on Ru-based phosphide catalysts, comparing them with monometallic Ru and Pt catalysts. Specifically, it examines Ru-P/SiO2 catalysts with varying P/Ru ratios.

3. Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the research aims to enhance propane selective dehydrogenation, which is relevant for industrial propylene production.

The document does not directly address coke formation on Pt-based catalysts or strategies to mitigate it. However, the focus on Ru-based phosphide catalysts suggests that researchers are exploring alternatives to traditional Pt catalysts, possibly to overcome limitations such as coke formation.

The study compares the performance of various catalysts, including Pt/SiO2, Ru/SiO2, and Ru-P/SiO2 with different P/Ru ratios, in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalyst was tested for stability over a 12-hour period, indicating an interest in long-term catalyst performance, which could be related to coke formation issues.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种利用特定催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯的丙烯生产方法。这个过程的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：文献提到550°C和600°C的温度，大气压力，以及C3H8/H2比例为1:1，用N2平衡，总流量为100 mL/min。

2. 催化剂类型：研究重点是基于Ru的磷化物催化剂，并与单金属Ru和Pt催化剂进行比较。具体来说，它研究了具有不同P/Ru比例的Ru-P/SiO2催化剂。

3. 工业应用：虽然没有明确讨论，但研究旨在增强丙烷选择性脱氢，这与工业丙烯生产相关。

文档没有直接讨论Pt基催化剂上的焦炭形成或减轻焦炭形成的策略。然而，对Ru基磷化物催化剂的关注表明，研究人员正在探索传统Pt催化剂的替代品，可能是为了克服焦炭形成等限制。

研究比较了各种催化剂的性能，包括Pt/SiO2、Ru/SiO2和具有不同P/Ru比例的Ru-P/SiO2，从丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性方面进行评估。Ru-P/SiO2-50催化剂进行了12小时的稳定性测试，表明对催化剂长期性能感兴趣，这可能与焦炭形成问题有关。
