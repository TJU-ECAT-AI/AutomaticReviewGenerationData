The catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a method for propene production that involves the use of catalysts to convert propane into propene. Key considerations for this process include:

1. Reaction conditions: The literature mentions temperatures around 600°C, atmospheric pressure, and specific gas ratios (e.g., C3H8/H2 = 1/1) with nitrogen as a balance gas.

2. Catalyst types: The study focuses on Ru-based phosphide catalysts, comparing them with traditional Pt and Ru catalysts. Ru-P/SiO2 catalysts with varying P/Ru ratios are examined.

3. Industrial applications: While not explicitly discussed, the research aims to enhance propane selective dehydrogenation, which is relevant for industrial propene production.

The literature does not directly address coke formation on Pt-based catalysts or strategies to mitigate it. However, the focus on Ru-based phosphide catalysts suggests that researchers are exploring alternative catalysts that may offer advantages over traditional Pt catalysts, possibly including improved resistance to coking or easier regeneration. The long-term stability test (12 hours) of the Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalyst indicates efforts to develop catalysts with sustained performance, which could be related to addressing coking issues.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种生产丙烯的方法，涉及使用催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯。这个过程的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：文献提到温度约为600°C，常压，以及特定的气体比例（例如，C3H8/H2 = 1/1），并使用氮气作为平衡气体。

2. 催化剂类型：研究重点关注基于钌的磷化物催化剂，并与传统的铂和钌催化剂进行比较。研究了具有不同P/Ru比例的Ru-P/SiO2催化剂。

3. 工业应用：虽然没有明确讨论，但研究旨在增强丙烷选择性脱氢，这与工业丙烯生产相关。

文献没有直接讨论铂基催化剂上的积碳形成或减轻积碳的策略。然而，对钌基磷化物催化剂的关注表明，研究人员正在探索可能比传统铂催化剂具有优势的替代催化剂，可能包括改善抗积碳性能或更容易再生。Ru-P/SiO2-50催化剂的长期稳定性测试（12小时）表明，研究人员正在努力开发具有持续性能的催化剂，这可能与解决积碳问题有关。
