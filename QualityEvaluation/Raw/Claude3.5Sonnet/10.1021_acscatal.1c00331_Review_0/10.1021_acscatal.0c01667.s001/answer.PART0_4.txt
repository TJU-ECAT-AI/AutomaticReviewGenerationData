The literature provides limited information on the catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) for propene production. However, it does mention some key aspects:

1. Catalyst composition: The study focuses on Ru-based phosphide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, suggesting these are potential alternatives to traditional catalysts.

2. Reaction conditions: The experiments were conducted at 600°C, atmospheric pressure, with a C3H8/H2 ratio of 1/1, balanced with N2 for a total flow rate of 100 mL/min.

3. Catalyst types: The study compares Ru-based catalysts with different P/Ru ratios, as well as Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 catalysts.

4. Performance evaluation: The research examined propane conversion and propylene selectivity over time, indicating these are important metrics for assessing catalyst performance.

The document does not provide specific information about coke formation on Pt-based catalysts or strategies to mitigate it. It also lacks details on industrial applications of PDH. The focus appears to be on developing and evaluating Ru-based phosphide catalysts as potential alternatives for propane dehydrogenation.

该文献对丙烷催化直接脱氢(PDH)生产丙烯提供了有限的信息。但是，它确实提到了一些关键方面：

1. 催化剂组成：该研究focused on基于钌的磷化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢，表明这些可能是传统催化剂的潜在替代品。

2. 反应条件：实验在600°C、大气压下进行，C3H8/H2比例为1/1，用N2平衡，总流量为100 mL/min。

3. 催化剂类型：该研究比较了具有不同P/Ru比例的钌基催化剂，以及Pt/SiO2和Ru/SiO2催化剂。

4. 性能评估：研究考察了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性随时间的变化，表明这些是评估催化剂性能的重要指标。

该文档没有提供关于Pt基催化剂上焦炭形成的具体信息，也没有提供减轻焦炭形成的策略。它也缺乏PDH工业应用的细节。研究的重点似乎是开发和评估钌基磷化物催化剂作为丙烷脱氢的潜在替代品。
