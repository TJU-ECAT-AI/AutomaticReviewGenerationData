[1] "Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

[2] "PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

[3] "Developing an economically viable and eco-friendly catalyst is essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. In this context, cobalt-based catalysts supported on different morphologies of γ-Al2O3, nano-sheet (Al2O3NS), nano-fiber (Al2O3NF) and nano-plate (Al2O3NP) were synthesized using wetness impregnation method and tested for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The presence of tetrahedral coordinated Co+2 in Co/Al2O3NS leads to higher selectivity towards propylene. The formation of metallic cobalt from Co3O4 precursor present in Co/Al2O3NP promoted side reactions to form lower hydrocarbons and carbon, which caused catalyst deactivation."

[5] "There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production that offers high selectivity compared to traditional naphtha steam cracking. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) to achieve sufficient conversion.

2. Catalyst types: Various catalysts have been studied, including PtSn-based catalysts (commercialized) and cobalt-based catalysts supported on different alumina morphologies.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for on-purpose propylene production due to its high selectivity and lower energy requirements compared to steam cracking.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and requiring frequent regeneration. This leads to increased operational costs and reduced catalyst lifetime.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Developing alternative catalyst formulations, such as cobalt-based catalysts on different alumina supports.

2. Optimizing catalyst morphology and metal-support interactions to enhance stability and reduce coke formation.

3. Controlling reaction conditions to minimize side reactions that lead to coke formation.

4. Implementing efficient regeneration processes to remove coke deposits without damaging the catalyst structure.

5. Investigating the role of Lewis acidic sites and metal oxidation states in coke formation to design more coke-resistant catalysts.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）是一种有前途的丙烯生产方法，与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解相比，具有更高的选择性。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（550-625°C）下进行，以实现足够的转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：研究了各种催化剂，包括PtSn基催化剂（已商业化）和负载在不同氧化铝形态上的钴基催化剂。

3. 工业应用：由于PDH具有高选择性和较低的能源需求，与蒸汽裂解相比，它在定向丙烯生产中变得越来越重要。

Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成显著影响了过程效率，导致催化剂失活并需要频繁再生。这导致了运营成本的增加和催化剂寿命的缩短。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 开发替代催化剂配方，如负载在不同氧化铝载体上的钴基催化剂。

2. 优化催化剂形态和金属-载体相互作用，以提高稳定性并减少积碳形成。

3. 控制反应条件，最大限度地减少导致积碳形成的副反应。

4. 实施高效的再生过程，以去除积碳沉积物而不损坏催化剂结构。

5. 研究Lewis酸性位点和金属氧化态在积碳形成中的作用，以设计更耐积碳的催化剂。
