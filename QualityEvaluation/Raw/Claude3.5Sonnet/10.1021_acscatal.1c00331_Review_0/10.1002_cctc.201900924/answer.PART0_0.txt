[1] "Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

[2] "PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

[3] "Cobalt-based catalysts supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been widely accepted for their promising performance in the Fischer-Tropsch process and several other important reactions, as reported in the literature."

[4] "The desired active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction is reported to be the Co+2 or CoO."

[5] "There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by removing hydrogen from propane molecules to form propene. This process is considered promising due to its ability to produce olefins with high selectivity compared to traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C as mentioned in the study).

2. Catalyst types: Various catalysts have been studied, including PtSn-based catalysts (commercially used) and cobalt-based catalysts. The active site for propane dehydrogenation is reported to be Co+2 or CoO for cobalt-based catalysts.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is seen as an alternative to energy-intensive and costly naphtha steam cracking for propylene production.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. This necessitates frequent regeneration, increasing operational costs and downtime.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition and support materials to enhance metal-support interaction.
2. Controlling reaction conditions to minimize side reactions that lead to coke formation.
3. Developing more efficient regeneration processes.
4. Exploring alternative catalyst formulations, such as cobalt-based catalysts on different alumina morphologies, as investigated in this study.

The research presented here focuses on cobalt-based catalysts supported on different alumina morphologies, aiming to understand the relationship between catalyst structure, activity, and coke formation. This approach represents an effort to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes.

催化直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）作为一种生产丙烯的方法，通过从丙烷分子中移除氢来形成丙烯。与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解相比，这一过程被认为是有前景的，因为它能够高选择性地生产烯烃。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温下进行（研究中提到550-625°C）。

2. 催化剂类型：研究了各种催化剂，包括商业使用的PtSn基催化剂和钴基催化剂。对于钴基催化剂，丙烷脱氢的活性位点据报道是Co+2或CoO。

3. 工业应用：PDH被视为能源密集型和高成本的石脑油蒸汽裂解的替代方案，用于丙烯生产。

包括Pt基催化剂在内的催化剂上的焦炭形成显著影响过程效率，导致催化剂失活。这需要频繁再生，增加了运营成本和停机时间。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 优化催化剂成分和载体材料，以增强金属-载体相互作用。
2. 控制反应条件，以最小化导致焦炭形成的副反应。
3. 开发更高效的再生过程。
4. 探索替代催化剂配方，如本研究中调查的不同氧化铝形态上的钴基催化剂。

这里呈现的研究侧重于不同氧化铝形态上的钴基催化剂，旨在理解催化剂结构、活性和焦炭形成之间的关系。这种方法代表了开发更高效、更稳定的PDH过程催化剂的努力。
