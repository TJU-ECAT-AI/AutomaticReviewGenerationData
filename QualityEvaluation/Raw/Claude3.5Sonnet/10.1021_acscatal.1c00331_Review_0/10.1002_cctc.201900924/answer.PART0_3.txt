[1] "Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

[2] "PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

[3] "Cobalt-based catalysts supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been widely accepted for their promising performance in the Fischer-Tropsch process and several other important reactions, as reported in the literature."

[4] "There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

[5] "For further development of cobalt based catalyst, lower cobalt loading should be preferred, and modification of support with TiO2, ZrO2 or SiO2 might help to suppress the strong Lewis acidic center and prevent coke deposition."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production that offers high selectivity compared to traditional naphtha steam cracking. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: High temperatures are typically required, with the study mentioning temperatures of 550-625°C.

2. Catalyst types: PtSn-based catalysts are widely used commercially, but suffer from deactivation. Cobalt-based catalysts supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have shown promise as alternatives.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is being commercialized, with processes like Oleflex by UOP Honeywell using PtSn catalysts.

Coke formation on catalysts, including Pt-based ones, significantly impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation and requiring frequent regeneration. For cobalt-based catalysts, coke formation occurs due to the formation of metallic cobalt promoting side reactions and carbon deposition on Lewis acidic sites.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:
1. Using lower cobalt loading in catalysts
2. Modifying supports with TiO2, ZrO2, or SiO2 to suppress strong Lewis acidic centers
3. Optimizing reaction conditions to minimize side reactions leading to coke formation
4. Developing more efficient regeneration processes to remove coke deposits

The study also highlights the importance of maintaining the correct oxidation state of cobalt (Co2+) and preventing the formation of metallic cobalt to reduce coke formation and improve catalyst stability.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解相比，具有高选择性。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：通常需要高温，研究中提到温度为550-625°C。

2. 催化剂类型：商业上广泛使用PtSn基催化剂，但存在失活问题。以SiO2和Al2O3为载体的钴基催化剂显示出作为替代品的潜力。

3. 工业应用：PDH正在商业化，如UOP霍尼韦尔的Oleflex工艺使用PtSn催化剂。

包括Pt基在内的催化剂上的积碳形成对过程效率有显著影响，导致失活并需要频繁再生。对于钴基催化剂，积碳形成是由于金属钴的形成促进副反应和Lewis酸性位点上的碳沉积。

减少积碳形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：
1. 在催化剂中使用更低的钴负载量
2. 用TiO2、ZrO2或SiO2修饰载体以抑制强Lewis酸性中心
3. 优化反应条件以最小化导致积碳形成的副反应
4. 开发更高效的再生过程以去除积碳沉积物

研究还强调了维持钴的正确氧化态（Co2+）和防止金属钴形成的重要性，以减少积碳形成并提高催化剂稳定性。
