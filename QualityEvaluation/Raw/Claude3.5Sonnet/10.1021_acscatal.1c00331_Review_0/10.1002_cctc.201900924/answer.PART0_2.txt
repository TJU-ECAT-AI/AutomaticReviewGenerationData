[1] "Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

[2] "PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

[3] "The major cause of catalyst deactivation of coke deposition."

[4] "The causes of catalyst deactivation will be discussed to understand the key factors leading to the lower selectivity and stability of the cobalt-based catalyst supported on Al2O3."

[5] "There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

[6] "For further development of cobalt based catalyst, lower cobalt loading should be preferred, and modification of support with TiO2, ZrO2 or SiO2 might help to suppress the strong Lewis acidic center and prevent coke deposition."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propylene through the removal of hydrogen. This process offers several advantages over traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking, including higher selectivity and lower energy requirements.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 550-600°C) to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst types: PtSn-based catalysts are widely used commercially, but cobalt-based catalysts are also being studied as potential alternatives.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for on-purpose propylene production, especially in regions with abundant propane resources.

Coke formation on Pt-based catalysts significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and reducing selectivity. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, increasing operational costs and downtime.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition and support materials (e.g., using cobalt-based catalysts with modified supports like TiO2, ZrO2, or SiO2).

2. Controlling reaction conditions to minimize side reactions that lead to coke formation.

3. Developing more effective regeneration processes to remove coke without damaging the catalyst.

4. Using lower metal loadings to reduce the formation of metallic species that promote coke formation.

5. Modifying catalyst supports to suppress strong Lewis acidic centers, which can contribute to coke deposition.

By addressing these challenges, researchers aim to develop more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH processes, ultimately improving the economic viability and sustainability of propylene production.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种通过去除氢气将丙烷转化为丙烯的丙烯生产方法。与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解等方法相比，这一工艺具有选择性更高、能耗更低等优势。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（约550-600°C）下运行，以克服热力学限制。

2. 催化剂类型：PtSn基催化剂在商业上广泛使用，但钴基催化剂也正在被研究作为潜在的替代品。

3. 工业应用：PDH在定向丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，特别是在丙烷资源丰富的地区。

焦炭在Pt基催化剂上的形成显著影响工艺效率，导致催化剂失活并降低选择性。这需要频繁的催化剂再生，增加了运营成本和停机时间。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 优化催化剂组成和载体材料（例如，使用改性载体如TiO2、ZrO2或SiO2的钴基催化剂）。

2. 控制反应条件，最大限度地减少导致焦炭形成的副反应。

3. 开发更有效的再生工艺，在不损坏催化剂的情况下去除焦炭。

4. 使用较低的金属负载量，以减少促进焦炭形成的金属物种的形成。

5. 改性催化剂载体，以抑制强Lewis酸中心，这些中心可能导致焦炭沉积。

通过解决这些挑战，研究人员旨在开发更高效、更稳定的PDH工艺催化剂，最终提高丙烯生产的经济可行性和可持续性。
