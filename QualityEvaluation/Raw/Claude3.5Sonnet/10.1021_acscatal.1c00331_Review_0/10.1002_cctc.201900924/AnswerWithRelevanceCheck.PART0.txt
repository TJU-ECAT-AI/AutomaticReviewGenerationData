          "Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

"PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

"Developing an economically viable and eco-friendly catalyst is essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. In this context, cobalt-based catalysts supported on different morphologies of γ-Al2O3, nano-sheet (Al2O3NS), nano-fiber (Al2O3NF) and nano-plate (Al2O3NP) were synthesized using wetness impregnation method and tested for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction."

"The presence of tetrahedral coordinated Co+2 in Co/Al2O3NS leads to higher selectivity towards propylene. The formation of metallic cobalt from Co3O4 precursor present in Co/Al2O3NP promoted side reactions to form lower hydrocarbons and carbon, which caused catalyst deactivation."

"There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

"For further development of cobalt based catalyst, lower cobalt loading should be preferred, and modification of support with TiO2, ZrO2 or SiO2 might help to suppress the strong Lewis acidic center and prevent coke deposition."

          Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) functions as a method for propene production by converting propane to propylene through the removal of hydrogen. This process offers several advantages over traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking, including higher selectivity and lower energy requirements.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (around 550-625°C) to achieve sufficient propane conversion.

2. Catalyst types: PtSn-based catalysts are widely used commercially, but suffer from deactivation. Researchers are exploring alternative catalysts like cobalt supported on different alumina morphologies (nano-sheet, nano-fiber, and nano-plate) to improve performance and reduce costs.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for on-purpose propylene production, especially in regions with abundant propane resources.

Coke formation on catalysts, particularly Pt-based ones, significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation and reducing selectivity. This necessitates frequent catalyst regeneration, increasing operational costs and downtime.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition and support materials (e.g., using cobalt-based catalysts with modified supports like TiO2, ZrO2, or SiO2).

2. Controlling reaction conditions to minimize side reactions that lead to coke formation.

3. Developing more effective regeneration processes to remove coke without damaging the catalyst.

4. Using lower metal loadings to reduce the formation of metallic species that promote coke formation.

5. Modifying catalyst supports to suppress strong Lewis acidic centers, which can contribute to coke deposition.

The study shows that cobalt catalysts with higher metal-support interaction and tetrahedral Co2+ species exhibit better selectivity and stability. However, the formation of metallic cobalt promotes side reactions and coke deposition. Future research should focus on further optimizing catalyst formulations and process conditions to minimize deactivation and improve overall efficiency.

          催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种通过去除氢气将丙烷转化为丙烯的丙烯生产方法。与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解等方法相比，这一工艺具有选择性更高、能耗更低等优势。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该工艺通常在高温（约550-625°C）下运行，以获得足够的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：PtSn基催化剂在商业上广泛使用，但存在失活问题。研究人员正在探索替代催化剂，如负载在不同形貌氧化铝（纳米片、纳米纤维和纳米板）上的钴，以提高性能并降低成本。

3. 工业应用：PDH在定向丙烯生产中变得越来越重要，特别是在丙烷资源丰富的地区。

焦炭在催化剂上的形成，尤其是Pt基催化剂，显著影响工艺效率，导致催化剂失活并降低选择性。这需要频繁的催化剂再生，增加了运营成本和停机时间。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 优化催化剂组成和载体材料（例如，使用改性载体如TiO2、ZrO2或SiO2的钴基催化剂）。

2. 控制反应条件，最大限度地减少导致焦炭形成的副反应。

3. 开发更有效的再生工艺，在不损坏催化剂的情况下去除焦炭。

4. 使用较低的金属负载量，以减少促进焦炭形成的金属物种的形成。

5. 改性催化剂载体，以抑制强Lewis酸中心，这些中心可能导致焦炭沉积。

研究表明，具有更高金属-载体相互作用和四面体Co2+物种的钴催化剂表现出更好的选择性和稳定性。然而，金属钴的形成会促进副反应和积碳沉积。未来的研究应该集中在进一步优化催化剂配方和工艺条件，以最小化失活并提高整体效率。
