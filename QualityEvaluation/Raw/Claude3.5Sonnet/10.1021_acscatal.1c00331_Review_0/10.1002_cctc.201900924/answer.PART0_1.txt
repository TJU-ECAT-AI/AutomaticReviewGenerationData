[1] "Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity."

[2] "PtSn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst."

[3] "Developing an economically viable and eco-friendly catalyst is essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. In this context, cobalt-based catalysts supported on different morphologies of γ-Al2O3, nano-sheet (Al2O3NS), nano-fiber (Al2O3NF) and nano-plate (Al2O3NP) were synthesized using wetness impregnation method and tested for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The presence of tetrahedral coordinated Co+2 in Co/Al2O3NS leads to higher selectivity towards propylene. The formation of metallic cobalt from Co3O4 precursor present in Co/Al2O3NP promoted side reactions to form lower hydrocarbons and carbon, which caused catalyst deactivation."

[5] "There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is a promising method for propene production that offers high selectivity compared to traditional naphtha steam cracking. Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (550-625°C) to achieve sufficient propane conversion.

2. Catalyst types: PtSn-based catalysts are widely used commercially, but suffer from deactivation. Researchers are exploring alternative catalysts like cobalt supported on different alumina morphologies to improve performance and reduce costs.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important for producing propylene, a key building block for many polymeric products.

4. Coke formation: This is a major issue for Pt-based and other catalysts, leading to deactivation and requiring frequent regeneration.

5. Strategies to mitigate coke formation:
- Optimizing catalyst composition and support morphology to enhance metal-support interactions
- Using promoters or modifying supports to suppress strong Lewis acid sites
- Controlling reaction temperature to minimize side reactions
- Developing more efficient regeneration processes

The study shows that cobalt catalysts with higher metal-support interaction and tetrahedral Co2+ species exhibit better selectivity and stability. However, the formation of metallic cobalt promotes side reactions and coke deposition. Future research should focus on further optimizing catalyst formulations and process conditions to minimize deactivation and improve overall efficiency.

丙烷催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，与传统的石脑油蒸汽裂解相比，它具有较高的选择性。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（550-625°C）下进行，以获得足够的丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂类型：PtSn基催化剂在商业上被广泛使用，但存在失活问题。研究人员正在探索替代催化剂，如负载在不同形貌氧化铝上的钴，以提高性能并降低成本。

3. 工业应用：PDH在生产丙烯方面变得越来越重要，丙烯是许多聚合物产品的关键构建块。

4. 积碳形成：这是Pt基和其他催化剂面临的主要问题，导致失活并需要频繁再生。

5. 减少积碳形成的策略：
- 优化催化剂组成和载体形貌，以增强金属-载体相互作用
- 使用助剂或改性载体以抑制强Lewis酸位
- 控制反应温度以最小化副反应
- 开发更高效的再生过程

研究表明，具有更高金属-载体相互作用和四面体Co2+物种的钴催化剂表现出更好的选择性和稳定性。然而，金属钴的形成会促进副反应和积碳沉积。未来的研究应该集中在进一步优化催化剂配方和工艺条件，以最小化失活并提高整体效率。
