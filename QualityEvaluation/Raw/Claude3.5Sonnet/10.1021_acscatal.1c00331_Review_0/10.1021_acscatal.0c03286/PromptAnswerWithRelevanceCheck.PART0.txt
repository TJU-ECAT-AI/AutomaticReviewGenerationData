[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory."

[3] "The critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability."

[4] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties."

[5] "The multiple PtPt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.)."

[6] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 575°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble platinum (Pt) is widely used due to its superior activity. However, efforts are being made to improve its selectivity and minimize usage to lower costs.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the propylene production industry due to its ability to meet growing demand.

The main challenge in PDH is coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Coke formation is primarily associated with the presence of multiple Pt-Pt sites, which promote deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and secondary reactions.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Atomic-level dispersion of Pt particles: This approach eliminates multiple Pt-Pt sites, effectively inhibiting undesired side reactions and reducing the coking rate.

2. Optimizing catalyst design: Developing catalysts that maintain high propylene selectivity while exhibiting high activity and increased anticoking ability.

3. Controlling reaction conditions: Adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure to minimize coke formation.

4. Regular catalyst regeneration: Implementing efficient regeneration processes to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

By addressing these aspects, researchers and industry professionals can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process for propene production.

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to meet. The process primarily uses noble platinum (Pt) as the active component due to its superior activity, although its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 575°C and 1 atm pressure, with a specific gas composition.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are widely used, with a focus on optimizing Pt particle size and dispersion.

3. Industrial applications: The main goals are to minimize noble Pt usage to lower production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity with high activity levels, and increase anticoking ability.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation of Pt-based catalysts. The study found that coke formation depends on Pt particle size and dispersion. Larger Pt particles and multiple Pt-Pt sites promote coke formation through deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and secondary reactions.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using atomically dispersed Pt catalysts: When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, multiple Pt-Pt sites disappear, effectively inhibiting undesired side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Optimizing Pt particle size: Smaller Pt particles, particularly atomically dispersed Pt, showed improved selectivity and stability due to reduced coke formation.

3. Controlling reaction conditions: Although not explicitly stated in the given quotes, optimizing temperature, pressure, and gas composition can help minimize coke formation.

4. Developing novel catalyst supports: The study used Al2O3 as a support, but exploring other materials or modifications could potentially improve anticoking properties.
