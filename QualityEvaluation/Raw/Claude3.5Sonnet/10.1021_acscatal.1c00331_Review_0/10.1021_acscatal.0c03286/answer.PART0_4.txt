[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory."

[3] "The critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability."

[4] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties."

[5] "The multiple PtPt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.)."

[6] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 575°C and 1 atm pressure, with a specific gas composition.

2. Catalyst types: Noble platinum (Pt) is widely used due to its superior activity, but its selectivity to propylene needs improvement. The research focused on different sizes of Pt catalysts, from atomically dispersed to nanoparticles.

3. Industrial applications: The main goals are to minimize noble Pt usage to lower costs, maintain high propylene selectivity with high activity, and increase resistance to coking.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by deactivating Pt-based catalysts. The study found that coke deposits increase with Pt loading, and multiple Pt-Pt sites contribute to undesired side reactions like deep dehydrogenation, cracking, and secondary coke reactions.

To mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration, the research suggests using atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, multiple Pt-Pt sites disappear, effectively inhibiting undesired side reactions. This approach increases propene selectivity and decreases the coking rate, potentially improving catalyst stability and regeneration capability.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产替代方法，可以满足传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足的日益增长的需求。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在575°C和1个大气压下进行实验，使用特定的气体组成。

2. 催化剂类型：由于其优越的活性，贵金属铂（Pt）被广泛使用，但其对丙烯的选择性需要改进。研究重点关注了从原子分散到纳米颗粒的不同大小的Pt催化剂。

3. 工业应用：主要目标是最小化贵金属Pt的使用以降低成本，在高活性下保持高丙烯选择性，并提高抗结焦能力。

结焦形成显著影响过程效率，导致Pt基催化剂失活。研究发现，随着Pt负载量的增加，焦炭沉积增加，多个Pt-Pt位点会导致不希望的副反应，如深度脱氢、裂解和二次焦炭反应。

为了减少结焦形成并改善催化剂再生，研究建议使用原子分散的Pt催化剂。当Pt颗粒达到原子级分散时，多个Pt-Pt位点消失，有效抑制了不希望的副反应。这种方法增加了丙烯选择性并降低了结焦率，有可能改善催化剂的稳定性和再生能力。
