Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to meet. The process primarily uses noble platinum (Pt) as the active component due to its superior activity, although its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory.

Key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The study conducted experiments at 575°C and 1 atm pressure, with a specific gas composition.

2. Catalyst types: Pt-based catalysts are widely used, with a focus on optimizing Pt particle size and dispersion.

3. Industrial applications: The main goals are to minimize noble Pt usage to lower production costs, maintain high propylene selectivity with high activity levels, and increase anticoking ability.

Coke formation significantly impacts process efficiency by causing deactivation of Pt-based catalysts. The study found that coke formation depends on Pt particle size and dispersion. Larger Pt particles and multiple Pt-Pt sites promote coke formation through deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and secondary reactions.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Using atomically dispersed Pt catalysts: When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, multiple Pt-Pt sites disappear, effectively inhibiting undesired side reactions that lead to coke formation.

2. Optimizing Pt particle size: Smaller Pt particles, particularly atomically dispersed Pt, showed improved selectivity and stability due to reduced coke formation.

3. Controlling reaction conditions: Although not explicitly stated in the given quotes, optimizing temperature, pressure, and gas composition can help minimize coke formation.

4. Developing novel catalyst supports: The study used Al2O3 as a support, but exploring other materials or modifications could potentially improve anticoking properties.

By implementing these strategies, researchers and industry professionals can work towards more efficient and stable PDH processes with improved catalyst lifetimes and regeneration capabilities.

催化直接脱氢丙烷（PDH）是生产丙烯的一种重要替代方法，解决了传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解难以满足的日益增长的需求。该过程主要使用贵金属铂（Pt）作为活性组分，因为它具有优越的活性，尽管其对丙烯的选择性并不完全令人满意。

PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该研究在575°C和1个大气压下进行实验，使用特定的气体组成。

2. 催化剂类型：广泛使用基于Pt的催化剂，重点优化Pt粒子大小和分散度。

3. 工业应用：主要目标是最小化贵金属Pt的使用以降低生产成本，保持高丙烯选择性和高活性水平，并提高抗结焦能力。

焦炭形成显著影响过程效率，导致基于Pt的催化剂失活。研究发现，焦炭形成取决于Pt粒子大小和分散度。较大的Pt粒子和多个Pt-Pt位点通过丙烯的深度脱氢、裂解和二次反应促进焦炭形成。

减少焦炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. 使用原子分散的Pt催化剂：当Pt粒子达到原子级分散时，多个Pt-Pt位点消失，有效抑制导致焦炭形成的不需要的副反应。

2. 优化Pt粒子大小：较小的Pt粒子，特别是原子分散的Pt，由于焦炭形成减少，显示出改善的选择性和稳定性。

3. 控制反应条件：虽然在给定的引用中没有明确说明，但优化温度、压力和气体组成可以帮助最小化焦炭形成。

4. 开发新型催化剂载体：该研究使用Al2O3作为载体，但探索其他材料或改性可能会改善抗结焦性能。

通过实施这些策略，研究人员和行业专业人士可以致力于更高效、更稳定的PDH过程，提高催化剂寿命和再生能力。
