[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory."

[3] "The critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability."

[4] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties."

[5] "The multiple PtPt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.)."

[6] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 575°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble platinum (Pt) is widely used due to its superior activity. However, efforts are being made to improve its selectivity and minimize usage to lower costs.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the propylene production industry due to its ability to meet growing demand.

The main challenge in PDH is coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which significantly impacts process efficiency by causing catalyst deactivation. Coke formation is primarily associated with the presence of multiple Pt-Pt sites, which promote deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and secondary reactions.

Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst regeneration include:

1. Atomic-level dispersion of Pt particles: This approach eliminates multiple Pt-Pt sites, effectively inhibiting undesired side reactions and reducing the coking rate.

2. Optimizing catalyst design: Developing catalysts that maintain high propylene selectivity while exhibiting high activity and increased anticoking ability.

3. Controlling reaction conditions: Adjusting parameters such as temperature and pressure to minimize coke formation.

4. Regular catalyst regeneration: Implementing efficient regeneration processes to remove coke deposits and restore catalyst activity.

By addressing these aspects, researchers and industry professionals can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process for propene production.

催化直接脱氢法（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产替代方法，可以满足传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足的日益增长的需求。PDH的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（如575°C）和常压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：贵金属铂（Pt）因其优越的活性而被广泛使用。然而，目前正在努力提高其选择性并最小化使用量以降低成本。

3. 工业应用：由于PDH能够满足不断增长的需求，它在丙烯生产行业中变得越来越重要。

PDH的主要挑战是Pt基催化剂上的积炭形成，这显著影响了过程效率，导致催化剂失活。积炭形成主要与多个Pt-Pt位点的存在有关，这些位点促进了丙烯的深度脱氢、裂解和二次反应。

减少积炭形成和改善催化剂再生的策略包括：

1. Pt颗粒的原子级分散：这种方法消除了多个Pt-Pt位点，有效抑制了不期望的副反应并减少了积炭速率。

2. 优化催化剂设计：开发在保持高丙烯选择性的同时具有高活性和增强抗积炭能力的催化剂。

3. 控制反应条件：调整温度和压力等参数以最小化积炭形成。

4. 定期催化剂再生：实施有效的再生过程以去除积炭沉积物并恢复催化剂活性。

通过解决这些方面，研究人员和行业专业人士可以提高PDH丙烯生产过程的效率和可持续性。
