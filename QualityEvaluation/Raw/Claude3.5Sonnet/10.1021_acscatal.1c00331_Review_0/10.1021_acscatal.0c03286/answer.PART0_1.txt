[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative as a result of the ever-increasing demand for propylene hardly being met by traditional methods of propene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[2] "Noble Pt is widely used as an active component in PDH due to its superior activity. Nevertheless, its selectivity to propylene is not entirely satisfactory."

[3] "Besides, the gradual catalyst deactivation owing to the formation of coke remains an insuperable issue."

[4] "Therefore, the critical requirements in PDH are (1) to minimize noble Pt usage for lowering production costs; (2) to maintain high propylene selectivity at high levels of activity; and (3) to increase anticoking ability."

[5] "The deactivation of Pt-based catalysts for PDH mainly originates from the formation of coke; an analysis procedure was performed to obtain comprehensive information about the size effects on coke properties."

[6] "When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple PtPt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions. Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases."

Catalytic direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is an important alternative method for propene production, addressing the increasing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet. The key considerations for PDH include:

1. Reaction conditions: The process typically operates at high temperatures (e.g., 575°C) and atmospheric pressure.

2. Catalyst types: Noble platinum (Pt) is widely used as the active component due to its superior activity. However, researchers are exploring ways to improve its selectivity and stability.

3. Industrial applications: PDH is becoming increasingly important in the chemical industry as a dedicated propylene production method.

The main challenge in PDH is coke formation on Pt-based catalysts, which significantly impacts process efficiency by causing gradual catalyst deactivation. Strategies to mitigate coke formation and improve catalyst performance include:

1. Minimizing Pt usage while maintaining high activity and selectivity.
2. Optimizing Pt particle size and dispersion.
3. Developing atomically dispersed Pt catalysts, which show improved propene selectivity and reduced coking rates.
4. Exploring the use of promoters or support materials to enhance catalyst stability.

Improving catalyst regeneration techniques is also crucial for maintaining long-term process efficiency. The research focuses on understanding the relationship between Pt particle size, catalytic performance, and coke formation to design more effective and stable catalysts for industrial PDH applications.

催化直接脱氢（PDH）是一种重要的丙烯生产替代方法，满足了传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足的日益增长的需求。PDH的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 反应条件：该过程通常在高温（如575°C）和大气压下进行。

2. 催化剂类型：由于其优越的活性，贵金属铂（Pt）被广泛用作活性组分。然而，研究人员正在探索提高其选择性和稳定性的方法。

3. 工业应用：PDH正成为化工行业越来越重要的专门丙烯生产方法。

PDH的主要挑战是Pt基催化剂上的积碳形成，这显著影响了过程效率，导致催化剂逐渐失活。减少积碳形成和改善催化剂性能的策略包括：

1. 在保持高活性和选择性的同时最小化Pt的使用。
2. 优化Pt粒子尺寸和分散度。
3. 开发原子分散的Pt催化剂，表现出改善的丙烯选择性和降低的积碳率。
4. 探索使用助剂或支持材料来增强催化剂稳定性。

改进催化剂再生技术对于维持长期过程效率也至关重要。研究重点是了解Pt粒子尺寸、催化性能和积碳形成之间的关系，以设计更有效和稳定的工业PDH应用催化剂。
