[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)"

[2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen"

[3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells"

[4] "Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods"

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR).

Ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple but generally produce catalysts with lower activities compared to more sophisticated approaches. HDP and RDP methods are more advanced techniques that can yield catalysts with improved performance. The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters via reduction of precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen.

The MAPR technique is a novel method that uses microwave irradiation to achieve uniform heating of metal precursors rapidly. This results in shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional methods. MAPR has shown promise in synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells and can produce catalysts with high activity and selectivity.

Each method has its advantages and applications. The choice of synthesis method depends on the desired catalyst properties, intended application, and available resources. More sophisticated methods like HDP, RDP, and MAPR generally offer better control over catalyst structure and properties, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance in various applications.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括离子交换、浸渍法（IMP）、均相沉淀法（HDP）、还原沉淀法（RDP）和微波辅助多元醇还原法（MAPR）。

离子交换和浸渍法简单，但通常产生的催化剂活性较低，相比之下，更复杂的方法效果更好。HDP和RDP是更先进的技术，可以生产性能更好的催化剂。RDP方法涉及在预还原的父金属催化剂上吸附氢气，然后通过吸附的氢气还原前驱体来沉积促进剂。

MAPR技术是一种新型方法，利用微波辐射快速实现金属前驱体的均匀加热。这导致结晶时间更短，成核更均匀，比传统方法更有优势。MAPR在合成用于燃料电池的铂基电催化剂方面显示出了前景，可以生产具有高活性和选择性的催化剂。

每种方法都有其优点和应用领域。合成方法的选择取决于所需的催化剂性能、预期应用和可用资源。像HDP、RDP和MAPR这样的更复杂方法通常能更好地控制催化剂结构和性能，可能会在各种应用中带来更好的催化性能。
