[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)"

[2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen"

[3] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells"

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR).

Ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple to perform but generally produce catalysts with lower activities compared to more advanced techniques. 

HDP and RDP are considered more sophisticated approaches. RDP involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, then depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles by reducing promoter precursors with the adsorbed hydrogen. This method results in close contact between promoters and main active centers, leading to favorable catalytic properties.

MAPR is a novel technique that uses microwave irradiation to heat metal precursors rapidly and uniformly. This results in shorter crystallization times and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional methods. MAPR has shown promise in synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells and has potential applications in other areas of catalyst production.

Overall, while simpler methods like ion-exchange and impregnation are widely used, more advanced techniques such as HDP, RDP, and MAPR offer potential advantages in terms of catalyst activity, promoter-active site interactions, and particle size control. The choice of method depends on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

支撑型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括离子交换法、浸渍法(IMP)、均相沉积沉淀法(HDP)、还原沉积沉淀法(RDP)和微波辅助多元醇还原法(MAPR)。

离子交换法和浸渍法操作简单，但通常产生的催化剂活性较低，不如更先进的技术。

HDP和RDP被认为是更复杂的方法。RDP涉及在预还原的母体金属催化剂上吸附氢气，然后通过吸附的氢气还原促进剂前体，将促进剂沉积在预形成的金属纳米粒子上。这种方法使促进剂和主要活性中心紧密接触，从而产生有利的催化性能。

MAPR是一种新技术，使用微波辐射快速均匀地加热金属前体。与传统方法相比，这种方法可缩短结晶时间并产生更均匀的成核。MAPR在合成用于燃料电池的铂基电催化剂方面显示出潜力，并有望应用于催化剂生产的其他领域。

总的来说，虽然离子交换和浸渍等较简单的方法被广泛使用，但HDP、RDP和MAPR等更先进的技术在催化剂活性、促进剂-活性位点相互作用和粒径控制方面具有潜在优势。方法的选择取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性能。
