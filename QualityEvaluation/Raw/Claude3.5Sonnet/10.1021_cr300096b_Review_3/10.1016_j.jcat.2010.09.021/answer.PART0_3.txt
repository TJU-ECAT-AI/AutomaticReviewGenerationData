[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)"

[2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen"

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include ion-exchange, impregnation (IMP), homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP), reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR).

Ion-exchange and impregnation methods are simple to perform but generally produce catalysts with lower activities compared to more advanced techniques. HDP and RDP are considered more sophisticated approaches that can yield better catalytic performance.

The RDP method involves adsorbing hydrogen on a pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles through reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen. This method can result in close contact between promoters and main active centers, leading to favorable catalytic properties.

MAPR is a novel technique that uses microwave irradiation to rapidly and uniformly heat metal precursors. This method offers advantages such as shorter crystallization time and more homogeneous nucleation compared to conventional preparation methods. MAPR has shown promise in synthesizing Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells and can produce catalysts with high activity and selectivity for certain reactions, such as cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation.

Overall, while simpler methods like ion-exchange and impregnation are widely used, more advanced techniques such as HDP, RDP, and MAPR offer potential advantages in terms of catalyst performance and efficiency of production. The choice of method depends on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括离子交换法、浸渍法（IMP）、均相沉积沉淀法（HDP）、还原沉积沉淀法（RDP）和微波辅助多元醇还原法（MAPR）。

离子交换和浸渍方法操作简单，但通常产生的催化剂活性较低，与更先进的技术相比效果较差。HDP和RDP被认为是更复杂的方法，可以产生更好的催化性能。

RDP方法涉及在预还原的母体金属催化剂上吸附氢气，然后通过吸附的氢气还原促进剂前体，将促进剂沉积在预形成的金属纳米颗粒上。这种方法可以使促进剂和主要活性中心紧密接触，从而产生良好的催化性能。

MAPR是一种新型技术，利用微波辐射快速均匀地加热金属前体。与传统制备方法相比，这种方法具有结晶时间短、成核更均匀等优点。MAPR在合成用于燃料电池的铂基电催化剂方面显示出了前景，并可以生产出对某些反应（如肉桂醛加氢）具有高活性和选择性的催化剂。

总的来说，虽然离子交换和浸渍等较简单的方法被广泛使用，但HDP、RDP和MAPR等更先进的技术在催化剂性能和生产效率方面具有潜在优势。方法的选择取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性能。
