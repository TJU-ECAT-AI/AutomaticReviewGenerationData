The literature discusses two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used to prepare the monometallic Pt/SiO2 catalyst.

2. Controlled surface reactions: Used to prepare bimetallic PtSn catalysts, derived from Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques.

The controlled surface reaction method involves reacting a reduced monometallic catalyst with an organometallic precursor (SnBu4) in a paraffinic solvent. This method allows for selective deposition of tin on supported platinum.

Advantages of the controlled surface reaction method include:
- High selectivity in metal deposition
- Better control over the bimetallic composition
- Preservation of particle size distribution

The literature does not provide a direct comparison of these methods in terms of overall efficacy. However, the controlled surface reaction method appears to offer more precise control over the bimetallic catalyst composition and structure, which can be advantageous for tailoring catalytic properties for specific applications.

文献讨论了两种支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 离子交换法：用于制备单金属Pt/SiO2催化剂。

2. 受控表面反应法：用于制备双金属PtSn催化剂，源自金属表面有机金属化学(SOMC/M)技术。

受控表面反应法涉及将还原后的单金属催化剂与有机金属前驱体(SnBu4)在石蜡溶剂中反应。这种方法允许锡选择性地沉积在负载的铂上。

受控表面反应法的优点包括：
- 金属沉积的高选择性
- 对双金属组成的更好控制
- 保持粒径分布

文献没有直接比较这些方法的整体效果。然而，受控表面反应法似乎能更精确地控制双金属催化剂的组成和结构，这对于针对特定应用定制催化性能可能是有利的。
