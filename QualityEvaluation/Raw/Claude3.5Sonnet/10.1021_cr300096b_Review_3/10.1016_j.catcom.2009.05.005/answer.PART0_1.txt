[1] "The monometallic catalyst was prepared by ion exchange, using SiO2 as support (Aerosil Degussa, 180 m2 g1), previously treated with ammonia solution."

[2] "Bimetallic PtSn catalysts were prepared by controlled surface reactions, using techniques derived from the Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M)"

[3] "According to this procedure, the monometallic catalyst, previously reduced, was reacted with a solution of SnBu4 in a paraffinic solvent. The reaction was carried out in H2 flow for 4 h at either 363 or 393 K, using n-heptane or n-decane, respectively, as solvent."

The literature describes two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used to prepare the monometallic Pt/SiO2 catalyst. This method involves treating the support with ammonia solution and then contacting it with a platinum precursor solution.

2. Controlled surface reactions: Used to prepare the bimetallic PtSn catalysts. This method, derived from Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M), involves reacting the reduced monometallic catalyst with an organotin compound (SnBu4) in a paraffinic solvent under H2 flow.

The controlled surface reaction method offers several advantages:
- It allows for precise control over the tin content and distribution on the catalyst surface.
- It ensures that tin is selectively deposited on the platinum, forming well-defined bimetallic phases.
- It does not significantly affect the particle size distribution compared to the monometallic catalyst.

This method is particularly effective for producing bimetallic catalysts with specific compositions and structures, which can lead to improved catalytic performance in reactions such as the selective hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

Overall, while ion exchange is a common method for preparing monometallic catalysts, the controlled surface reaction technique offers greater control and specificity in the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring precise tuning of catalyst properties.

文献描述了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 离子交换法：用于制备单金属Pt/SiO2催化剂。这种方法包括用氨水处理载体，然后与铂前体溶液接触。

2. 受控表面反应法：用于制备双金属PtSn催化剂。这种方法源自金属表面有机金属化学(SOMC/M)，包括在氢气流中将还原后的单金属催化剂与有机锡化合物(SnBu4)在石蜡溶剂中反应。

受控表面反应法具有以下几个优点：
- 它允许精确控制催化剂表面的锡含量和分布。
- 它确保锡选择性地沉积在铂上，形成定义明确的双金属相。
- 与单金属催化剂相比，它不会显著影响粒径分布。

这种方法特别适用于生产具有特定成分和结构的双金属催化剂，可以提高催化性能，例如在糠醛选择性加氢制糠醇的反应中。

总的来说，虽然离子交换是制备单金属催化剂的常用方法，但受控表面反应技术在双金属催化剂的合成中提供了更大的控制性和特异性，使其特别适用于需要精确调整催化剂性能的应用。
