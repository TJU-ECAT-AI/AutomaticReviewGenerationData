[1] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."

[2] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal. This technique is here referred to as reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)."

[3] "Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds have also been reported. In that method one of the organic ligand moieties of the promotercomplex reacts with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface to bind the organometallic compound to the metal surface."

[4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated, detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include impregnation, reductive deposition precipitation (RDP), and controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds. 

Impregnation is widely used but does not necessarily result in close contact between the two metals. RDP involves deposition of the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal, and has shown advantages for catalytic performance. Controlled surface reactions use organometallic compounds that react with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface.

RDP appears to be particularly promising as it can achieve close interaction between the metals, which is believed to be important for catalyst performance. However, detailed characterization of the metal interactions from RDP is still lacking. The controlled surface reaction method risks depositing inactive phases on the support.

Overall, RDP seems to offer potential advantages in achieving close metal contact compared to impregnation, but more research is needed to fully characterize and optimize the technique. The choice of method depends on the specific application and metals involved.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括浸渍法、还原沉积法（RDP）和有机金属化合物的控制表面反应法。

浸渍法使用广泛，但不一定能使两种金属紧密接触。RDP涉及通过第一种金属催化的氧化还原化学反应沉积第二种金属，已经显示出对催化性能的优势。控制表面反应法使用与金属表面吸附的氢反应的有机金属化合物。

RDP似乎特别有前景，因为它可以实现金属之间的紧密相互作用，这被认为对催化剂性能很重要。然而，对RDP产生的金属相互作用的详细表征仍然缺乏。控制表面反应法存在在载体上沉积无活性相的风险。

总的来说，与浸渍法相比，RDP似乎在实现金属紧密接触方面具有潜在优势，但需要更多研究来全面表征和优化该技术。方法的选择取决于具体应用和涉及的金属。
