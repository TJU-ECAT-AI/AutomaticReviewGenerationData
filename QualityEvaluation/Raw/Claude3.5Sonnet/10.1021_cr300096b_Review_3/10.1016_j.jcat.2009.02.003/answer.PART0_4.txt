[1] "Various ways to prepare bimetallic catalysts for different applications have been reported"

[2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."

[3] "Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds have also been reported"

[4] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal"

[5] "Preparation of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can also be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction. The latter situation results in underpotential deposition: adatoms can be deposited on particular sites of the metal surface whereby the equilibrium potential is shifted and enables creation of submonolayers of adatoms"

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation techniques: These are widely used but may not result in close contact between the two metals.

2. Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds: This method involves reacting organic ligand moieties with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface.

3. Reductive deposition precipitation (RDP): This technique deposits the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal. 

4. Underpotential deposition: A variation of RDP performed below the equilibrium potential, enabling creation of submonolayers of adatoms.

These methods compare as follows:

- Impregnation is common but may not achieve optimal metal interaction.
- Controlled surface reactions can be precise but risk depositing inactive phases on the support.
- RDP and underpotential deposition offer promising control over metal-metal interactions.

Overall, RDP and its variations appear most effective for achieving close bimetallic contact, which is important for catalyst performance. However, the choice of method depends on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍技术：广泛使用，但可能无法实现两种金属之间的紧密接触。

2. 有机金属化合物的受控表面反应：这种方法涉及有机配体部分与金属表面吸附的氢气反应。

3. 还原沉积沉淀法（RDP）：这种技术通过第一种金属催化的氧化还原化学反应沉积第二种金属。

4. 欠电位沉积：RDP的一种变体，在平衡电位以下进行，能够创建原子层下的吸附原子。

这些方法的比较如下：

- 浸渍法常见但可能无法实现最佳的金属相互作用。
- 受控表面反应可以精确，但存在在载体上沉积无活性相的风险。
- RDP和欠电位沉积提供了对金属-金属相互作用的有前景的控制。

总的来说，RDP及其变体似乎是实现双金属紧密接触的最有效方法，这对催化剂性能很重要。然而，方法的选择取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性能。
