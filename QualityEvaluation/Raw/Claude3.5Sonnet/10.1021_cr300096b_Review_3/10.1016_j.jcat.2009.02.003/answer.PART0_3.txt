[1] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."

[2] "Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds have also been reported"

[3] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal"

[4] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated, detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation techniques
2. Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds  
3. Reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)

Impregnation is widely used but may not result in close contact between metals. Controlled surface reactions can create bimetallic surfaces but risk depositing inactive phases on the support. RDP shows promise for creating close metal-promoter interactions, though detailed characterization has been lacking. Overall, RDP appears most effective for producing catalysts with intimate bimetallic contact, which can enhance selectivity in reactions like cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. However, each method has potential advantages for different applications, and the optimal technique depends on the specific catalyst system and desired properties.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括:

1. 浸渍技术
2. 有机金属化合物的受控表面反应
3. 还原沉积沉淀(RDP)

浸渍法使用广泛,但可能无法使金属之间紧密接触。受控表面反应可以创建双金属表面,但有在载体上沉积无活性相的风险。RDP显示出创造金属-助剂紧密相互作用的前景,尽管缺乏详细的表征。总的来说,RDP似乎是生产具有亲密双金属接触的催化剂的最有效方法,这可以增强肉桂醛氢化等反应的选择性。然而,每种方法对不同的应用都有潜在的优势,最佳技术取决于特定的催化剂体系和所需的性能。
