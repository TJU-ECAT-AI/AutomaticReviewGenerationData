          [1] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

[2] "A total of 2.000 g of NH4+PILC (60120 mesh) was added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing 0.037 g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O. The mixture was stirred for 96 h at r.t., and then washed with distilled water till Cl ions disappearance."

[3] "As example of the commercial catalysts, a reference sample, containing the same total amount of noble metals, was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Pd- and Pt-containing salts on a silicaalumina by Engelhard, according to a widely claimed industrial patent"

[4] "The catalysts were characterized by XRPD, N2 physisorption, ammonia TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy."

          The literature primarily discusses two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: This method was used to prepare Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay (PILC) supports. The process involves adding the support to an aqueous solution containing metal salts, stirring for an extended period (96 hours), washing, and drying. This method may offer advantages in achieving a more uniform dispersion of metal particles throughout the support structure, especially for layered supports like clays.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: This method was used to prepare a reference Pd/Pt catalyst on silica-alumina support. It is described as a widely used industrial method, likely due to its simplicity and scalability for industrial production.

The choice of method impacts metal distribution and interaction with the support, which can affect catalyst performance. Ion exchange may offer better metal dispersion and stronger metal-support interactions, particularly suitable for supports with ion exchange capacity like clays. Incipient wetness impregnation allows for precise control of metal loading but may result in larger metal particles.

Both methods can produce effective catalysts for hydrotreatment reactions, as demonstrated in the study. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison of the efficacy of these methods. The selection of the synthesis method depends on the specific support material, metals used, and desired catalyst properties.

The catalysts were characterized using various techniques such as XRPD, N2 physisorption, ammonia TPD, and FT-IR spectroscopy, indicating the importance of thorough analysis in understanding the properties and performance of the synthesized catalysts.

          文献主要讨论了两种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 离子交换法：该方法用于在柱撑粘土（PILC）载体上制备Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。该过程包括将载体加入含有金属盐的水溶液中，长时间搅拌（96小时），洗涤和干燥。这种方法可能在实现金属颗粒在载体结构中更均匀分散方面具有优势，尤其是对于像粘土这样的层状载体。

2. 浸渍法：该方法用于在硅铝载体上制备参比Pd/Pt催化剂。它被描述为一种广泛使用的工业方法，可能是由于其简单性和工业生产的可扩展性。

方法的选择会影响金属的分布和与载体的相互作用，从而影响催化剂的性能。离子交换法可能提供更好的金属分散性和更强的金属-载体相互作用，特别适用于具有离子交换能力的载体，如粘土。浸渍法允许精确控制金属负载量，但可能导致较大的金属颗粒。

研究表明，这两种方法都可以制备用于加氢处理反应的有效催化剂。然而，文献并未提供这些方法效果的直接比较。合成方法的选择取决于特定的载体材料、使用的金属和所需的催化剂性能。

催化剂使用各种技术进行表征，如XRPD、N2物理吸附、氨TPD和FT-IR光谱，表明了全面分析在理解合成催化剂的性质和性能方面的重要性。
