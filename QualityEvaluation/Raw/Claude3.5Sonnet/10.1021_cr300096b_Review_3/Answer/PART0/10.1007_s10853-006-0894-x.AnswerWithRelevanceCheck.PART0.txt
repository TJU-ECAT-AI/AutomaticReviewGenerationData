          [1] "Cobalt was loaded on the supports by two methods. Classical impregnation with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O was used to prepare the precursor which was subsequently dried and calcined for 1 h at 773 K in air (samples designated from here on as samples I)."

          [2] "The second method applied is described by Barbier et al. [10] as ammonia method. It leads to the formation of finely dispersed cobalt oxide on the support."

          [3] "Platinum was introduced by impregnation with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 on the Co-containing supports after their calcination except for the kenyaite sample (Co/Ken-AM) where impregnation was performed on the freshly prepared (not calcined) precursor."

          The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

          1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g., Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O), followed by drying and calcination.

          2. Ammonia method: This technique leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves using ammonia to functionalize the support surface, form metal amine ions, and precipitate metal hydroxides.

          For introducing the second metal (platinum in this case), impregnation with an aqueous solution of the metal precursor (e.g., Pt(NH3)4Cl2) is used.

          Advantages and comparisons:
          - The ammonia method appears to have an advantage in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles compared to classical impregnation.
          - This can lead to better catalytic performance in some cases, particularly for monometallic cobalt catalysts in benzene oxidation.
          - The classical impregnation method may be simpler to implement.
          - The choice of method may depend on the specific metals, supports, and desired catalyst properties for a given application.
          - The promoting effect of platinum addition was more evident for samples prepared by impregnation compared to those prepared by the ammonia method.

          Overall efficacy:
          The efficacy of these methods can vary depending on factors such as the support material, metal precursors, and preparation conditions. The literature suggests that the ammonia method generally produces more active catalysts for benzene oxidation compared to the impregnation method, likely due to the finer dispersion of metal oxide particles. However, a comprehensive comparison of all commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts is not provided, so a full assessment of their relative advantages, applications, and overall efficacy across different applications cannot be made based solely on this literature.

          文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

          1. 经典浸渍法：这种方法包括用金属前驱体的水溶液（如Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O）浸渍载体，然后进行干燥和焙烧。

          2. 氨法：这种方法可以在载体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它涉及使用氨来功能化载体表面，形成金属胺离子，并沉淀金属氢氧化物。

          对于引入第二种金属（在本例中为铂），使用金属前驱体的水溶液（如Pt(NH3)4Cl2）进行浸渍。

          优势和比较：
          - 氨法似乎在产生更细分散的金属氧化物颗粒方面具有优势，相比于经典浸渍法。
          - 这在某些情况下可能导致更好的催化性能，特别是对于苯氧化反应中的单金属钴催化剂。
          - 经典浸渍法可能更容易实施。
          - 方法的选择可能取决于特定的金属、载体和特定应用所需的催化剂性质。
          - 与氨法制备的样品相比，铂添加对浸渍法制备的样品的促进作用更为明显。

          整体效果：
          这些方法的有效性可能因载体材料、金属前驱体和制备条件等因素而异。文献表明，氨法通常比浸渍法制备的催化剂在苯氧化反应中表现出更高的活性，这可能是由于金属氧化物颗粒分散得更细的缘故。然而，该文献并未提供所有常用的支撑型双金属催化剂合成方法的全面比较，因此仅基于这篇文献无法对它们在不同应用中的相对优势、应用和整体效果进行全面评估。
