          [1] "Gold catalysts were synthesised by a deposition-precipitation technique of the gold nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (Degussa, P-25)."

          [2] "Finally, the bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a proper amount of Pt onto the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council, using H2PtCl6 as precursor, followed by a treatment in H2 flow at 723 K."

          The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

          1. Deposition-precipitation: Used to synthesize gold catalysts by depositing gold nanoparticles onto TiO2 support.

          2. Impregnation: Used to prepare bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts by impregnating platinum onto pre-existing Au/TiO2 catalysts.

          The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. However, it suggests that the impregnation method allows for the creation of bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal contents, which can lead to improved catalytic performance while maintaining desirable properties like chemoselectivity. More information would be needed to fully answer the question about how these methods compare.

          文献提到了两种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

          1. 沉积-沉淀法：用于合成金催化剂，将金纳米颗粒沉积在TiO2载体上。

          2. 浸渍法：用于制备双金属Au@Pt/TiO2催化剂，通过将铂浸渍到预先存在的Au/TiO2催化剂上。

          该文件没有提供这些方法在优势、应用和整体效果方面的全面比较。然而，它表明浸渍法可以创造具有优化金属含量的双金属催化剂，从而在保持理想性能（如化学选择性）的同时提高催化性能。要全面回答这些方法如何比较的问题，需要更多信息。
