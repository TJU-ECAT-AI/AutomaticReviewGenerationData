          [4] "Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts were synthesized in order to study the effects of metal atomic ratio and impregnation sequence."
          [5] "Pt and Ni precursor solutions were made by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) precursor salts. Catalysts were dried at 373 K for 10 h and calcined at 563 K for 2 h. Sequentially impregnated catalysts were dried and calcined at the same conditions after each impregnation."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts discussed in the provided literature is incipient wetness impregnation. This method was used to synthesize γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts. The study explored two main variables:

          1. Impregnation sequence: Three approaches were studied - Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation.
          2. Metal atomic ratio: Different Pt:Ni ratios were examined (1:1, 1:3, and 1:10).

          Advantages of this method include:
          - Simplicity of the process
          - Ability to control metal loading and sequence
          - Flexibility to adjust synthesis parameters for optimizing catalyst performance

          The study found that co-impregnation resulted in the highest catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions and the greatest extent of bimetallic bond formation. This suggests that co-impregnation may be more effective in promoting bimetallic interactions.

          Applications discussed include hydrogenation of conjugated C=C bonds, specifically benzene and 1,3-butadiene.

          In terms of efficacy, the incipient wetness impregnation method appears effective for producing supported bimetallic catalysts with tunable compositions and structures. The ability to control impregnation sequence and metal ratios allows for optimization of catalyst properties for specific applications.

          However, it's important to note that the literature doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of all possible synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts, focusing specifically on variations within the incipient wetness impregnation method.

          提供的文献中讨论的最常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法。这种方法被用来合成γ-Al2O3负载的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂。研究探讨了两个主要变量：

          1. 浸渍顺序：研究了三种方法 - 先镍、先铂和共浸渍。
          2. 金属原子比：考察了不同的Pt:Ni比例（1:1、1:3和1:10）。

          这种方法的优点包括：
          - 过程简单
          - 能够控制金属负载量和顺序
          - 灵活调整合成参数以优化催化剂性能

          研究发现，共浸渍法在加氢反应中表现出最高的催化活性，并形成了最多的双金属键。这表明共浸渍可能更有效地促进双金属相互作用。

          讨论的应用包括共轭C=C键的加氢，特别是苯和1,3-丁二烯。

          在效果方面，浸渍法似乎是一种有效的方法，可以制备具有可调组成和结构的负载型双金属催化剂。控制浸渍顺序和金属比例的能力允许针对特定应用优化催化剂性能。

          然而，需要注意的是，文献并未对双金属催化剂的所有可能合成方法进行全面比较，而是专门关注浸渍法内的变化。
