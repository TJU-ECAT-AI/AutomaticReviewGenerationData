          [1] "Generally speaking, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."

[2] "Compared to the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs, the preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified."

[3] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[4] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[5] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

[6] "Toshima and coworkers have proposed three possible routes for preparation of heterometallic coreshell NPs based on their long-term and systematic studies: 1) Pt@Pd coreshell NPs have been obtained by simultaneous gentle reduction with alcohol for H2PtCl6 and PdCl3 in the presence of PVP; 2) Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been prepared by a so-called hydrogen-sacrificial protective strategy, in which hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of core-metal NPs works as reductant of the second metal ions to produce the shell; 3) physical mixture of two kinds of metal NP in dispersions can spontaneously produce coreshell-structured bimetallic NPs."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation/co-reduction: This straightforward method uses a strong reducing agent to prepare bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) by co-introducing two metal precursors.

2. Successive two-step reduction: This universal method for core-shell bimetallic NPs involves first forming the core metal NPs, then depositing the shell metal on the pre-formed core.

3. One-step reduction: A recently developed route for core-shell NPs using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with different reduction potentials.

4. Galvanic replacement: An effective approach to fabricate hollow core-shell NPs based on differences in reduction potentials between core and shell metal ions.

5. Simultaneous gentle reduction: Using mild reducing agents like alcohols can produce core-shell structures in one step under certain conditions.

6. Hydrogen-sacrificial protective strategy: This method uses hydrogen adsorbed on core metal nanoparticles to reduce shell metal ions, creating well-defined core-shell structures.

7. Physical mixing: In some cases, simply mixing two types of metal nanoparticles can spontaneously produce core-shell bimetallic structures through self-organization.

These methods compare as follows:

- Impregnation/co-reduction is simple and effective for alloy NPs but offers less control over structure.
- Successive reduction allows better control of core-shell structures but is more complex.
- One-step reduction simplifies the process for core-shell NPs but requires careful selection of reducing agents.
- Galvanic replacement enables hollow structures but is limited to certain metal combinations.
- Simultaneous gentle reduction, hydrogen-sacrificial strategy, and physical mixing offer alternative routes for specific metal combinations and desired structures.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired nanoparticle structure, composition, and application. The flexibility and diversity of preparation strategies, especially for core-shell structures, allow researchers to tailor the synthesis method to their specific requirements.

          支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍/共还原法：这种简单的方法使用强还原剂通过共同引入两种金属前驱体来制备双金属合金纳米粒子（NPs）。

2. 连续两步还原法：这是制备核壳结构双金属NPs的通用方法，首先形成核心金属NPs，然后在预先形成的核上沉积壳层金属。

3. 一步还原法：最近开发的核壳NPs合成路线，使用适当的还原剂来还原具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子。

4. 置换反应法：基于核心和壳层金属离子还原电位差异，制备中空核壳NPs的有效方法。

5. 同时温和还原法：在某些条件下，使用温和的还原剂（如醇类）可以一步生成核壳结构。

6. 氢牺牲保护策略：这种方法利用吸附在核金属纳米粒子上的氢来还原壳金属离子，创造出明确定义的核壳结构。

7. 物理混合法：在某些情况下，简单地混合两种类型的金属纳米粒子可以通过自组织形成核壳双金属结构。

这些方法的比较如下：

- 浸渍/共还原法简单有效，适用于合金NPs，但对结构控制较少。
- 连续还原法对核壳结构控制更好，但过程较复杂。
- 一步还原法简化了核壳NPs的制备过程，但需要谨慎选择还原剂。
- 置换反应法可制备中空结构，但仅限于某些金属组合。
- 同时温和还原、氢牺牲策略和物理混合为特定金属组合和所需结构提供了替代路线。

总的来说，方法的选择取决于所需的纳米粒子结构、成分和应用。制备策略的灵活性和多样性，尤其是对核壳结构而言，使研究人员能够根据具体要求定制合成方法。
