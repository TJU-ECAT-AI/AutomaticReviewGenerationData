          [1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals"

[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods"

[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"

[4] "One possible alternative to traditional preparative techniques is electroless deposition (ED), wherein a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent."

[5] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals"

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These traditional methods are widely used in industrial production due to their simplicity and scalability. However, they often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts with both isolated monometallic particles and bimetallic particles of varying compositions.

Electroless deposition (ED) is presented as a promising alternative method. ED offers better control over metal placement through a controlled chemical reaction that deposits a metal salt onto activated catalytic metal sites. This method can be applied to a wide range of metals and is considered industrially relevant.

Comparing these methods:

1. Traditional methods (impregnation):
Advantages: Simple, scalable for industrial production
Disadvantages: Poor control over metal placement, inconsistent particle composition

2. Electroless deposition (ED):
Advantages: Better control over metal placement, applicable to various metals, industrially relevant
Disadvantages: More complex process than traditional methods

Overall, while traditional impregnation methods are still widely used due to their simplicity, ED shows promise for producing more controlled and potentially more effective bimetallic catalysts. The choice between these methods would depend on the specific requirements of the catalyst and the industrial application.

          支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是连续浸渍法和共浸渍法。这些传统方法由于其简单性和可扩展性而在工业生产中广泛使用。然而，它们通常对金属放置的控制不足，导致催化剂中既有孤立的单金属颗粒，也有成分各异的双金属颗粒。

无电解沉积法(ED)被提出作为一种有前景的替代方法。ED通过受控的化学反应将金属盐沉积到活化的催化金属位点上，从而提供了更好的金属放置控制。这种方法可应用于多种金属，并被认为具有工业相关性。

比较这些方法：

1. 传统方法（浸渍法）：
优点：简单，可扩展用于工业生产
缺点：对金属放置控制不佳，颗粒成分不一致

2. 无电解沉积法（ED）：
优点：对金属放置控制更好，适用于各种金属，具有工业相关性
缺点：过程比传统方法更复杂

总的来说，虽然传统浸渍方法因其简单性仍被广泛使用，但ED在生产更可控和潜在更有效的双金属催化剂方面显示出前景。这些方法的选择将取决于催化剂的具体要求和工业应用。
