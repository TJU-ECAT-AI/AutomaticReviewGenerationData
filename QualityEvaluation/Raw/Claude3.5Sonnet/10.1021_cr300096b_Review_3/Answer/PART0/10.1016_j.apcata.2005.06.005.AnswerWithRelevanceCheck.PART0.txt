          [1] "The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K, overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation (100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of 1 wt.%. The excess of solvent was removed by flowing nitrogen through the slurry at 333 K and the remaining solid was dried overnight at 383 K and heat treated in flowing helium (50 cm3 min1) at 673 K for 4 h (heating rate: 5 K min1) to decompose the nitrate precursor. After this treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration to load 0.2 wt.%."

          The literature primarily discusses sequential impregnation as a synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts. This method involves depositing each metal precursor onto the support separately in sequence. The advantages of sequential impregnation include:

          1. Control over individual metal loadings
          2. Ability to use different solvents for each metal precursor
          3. Potential for better dispersion of metals

          The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of the bimetallic PtZn catalyst compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst in both crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and iso-butane dehydrogenation reactions.

          However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. To fully answer this question and compare advantages, applications, and overall efficacy of various methods, additional information on other common techniques such as co-impregnation, deposition-precipitation, and ion exchange would be necessary.

          该文献主要讨论了顺序浸渍法作为制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法。这种方法涉及将每种金属前驱体依次单独沉积到载体上。顺序浸渍法的优点包括：

          1. 可以控制单个金属的负载量
          2. 可以为每种金属前驱体使用不同的溶剂
          3. 有潜力获得更好的金属分散度

          这种方法的有效性通过双金属PtZn催化剂在巴豆醛加氢和异丁烷脱氢反应中相比单金属Pt催化剂的改进催化性能得到了证明。

          然而，该文献并未提供不同合成方法的全面比较。要完整回答这个问题并比较各种方法的优势、应用和整体效果，还需要关于其他常见技术（如共浸渍法、沉淀-沉积法和离子交换法）的额外信息。
