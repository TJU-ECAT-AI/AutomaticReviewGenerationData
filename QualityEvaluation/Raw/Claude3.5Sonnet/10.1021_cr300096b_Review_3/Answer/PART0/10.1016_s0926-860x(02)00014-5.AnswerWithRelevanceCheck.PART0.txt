          [1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

          [2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

          [3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

          [4] "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3."

          [5] "In this study our two-step tin anchoring has been applied, which consists of: (i) tin anchoring (step 1), and (ii) decomposition of surface organometallic complexes (step 2)."

          [6] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

          1. Conventional impregnation techniques: Widely used but lack control over interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both platinum and the support, and alloy-type surface entities cannot be controlled.

          2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): Uses tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to obtain alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction.

          3. One-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls: Developed for rhodium and other noble or transition metals.

          4. Modified tin anchoring procedures: Allow for increased tin anchoring, resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3.

          5. Two-step tin anchoring: Involves (i) tin anchoring and (ii) decomposition of surface organometallic complexes.

          6. In-situ formation: Sn4+Pt ensemble sites are formed in-situ on supported alloy-type SnPt nanoclusters.

          Comparing these methods:

          - CSRs and modified anchoring procedures offer better control over catalyst composition and structure compared to conventional impregnation.
          - CSRs allow for exclusive tin-platinum interactions, potentially leading to improved catalyst performance.
          - Modified tin anchoring procedures enable higher tin content, which can be advantageous for certain applications.
          - The two-step and in-situ formation methods offer more precise control over the final catalyst structure.

          Applications and efficacy:
          - Catalysts prepared by CSRs and modified anchoring procedures show promise in selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and low-temperature CO oxidation.
          - The choice of method depends on the desired catalyst properties and specific application requirements.
          - Controlled methods (CSRs, modified anchoring, two-step, and in-situ formation) generally offer better efficacy in producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts compared to conventional impregnation techniques.

          支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

          1. 传统浸渍技术：广泛使用但缺乏对形成活性物种所涉及的相互作用的控制。锡被引入铂和载体中，无法控制合金型表面实体的形成。

          2. 受控表面反应（CSRs）：使用锡四烷基和吸附在铂上的氢气，获得具有专一性锡-铂相互作用的合金型支持Sn-Pt催化剂。

          3. 锡四烷基的一步锚定：适用于铑和其他贵金属或过渡金属。

          4. 改进的锡锚定程序：允许增加锡的锚定量，产生具有高达3的Snanch/Pts比率的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。

          5. 两步锡锚定法：包括（i）锡锚定和（ii）表面有机金属络合物的分解。

          6. 原位形成：在支持型合金SnPt纳米簇上原位形成Sn4+Pt集合位点。

          比较这些方法：

          - CSRs和改进的锚定程序与传统浸渍相比，对催化剂组成和结构提供了更好的控制。
          - CSRs允许专一性锡-铂相互作用，可能导致催化剂性能的改善。
          - 改进的锡锚定程序可以实现更高的锡含量，这对某些应用可能有利。
          - 两步法和原位形成法对最终催化剂结构提供更精确的控制。

          应用和效果：
          - 由CSRs和改进的锚定程序制备的催化剂在不饱和醛的选择性加氢和低温CO氧化方面显示出前景。
          - 方法的选择取决于所需的催化剂性质和特定应用要求。
          - 受控方法（CSRs、改进的锚定、两步法和原位形成）与传统浸渍技术相比，通常在生产明确定义的双金属催化剂方面提供更好的效果。
