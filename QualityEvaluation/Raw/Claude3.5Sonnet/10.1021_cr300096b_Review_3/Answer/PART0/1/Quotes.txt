[1] "Cobalt was loaded on the supports by two methods. Classical impregnation with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O was used to prepare the precursor which was subsequently dried and calcined for 1 h at 773 K in air (samples designated from here on as samples I)."

          [2] "The second method applied is described by Barbier et al. [10] as ammonia method. It leads to the formation of finely dispersed cobalt oxide on the support."

          [3] "Platinum was introduced by impregnation with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 on the Co-containing supports after their calcination except for the kenyaite sample (Co/Ken-AM) where impregnation was performed on the freshly prepared (not calcined) precursor."

"Other techniques proposed include chemical reduction [15], hydrolysis [16], vacuum deposition [17], and colloidal methods [19]."
          
          "Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition."
          
          "Platinumcobalt nanoparticles were prepared by a two-microemulsion technique [20], [21], [22], [23]."
          
          "The attractive feature of the two-step microemulsion reduction technique is the ease and accuracy in controlling the composition of the mixed metal nanoparticles."
          
          "For these techniques, however, it is difficult to achieve a consistent alloy composition in the nanoparticles prepared."

[1] "Factors such as metal segregation and sintering, surface enrichment of the inactive metal, and compositional inhomogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation methods."

[2] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distributions, particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide ranging distributions in a given catalyst sample."

[3] "The use of zeolitic supports has shown promise for the preparation of small bimetallic particles, particularly for the platinum-copper system"

[4] "Recently, we reported on the preparation and characterization of supported bimetallic Pt-Au and Pt-Cu catalysts from the molecular cluster precursors Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 and Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8"

[5] "Conventional Pt catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of platinic acid precursors onto the dried silica support."

[1] "Coreshell catalyst structures containing an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell can bring about further improvements in this respect."
          
          [2] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, or electrochemical deposition techniques."
          
          [3] "All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."
          
          [4] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."

[1] "The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K, overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation (100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of 1 wt.%. The excess of solvent was removed by flowing nitrogen through the slurry at 333 K and the remaining solid was dried overnight at 383 K and heat treated in flowing helium (50 cm3 min1) at 673 K for 4 h (heating rate: 5 K min1) to decompose the nitrate precursor. After this treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration to load 0.2 wt.%."

[1] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)."

[2] "Chandler and co-workers, who showed that G5-OH(Pt50) and G5-OH(Pt100) DENs could be deposited onto commercial silica supports and then calcined at 300 C in a O2/He flow to yield supported Pt catalysts that largely retained their original size."

[3] "In addition to depositing DENs onto surfaces, it is also possible to incorporate them into inorganic matrixes to yield catalytically active heterogeneous materials. For example, we have shown that such materials can be prepared by incorporating DENs into solgel matrixes, and then calcining the composite to remove the dendrimer."

[4] "Supported bimetallic nanoparticles can also be prepared via this solgel route, and even after calcining to remove the dendrimer the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained."

[1] "Arguably the key challenge in heterogeneous catalysis for the 21st century is the control of selectivity in highly complex processes, and that requires exquisite control over the design of the catalytic active site."

[2] "Recently, though, novel colloidal and self-assembly approaches have been used to synthesize catalyst with metal nanoparticles displaying excellent size and shape distributions"

[3] "An alternative way to grow small nanoparticles, with diameter of the order of 12 nm and narrow size distributions, is using dendrimer templates"

[4] "Well-defined platinum-based catalysts were prepared via an initial synthesis of dendrimer-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (Pt-DENs) and their subsequent dispersion onto a high-surface-area homemade solgel silica support."

"Preparation of metal nanoparticles (with a diameter of a few nanometres) has been successfully attempted using methods of colloid chemistry [16]. This is based on reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants which then form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles, as opposed to traditional preparation of metal blacks producing usually larger particles or their aggregates [7,17]."

"Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

"Monometallic Pt and Pd [18,19] as well as PdPt particles [2022] were synthesized and tested in catalytic reactions [23]. Catalytic tests could be carried out on the nanoparticles alone or deposited on oxide supports, the latter being more suited for practical purposes."

"Nanosized Pd, Pt and PdPt bimetallic particles were prepared by the reduction of K2PdCl4 (03.8 mM) and/or K2PtCl4 (02.8 mM) in the presence of cationic surfactant, C14TABr (19.5 mM)."

[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]."

[3] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

[4] "During the removal of the CO ligands, the existing metal-metal bonds help to maintain the integrity of the metallic cluster core. Consequently, most of the yielded nanoparticles would retain the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor. In addition, the relatively low decarbonylation temperature used also ensured that sintering was kept to a minimum."

[1] "The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation."
          [2] "Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of metal atomic ratio and the other to study the effect of impregnation sequence."
          [3] "To study the effect of impregnation sequence, three catalysts with Pt:Ni atomic ratio of 1:3 were synthesized with the following sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation."
          [4] "Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts were synthesized in order to study the effects of metal atomic ratio and impregnation sequence."
          [5] "Pt and Ni precursor solutions were made by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) precursor salts. Catalysts were dried at 373 K for 10 h and calcined at 563 K for 2 h. Sequentially impregnated catalysts were dried and calcined at the same conditions after each impregnation."

"1.6 wt.% Pt/Al2O3, 0.8 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 and 0.4 wt.% Pt-0.6 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with and without fluorine (3 wt.% F) were prepared by typical incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) using two different solvents, ethylene glycol or deionized water."

          "The addition of ammonium fluoride was conducted in the same manner as the metals, using deionized water as a solvent. The order of fluorine and metal addition was varied in some catalysts."

[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."

          [2] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and, in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."

          [3] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."

[1] "In previous works, we have prepared bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts by surface redox reaction for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols"

          [2] "In this paper, bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction were tested in selective hydrogenation of citral with the aim of combining the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect."

          [3] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction (catalytic reduction method) were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral."

          [4] "The germanium deposit was introduced by catalytic reduction on the parent catalysts"

[1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support"

[2] "This paper investigates the reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions"

[3] "Previous research has demonstrated the potential for control over nanoparticle size using reverse micelles as nanoreactors, dendrimer encapsulation, and self-assembly of diblock co-polymers into micelles"

[4] "Two impregnation methods were investigated to optimize the use of the micelle method: (1) step-impregnation, where Ni nanoparticles were chemically reduced in microemulsion and then supported, followed by Pt deposition using incipient wetness impregnation, and (2) co-impregnation, where Ni and Pt were chemically reduced simultaneously in microemulsion and then supported."

[1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

          [2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

          [3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

          [4] "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3."

          [5] "In this study our two-step tin anchoring has been applied, which consists of: (i) tin anchoring (step 1), and (ii) decomposition of surface organometallic complexes (step 2)."

          [6] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."

[1] "Various ways to prepare bimetallic catalysts for different applications have been reported"
          [2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
          [3] "Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds have also been reported"
          [4] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal"
          [5] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated, detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."
          [6] "Preparation of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can also be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction. The latter situation results in underpotential deposition: adatoms can be deposited on particular sites of the metal surface whereby the equilibrium potential is shifted and enables creation of submonolayers of adatoms"

[1] "Generally speaking, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."

[2] "Compared to the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs, the preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified."

[3] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[4] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[5] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

[6] "Toshima and coworkers have proposed three possible routes for preparation of heterometallic coreshell NPs based on their long-term and systematic studies: 1) Pt@Pd coreshell NPs have been obtained by simultaneous gentle reduction with alcohol for H2PtCl6 and PdCl3 in the presence of PVP; 2) Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been prepared by a so-called hydrogen-sacrificial protective strategy, in which hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of core-metal NPs works as reductant of the second metal ions to produce the shell; 3) physical mixture of two kinds of metal NP in dispersions can spontaneously produce coreshell-structured bimetallic NPs."

[1] "Supported bimetallic catalysts have been synthesized using a wide range of synthesis techniques. In this section we will provide a summary of some of the most commonly utilized synthesis methods and the potential advantages of each method."

[2] "Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation."

[3] "Slurry synthesis method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas."

[4] "An improved method to achieve higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and then thermally remove the ligands."

[5] "Reductive deposition precipitation is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts."

[6] "Electroless deposition method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst."

[7] "Colloidal synthesis method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles."

[8] "Core−shell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 1−2 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt."

[9] "Reverse micelle synthesis method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution."

          [4] "Monometallic catalysts usually produce the saturated aldehyde, and it is necessary to modify them either by support effects [...] or by addition of a second metal [...] to improve the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."

          [5] "Recently, Reyes et al. [...] as well as Silva et al. [...] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."

[1] "We report on the carbon supported Ni coreePt shell Ni1x@Ptx/C (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) nanoparticles as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). The catalysts are prepared through a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant."

[2] "Ni1x@Ptx NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were chemically prepared through a redox reaction method."

[3] "Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were prepared using similar process depicted above except that the required amount of carbon black was added at 150 C before the reduction reaction."

[4] "Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading)."

[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals"

[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods"

[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"

[4] "One possible alternative to traditional preparative techniques is electroless deposition (ED), wherein a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent."

[5] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals"

[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction)"

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support"

[3] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering"

[4] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

[5] "When the molecular cluster precursors were used as catalyst precursors, small and uniform bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersions were prepared."

[6] "Unfortunately, there are few bimetallic PtM clusters that are ligated exclusively by CO and carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable. There are many molecular PtM clusters stabilized by phosphine ligands (26, 27); however, previous studies using phosphine-stabilized PtAu clusters as catalyst precursors indicated that that the presence of phosphine residues controls the properties of the resulting catalysts (2832)."

[1] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

"Monometallic Pt and Pd [18,19] as well as PdPt particles [2022] were synthesized and tested in catalytic reactions [23]. Catalytic tests could be carried out on the nanoparticles alone or deposited on oxide supports, the latter being more suited for practical purposes."

"Nanosized Pd, Pt and PdPt bimetallic particles were prepared by the reduction of K2PdCl4 (03.8 mM) and/or K2PtCl4 (02.8 mM) in the presence of cationic surfactant, C14TABr (19.5 mM)."

[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]."

[3] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

[4] "During the removal of the CO ligands, the existing metal-metal bonds help to maintain the integrity of the metallic cluster core. Consequently, most of the yielded nanoparticles would retain the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor. In addition, the relatively low decarbonylation temperature used also ensured that sintering was kept to a minimum."

[1] "The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation."
          [2] "Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of metal atomic ratio and the other to study the effect of impregnation sequence."
          [3] "To study the effect of impregnation sequence, three catalysts with Pt:Ni atomic ratio of 1:3 were synthesized with the following sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation."
          [4] "Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts were synthesized in order to study the effects of metal atomic ratio and impregnation sequence."
          [5] "Pt and Ni precursor solutions were made by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) precursor salts. Catalysts were dried at 373 K for 10 h and calcined at 563 K for 2 h. Sequentially impregnated catalysts were dried and calcined at the same conditions after each impregnation."

"1.6 wt.% Pt/Al2O3, 0.8 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 and 0.4 wt.% Pt-0.6 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with and without fluorine (3 wt.% F) were prepared by typical incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) using two different solvents, ethylene glycol or deionized water."

          "The addition of ammonium fluoride was conducted in the same manner as the metals, using deionized water as a solvent. The order of fluorine and metal addition was varied in some catalysts."

[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."

          [2] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and, in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."

          [3] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."

[1] "In previous works, we have prepared bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts by surface redox reaction for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols"

          [2] "In this paper, bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction were tested in selective hydrogenation of citral with the aim of combining the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect."

          [3] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction (catalytic reduction method) were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral."

          [4] "The germanium deposit was introduced by catalytic reduction on the parent catalysts"

[1] "A common synthesis method of supported catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which involves dissolving the metal salt in a volume of water equal to or slightly less than the pore volume of the support"

[2] "This paper investigates the reverse micelle synthesis method, which has been reported to produce uniform metal nanoparticles by chemically reducing metal precursors within microemulsions"

[3] "Previous research has demonstrated the potential for control over nanoparticle size using reverse micelles as nanoreactors, dendrimer encapsulation, and self-assembly of diblock co-polymers into micelles"

[4] "Two impregnation methods were investigated to optimize the use of the micelle method: (1) step-impregnation, where Ni nanoparticles were chemically reduced in microemulsion and then supported, followed by Pt deposition using incipient wetness impregnation, and (2) co-impregnation, where Ni and Pt were chemically reduced simultaneously in microemulsion and then supported."

[1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

          [2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

          [3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

          [4] "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3."

          [5] "In this study our two-step tin anchoring has been applied, which consists of: (i) tin anchoring (step 1), and (ii) decomposition of surface organometallic complexes (step 2)."

          [6] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."

[1] "Various ways to prepare bimetallic catalysts for different applications have been reported"
          [2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
          [3] "Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds have also been reported"
          [4] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal"
          [5] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated, detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."
          [6] "Preparation of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can also be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction. The latter situation results in underpotential deposition: adatoms can be deposited on particular sites of the metal surface whereby the equilibrium potential is shifted and enables creation of submonolayers of adatoms"

[1] "Generally speaking, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."

[2] "Compared to the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs, the preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified."

[3] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[4] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[5] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

[6] "Toshima and coworkers have proposed three possible routes for preparation of heterometallic coreshell NPs based on their long-term and systematic studies: 1) Pt@Pd coreshell NPs have been obtained by simultaneous gentle reduction with alcohol for H2PtCl6 and PdCl3 in the presence of PVP; 2) Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been prepared by a so-called hydrogen-sacrificial protective strategy, in which hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of core-metal NPs works as reductant of the second metal ions to produce the shell; 3) physical mixture of two kinds of metal NP in dispersions can spontaneously produce coreshell-structured bimetallic NPs."

[1] "Supported bimetallic catalysts have been synthesized using a wide range of synthesis techniques. In this section we will provide a summary of some of the most commonly utilized synthesis methods and the potential advantages of each method."

[2] "Incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly utilized method because of its ease in sample preparation."

[3] "Slurry synthesis method is used for synthesizing catalysts with high metal loadings and/or supports with low surface areas."

[4] "An improved method to achieve higher uniformity of bimetallic catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors onto the support and then thermally remove the ligands."

[5] "Reductive deposition precipitation is a useful method to produce highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic catalysts."

[6] "Electroless deposition method is similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction, catalyzed by Pt, to deposit a metal salt onto an activated metal site of a preexisting monometallic catalyst."

[7] "Colloidal synthesis method has the potential to synthesize supported catalysts with precise control over the size and composition of the bimetallic particles because the metallic colloid is prepared in the presence of a surfactant, which prevents the coalescence of small particles."

[8] "Core−shell nanoparticle catalysts consist of a transition metal core covered with a 1−2 monolayer shell of another metal, such as Pt."

[9] "Reverse micelle synthesis method uses microemulsions to produce supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution."

[10] "Synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with dendrimer supports yields monodisperse particles with a diameter of 1−2 nm."

[1] "Gold catalysts were synthesised by a deposition-precipitation technique of the gold nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (Degussa, P-25)."

          [2] "Finally, the bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a proper amount of Pt onto the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council, using H2PtCl6 as precursor, followed by a treatment in H2 flow at 723 K."

[1] "Bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts were prepared by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic rhodium or platinum catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in water (catalytic reduction method)."

          [4] "Monometallic catalysts usually produce the saturated aldehyde, and it is necessary to modify them either by support effects [...] or by addition of a second metal [...] to improve the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."

          [5] "Recently, Reyes et al. [...] as well as Silva et al. [...] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."

[1] "We report on the carbon supported Ni coreePt shell Ni1x@Ptx/C (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) nanoparticles as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). The catalysts are prepared through a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant."

[2] "Ni1x@Ptx NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were chemically prepared through a redox reaction method."

[3] "Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were prepared using similar process depicted above except that the required amount of carbon black was added at 150 C before the reduction reaction."

[4] "Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading)."

[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals"

[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods"

[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"

[4] "One possible alternative to traditional preparative techniques is electroless deposition (ED), wherein a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent."

[5] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals"

[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction)"

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support"

[3] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering"

[4] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

[5] "When the molecular cluster precursors were used as catalyst precursors, small and uniform bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersions were prepared."

[6] "Unfortunately, there are few bimetallic PtM clusters that are ligated exclusively by CO and carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable. There are many molecular PtM clusters stabilized by phosphine ligands (26, 27); however, previous studies using phosphine-stabilized PtAu clusters as catalyst precursors indicated that that the presence of phosphine residues controls the properties of the resulting catalysts (2832)."

[1] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

          [5] "Preliminary work in our research group demonstrated the specificity of the reactions that take place during the preparation of bimetallic catalysts by means of SOMC/M techniques, concluding that all of the tin added is deposited selectively on supported platinum"

[1] "Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)"

[2] "For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen"
