Controlled surface reactions: Used to prepare bimetallic PtSn catalysts, derived from Surface Organometallic Chemistry on Metals (SOMC/M) techniques. This method involves reacting a pre-reduced monometallic catalyst with an organometallic precursor (SnBu4) in a paraffinic solvent under controlled conditions.\n\n          The controlled surface reaction method (SOMC/M) offers several advantages:\n          - It allows for precise control over the tin content and distribution on the catalyst surface.\n          - It ensures selective deposition of tin on supported platinum, forming well-defined bimetallic phases.\n          - It preserves the particle size distribution of the original monometallic catalyst.\n          - It enables the creation of tailored bimetallic catalysts with specific compositions and structures.\n\n          The SOMC/M technique has been shown to be particularly effective in producing highly selective and active PtSn catalysts for various applications, such as the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in these reactions.\n\n          While the literature doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of all synthesis methods, it demonstrates that the combination of ion exchange (for monometallic preparation) and SOMC/M (for bimetallic modification) is effective in producing high-performance bimetallic catalysts.
