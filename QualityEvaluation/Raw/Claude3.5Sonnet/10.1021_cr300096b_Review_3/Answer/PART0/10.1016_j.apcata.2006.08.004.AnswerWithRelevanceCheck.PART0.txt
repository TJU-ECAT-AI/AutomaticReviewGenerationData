          [1] "In previous works, we have prepared bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts by surface redox reaction for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols"

          [2] "In this paper, bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction were tested in selective hydrogenation of citral with the aim of combining the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect."

          [3] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction (catalytic reduction method) were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral."

          [4] "The germanium deposit was introduced by catalytic reduction on the parent catalysts"

          The literature primarily discusses the surface redox reaction, also referred to as the catalytic reduction method, for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts. This method was used to prepare Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2.

          Advantages of this method include:
          1. It allows for combining the bimetallic effect with the reducible support effect (SMSI effect on TiO2).
          2. It can produce catalysts with high selectivity for unsaturated alcohol production in citral hydrogenation.
          3. It provides better stability of bimetallic particles on TiO2 compared to alumina or silica supports.
          4. It enables precise control of germanium deposition onto parent metal catalysts.

          The main application discussed is the selective hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols.

          The overall efficacy seems good, as the method produced catalysts with tunable properties and high selectivities. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods, so a full comparison of efficacy is not possible based solely on this text. The repeated use of this method for different metal combinations (Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge) suggests that it is versatile and effective for producing a range of bimetallic catalysts.

          该文献主要讨论了表面氧化还原反应，也称为催化还原法，用于合成负载型双金属催化剂。这种方法被用来制备TiO2负载的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂。

          这种方法的优势包括：
          1. 它可以结合双金属效应和可还原载体效应（TiO2上的SMSI效应）。
          2. 它可以生产出在柠檬醛加氢反应中对不饱和醇生成具有高选择性的催化剂。
          3. 与氧化铝或二氧化硅载体相比，它在TiO2上提供了更好的双金属颗粒稳定性。
          4. 它能够精确控制锗沉积到母体金属催化剂上。

          讨论的主要应用是柠檬醛选择性加氢制不饱和醇。

          整体效果似乎很好，因为该方法生产出了具有可调性能和高选择性的催化剂。然而，该文献并没有提供不同合成方法的全面比较，因此仅基于这篇文本无法对效率进行完整比较。这种方法在不同金属组合（Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge）中的重复使用表明，它在生产各种双金属催化剂方面是多功能和有效的。
