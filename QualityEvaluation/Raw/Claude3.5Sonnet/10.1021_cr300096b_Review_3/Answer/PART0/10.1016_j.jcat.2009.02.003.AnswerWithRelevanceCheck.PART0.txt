          [1] "Various ways to prepare bimetallic catalysts for different applications have been reported"
          [2] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
          [3] "Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds have also been reported"
          [4] "Another promising technique to prepare bimetallic catalysts is the deposition of the second metal(oxide) via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal"
          [5] "Though the advantage of RDP for catalytic performance has been demonstrated, detailed characterization of the interaction of promoters with the active metal is lacking thus far."
          [6] "Preparation of bimetallic catalysts via RDP can also be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction. The latter situation results in underpotential deposition: adatoms can be deposited on particular sites of the metal surface whereby the equilibrium potential is shifted and enables creation of submonolayers of adatoms"

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

          1. Impregnation techniques: Widely used but may not result in close contact between the two metals.
          2. Controlled surface reactions of organometallic compounds: Involves reacting organic ligands with adsorbed hydrogen on the metal surface.
          3. Reductive deposition precipitation (RDP): Deposits the second metal via redox chemistry catalyzed by the first metal.
          4. Underpotential deposition: A variation of RDP performed below the equilibrium potential, enabling creation of submonolayers of adatoms.

          Comparison of methods:
          - Impregnation is simple and common but may not achieve optimal metal interaction.
          - Controlled surface reactions offer precision but risk depositing inactive phases on the support.
          - RDP and underpotential deposition show promise for achieving close metal-metal interactions and improved catalytic performance.
          - However, detailed characterization of metal interactions from RDP is still lacking.

          The choice of method depends on the specific application, desired catalyst properties, and metals involved. Overall, RDP and its variations appear most effective for creating catalysts with intimate bimetallic contact, which can enhance selectivity in reactions like cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation. However, more research is needed to fully characterize and optimize these techniques.

          支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

          1. 浸渍技术：广泛使用，但可能无法实现两种金属之间的紧密接触。
          2. 有机金属化合物的受控表面反应：涉及有机配体与金属表面吸附的氢气反应。
          3. 还原沉积沉淀法（RDP）：通过第一种金属催化的氧化还原化学反应沉积第二种金属。
          4. 欠电位沉积：RDP的一种变体，在平衡电位以下进行，能够创建原子层下的吸附原子。

          方法比较：
          - 浸渍法简单常见，但可能无法实现最佳的金属相互作用。
          - 受控表面反应提供精确控制，但存在在载体上沉积无活性相的风险。
          - RDP和欠电位沉积显示出实现金属-金属紧密相互作用和改善催化性能的潜力。
          - 然而，对RDP产生的金属相互作用的详细表征仍然缺乏。

          方法的选择取决于具体应用、所需的催化剂性质和涉及的金属。总的来说，RDP及其变体似乎是创造具有亲密双金属接触的催化剂的最有效方法，这可以增强肉桂醛氢化等反应的选择性。然而，需要更多研究来全面表征和优化这些技术。
