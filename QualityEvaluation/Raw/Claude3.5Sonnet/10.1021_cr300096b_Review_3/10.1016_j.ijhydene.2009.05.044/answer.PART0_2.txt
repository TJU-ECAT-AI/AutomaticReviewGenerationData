[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]."

[3] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Incipient wetness impregnation 
2. Precipitation
3. Deposition-precipitation
4. Co-precipitation
5. Sol-gel
6. Sonochemical
7. Cluster-derived method

The incipient wetness impregnation is reported to be the most frequently used. However, the cluster-derived method, while more tedious, offers significant advantages in controlling the size and bimetallic composition of the catalysts. Cluster-derived nanoparticles have been shown to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts. This method allows for excellent control of bimetallic ratios and particle sizes, which can lead to improved catalyst performance. The choice of method depends on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括:

1. 浸渍法
2. 沉淀法
3. 沉积-沉淀法
4. 共沉淀法
5. 溶胶-凝胶法
6. 超声化学法
7. 簇衍生法

据报道,浸渍法是最常用的方法。然而,簇衍生法虽然更繁琐,但在控制催化剂的尺寸和双金属组成方面具有显著优势。簇衍生的纳米颗粒已被证明比其盐衍生的对应物更稳定和活性。这种方法可以很好地控制双金属比例和粒子大小,从而提高催化剂性能。方法的选择取决于特定的应用和所需的催化剂性能。
