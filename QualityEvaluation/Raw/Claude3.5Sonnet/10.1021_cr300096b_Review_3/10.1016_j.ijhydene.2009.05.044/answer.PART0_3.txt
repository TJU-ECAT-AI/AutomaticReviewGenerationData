[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

[3] "During the removal of the CO ligands, the existing metal-metal bonds help to maintain the integrity of the metallic cluster core. Consequently, most of the yielded nanoparticles would retain the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation, with the latter being the most frequently used. These conventional methods are compared to the cluster-derived method, which offers superior control over particle size and bimetallic composition.

The cluster-derived method, while more complex than incipient wetness impregnation, provides significant advantages in controlling nanoparticle size and maintaining the desired bimetallic composition. This method preserves the integrity of the metallic cluster core during ligand removal, resulting in nanoparticles that closely match the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor.

In terms of overall efficacy, the cluster-derived method appears to be more effective in producing catalysts with precise bimetallic compositions and smaller particle sizes. This level of control is particularly valuable for applications requiring specific metal ratios and uniform particle distribution. However, the more straightforward conventional methods like incipient wetness impregnation may be preferred in situations where precise control is less critical or when scalability and ease of production are prioritized.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括沉淀法、沉积-沉淀法、共沉淀法、溶胶-凝胶法、超声化学法和浸渍法，其中浸渍法是最常用的。这些传统方法与簇衍生法进行了比较，后者在控制粒径和双金属组成方面具有优越性。

簇衍生法虽然比浸渍法更复杂，但在控制纳米粒子大小和保持所需的双金属组成方面具有显著优势。这种方法在配体去除过程中保持了金属簇核的完整性，从而产生的纳米粒子与簇前体的原始双金属组成非常接近。

就整体效果而言，簇衍生法在生产具有精确双金属组成和更小粒径的催化剂方面似乎更有效。这种控制水平对于需要特定金属比例和均匀粒子分布的应用特别有价值。然而，在精确控制不太关键或者当可扩展性和生产便利性更为重要时，可能会更倾向于使用像浸渍法这样更简单的传统方法。
