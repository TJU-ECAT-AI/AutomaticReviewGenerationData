[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]."

[3] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

[4] "During the removal of the CO ligands, the existing metal-metal bonds help to maintain the integrity of the metallic cluster core. Consequently, most of the yielded nanoparticles would retain the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor. In addition, the relatively low decarbonylation temperature used also ensured that sintering was kept to a minimum."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Incipient wetness impregnation (most frequent)
2. Precipitation 
3. Deposition-precipitation
4. Co-precipitation
5. Sol-gel
6. Sonochemical
7. Cluster-derived method

The cluster-derived method offers several advantages compared to other methods:

1. Better control of particle size and bimetallic composition
2. Produces more stable and active nanoparticles
3. Maintains the integrity of the metallic cluster core
4. Minimizes sintering due to low decarbonylation temperature

However, the cluster-derived method is slightly more tedious than incipient wetness impregnation.

In terms of efficacy, cluster-derived catalysts have been shown to be more active and stable than salt-derived counterparts in hydrogenation reactions. For ethanol steam reforming, cluster-derived catalysts outperformed other catalysts tested under identical reaction conditions.

Overall, while incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly used method due to its simplicity, the cluster-derived method appears to offer superior control and performance for bimetallic catalyst production, especially for applications requiring precise composition and small particle sizes.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍法（最常见）
2. 沉淀法
3. 沉积-沉淀法
4. 共沉淀法
5. 溶胶-凝胶法
6. 超声化学法
7. 簇衍生法

与其他方法相比，簇衍生法具有以下优势：

1. 更好地控制粒子尺寸和双金属组成
2. 产生更稳定和活性的纳米粒子
3. 保持金属簇核的完整性
4. 由于低温脱羰，最大限度地减少烧结

然而，簇衍生法比浸渍法稍微繁琐一些。

在效果方面，簇衍生催化剂在加氢反应中表现出比盐衍生的对应物更高的活性和稳定性。对于乙醇蒸汽重整，在相同反应条件下，簇衍生催化剂的性能优于其他测试的催化剂。

总的来说，虽然浸渍法由于其简单性而成为最常用的方法，但簇衍生法似乎在双金属催化剂生产方面提供了更优越的控制和性能，特别是对于需要精确组成和小粒径的应用。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation, with the latter being the most frequently used. The organometallic cluster-derived method is also mentioned as an alternative approach.

In terms of potential advantages and efficacy, the cluster-derived method offers better control over particle size and bimetallic composition compared to the incipient wetness impregnation method. Cluster-derived nanoparticles have been reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts for hydrogenation reactions.

While the cluster-derived method is described as slightly more tedious than incipient wetness impregnation, its advantages in terms of composition control and particle size make it a promising approach for catalyst production, particularly for applications requiring precise control over catalyst properties.

Overall, the choice of synthesis method depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst and the intended application. The incipient wetness impregnation method is widely used due to its simplicity, while the cluster-derived method offers advantages in terms of control and performance for certain applications.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation, with the latter being the most frequently used. These conventional methods are compared to the cluster-derived method, which offers superior control over particle size and bimetallic composition.

The cluster-derived method, while more complex than incipient wetness impregnation, provides significant advantages in controlling nanoparticle size and maintaining the desired bimetallic composition. This method preserves the integrity of the metallic cluster core during ligand removal, resulting in nanoparticles that closely match the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor.

In terms of overall efficacy, the cluster-derived method appears to be more effective in producing catalysts with precise bimetallic compositions and smaller particle sizes. This level of control is particularly valuable for applications requiring specific metal ratios and uniform particle distribution. However, the more straightforward conventional methods like incipient wetness impregnation may be preferred in situations where precise control is less critical or when scalability and ease of production are prioritized.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括沉淀法、沉积-沉淀法、共沉淀法、溶胶-凝胶法、超声化学法和浸渍法，其中浸渍法是最常用的。这些传统方法与簇衍生法进行了比较，后者在控制粒径和双金属组成方面具有优越性。

簇衍生法虽然比浸渍法更复杂，但在控制纳米粒子大小和保持所需的双金属组成方面具有显著优势。这种方法在配体去除过程中保持了金属簇核的完整性，从而产生的纳米粒子与簇前体的原始双金属组成非常接近。

就整体效果而言，簇衍生法在生产具有精确双金属组成和更小粒径的催化剂方面似乎更有效。这种控制水平对于需要特定金属比例和均匀粒子分布的应用特别有价值。然而，在精确控制不太关键或者当可扩展性和生产便利性更为重要时，可能会更倾向于使用像浸渍法这样更简单的传统方法。
