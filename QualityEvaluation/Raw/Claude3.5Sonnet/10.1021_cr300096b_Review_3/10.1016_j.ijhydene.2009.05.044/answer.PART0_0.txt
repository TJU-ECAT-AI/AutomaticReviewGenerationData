[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]."

[3] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

[4] "During the removal of the CO ligands, the existing metal-metal bonds help to maintain the integrity of the metallic cluster core. Consequently, most of the yielded nanoparticles would retain the original bimetallic composition of the cluster precursor. In addition, the relatively low decarbonylation temperature used also ensured that sintering was kept to a minimum."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Incipient wetness impregnation (most frequent)
2. Precipitation 
3. Deposition-precipitation
4. Co-precipitation
5. Sol-gel
6. Sonochemical
7. Cluster-derived method

The cluster-derived method offers several advantages compared to other methods:

1. Better control of particle size and bimetallic composition
2. Produces more stable and active nanoparticles
3. Maintains the integrity of the metallic cluster core
4. Minimizes sintering due to low decarbonylation temperature

However, the cluster-derived method is slightly more tedious than incipient wetness impregnation.

In terms of efficacy, cluster-derived catalysts have been shown to be more active and stable than salt-derived counterparts in hydrogenation reactions. For ethanol steam reforming, cluster-derived catalysts outperformed other catalysts tested under identical reaction conditions.

Overall, while incipient wetness impregnation is the most commonly used method due to its simplicity, the cluster-derived method appears to offer superior control and performance for bimetallic catalyst production, especially for applications requiring precise composition and small particle sizes.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍法（最常见）
2. 沉淀法
3. 沉积-沉淀法
4. 共沉淀法
5. 溶胶-凝胶法
6. 超声化学法
7. 簇衍生法

与其他方法相比，簇衍生法具有以下优势：

1. 更好地控制粒子尺寸和双金属组成
2. 产生更稳定和活性的纳米粒子
3. 保持金属簇核的完整性
4. 由于低温脱羰，最大限度地减少烧结

然而，簇衍生法比浸渍法稍微繁琐一些。

在效果方面，簇衍生催化剂在加氢反应中表现出比盐衍生的对应物更高的活性和稳定性。对于乙醇蒸汽重整，在相同反应条件下，簇衍生催化剂的性能优于其他测试的催化剂。

总的来说，虽然浸渍法由于其简单性而成为最常用的方法，但簇衍生法似乎在双金属催化剂生产方面提供了更优越的控制和性能，特别是对于需要精确组成和小粒径的应用。
