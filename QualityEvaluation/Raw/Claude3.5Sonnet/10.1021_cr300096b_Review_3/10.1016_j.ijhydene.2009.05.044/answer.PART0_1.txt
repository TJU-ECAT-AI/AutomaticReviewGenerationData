[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]."

[3] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include precipitation, deposition-precipitation, co-precipitation, sol-gel, sonochemical, and incipient wetness impregnation, with the latter being the most frequently used. The organometallic cluster-derived method is also mentioned as an alternative approach.

In terms of potential advantages and efficacy, the cluster-derived method offers better control over particle size and bimetallic composition compared to the incipient wetness impregnation method. Cluster-derived nanoparticles have been reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts for hydrogenation reactions.

While the cluster-derived method is described as slightly more tedious than incipient wetness impregnation, its advantages in terms of composition control and particle size make it a promising approach for catalyst production, particularly for applications requiring precise control over catalyst properties.

Overall, the choice of synthesis method depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst and the intended application. The incipient wetness impregnation method is widely used due to its simplicity, while the cluster-derived method offers advantages in terms of control and performance for certain applications.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括沉淀法、沉积-沉淀法、共沉淀法、溶胶-凝胶法、超声化学法和浸渍法，其中浸渍法使用最为频繁。有机金属簇衍生法也被提及作为一种替代方法。

在潜在优势和效能方面，与浸渍法相比，簇衍生法能更好地控制粒径和双金属组成。据报道，簇衍生纳米粒子在加氢反应中比盐衍生的对应物更稳定和活性更高。

虽然簇衍生法被描述为比浸渍法稍微繁琐，但其在组成控制和粒径方面的优势使其成为催化剂生产的一种很有前途的方法，特别是对于需要精确控制催化剂性能的应用。

总的来说，合成方法的选择取决于催化剂的具体要求和预期应用。浸渍法因其简单性而被广泛使用，而簇衍生法在某些应用中在控制和性能方面具有优势。
