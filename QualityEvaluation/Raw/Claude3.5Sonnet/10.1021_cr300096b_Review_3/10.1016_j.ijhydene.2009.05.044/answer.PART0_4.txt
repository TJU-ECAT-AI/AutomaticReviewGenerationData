[1] "Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date have involved either inorganic oxides [16,17] or oxide-supported metals [2331] as catalysts. Various catalyst preparation methods have been reported in the literature, including precipitation [29,30], depositionprecipitation [23], co-precipitation [30], solgel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently, incipient wetness impregnation [2427]."

[2] "Organometallic cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts, and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions [3335]."

[3] "Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic composition that it offers [3335]."

The most common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Incipient wetness impregnation
2. Precipitation 
3. Deposition-precipitation
4. Co-precipitation
5. Sol-gel
6. Sonochemical
7. Organometallic cluster-derived method

The incipient wetness impregnation is reported as the most frequently used method. However, the organometallic cluster-derived method, while more tedious, offers significant advantages in controlling the size and bimetallic composition of the catalysts. This method has been shown to produce nanoparticles that are more stable and active than those derived from salt precursors, particularly for hydrogenation reactions. 

In terms of efficacy, the cluster-derived method appears to be superior for producing highly active and selective catalysts, especially for reactions like ethanol steam reforming. It allows for excellent control of bimetallic ratios and typically results in smaller particle sizes, which can lead to improved catalyst performance.

The choice of method depends on the specific application and desired catalyst properties. While incipient wetness impregnation is widely used due to its simplicity, the cluster-derived method may be preferred when precise control over nanoparticle size and composition is crucial for catalyst performance.

支持型双金属催化剂的最常见合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍法
2. 沉淀法
3. 沉积-沉淀法
4. 共沉淀法
5. 溶胶-凝胶法
6. 超声化学法
7. 有机金属簇衍生法

据报道，浸渍法是最常用的方法。然而，虽然有机金属簇衍生法更加繁琐，但在控制催化剂的尺寸和双金属组成方面具有显著优势。这种方法已被证明可以产生比盐前体衍生的纳米粒子更稳定和活性的纳米粒子，特别是对于加氢反应。

在效能方面，簇衍生法似乎在生产高活性和高选择性催化剂方面更为出色，特别是对于乙醇蒸汽重整等反应。它允许对双金属比例进行精确控制，通常会产生更小的粒子尺寸，这可能会导致催化剂性能的改善。

方法的选择取决于特定的应用和所需的催化剂性质。虽然由于其简单性，浸渍法被广泛使用，但当催化剂性能对纳米粒子尺寸和组成的精确控制至关重要时，可能会优先选择簇衍生法。
