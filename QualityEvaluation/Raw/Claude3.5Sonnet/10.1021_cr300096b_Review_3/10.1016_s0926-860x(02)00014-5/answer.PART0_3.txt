[1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

[2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

[3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

[4] "In this study our two-step tin anchoring has been applied, which consists of: (i) tin anchoring (step 1), and (ii) decomposition of surface organometallic complexes (step 2)."

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation techniques: These are widely used but lack control over the interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both platinum and the support, and alloy-type surface entities cannot be controlled.

2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): This method uses reactions between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to obtain alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction.

3. One-step anchoring: Developed by other research groups, this approach uses tin tetraalkyls anchored onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals.

4. Two-step tin anchoring: This method involves (i) tin anchoring and (ii) decomposition of surface organometallic complexes.

CSRs and the two-step tin anchoring method offer better control over the formation of bimetallic species compared to conventional impregnation techniques. They allow for more precise control of tin-platinum interactions and can potentially lead to improved catalyst performance. The one-step anchoring method may be simpler to implement but might not offer the same level of control as the two-step process.

Overall, the controlled surface reaction and multi-step anchoring methods appear to be more effective in producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts, offering advantages in terms of control over catalyst composition and structure. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍技术：这些技术被广泛使用，但缺乏对形成活性物种所涉及的相互作用的控制。锡被引入铂和载体中，且无法控制合金型表面实体的形成。

2. 受控表面反应（CSRs）：该方法利用锡四烷基与吸附在铂上的氢之间的反应，获得具有专一性锡-铂相互作用的合金型支持Sn-Pt催化剂。

3. 一步锚定法：由其他研究组开发，这种方法将锡四烷基锚定到铑和其他贵金属或过渡金属上。

4. 两步锡锚定法：这种方法包括（i）锡锚定和（ii）表面有机金属络合物的分解。

与传统浸渍技术相比，CSRs和两步锡锚定法对双金属物种的形成提供了更好的控制。它们允许更精确地控制锡-铂相互作用，可能导致催化剂性能的改善。一步锚定法可能更简单易行，但可能无法提供与两步过程相同水平的控制。

总的来说，受控表面反应和多步锚定方法在生产明确定义的双金属催化剂方面似乎更有效，在控制催化剂组成和结构方面提供了优势。然而，方法的选择可能取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性能。
