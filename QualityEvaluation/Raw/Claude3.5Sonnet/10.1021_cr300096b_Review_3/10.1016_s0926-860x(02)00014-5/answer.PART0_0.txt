[1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

[2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

[3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

[4] "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation techniques: These are widely used but lack control over the interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both platinum and the support, and alloy-type surface entities cannot be controlled.

2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): This method uses tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to obtain alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction.

3. One-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls: Developed by other research groups, this approach is used for rhodium and other noble or transition metals.

4. Modified tin anchoring procedures: These new methods allow for increased tin anchoring, resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3.

In terms of advantages and efficacy:

- CSRs offer better control over tin-platinum interactions compared to conventional impregnation.
- The modified tin anchoring procedures allow for higher tin content, which can be advantageous for certain applications.
- Conventional impregnation, while widely used, lacks the precision of newer methods.

Applications vary depending on the method:

- Catalysts prepared by CSRs and modified anchoring procedures show promise in selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and low-temperature CO oxidation.
- Conventional impregnation techniques are used in various catalytic applications but may not offer the same level of selectivity as more controlled methods.

Overall, newer methods like CSRs and modified anchoring procedures offer better control and potentially higher efficacy in catalyst production, especially for specific applications requiring precise tin-platinum interactions.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍技术：这些技术被广泛使用，但缺乏对形成活性物种所涉及的相互作用的控制。锡被引入铂和载体中，无法控制合金型表面实体的形成。

2. 受控表面反应（CSRs）：该方法使用四烷基锡和吸附在铂上的氢气，以获得具有独特锡-铂相互作用的合金型负载Sn-Pt催化剂。

3. 四烷基锡的一步锚定：由其他研究小组开发，这种方法用于铑和其他贵金属或过渡金属。

4. 改进的锡锚定程序：这些新方法允许增加锡的锚定量，从而得到具有高Snanch/Pts比率（接近3）的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。

在优势和效果方面：

- 与传统浸渍相比，CSRs对锡-铂相互作用的控制更好。
- 改进的锡锚定程序允许更高的锡含量，这对某些应用可能有利。
- 传统浸渍虽然被广泛使用，但缺乏newer方法的精确性。

应用根据方法的不同而有所不同：

- 由CSRs和改进的锚定程序制备的催化剂在不饱和醛的选择性加氢和低温CO氧化方面显示出前景。
- 传统浸渍技术用于各种催化应用，但可能无法提供与更受控方法相同水平的选择性。

总的来说，像CSRs和改进的锚定程序这样的较新方法在催化剂生产中提供了更好的控制和潜在的更高效率，特别是对于需要精确锡-铂相互作用的特定应用。
