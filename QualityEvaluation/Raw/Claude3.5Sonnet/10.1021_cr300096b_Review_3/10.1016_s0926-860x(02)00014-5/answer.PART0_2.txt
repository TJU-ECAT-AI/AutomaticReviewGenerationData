[1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

[2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

[3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

[4] "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation techniques: These are widely used but lack control over the interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both platinum and the support, and alloy-type surface entities cannot be controlled.

2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): This method uses tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to obtain alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction.

3. One-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls: Developed by other research groups, this approach is used for rhodium and other noble or transition metals.

4. Modified tin anchoring procedures: These new methods allow for increased tin anchoring, resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3.

CSRs and modified tin anchoring procedures offer advantages in terms of control over the formation of active species and the ability to achieve higher tin-to-platinum ratios. These methods are particularly effective for producing alloy-type catalysts with specific interactions between tin and platinum. Conventional impregnation techniques, while widely used, have limitations in controlling the distribution of tin between platinum and the support.

The choice of method depends on the desired catalyst properties and applications. For selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes or low-temperature CO oxidation, the controlled methods (CSRs and modified tin anchoring) appear to be more effective in producing catalysts with optimal performance.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍技术：这些技术被广泛使用，但缺乏对形成活性物种的相互作用的控制。锡被引入铂和载体中，无法控制合金型表面实体的形成。

2. 受控表面反应（CSRs）：该方法使用四烷基锡和吸附在铂上的氢气，获得具有专一性锡-铂相互作用的合金型负载Sn-Pt催化剂。

3. 四烷基锡的一步锚定：由其他研究小组开发，这种方法用于铑和其他贵金属或过渡金属。

4. 改进的锡锚定程序：这些新方法允许增加锡的锚定量，产生具有高达3的Snanch/Pts比率的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。

CSRs和改进的锡锚定程序在控制活性物种的形成和实现更高的锡-铂比率方面具有优势。这些方法对于生产具有特定锡-铂相互作用的合金型催化剂特别有效。传统的浸渍技术虽然被广泛使用，但在控制锡在铂和载体之间的分布方面存在局限性。

方法的选择取决于所需的催化剂性质和应用。对于不饱和醛的选择性加氢或低温CO氧化，受控方法（CSRs和改进的锡锚定）在生产具有最佳性能的催化剂方面似乎更有效。
