[1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

[2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

[3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

[4] "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation techniques: These are widely used but lack control over the interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both platinum and the support, and alloy-type surface entities cannot be controlled.

2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): This method uses tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to obtain alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction.

3. One-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls: Developed by other research groups, this approach is used for rhodium and other noble or transition metals.

4. Modified tin anchoring procedures: These new methods allow for increased tin anchoring, resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3.

In terms of advantages and efficacy:

- CSRs offer better control over tin-platinum interactions compared to conventional impregnation.
- The modified tin anchoring procedures allow for higher tin content, which can be advantageous for certain applications.
- Conventional impregnation, while widely used, lacks the precision of newer methods.

Applications vary depending on the method:

- Catalysts prepared by CSRs and modified anchoring procedures show promise in selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and low-temperature CO oxidation.
- Conventional impregnation techniques are used in various catalytic applications but may not offer the same level of selectivity as more controlled methods.

Overall, newer methods like CSRs and modified anchoring procedures offer better control and potentially higher efficacy in catalyst production, especially for specific applications requiring precise tin-platinum interactions.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍技术：这些技术被广泛使用，但缺乏对形成活性物种所涉及的相互作用的控制。锡被引入铂和载体中，无法控制合金型表面实体的形成。

2. 受控表面反应（CSRs）：该方法使用四烷基锡和吸附在铂上的氢气，以获得具有独特锡-铂相互作用的合金型负载Sn-Pt催化剂。

3. 四烷基锡的一步锚定：由其他研究小组开发，这种方法用于铑和其他贵金属或过渡金属。

4. 改进的锡锚定程序：这些新方法允许增加锡的锚定量，从而得到具有高Snanch/Pts比率（接近3）的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。

在优势和效果方面：

- 与传统浸渍相比，CSRs对锡-铂相互作用的控制更好。
- 改进的锡锚定程序允许更高的锡含量，这对某些应用可能有利。
- 传统浸渍虽然被广泛使用，但缺乏newer方法的精确性。

应用根据方法的不同而有所不同：

- 由CSRs和改进的锚定程序制备的催化剂在不饱和醛的选择性加氢和低温CO氧化方面显示出前景。
- 传统浸渍技术用于各种催化应用，但可能无法提供与更受控方法相同水平的选择性。

总的来说，像CSRs和改进的锚定程序这样的较新方法在催化剂生产中提供了更好的控制和潜在的更高效率，特别是对于需要精确锡-铂相互作用的特定应用。

The CSR method offers advantages in terms of control over the formation of alloy-type surface entities and exclusive tin-platinum interaction. This can lead to better-defined catalysts with potentially improved performance. Conventional impregnation techniques, while widely used, lack this level of control.

The one-step anchoring approach offers simplicity but may introduce tin into the support as well. The modified tin anchoring procedures allow for higher tin loading, which can be advantageous for certain applications requiring higher Snanch/Pts ratios.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired catalyst properties and application. CSRs and modified anchoring procedures offer more control and potential for tailored catalyst design, while conventional methods may be simpler but less precise.

Conventional impregnation techniques, while widely used, have limitations in controlling the distribution of tin between platinum and the support.

The choice of method depends on the desired catalyst properties and applications. For selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes or low-temperature CO oxidation, the controlled methods (CSRs and modified tin anchoring) appear to be more effective in producing catalysts with optimal performance.

The one-step anchoring method may be simpler to implement but might not offer the same level of control as the two-step process.

Overall, the controlled surface reaction and multi-step anchoring methods appear to be more effective in producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts, offering advantages in terms of control over catalyst composition and structure. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

[1] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."

[2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

[3] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques.

The literature discusses a few common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Conventional impregnation techniques: These are widely used but lack control over the interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both the platinum and support, and alloy formation cannot be controlled.

2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): This method uses tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to create alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction. This offers better control over the catalyst structure.

3. In-situ formation: The paper describes a method where Sn4+Pt ensemble sites are formed in-situ on supported alloy-type SnPt nanoclusters.

Each method has its advantages and applications. Conventional impregnation is simple but lacks precision. CSRs offer better control over the catalyst structure, potentially leading to improved performance in specific applications. The in-situ formation method described seems particularly suited for catalysts used in selective hydrogenation and low-temperature CO oxidation.

Overall, the CSR method appears to be more effective in producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts compared to conventional impregnation. However, the choice of method would depend on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

该文献讨论了几种常见的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 传统浸渍技术：这种方法被广泛使用，但缺乏对形成活性物种所涉及的相互作用的控制。锡被引入到铂和载体中，合金的形成无法控制。

2. 受控表面反应（CSRs）：这种方法使用锡四烷基和吸附在铂上的氢来制造具有专一性锡-铂相互作用的合金型负载Sn-Pt催化剂。这种方法可以更好地控制催化剂结构。

3. 原位形成：该文描述了一种在负载型合金SnPt纳米簇上原位形成Sn4+Pt集合位点的方法。

每种方法都有其优势和应用。传统浸渍简单但缺乏精确性。CSRs可以更好地控制催化剂结构，可能会在特定应用中带来性能改善。所描述的原位形成方法似乎特别适用于选择性加氢和低温CO氧化的催化剂。

总的来说，与传统浸渍相比，CSR方法在生产定义明确的双金属催化剂方面似乎更有效。然而，方法的选择将取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性能。
