[1] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."

[2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

[3] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

The literature discusses a few common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Conventional impregnation techniques: These are widely used but lack control over the interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both the platinum and support, and alloy formation cannot be controlled.

2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): This method uses tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to create alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction. This offers better control over the catalyst structure.

3. In-situ formation: The paper describes a method where Sn4+Pt ensemble sites are formed in-situ on supported alloy-type SnPt nanoclusters.

Each method has its advantages and applications. Conventional impregnation is simple but lacks precision. CSRs offer better control over the catalyst structure, potentially leading to improved performance in specific applications. The in-situ formation method described seems particularly suited for catalysts used in selective hydrogenation and low-temperature CO oxidation.

Overall, the CSR method appears to be more effective in producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts compared to conventional impregnation. However, the choice of method would depend on the specific application and desired catalyst properties.

该文献讨论了几种常见的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 传统浸渍技术：这种方法被广泛使用，但缺乏对形成活性物种所涉及的相互作用的控制。锡被引入到铂和载体中，合金的形成无法控制。

2. 受控表面反应（CSRs）：这种方法使用锡四烷基和吸附在铂上的氢来制造具有专一性锡-铂相互作用的合金型负载Sn-Pt催化剂。这种方法可以更好地控制催化剂结构。

3. 原位形成：该文描述了一种在负载型合金SnPt纳米簇上原位形成Sn4+Pt集合位点的方法。

每种方法都有其优势和应用。传统浸渍简单但缺乏精确性。CSRs可以更好地控制催化剂结构，可能会在特定应用中带来性能改善。所描述的原位形成方法似乎特别适用于选择性加氢和低温CO氧化的催化剂。

总的来说，与传统浸渍相比，CSR方法在生产定义明确的双金属催化剂方面似乎更有效。然而，方法的选择将取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性能。
