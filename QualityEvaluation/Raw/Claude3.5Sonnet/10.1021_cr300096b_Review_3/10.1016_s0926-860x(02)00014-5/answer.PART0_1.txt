[1] "Supported Sn-Pt catalysts used either in selective hydrogenation of UA or LT CO oxidation were prepared by using different conventional impregnation techniques. In these catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."

[2] "However, we have demonstrated that upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tinplatinum interaction can be obtained."

[3] "Similar approach has been developed by other research groups upon using a one-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls onto rhodium and other noble or transition metals"

[4] "In order to achieve these high Snanch/Pts ratios the general procedure used earlier for tin anchoring had to be altered. The new modification procedures developed has allowed to increase the amount of tin anchored resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation techniques: These are widely used but lack control over the interactions involved in forming active species. Tin is introduced into both platinum and the support, and alloy-type surface entities cannot be controlled.

2. Controlled surface reactions (CSRs): This method uses tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum to create alloy-type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction.

3. One-step anchoring of tin tetraalkyls: Developed by other research groups, this approach is used for rhodium and other noble or transition metals.

4. Modified tin anchoring procedures: These new techniques allow for increased tin anchoring, resulting in Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with high Snanch/Pts ratios close to 3.

The CSR method offers advantages in terms of control over the formation of alloy-type surface entities and exclusive tin-platinum interaction. This can lead to better-defined catalysts with potentially improved performance. Conventional impregnation techniques, while widely used, lack this level of control.

The one-step anchoring approach offers simplicity but may introduce tin into the support as well. The modified tin anchoring procedures allow for higher tin loading, which can be advantageous for certain applications requiring higher Snanch/Pts ratios.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired catalyst properties and application. CSRs and modified anchoring procedures offer more control and potential for tailored catalyst design, while conventional methods may be simpler but less precise.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍技术：这些方法被广泛使用，但缺乏对形成活性物种所涉及的相互作用的控制。锡被引入到铂和载体中，无法控制合金型表面实体的形成。

2. 控制表面反应（CSRs）：该方法使用锡四烷基和吸附在铂上的氢气来创建具有独特锡-铂相互作用的合金型支持Sn-Pt催化剂。

3. 锡四烷基的一步锚定：由其他研究小组开发，这种方法用于铑和其他贵金属或过渡金属。

4. 改进的锡锚定程序：这些新技术允许增加锡的锚定量，从而得到具有高Snanch/Pts比率（接近3）的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。

CSR方法在控制合金型表面实体的形成和独特的锡-铂相互作用方面具有优势。这可以导致更明确定义的催化剂，并可能提高性能。传统的浸渍技术虽然被广泛使用，但缺乏这种程度的控制。

一步锚定方法提供了简单性，但也可能将锡引入到载体中。改进的锡锚定程序允许更高的锡负载，这对于需要更高Snanch/Pts比率的某些应用可能是有利的。

总的来说，方法的选择取决于所需的催化剂性质和应用。CSRs和改进的锚定程序提供了更多的控制和定制催化剂设计的潜力，而传统方法可能更简单但不太精确。
