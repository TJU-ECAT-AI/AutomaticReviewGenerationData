[1] "We report on the carbon supported Ni coreePt shell Ni1x@Ptx/C (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) nanoparticles as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). The catalysts are prepared through a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant."

[2] "Ni1x@Ptx NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were chemically prepared through a redox reaction method."

[3] "Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were prepared using similar process depicted above except that the required amount of carbon black was added at 150 C before the reduction reaction."

The literature discusses a few synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Polyol synthesis process: This method uses oleic acid as a surfactant to prepare carbon-supported Ni core-Pt shell nanoparticles. It allows for control over particle size and distribution.

2. Redox reaction method: This approach is used to chemically prepare Ni1-x@Ptx nanoparticles with varying compositions.

3. Modified redox reaction with carbon support: This method is similar to the redox reaction method, but includes the addition of carbon black before the reduction reaction to create supported catalysts.

These methods offer advantages in controlling particle size, composition, and dispersion on support materials. The polyol synthesis with surfactant appears particularly effective for creating well-dispersed, small nanoparticles. The redox methods allow for tuning of the bimetallic composition. Overall, these techniques seem well-suited for producing core-shell structured catalysts with good control over key properties.

文献讨论了几种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 多元醇合成法：该方法使用油酸作为表面活性剂来制备碳负载的镍核-铂壳纳米粒子。它可以控制粒子大小和分布。

2. 氧化还原反应法：这种方法用于化学制备具有不同成分的Ni1-x@Ptx纳米粒子。

3. 改进的碳载体氧化还原反应法：该方法与氧化还原反应法类似，但在还原反应前加入碳黑以创建负载型催化剂。

这些方法在控制粒子大小、成分和在载体材料上的分散方面具有优势。使用表面活性剂的多元醇合成法似乎特别有效，可以创建分散良好的小纳米粒子。氧化还原方法允许调节双金属成分。总的来说，这些技术似乎非常适合生产核壳结构的催化剂，并能很好地控制关键性能。
