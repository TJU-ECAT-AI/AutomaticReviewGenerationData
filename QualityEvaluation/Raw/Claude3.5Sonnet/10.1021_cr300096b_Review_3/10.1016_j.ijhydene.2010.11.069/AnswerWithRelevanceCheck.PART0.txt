          The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Polyol synthesis process: This method uses oleic acid as a surfactant to prepare carbon-supported Ni core-Pt shell nanoparticles. It allows for control over particle size and distribution.

2. Redox reaction method: This approach is used to chemically prepare Ni1-x@Ptx nanoparticles with varying compositions.

3. Modified redox reaction with carbon support: This method is similar to the redox reaction method, but includes the addition of carbon black before the reduction reaction to create supported catalysts.

4. Chemical impregnation method: Used to prepare Pt3Ni nanoparticles with diameters of about 5-20 nm.

5. Hydrothermal method: Used to synthesize Pt/Ni hollow spheres.

6. Template-replacement synthesis: Used to prepare nest-like Pt-Ni submicrometer-size hollow spheres.

7. Reverse-microemulsion method: Used to synthesize nanosized Pt-Ni particles.

These methods offer different advantages:

- The polyol synthesis with surfactant helps control particle size, distribution, and creates well-dispersed, small nanoparticles.
- The redox methods allow for tuning of the bimetallic composition and formation of core-shell structures.
- The carbon-supported synthesis improves dispersion and stability.
- Other methods like hydrothermal and template-replacement allow for the creation of specific morphologies like hollow spheres.

Overall, these techniques are well-suited for producing catalysts with good control over key properties such as size, composition, structure, and dispersion. The choice of method significantly impacts the characteristics and performance of the resulting catalyst. The polyol/redox methods with surfactants appear particularly effective for producing highly active supported bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, especially for applications like hydrogen generation from ammonia borane hydrolysis.

          文献讨论了几种合成支持型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 多元醇合成法：该方法使用油酸作为表面活性剂来制备碳负载的镍核-铂壳纳米粒子。它可以控制粒子大小和分布。

2. 氧化还原反应法：这种方法用于化学制备具有不同成分的Ni1-x@Ptx纳米粒子。

3. 改进的碳载体氧化还原反应法：该方法与氧化还原反应法类似，但在还原反应前加入碳黑以创建负载型催化剂。

4. 化学浸渍法：用于制备直径约为5-20纳米的Pt3Ni纳米粒子。

5. 水热法：用于合成Pt/Ni空心球。

6. 模板替换合成法：用于制备巢状Pt-Ni亚微米级空心球。

7. 反向微乳液法：用于合成纳米级Pt-Ni粒子。

这些方法具有不同的优势：

- 使用表面活性剂的多元醇合成法有助于控制粒子大小、分布，并创建分散良好的小纳米粒子。
- 氧化还原方法允许调节双金属成分和形成核-壳结构。
- 碳载体合成法改善了分散性和稳定性。
- 其他方法如水热法和模板替换法允许创建特定形态如空心球。

总的来说，这些技术非常适合生产对关键性能（如尺寸、成分、结构和分散性）具有良好控制的催化剂。方法的选择显著影响了所得催化剂的特性和性能。使用表面活性剂的多元醇/氧化还原方法似乎特别有效，可以生产高活性支持型双金属纳米粒子催化剂，特别适用于氨硼烷水解制氢等应用。
