[1] "We report on the carbon supported Ni coreePt shell Ni1x@Ptx/C (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) nanoparticles as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). The catalysts are prepared through a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant."

[2] "Ni1x@Ptx NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were chemically prepared through a redox reaction method."

[3] "Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were prepared using similar process depicted above except that the required amount of carbon black was added at 150 C before the reduction reaction."

The literature discusses a few synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Polyol synthesis process: This method uses oleic acid as a surfactant to prepare carbon-supported Ni core-Pt shell nanoparticles. 

2. Redox reaction method: This approach is used to chemically prepare Ni1-x@Ptx nanoparticles.

3. Modified redox reaction method: This is similar to the redox reaction method, but includes the addition of carbon black before the reduction reaction to create supported catalysts.

These methods have different advantages. The polyol synthesis with surfactant helps control particle size and dispersion. The redox reaction allows for precise control of metal composition. The modified method for supported catalysts combines the benefits of the redox approach with improved dispersion on a support material.

The efficacy of these methods is demonstrated by the successful production of well-dispersed nanoparticles with core-shell structures and controlled compositions. The resulting catalysts showed high activity for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane hydrolysis, indicating the overall effectiveness of these synthesis approaches.

文献讨论了几种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 多元醇合成法：该方法使用油酸作为表面活性剂来制备碳负载的镍核-铂壳纳米粒子。

2. 氧化还原反应法：这种方法用于化学制备Ni1-x@Ptx纳米粒子。

3. 改进的氧化还原反应法：这种方法与氧化还原反应法类似，但在还原反应之前添加碳黑以制造负载型催化剂。

这些方法具有不同的优势。使用表面活性剂的多元醇合成法有助于控制粒子大小和分散性。氧化还原反应法允许精确控制金属组成。用于负载型催化剂的改进方法结合了氧化还原方法的优点和在载体材料上改善分散性的好处。

这些方法的有效性通过成功制备具有核-壳结构和可控组成的良好分散的纳米粒子得到了证明。所得催化剂对氨硼烷水解产生氢气表现出高活性，表明这些合成方法的整体有效性。
