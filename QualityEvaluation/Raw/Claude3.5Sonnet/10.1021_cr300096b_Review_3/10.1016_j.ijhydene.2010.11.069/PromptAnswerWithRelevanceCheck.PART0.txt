[1] "The Ni nanopaticles (Ni NPs), Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs), Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx NPs), the carbon-supported Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs) (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) and the carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/C NPs) (30 wt% Pt loading) were prepared using an oleic acid as the surfactant"

[2] "The first step is the synthesis of Ni particles by a surfactant-mediated polyol process. The formation of the coreeshell nanostructures is attained in the second step through the reaction between Ni NPs and PtCl6
2."

[3] "We report on the carbon supported Ni coreePt shell Ni1x@Ptx/C (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) nanoparticles as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). The catalysts are prepared through a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant."

The paper discusses a few synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Polyol synthesis process: This is the main method described, using oleic acid as a surfactant. It allows for control over particle size and distribution.

2. Two-step process: First, Ni nanoparticles are synthesized using a surfactant-mediated polyol process. Then, the core-shell structure is formed by reacting the Ni nanoparticles with PtCl6
2-.

3. Carbon support addition: For supported catalysts, carbon black is added during the synthesis process.

These methods offer advantages in terms of controlling particle size, achieving uniform dispersion, and forming specific structures like core-shell nanoparticles. The polyol process with oleic acid as surfactant seems particularly effective for producing small, well-dispersed nanoparticles. 

The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods, focusing mainly on the polyol process for this specific Ni-Pt core-shell catalyst system. Therefore, it's difficult to make broad comparisons about overall efficacy in catalyst production based solely on this paper.

本文讨论了几种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 多元醇合成法：这是文中描述的主要方法，使用油酸作为表面活性剂。这种方法可以控制粒子大小和分布。

2. 两步法：首先，使用表面活性剂介导的多元醇过程合成Ni纳米粒子。然后，通过Ni纳米粒子与PtCl6
2-反应形成核-壳结构。

3. 碳载体添加：对于负载型催化剂，在合成过程中添加碳黑。

这些方法在控制粒子大小、实现均匀分散以及形成特定结构（如核-壳纳米粒子）方面具有优势。使用油酸作为表面活性剂的多元醇法似乎特别有效，可以生产小而分散均匀的纳米粒子。

本文并未对不同合成方法进行全面比较，主要集中在这种特定Ni-Pt核-壳催化剂系统的多元醇合成法上。因此，仅基于这篇论文很难对催化剂生产的整体效果做出广泛的比较。

The literature mentions several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as surfactant
2. Simple redox method using oleic acid as surfactant  
3. Chemical impregnation method
4. Hydrothermal method
5. Template-replacement synthesis
6. Reverse-microemulsion method

The polyol and redox methods using oleic acid as a surfactant appear to be the main focus of this study. These methods produce small nanoparticles (2-4 nm) with core-shell structures, which exhibit high catalytic activity for hydrogen generation from ammonia borane hydrolysis. The use of oleic acid helps control particle size and dispersion.

The chemical impregnation method produced larger particles (5-20 nm). The hydrothermal and template-replacement methods created hollow sphere structures. The reverse-microemulsion method made nanosized particles.

Each method has advantages for specific applications. The polyol/redox methods with surfactants seem particularly effective for producing small, well-dispersed nanoparticles with controlled structures. This results in high catalytic activity. Other methods may be useful for creating different morphologies or larger particles as needed for various catalytic applications.

Overall, the choice of synthesis method significantly impacts the size, structure, and performance of the resulting catalyst. The polyol/redox methods highlighted in this study appear especially promising for producing highly active supported bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts.
