[1] "The Ni NPs were prepared by a polyol synthesis route following modified procedures of a previous report [19,20]. In the synthesis, 20 mmol of nickel acetate and 20 mmol of NaOH were mixed and stirred in deoxygenated ethylene glycol under Ar atmosphere."

[2] "Ni1x@Ptx NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were chemically prepared through a redox reaction method. A certain amount of H2PtCl6 (50 mM isopropanol) was slowly dripped to the dried Ni NPs at room temperature with ultrasonic cleaner applied."

[3] "Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) were prepared using similar process depicted above except that the required amount of carbon black was added at 150 C before the reduction reaction."

The literature describes a few synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Polyol synthesis: Used to prepare Ni nanoparticles by reducing nickel acetate in ethylene glycol. 

2. Redox reaction method: Used to prepare Ni-Pt core-shell nanoparticles by slowly adding H2PtCl6 to pre-formed Ni nanoparticles.

3. Carbon-supported synthesis: Similar to the redox method, but with carbon black added before the reduction reaction to create supported catalysts.

The polyol method allows control over nanoparticle size. The redox method enables formation of core-shell structures. Adding a carbon support improves dispersion and stability. Overall, these methods allow good control over composition, structure and particle size to optimize catalytic performance. The carbon-supported method in particular resulted in highly active catalysts for ammonia borane hydrolysis.

该文献描述了几种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 多元醇合成法：用于通过在乙二醇中还原醋酸镍来制备镍纳米颗粒。

2. 氧化还原反应法：通过向预先形成的镍纳米颗粒中缓慢添加H2PtCl6来制备镍-铂核壳纳米颗粒。

3. 碳负载合成法：与氧化还原法类似，但在还原反应前添加炭黑以制造负载型催化剂。

多元醇法允许控制纳米颗粒尺寸。氧化还原法能够形成核壳结构。添加碳载体可以改善分散性和稳定性。总的来说，这些方法可以很好地控制成分、结构和粒径，以优化催化性能。特别是碳负载法产生了对氨硼烷水解高度活性的催化剂。
