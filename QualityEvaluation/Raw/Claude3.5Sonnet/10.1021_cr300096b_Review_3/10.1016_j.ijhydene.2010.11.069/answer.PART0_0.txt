[1] "The Ni nanopaticles (Ni NPs), Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs), Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx NPs), the carbon-supported Ni1x@Ptx nanoparticles (Ni1x@Ptx/C NPs) (30 wt% Ni1x@Ptx loading) and the carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/C NPs) (30 wt% Pt loading) were prepared using an oleic acid as the surfactant"

[2] "The first step is the synthesis of Ni particles by a surfactant-mediated polyol process. The formation of the coreeshell nanostructures is attained in the second step through the reaction between Ni NPs and PtCl6
2."

[3] "We report on the carbon supported Ni coreePt shell Ni1x@Ptx/C (x  0.32, 0.43, 0.60, 0.67, and 0.80) nanoparticles as catalysts for hydrogen generation from hydrolysis of ammonia borane (NH3BH3). The catalysts are prepared through a polyol synthesis process with oleic acid as the surfactant."

The paper discusses a few synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Polyol synthesis process: This is the main method described, using oleic acid as a surfactant. It allows for control over particle size and distribution.

2. Two-step process: First, Ni nanoparticles are synthesized using a surfactant-mediated polyol process. Then, the core-shell structure is formed by reacting the Ni nanoparticles with PtCl6
2-.

3. Carbon support addition: For supported catalysts, carbon black is added during the synthesis process.

These methods offer advantages in terms of controlling particle size, achieving uniform dispersion, and forming specific structures like core-shell nanoparticles. The polyol process with oleic acid as surfactant seems particularly effective for producing small, well-dispersed nanoparticles. 

The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods, focusing mainly on the polyol process for this specific Ni-Pt core-shell catalyst system. Therefore, it's difficult to make broad comparisons about overall efficacy in catalyst production based solely on this paper.

本文讨论了几种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 多元醇合成法：这是文中描述的主要方法，使用油酸作为表面活性剂。这种方法可以控制粒子大小和分布。

2. 两步法：首先，使用表面活性剂介导的多元醇过程合成Ni纳米粒子。然后，通过Ni纳米粒子与PtCl6
2-反应形成核-壳结构。

3. 碳载体添加：对于负载型催化剂，在合成过程中添加碳黑。

这些方法在控制粒子大小、实现均匀分散以及形成特定结构（如核-壳纳米粒子）方面具有优势。使用油酸作为表面活性剂的多元醇法似乎特别有效，可以生产小而分散均匀的纳米粒子。

本文并未对不同合成方法进行全面比较，主要集中在这种特定Ni-Pt核-壳催化剂系统的多元醇合成法上。因此，仅基于这篇论文很难对催化剂生产的整体效果做出广泛的比较。
