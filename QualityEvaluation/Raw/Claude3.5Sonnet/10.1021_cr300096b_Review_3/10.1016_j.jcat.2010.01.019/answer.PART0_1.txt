[1] "Pt and Ni precursor solutions were made by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) precursor salts. Catalysts were dried at 373 K for 10 h and calcined at 563 K for 2 h. Sequentially impregnated catalysts were dried and calcined at the same conditions after each impregnation."

[2] "The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation. Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of impregnation sequence and the other to study the effect of Pt:Ni atomic ratio."

The main synthesis method discussed in this literature for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation. The study examines two key variables in this method:

1. Impregnation sequence: This includes Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation approaches.

2. Metal atomic ratio: Different Pt:Ni ratios were studied (1:1, 1:3, and 1:10).

The advantages of this method include its simplicity and ability to control metal loading and sequence. The study found that co-impregnation led to the highest extent of bimetallic formation and catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions. Increasing the Ni content in the bimetallic catalysts also improved activity.

This method is effective for producing supported bimetallic catalysts with tunable properties for applications such as hydrogenation reactions. The study demonstrates how synthesis parameters can be adjusted to optimize catalyst performance.

本文献中讨论的主要负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法。研究考察了该方法的两个关键变量：

1. 浸渍顺序：包括先浸渍Ni、先浸渍Pt和共浸渍三种方法。

2. 金属原子比：研究了不同的Pt:Ni比例(1:1、1:3和1:10)。

这种方法的优点包括操作简单，可以控制金属负载量和浸渍顺序。研究发现，共浸渍法可以形成最多的双金属键，并在氢化反应中表现出最高的催化活性。增加双金属催化剂中Ni的含量也可以提高活性。

这种方法可以有效地制备具有可调性能的负载型双金属催化剂，适用于氢化反应等应用。该研究表明，可以通过调整合成参数来优化催化剂性能。
