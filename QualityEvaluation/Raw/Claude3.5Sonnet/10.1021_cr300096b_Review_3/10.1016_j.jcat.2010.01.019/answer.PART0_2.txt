[1] "Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts were synthesized in order to study the effects of metal atomic ratio and impregnation sequence."

[2] "Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of metal atomic ratio and the other to study the effect of impregnation sequence."

[3] "The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation."

[4] "To study the effect of impregnation sequence, three catalysts with Pt:Ni atomic ratio of 1:3 were synthesized with the following sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation."

The document mainly discusses incipient wetness impregnation as the synthesis method for supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts. It compares different impregnation sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation. The study found that co-impregnation resulted in catalysts with the highest activity compared to sequentially impregnated catalysts. 

The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. It focuses specifically on incipient wetness impregnation and variations within this method. To fully answer the question about advantages, applications, and efficacy of different synthesis methods, additional information beyond what is provided in this document would be needed.

该文档主要讨论了浸渍法作为合成负载型Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的方法。它比较了不同的浸渍顺序:先浸渍Ni、先浸渍Pt和共浸渍。研究发现,与顺序浸渍的催化剂相比,共浸渍得到的催化剂活性最高。

文档并未全面比较支持的双金属催化剂的不同合成方法。它专门关注浸渍法及其变体。要全面回答有关不同合成方法的优势、应用和效果的问题,需要该文档提供的信息之外的额外信息。
