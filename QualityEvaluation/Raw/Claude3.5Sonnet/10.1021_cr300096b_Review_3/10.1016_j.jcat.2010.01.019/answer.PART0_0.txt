The literature primarily discusses incipient wetness impregnation as the synthesis method for supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts. It compares different impregnation sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation. The study found that co-impregnation resulted in the highest catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions. This suggests that co-impregnation may be more effective in promoting bimetallic bond formation. 

The advantages of these methods include the ability to control metal atomic ratios and impregnation sequences, which allows for tuning of catalyst properties. The main application discussed is hydrogenation of conjugated C=C bonds, specifically benzene and 1,3-butadiene. 

Overall, the efficacy of these synthesis methods appears to depend on how well they promote bimetallic bond formation, with co-impregnation showing the best results in this study. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all possible synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts.

该文献主要讨论了浸渍法作为合成负载型Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的方法。它比较了不同的浸渍顺序：先镍、先铂和共浸渍。研究发现，共浸渍法在加氢反应中表现出最高的催化活性。这表明共浸渍可能更有效地促进双金属键的形成。

这些方法的优点包括能够控制金属原子比和浸渍顺序，从而可以调节催化剂的性能。讨论的主要应用是共轭C=C键的加氢，特别是苯和1,3-丁二烯。

总的来说，这些合成方法的效果似乎取决于它们促进双金属键形成的能力，在这项研究中，共浸渍法显示出最佳结果。然而，该文献并未对双金属催化剂的所有可能合成方法进行全面比较。
