[1] "Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts were synthesized in order to study the effects of metal atomic ratio and impregnation sequence."

[2] "Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of metal atomic ratio and the other to study the effect of impregnation sequence."

[3] "The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation."

[4] "To study the effect of impregnation sequence, three catalysts with Pt:Ni atomic ratio of 1:3 were synthesized with the following sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation."

</quotes>

The literature primarily discusses incipient wetness impregnation as the synthesis method for supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts. It compares different impregnation sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation. The study found that co-impregnation resulted in the highest catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions. This suggests that co-impregnation may be more effective in promoting bimetallic bond formation. 

The advantages of these methods include the ability to control metal atomic ratios and impregnation sequences, which allows for tuning of catalyst properties. The main application discussed is hydrogenation of conjugated C=C bonds, specifically benzene and 1,3-butadiene. 

Overall, the efficacy of these synthesis methods appears to depend on how well they promote bimetallic bond formation, with co-impregnation showing the best results in this study. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all possible synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts.

该文献主要讨论了浸渍法作为合成负载型Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的方法。它比较了不同的浸渍顺序：先镍、先铂和共浸渍。研究发现，共浸渍法在加氢反应中表现出最高的催化活性。这表明共浸渍可能更有效地促进双金属键的形成。

这些方法的优点包括能够控制金属原子比和浸渍顺序，从而可以调节催化剂的性能。讨论的主要应用是共轭C=C键的加氢，特别是苯和1,3-丁二烯。

总的来说，这些合成方法的效果似乎取决于它们促进双金属键形成的能力，在这项研究中，共浸渍法显示出最佳结果。然而，该文献并未对双金属催化剂的所有可能合成方法进行全面比较。

[1] "Pt and Ni precursor solutions were made by adding the necessary volume of deionized water to the Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar) precursor salts. Catalysts were dried at 373 K for 10 h and calcined at 563 K for 2 h. Sequentially impregnated catalysts were dried and calcined at the same conditions after each impregnation."

[2] "The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation. Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of impregnation sequence and the other to study the effect of Pt:Ni atomic ratio."

The main synthesis method discussed in this literature for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation. The study examines two key variables in this method:

1. Impregnation sequence: This includes Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation approaches.

2. Metal atomic ratio: Different Pt:Ni ratios were studied (1:1, 1:3, and 1:10).

The advantages of this method include its simplicity and ability to control metal loading and sequence. The study found that co-impregnation led to the highest extent of bimetallic formation and catalytic activity for hydrogenation reactions. Increasing the Ni content in the bimetallic catalysts also improved activity.

This method is effective for producing supported bimetallic catalysts with tunable properties for applications such as hydrogenation reactions. The study demonstrates how synthesis parameters can be adjusted to optimize catalyst performance.

本文献中讨论的主要负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法。研究考察了该方法的两个关键变量：

1. 浸渍顺序：包括先浸渍Ni、先浸渍Pt和共浸渍三种方法。

2. 金属原子比：研究了不同的Pt:Ni比例(1:1、1:3和1:10)。

这种方法的优点包括操作简单，可以控制金属负载量和浸渍顺序。研究发现，共浸渍法可以形成最多的双金属键，并在氢化反应中表现出最高的催化活性。增加双金属催化剂中Ni的含量也可以提高活性。

这种方法可以有效地制备具有可调性能的负载型双金属催化剂，适用于氢化反应等应用。该研究表明，可以通过调整合成参数来优化催化剂性能。

The literature primarily discusses incipient wetness impregnation as the synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts. It compares different impregnation sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation. The study found that co-impregnation resulted in the highest hydrogenation activity compared to sequential impregnation methods. This suggests that co-impregnation may be more effective in producing well-mixed bimetallic nanoparticles. The research also examined the effect of metal atomic ratios on catalyst performance. While the document does not explicitly compare incipient wetness impregnation to other synthesis methods, it demonstrates that this technique can be used to study and control important parameters in bimetallic catalyst synthesis, such as metal ratio and impregnation sequence.

The main synthesis method discussed in the literature for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation. This method was used to produce both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3. 

The study explored different impregnation sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation. Co-impregnation was found to produce catalysts with the highest activity and greatest extent of bimetallic bond formation. This suggests co-impregnation may have advantages in terms of achieving better metal mixing and interactions.

The research also examined the effect of varying metal atomic ratios. While not a synthesis method per se, controlling the metal ratio is an important aspect of bimetallic catalyst preparation that can significantly impact catalyst properties and performance.

Overall, the incipient wetness method appears effective for producing supported bimetallic catalysts with tunable compositions and structures. The ability to control impregnation sequence and metal ratios allows for optimization of catalyst properties for specific applications.
