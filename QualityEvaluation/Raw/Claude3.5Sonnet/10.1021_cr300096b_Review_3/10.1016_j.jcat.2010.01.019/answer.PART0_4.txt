[1] "The γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts were synthesized using incipient wetness impregnation."

[2] "Three control monometallic catalysts were also synthesized: 1.7 wt.% Pt/γ-Al2O3, 1.5 wt.% Ni/γ-Al2O3, and 5.0 wt.% Ni/γ-Al2O3."

[3] "To study the effect of impregnation sequence, three catalysts with Pt:Ni atomic ratio of 1:3 were synthesized with the following sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation."

The main synthesis method discussed in the literature for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation. This method was used to produce both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3. 

The study explored different impregnation sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation. Co-impregnation was found to produce catalysts with the highest activity and greatest extent of bimetallic bond formation. This suggests co-impregnation may have advantages in terms of achieving better metal mixing and interactions.

The research also examined the effect of varying metal atomic ratios. While not a synthesis method per se, controlling the metal ratio is an important aspect of bimetallic catalyst preparation that can significantly impact catalyst properties and performance.

Overall, the incipient wetness method appears effective for producing supported bimetallic catalysts with tunable compositions and structures. The ability to control impregnation sequence and metal ratios allows for optimization of catalyst properties for specific applications.

文献中讨论的主要支持型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法。这种方法被用来制备单金属和双金属催化剂，以γ-Al2O3为载体。

研究探索了不同的浸渍顺序：先镍、先铂和共浸渍。结果发现，共浸渍法制备的催化剂具有最高的活性和最大程度的双金属键形成。这表明共浸渍可能在实现更好的金属混合和相互作用方面具有优势。

研究还考察了改变金属原子比例的效果。虽然这本身不是一种合成方法，但控制金属比例是双金属催化剂制备的一个重要方面，可以显著影响催化剂的性能和特性。

总的来说，浸渍法似乎是一种有效的方法，可以制备具有可调组成和结构的负载型双金属催化剂。控制浸渍顺序和金属比例的能力允许针对特定应用优化催化剂性能。
