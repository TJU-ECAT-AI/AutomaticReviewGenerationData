[1] "Pt/Ni bimetallic and Pt and Ni monometallic catalysts were supported on γ-Al2O3 using incipient wetness impregnation."

[2] "Two sets of bimetallic catalysts were synthesized: one set to study the effect of metal atomic ratio and the other to study the effect of impregnation sequence."

[3] "To study the effect of impregnation sequence, three catalysts with Pt:Ni atomic ratio of 1:3 were synthesized with the following sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation."

The literature primarily discusses incipient wetness impregnation as the synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts. It compares different impregnation sequences: Ni-first, Pt-first, and co-impregnation. The study found that co-impregnation resulted in the highest hydrogenation activity compared to sequential impregnation methods. This suggests that co-impregnation may be more effective in producing well-mixed bimetallic nanoparticles. The research also examined the effect of metal atomic ratios on catalyst performance. While the document does not explicitly compare incipient wetness impregnation to other synthesis methods, it demonstrates that this technique can be used to study and control important parameters in bimetallic catalyst synthesis, such as metal ratio and impregnation sequence.

该文献主要讨论了浸渍法作为合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法。它比较了不同的浸渍顺序:先镍、先铂和共浸渍。研究发现,与顺序浸渍方法相比,共浸渍产生的催化剂具有最高的加氢活性。这表明共浸渍可能在生产混合良好的双金属纳米颗粒方面更有效。该研究还考察了金属原子比对催化剂性能的影响。虽然文档没有明确将浸渍法与其他合成方法进行比较,但它展示了这种技术可用于研究和控制双金属催化剂合成中的重要参数,如金属比例和浸渍顺序。
