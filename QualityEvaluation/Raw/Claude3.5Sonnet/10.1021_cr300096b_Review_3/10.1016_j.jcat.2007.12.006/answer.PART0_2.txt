[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals"

[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods"

[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"

[4] "One possible alternative to traditional preparative techniques is electroless deposition (ED), wherein a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent."

[5] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals"

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These traditional methods are widely used in industrial scale production. However, they often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts with a mixture of monometallic and bimetallic particles of varying compositions.

Electroless deposition (ED) is presented as a promising alternative method. ED involves depositing a metal salt onto an activated catalytic metal site using a controlled chemical reaction. It offers several potential advantages:

1. Better control over metal placement
2. More targeted deposition of the secondary metal
3. Applicability to a wide range of metals
4. Industrial relevance

In terms of overall efficacy, ED appears to provide more precise control over the final catalyst composition compared to traditional methods. This can lead to improved catalyst performance and more consistent results. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all methods in terms of their overall efficacy in catalyst production.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是连续浸渍法和共浸渍法。这些传统方法广泛应用于工业规模生产。然而,它们通常对金属放置的控制不足,导致催化剂中混合了单金属颗粒和不同组成的双金属颗粒。

无电镀沉积法(ED)被提出作为一种有前景的替代方法。ED涉及使用受控化学反应将金属盐沉积到活化的催化金属位点上。它具有以下几个潜在优势:

1. 更好地控制金属放置
2. 对次要金属的沉积更有针对性
3. 适用于各种金属
4. 工业相关性

就整体效果而言,与传统方法相比,ED似乎能更精确地控制最终催化剂的组成。这可能会导致催化剂性能的提高和更一致的结果。然而,文献并未就所有方法在催化剂生产整体效果方面进行全面比较。
