[1] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods"

[2] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"

[3] "One possible alternative to traditional preparative techniques is electroless deposition (ED), wherein a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent."

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These traditional methods are widely used industrially but often provide poor control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts with a mixture of monometallic and bimetallic particles of varying compositions.

Electroless deposition (ED) is an alternative method that offers better control over the deposition of a second metal onto existing metal sites. ED involves using a controlled chemical reaction to deposit metal salts onto activated catalyst surfaces. It has several advantages:

1. More precise control over metal placement
2. Can produce true bimetallic particles 
3. Industrially relevant and scalable
4. Applicable to a wide range of metals

Overall, while impregnation methods are more common, ED appears to offer superior control for synthesizing well-defined bimetallic catalysts. However, the optimal method depends on the specific catalyst system and application requirements.

用于合成负载型双金属催化剂的最常用方法是连续浸渍法和共浸渍法。这些传统方法在工业上广泛使用,但通常对金属的放置控制较差,导致催化剂中含有单金属颗粒和成分各异的双金属颗粒的混合物。

无电解沉积(ED)是一种替代方法,可以更好地控制第二种金属在现有金属位点上的沉积。ED涉及使用受控化学反应将金属盐沉积到活化的催化剂表面上。它有几个优点:

1. 对金属放置的控制更精确
2. 可以生产真正的双金属颗粒
3. 具有工业相关性和可扩展性
4. 适用于多种金属

总的来说,虽然浸渍法更为常见,但ED似乎能为合成明确定义的双金属催化剂提供更好的控制。然而,最佳方法取决于具体的催化剂体系和应用要求。
