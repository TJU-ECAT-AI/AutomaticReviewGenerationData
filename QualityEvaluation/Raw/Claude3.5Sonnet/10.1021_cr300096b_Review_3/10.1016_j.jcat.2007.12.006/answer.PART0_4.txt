[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals"

[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods"

[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"

[4] "One possible alternative to traditional preparative techniques is electroless deposition (ED), wherein a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent."

[5] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals"

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These traditional methods are widely used in industrial processes due to their simplicity and scalability. However, they often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts with a mixture of monometallic and bimetallic particles of varying compositions.

An alternative method is electroless deposition (ED), which offers better control over the deposition of a second metal onto pre-existing metal sites. ED involves a controlled chemical reaction to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site activated by a reducing agent. This method provides more targeted placement of the secondary metal and can be applied to a wide range of metals.

Comparing these methods:

1. Traditional methods (impregnation):
Advantages: Simple, scalable for industrial use
Disadvantages: Poor control over metal placement, non-uniform composition

2. Electroless deposition:
Advantages: Better control over metal placement, more uniform composition, applicable to various metals, industrially relevant
Disadvantages: May be more complex than traditional methods

Overall, while traditional impregnation methods are still widely used, electroless deposition shows promise for producing more precisely engineered bimetallic catalysts with improved performance characteristics.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是连续浸渍法和共浸渍法。这些传统方法由于其简单性和可扩展性而在工业过程中广泛使用。然而，它们通常对金属放置的控制不足，导致催化剂中混合了单金属和双金属颗粒，且组成变化较大。

另一种替代方法是无电解沉积(ED)，它可以更好地控制第二种金属在预先存在的金属位点上的沉积。ED涉及一种受控的化学反应，将金属盐沉积到由还原剂激活的催化金属位点上。这种方法可以更有针对性地放置第二种金属，并且可以应用于多种金属。

比较这些方法：

1. 传统方法(浸渍法)：
优点：简单，可扩展用于工业生产
缺点：对金属放置控制不足，组成不均匀

2. 无电解沉积：
优点：对金属放置控制更好，组成更均匀，适用于各种金属，具有工业相关性
缺点：可能比传统方法更复杂

总的来说，虽然传统的浸渍方法仍被广泛使用，但无电解沉积显示出生产更精确设计的双金属催化剂的潜力，具有更好的性能特征。
