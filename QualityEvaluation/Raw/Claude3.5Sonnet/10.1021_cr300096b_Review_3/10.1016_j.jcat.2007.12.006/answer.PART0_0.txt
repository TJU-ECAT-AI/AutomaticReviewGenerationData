[1] "Over the last several decades bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts have replaced monometallic catalysts in industrial processes due to the beneficial activity, selectivity, and stability modifications that may be achieved by the inclusion of additional metals"

[2] "These bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts are often prepared on an industrial scale using either successive impregnation or co-impregnation methods"

[3] "However, these traditional methodologies frequently provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"

[4] "One possible alternative to traditional preparative techniques is electroless deposition (ED), wherein a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent."

[5] "Perhaps most importantly, ED is an industrially-relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals"

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are successive impregnation and co-impregnation. These traditional methods are widely used in industrial production due to their simplicity. However, they often provide inadequate control over metal placement, resulting in catalysts with a mixture of monometallic and bimetallic particles of varying compositions.

Electroless deposition (ED) is an alternative method that offers better control over the deposition process. In ED, a controlled chemical reaction deposits a metal salt onto an activated catalytic metal site. This method allows for more precise placement of the secondary metal on the surface of the primary metal.

The main advantages of ED include:
1. Better control over metal placement
2. More uniform bimetallic particle composition 
3. Applicability to a wide range of metals
4. Industrial relevance

In terms of overall efficacy, ED appears to offer superior control in producing true bimetallic catalysts compared to traditional impregnation methods. However, impregnation techniques remain widely used industrially due to their simplicity and established protocols. The choice of method depends on the specific catalytic application and desired catalyst properties.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是连续浸渍法和共浸渍法。这些传统方法由于其简单性而在工业生产中被广泛使用。然而，它们通常对金属放置控制不足，导致催化剂中混合了单金属颗粒和不同组成的双金属颗粒。

无电解沉积(ED)是一种可以更好地控制沉积过程的替代方法。在ED中，通过控制的化学反应将金属盐沉积到已活化的催化金属位点上。这种方法可以更精确地将次要金属放置在主要金属表面。

ED的主要优点包括：
1. 更好地控制金属放置
2. 更均匀的双金属颗粒组成
3. 适用于广泛的金属
4. 工业相关性

就整体效果而言，与传统的浸渍方法相比，ED似乎在生产真正的双金属催化剂方面提供了更好的控制。然而，由于其简单性和成熟的协议，浸渍技术在工业中仍然被广泛使用。方法的选择取决于特定的催化应用和所需的催化剂性能。
