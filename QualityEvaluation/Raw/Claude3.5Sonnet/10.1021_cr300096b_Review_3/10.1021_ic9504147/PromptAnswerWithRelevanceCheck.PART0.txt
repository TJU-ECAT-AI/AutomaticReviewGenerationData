Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not discuss common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts or compare different preparation techniques. The document focuses on characterizing specific platinum-gold clusters supported on silica and alumina, but does not provide information about general synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts or their comparative advantages. To answer this question would require information not present in the given text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的文献没有讨论支持型双金属催化剂的常用合成方法,也没有比较不同的制备技术。该文档主要关注于表征特定的铂-金簇合物支持在二氧化硅和氧化铝上,但没有提供关于支持型双金属催化剂一般合成方法或其比较优势的信息。要回答这个问题需要文中没有提供的信息。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide information about common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts or compare their advantages, applications, and efficacy. The text focuses on characterizing specific platinum-gold cluster compounds supported on silica and alumina, rather than discussing general catalyst synthesis methods. The synthesis approach described in the paper involves adsorbing pre-formed PtAu cluster compounds onto oxide supports from solution, which is just one possible method but not necessarily representative of common industrial practices for bimetallic catalyst preparation.

这篇文献并未提供关于支持型双金属催化剂常用合成方法的信息,也没有比较它们的优势、应用和效果。文章主要关注于表征特定的铂-金簇合物在二氧化硅和氧化铝载体上的性质,而不是讨论一般的催化剂合成方法。文中描述的合成方法是将预先形成的PtAu簇合物从溶液中吸附到氧化物载体上,这只是一种可能的方法,不一定代表双金属催化剂制备的常见工业实践。
