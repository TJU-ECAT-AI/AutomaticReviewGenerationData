[1] "Factors such as metal segregation and sintering, surface enrichment of the inactive metal, and compositional inhomogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation methods."

[2] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distributions, particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide ranging distributions in a given catalyst sample."

[3] "The use of zeolitic supports has shown promise for the preparation of small bimetallic particles, particularly for the platinum-copper system"

[4] "Recently, we reported on the preparation and characterization of supported bimetallic Pt-Au and Pt-Cu catalysts from the molecular cluster precursors Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 and Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8"

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation methods: These are widely used but often result in metal segregation, sintering, and compositional inhomogeneity.

2. Advanced techniques for controlling particle size and distribution: These offer some improvements over conventional methods but still face challenges with particle and surface composition uniformity.

3. Use of zeolitic supports: This approach has shown promise, especially for platinum-copper systems, in preparing small bimetallic particles.

4. Molecular cluster precursors: This is a more recent method that has been used to prepare highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Au and Pt-Cu systems.

Each method has its own advantages and limitations. Conventional impregnation is simple but lacks control over particle characteristics. Advanced techniques offer better control but may still struggle with uniformity. Zeolitic supports can help create small particles but may be limited to certain metal combinations. The molecular cluster precursor method shows promise in creating highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles, potentially overcoming some limitations of other methods.

The efficacy of these methods varies depending on the specific metal combination and desired catalyst properties. The choice of method often depends on the intended application, with more precise control methods being favored for applications requiring highly specific particle characteristics or uniform composition.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍法：这种方法广泛使用，但常常导致金属分离、烧结和成分不均匀。

2. 控制粒子尺寸和分布的先进技术：这些技术比传统方法有所改进，但在粒子和表面成分均匀性方面仍面临挑战。

3. 使用沸石载体：这种方法在制备小型双金属粒子方面显示出前景，特别是对于铂-铜系统。

4. 分子簇前驱体：这是一种较新的方法，用于制备高度分散的双金属催化剂，如Pt-Au和Pt-Cu系统。

每种方法都有其优势和局限性。传统浸渍法简单，但对粒子特性缺乏控制。先进技术提供了更好的控制，但在均匀性方面可能仍有困难。沸石载体可以帮助创造小粒子，但可能仅限于某些金属组合。分子簇前驱体方法在创造高度分散和均匀的双金属粒子方面显示出前景，可能克服了其他方法的一些限制。

这些方法的效果因特定的金属组合和所需的催化剂性质而异。方法的选择通常取决于预期的应用，对于需要高度特定粒子特性或均匀成分的应用，更倾向于使用更精确的控制方法。
