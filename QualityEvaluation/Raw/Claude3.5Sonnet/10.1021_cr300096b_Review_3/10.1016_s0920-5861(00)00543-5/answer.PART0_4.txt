The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation: This involves impregnating the support with metal precursor solutions. However, it often results in metal segregation, sintering, and inhomogeneous particle composition.

2. Zeolitic supports: Using zeolites as supports has shown promise for preparing small bimetallic particles, especially for Pt-Cu systems.

3. Molecular cluster precursors: This involves using bimetallic molecular clusters as precursors, which can lead to highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles.

4. Incipient wetness impregnation: This method is commonly used for preparing conventional catalysts, such as Pt catalysts from platinic acid precursors.

The molecular cluster precursor method appears to have advantages in terms of producing highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles, which can be difficult to achieve with conventional impregnation methods. This approach may be particularly useful for systems where bulk alloys are not thermodynamically stable, such as Pt-Au. Zeolitic supports also show promise for certain systems like Pt-Cu.

The efficacy of these methods depends on the specific metal combination and desired catalyst properties. Conventional impregnation, while widely used, may not be ideal for all bimetallic systems due to issues with particle uniformity and composition. The molecular cluster and zeolitic support approaches offer potential improvements in particle size control and uniformity for certain applications.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍法：这涉及将金属前体溶液浸渍到载体上。然而，它常常导致金属分离、烧结和颗粒组成不均匀。

2. 沸石载体：使用沸石作为载体已显示出制备小型双金属颗粒的前景，特别是对于Pt-Cu系统。

3. 分子簇前体：这涉及使用双金属分子簇作为前体，可以产生高度分散和均匀的双金属颗粒。

4. 等体积浸渍法：这种方法常用于制备传统催化剂，如从铂酸前体制备Pt催化剂。

分子簇前体方法在生产高度分散和均匀的双金属颗粒方面似乎具有优势，这在传统浸渍方法中难以实现。这种方法可能特别适用于块状合金在热力学上不稳定的系统，如Pt-Au。沸石载体对某些系统（如Pt-Cu）也显示出前景。

这些方法的效果取决于特定的金属组合和所需的催化剂性能。虽然传统浸渍法被广泛使用，但由于颗粒均匀性和组成的问题，可能并不适合所有双金属系统。分子簇和沸石载体方法在某些应用中可能在颗粒大小控制和均匀性方面提供潜在的改进。
