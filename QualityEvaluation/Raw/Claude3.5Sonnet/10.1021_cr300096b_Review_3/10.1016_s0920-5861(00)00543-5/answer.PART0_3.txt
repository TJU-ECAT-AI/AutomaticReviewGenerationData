[1] "Factors such as metal segregation and sintering, surface enrichment of the inactive metal, and compositional inhomogeneity of bimetallic particles make the preparation of highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles difficult with conventional impregnation methods."

[2] "Although some techniques allow for a degree of control over metal particle sizes and distributions, particle composition and surface composition of metals may have wide ranging distributions in a given catalyst sample."

[3] "The use of zeolitic supports has shown promise for the preparation of small bimetallic particles, particularly for the platinum-copper system"

[4] "Recently, we reported on the preparation and characterization of supported bimetallic Pt-Au and Pt-Cu catalysts from the molecular cluster precursors Pt2Au4(CCtBu)8 and Pt2Cu4(CCtBu)8"

The most common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Conventional impregnation: This method is widely used but has limitations in controlling particle size, composition, and distribution.

2. Techniques allowing some control over particle size and distribution: These offer improvements over conventional impregnation but still face challenges in achieving uniform composition.

3. Use of zeolitic supports: This approach has shown promise, especially for platinum-copper systems, in preparing small bimetallic particles.

4. Molecular cluster precursors: A newer method involving the use of bimetallic molecular clusters as precursors, which has shown potential for creating highly dispersed and uniform bimetallic particles.

Each method has its advantages and limitations. Conventional impregnation is simple but lacks control. More advanced techniques offer better control but may be more complex. Zeolitic supports can help with certain metal combinations. The molecular cluster precursor method shows promise for creating well-defined bimetallic particles but may be limited to specific metal combinations.

The efficacy of these methods varies. Conventional methods are widely applicable but may not produce optimal catalysts. Newer methods like molecular cluster precursors can produce highly dispersed and uniform particles, potentially leading to better catalytic performance. The choice of method depends on the specific metals, desired particle characteristics, and intended application of the catalyst.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 传统浸渍法：这种方法使用广泛，但在控制粒子大小、成分和分布方面存在局限性。

2. 允许对粒子大小和分布进行一定程度控制的技术：这些技术比传统浸渍法有所改进，但在实现均匀成分方面仍面临挑战。

3. 使用分子筛支持：这种方法在制备小型双金属粒子方面显示出前景，特别是对于铂-铜系统。

4. 分子簇前驱体：一种较新的方法，涉及使用双金属分子簇作为前驱体，这种方法在创建高度分散和均匀的双金属粒子方面显示出潜力。

每种方法都有其优势和局限性。传统浸渍法简单但缺乏控制。更先进的技术提供了更好的控制，但可能更复杂。分子筛支持可以帮助某些金属组合。分子簇前驱体方法在创建定义明确的双金属粒子方面显示出前景，但可能仅限于特定的金属组合。

这些方法的效力各不相同。传统方法适用范围广，但可能无法产生最佳催化剂。像分子簇前驱体这样的较新方法可以产生高度分散和均匀的粒子，可能会带来更好的催化性能。方法的选择取决于特定的金属、所需的粒子特性和催化剂的预期应用。
