[1] "The mono- and bimetallic Pt and Pd supported on γ-alumina at 300 C and 500 psig in excess of H2."

[2] "1.6 wt.% Pt/Al2O3, 0.8 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 and 0.4 wt.% Pt-0.6 wt.% Pd/Al2O3 catalysts with and without fluorine (3 wt.% F) were prepared by typical incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) using two different solvents, ethylene glycol or deionized water."

[3] "The addition of ammonium fluoride was conducted in the same manner as the metals, using deionized water as a solvent. The order of fluorine and metal addition was varied in some catalysts."

The literature discusses incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) as a synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts. This method involves using either ethylene glycol or deionized water as solvents. The order of adding components (metals and fluorine) can be varied. However, the document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods or discuss their relative advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production. To fully answer this question, additional information from other sources would be needed.

该文献讨论了浸渍法(IWI)作为一种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法。这种方法涉及使用乙二醇或去离子水作为溶剂。添加组分(金属和氟)的顺序可以改变。然而,该文档并未提供不同合成方法的全面比较,也没有讨论它们在催化剂生产中的相对优势、应用和整体效果。要全面回答这个问题,需要从其他来源获取额外的信息。
