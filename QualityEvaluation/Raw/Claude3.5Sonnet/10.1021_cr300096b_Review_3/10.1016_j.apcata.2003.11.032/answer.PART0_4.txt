The literature does not directly discuss synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. The document focuses on the hydrogenation of polyaromatic compounds using Pt-Pd catalysts, but does not go into detail about the synthesis methods used to produce these catalysts. The only information provided about catalyst preparation is that they were made by incipient wetness impregnation using either ethylene glycol or deionized water as solvents. Without more specific information about synthesis methods and their comparative advantages, this question cannot be fully answered based solely on the given literature.

该文献并未直接讨论制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法。文档主要关注使用Pt-Pd催化剂进行多环芳烃化合物的加氢,但并未详细介绍制备这些催化剂所使用的合成方法。关于催化剂制备,文中仅提供的信息是使用乙二醇或去离子水作为溶剂进行浸渍法制备。由于缺乏关于合成方法及其比较优势的更具体信息,仅凭所给文献无法全面回答这个问题。
