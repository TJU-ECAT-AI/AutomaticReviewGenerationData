The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of non-noble materials, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have potential advantages in creating core-shell structures with an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell, which can improve catalyst performance while reducing the amount of precious metals used.

However, these traditional methods also have significant drawbacks. They can result in a loss of active surface area and material, formation of incomplete noble-metal shells, and may require potential control during preparation. These limitations affect their overall efficacy in catalyst production.

The literature presents a novel preparation procedure using adsorbate-induced surface segregation, which aims to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional methods. This new approach offers the potential for improved catalyst synthesis without the drawbacks associated with traditional techniques.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属化学浸出和电化学沉积技术。这些方法在创建核壳结构方面具有潜在优势，即用廉价的非贵金属核心包裹贵金属外壳，这可以在减少贵金属使用量的同时提高催化剂性能。

然而，这些传统方法也有显著的缺点。它们可能导致活性表面积和材料的损失，形成不完整的贵金属外壳，并且在制备过程中可能需要电位控制。这些限制影响了它们在催化剂生产中的整体效率。

文献提出了一种使用吸附诱导表面偏析的新型制备程序，旨在克服传统方法的缺点。这种新方法为改进催化剂合成提供了潜力，同时避免了与传统技术相关的缺点。
