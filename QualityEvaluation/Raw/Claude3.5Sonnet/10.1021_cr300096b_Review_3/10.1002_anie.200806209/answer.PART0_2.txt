[1] "Coreshell catalyst structures containing an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell can bring about further improvements in this respect."

[2] "A promising class of fuel-cell-cathode catalysts are alloys of platinum with other transition metals."

[3] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, or electrochemical deposition techniques."

[4] "All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."

[5] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of non-noble materials, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have different advantages and applications, but also exhibit significant disadvantages.

High-temperature annealing can create core-shell structures but may lead to loss of active surface area. Chemical leaching can remove non-noble materials to form a noble metal shell, but may result in incomplete shell formation. Electrochemical deposition allows for controlled synthesis but requires potential control during preparation.

A novel method introduced in this study is the adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect, which overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional methods. This approach uses CO annealing to induce platinum segregation to the surface of Pt3Co nanoparticles, forming a platinum shell around an alloy core. This method maintains the particle size, prevents active surface area loss, and produces highly active catalysts with a low amount of noble metal.

Overall, while traditional methods have been widely used, they each have limitations. The new adsorbate-induced surface segregation method shows promise in producing more effective supported bimetallic catalysts, particularly for applications such as fuel cell cathodes and oxygen reduction reactions.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属化学浸出和电化学沉积技术。这些方法具有不同的优势和应用，但也存在显著的缺点。

高温退火可以创建核壳结构，但可能导致活性表面积损失。化学浸出可以去除非贵金属形成贵金属壳层，但可能导致壳层形成不完整。电化学沉积允许受控合成，但在制备过程中需要电位控制。

本研究介绍了一种新方法，即吸附剂诱导的表面偏析效应，克服了传统方法的缺点。这种方法使用CO退火诱导铂在Pt3Co纳米颗粒表面偏析，在合金核心周围形成铂壳层。这种方法保持了粒子尺寸，防止活性表面积损失，并生产出贵金属含量低但活性高的催化剂。

总的来说，虽然传统方法被广泛使用，但它们各自都有局限性。新的吸附剂诱导表面偏析方法在生产更有效的支持型双金属催化剂方面显示出潜力，特别是在燃料电池阴极和氧还原反应等应用中。
