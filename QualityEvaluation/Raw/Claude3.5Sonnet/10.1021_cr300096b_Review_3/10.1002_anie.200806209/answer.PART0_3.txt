[1] "Coreshell catalyst structures containing an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell can bring about further improvements in this respect."

[2] "A promising class of fuel-cell-cathode catalysts are alloys of platinum with other transition metals."

[3] "For these materials coreshell structures can be achieved by high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, or electrochemical deposition techniques."

[4] "All of these methods, however, exhibit significant disadvantages including the loss in active surface area and material, the formation of an incomplete noble-metal shell, and the necessity for potential control during preparation."

[5] "Herein we present a novel preparation procedure of such coreshell nanoparticles with a platinum shell that overcomes these issues by using an adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of non-noble materials, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have different advantages and applications, but also come with significant drawbacks.

High-temperature annealing can create core-shell structures but may lead to a loss of active surface area. Chemical leaching can remove non-noble materials to create a noble metal shell, but risks forming an incomplete shell. Electrochemical deposition allows for controlled deposition of the noble metal layer but requires potential control during preparation.

The literature presents a novel method using adsorbate-induced surface segregation to overcome these issues. This technique involves CO annealing, which causes platinum atoms to segregate to the particle surface, forming a platinum shell around an alloy core. This method appears to be more effective for nanocatalysts, as it doesn't alter particle size or cause loss of active surface area.

Overall, while traditional methods have their applications, they each have limitations. The new adsorbate-induced surface segregation method shows promise in producing highly active catalysts with a low amount of noble metal, potentially offering advantages over conventional techniques.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属化学浸出和电化学沉积技术。这些方法有不同的优势和应用，但也存在显著的缺点。

高温退火可以创建核壳结构，但可能导致活性表面积的损失。化学浸出可以去除非贵金属以创建贵金属壳层，但有形成不完整壳层的风险。电化学沉积允许对贵金属层进行受控沉积，但在制备过程中需要电位控制。

文献提出了一种利用吸附诱导表面偏析的新方法来克服这些问题。这种技术涉及CO退火，使铂原子偏析到粒子表面，在合金核心周围形成铂壳层。这种方法似乎对纳米催化剂更有效，因为它不会改变粒子大小或导致活性表面积的损失。

总的来说，虽然传统方法有其应用，但它们各自都有局限性。新的吸附诱导表面偏析方法在生产具有低贵金属含量的高活性催化剂方面显示出潜力，可能比传统技术具有优势。
