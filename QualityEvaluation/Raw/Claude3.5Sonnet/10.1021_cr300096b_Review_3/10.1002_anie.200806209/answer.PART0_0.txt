The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have potential advantages in creating core-shell structures with an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell, which can improve catalyst performance while reducing the amount of precious metal used.

However, these traditional methods also have significant drawbacks. High-temperature annealing and chemical leaching can result in a loss of active surface area and material. Electrochemical deposition may form an incomplete noble-metal shell and requires potential control during preparation. These limitations can affect the overall efficacy of catalyst production.

The literature introduces a novel preparation procedure using adsorbate-induced surface segregation, which aims to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional methods. This new approach potentially offers improved efficacy in catalyst production by maintaining the active surface area and forming a complete noble-metal shell without the need for potential control during preparation.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属化学浸出和电化学沉积技术。这些方法在创建具有廉价非贵金属核心和贵金属外壳的核壳结构方面具有潜在优势，可以在减少贵金属使用量的同时提高催化剂性能。

然而，这些传统方法也有重大缺点。高温退火和化学浸出可能导致活性表面积和材料的损失。电化学沉积可能形成不完整的贵金属壳层，并且在制备过程中需要电位控制。这些限制可能影响催化剂生产的整体效率。

文献介绍了一种使用吸附诱导表面偏析的新型制备方法，旨在克服传统方法的缺点。这种新方法可能通过保持活性表面积并形成完整的贵金属壳层而不需要在制备过程中进行电位控制，从而提高催化剂生产的效率。
