The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of the non-noble material, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have potential advantages in creating core-shell structures with an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell, which can improve catalyst performance while reducing the amount of precious metal used.

However, these traditional methods also have significant drawbacks. High-temperature annealing and chemical leaching can result in a loss of active surface area and material. Electrochemical deposition may form an incomplete noble-metal shell and requires potential control during preparation. These limitations can affect the overall efficacy of catalyst production.

The literature introduces a novel preparation procedure using adsorbate-induced surface segregation, which aims to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional methods. This new approach potentially offers improved efficacy in catalyst production by maintaining the active surface area and forming a complete noble-metal shell without the need for potential control during preparation.

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of non-noble materials, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have different advantages and applications, but also exhibit significant disadvantages.

High-temperature annealing can create core-shell structures but may lead to loss of active surface area. Chemical leaching can remove non-noble materials to form a noble metal shell, but may result in incomplete shell formation. Electrochemical deposition allows for controlled synthesis but requires potential control during preparation.

A novel method introduced in this study is the adsorbate-induced surface segregation effect, which overcomes the disadvantages of the traditional methods. This approach uses CO annealing to induce platinum segregation to the surface of Pt3Co nanoparticles, forming a platinum shell around an alloy core. This method maintains the particle size, prevents active surface area loss, and produces highly active catalysts with a low amount of noble metal.

Overall, while traditional methods have been widely used, they each have limitations. The new adsorbate-induced surface segregation method shows promise in producing more effective supported bimetallic catalysts, particularly for applications such as fuel cell cathodes and oxygen reduction reactions.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属化学浸出和电化学沉积技术。这些方法具有不同的优势和应用，但也存在显著的缺点。

高温退火可以创建核壳结构，但可能导致活性表面积损失。化学浸出可以去除非贵金属形成贵金属壳层，但可能导致壳层形成不完整。电化学沉积允许受控合成，但在制备过程中需要电位控制。

本研究介绍了一种新方法，即吸附剂诱导的表面偏析效应，克服了传统方法的缺点。这种方法使用CO退火诱导铂在Pt3Co纳米颗粒表面偏析，在合金核心周围形成铂壳层。这种方法保持了粒子尺寸，防止活性表面积损失，并生产出贵金属含量低但活性高的催化剂。

总的来说，虽然传统方法被广泛使用，但它们各自都有局限性。新的吸附剂诱导表面偏析方法在生产更有效的支持型双金属催化剂方面显示出潜力，特别是在燃料电池阴极和氧还原反应等应用中。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of non-noble materials, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have different advantages and applications, but also come with significant drawbacks.

High-temperature annealing can create core-shell structures but may lead to a loss of active surface area. Chemical leaching can remove non-noble materials to create a noble metal shell, but risks forming an incomplete shell. Electrochemical deposition allows for controlled deposition of the noble metal layer but requires potential control during preparation.

The literature presents a novel method using adsorbate-induced surface segregation to overcome these issues. This technique involves CO annealing, which causes platinum atoms to segregate to the particle surface, forming a platinum shell around an alloy core. This method appears to be more effective for nanocatalysts, as it doesn't alter particle size or cause loss of active surface area.

Overall, while traditional methods have their applications, they each have limitations. The new adsorbate-induced surface segregation method shows promise in producing highly active catalysts with a low amount of noble metal, potentially offering advantages over conventional techniques.

文献提出了一种利用吸附诱导表面偏析的新方法来克服这些问题。这种技术涉及CO退火，使铂原子偏析到粒子表面，在合金核心周围形成铂壳层。这种方法似乎对纳米催化剂更有效，因为它不会改变粒子大小或导致活性表面积的损失。

总的来说，虽然传统方法有其应用，但它们各自都有局限性。新的吸附诱导表面偏析方法在生产具有低贵金属含量的高活性催化剂方面显示出潜力，可能比传统技术具有优势。
