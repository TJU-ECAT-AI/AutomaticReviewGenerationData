The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include high-temperature annealing, chemical leaching of non-noble materials, and electrochemical deposition techniques. These methods have potential advantages in creating core-shell structures with an inexpensive, non-noble core surrounded by a noble-metal shell, which can improve catalyst performance while reducing the amount of precious metals used.

However, these traditional methods also have significant drawbacks. They can result in loss of active surface area and material, formation of incomplete noble-metal shells, and may require careful potential control during preparation. These limitations can negatively impact the overall efficacy of catalyst production.

The literature presents a novel preparation procedure using adsorbate-induced surface segregation to overcome these issues. This method involves CO annealing, which induces platinum atoms to segregate to the particle surface, forming a platinum shell around an alloy core. This technique appears to be more effective for nanocatalysts, as it maintains particle size and does not result in active surface area loss.

Overall, while traditional methods have been widely used, they each have specific drawbacks that can limit their effectiveness. The novel adsorbate-induced surface segregation method shows promise in addressing these limitations and improving the overall efficacy of bimetallic catalyst production.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括高温退火、非贵金属的化学浸出和电化学沉积技术。这些方法在创建具有廉价非贵金属核心和贵金属外壳的核壳结构方面具有潜在优势，可以在减少贵金属使用量的同时提高催化剂性能。

然而，这些传统方法也有明显的缺点。它们可能导致活性表面积和材料的损失，形成不完整的贵金属外壳，并且在制备过程中可能需要仔细控制电位。这些限制可能会对催化剂生产的整体效率产生负面影响。

文献提出了一种新的制备程序，使用吸附剂诱导表面偏析来克服这些问题。这种方法涉及CO退火，它诱导铂原子偏析到粒子表面，在合金核心周围形成铂壳。这种技术似乎对纳米催化剂更有效，因为它保持了粒子大小，并且不会导致活性表面积损失。

总的来说，虽然传统方法被广泛使用，但它们各自都有特定的缺点，可能限制其有效性。这种新的吸附剂诱导表面偏析方法在解决这些限制和提高双金属催化剂生产的整体效率方面显示出了前景。
