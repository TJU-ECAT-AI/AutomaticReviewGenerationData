Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over size and composition of bimetallic particles, but requires careful removal of carbon from surfactants.

Core-shell synthesis can create catalysts with a low-cost transition metal core and precious metal shell, potentially offering high activity and stability.

Reverse micelle synthesis produces nanoparticles with narrow size distribution, with particle size controllable by adjusting synthesis parameters.

Dendrimer support synthesis yields monodisperse particles with very small diameters, overcoming size distribution issues of traditional methods.

Each method has its strengths and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the catalyst and its intended application. The choice depends on factors such as desired metal loading, particle size, uniformity, and the specific metals involved in the bimetallic catalyst.
