The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Wet Impregnation Method: This is the most widely used due to its simplicity in sample preparation.

2. Slurry Synthesis Method: Ideal for catalysts with high metal loadings or supports with low surface areas.

3. Organometallic Cluster Precursors: Provides better uniformity of bimetallic catalysts compared to conventional methods.

4. Reductive Deposition Precipitation: Useful for producing highly coordinated bimetallic catalysts from monometallic ones.

5. Electroless Deposition: Similar to reductive deposition but uses a controlled chemical reaction.

6. Colloidal Synthesis: Offers precise control over size and composition of bimetallic particles.

7. Core-Shell Synthesis: Creates nanoparticle catalysts with a transition metal core and a shell of another metal.

8. Reverse Micelle Synthesis: Produces supported metallic nanoparticles with narrow size distribution.

9. Dendrimer Support Synthesis: Yields monodisperse particles, overcoming limitations of traditional impregnation techniques.

These methods compare in terms of their advantages, applications, and efficacy as follows:

- Wet Impregnation is the most common due to its simplicity, but may not provide the best control over particle size and distribution.
- Slurry Synthesis is beneficial for specific catalyst types but may not offer the finest control over particle characteristics.
- Organometallic Cluster Precursors and Colloidal Synthesis offer better control over particle size and composition, making them suitable for applications requiring precise catalyst properties.
- Reductive Deposition Precipitation and Electroless Deposition are useful for modifying existing catalysts, allowing for the creation of bimetallic catalysts with specific properties.
- Core-Shell Synthesis can create catalysts with unique properties by combining different metals in a structured way.
- Reverse Micelle and Dendrimer Support Synthesis methods offer excellent control over particle size distribution, which is crucial for certain catalytic applications.

The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the catalyst, including desired metal loading, particle size, distribution, and the nature of the support material. Each method has its strengths and is suited to different applications in catalyst production.
