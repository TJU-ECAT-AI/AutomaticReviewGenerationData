Alumina-supported Ru and Ru–Pt catalysts, derived from either organometallic clusters
([HRu3(CO)11], Ru3(CO)12 and [Ru5PtC(CO)15]2) or inorganic salts, were investigated for
their performance in the production of hydrogen via the steam reforming of ethanol. The
cluster-derived catalysts were found to be more active and selective than a commercial
catalyst as well as their salt-derived counterparts. Although all three cluster-derived
catalysts exhibit similar activity and selectivity, it appears that the presence of Pt might
help to promote water gas shift reaction at low temperatures, while ethanol C–C bond
cleavage also appears to be facilitated over the bimetallic cluster-derived catalyst. With the
use of cluster precursors, excellent control of bimetallic composition and smaller particle
sizes were achieved. This approach is demonstrated to be useful in the design of efﬁcient
ethanol steam reforming catalysts.

Introduction
The hydrogen economy is seen as a possible solution to the
various economical, environmental and security woes asso-
ciated with the current fossil fuel-based economy [1–5].
Hydrogen is, however, rarely found in its elemental form on
Earth. As such, a hydrogen economy would only be realisable
with sustainable and cost-effective large-scale H2 production
technologies. Besides the conventional steam reforming of
natural gas, various H2 production methods are currently
being explored, including the partial oxidation of methane [6],
gasiﬁcation
of
coal
[7],
electrolysis
or
thermochemical
decomposition of water [8], microbial H2 metabolism [9,10],
and the reforming of ethanol [4,11–18]. In particular, there are
several advantages of using this last production method.
Firstly, bio-ethanol, which can be obtained by fermentation of
carbohydrate-rich plants, is considered to be a renewable fuel.
In addition, the whole cycle from the growing of crops to the

production hydrogen is potentially carbon neutral, though in
practice,
the
balance
between
CO2
uptake
and
release
depends on various factors, including infrastructure, the type
of crops and processing methods [19–21]. Ethanol also has
a comparatively high hydrogen/carbon ratio, can be easily
transported, and is relatively non-toxic.
The steam reforming of ethanol, as represented in Eq. (1), is
an attractive method for on-board hydrogen generation in
vehicles powered by proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells
(PEMFCs), which typically operate at relatively low tempera-
tures and have
notoriously
low CO-tolerance [22]. The
advantage of this method is that more hydrogen can be
produced per mole of ethanol reformed, since hydrogen can
also be extracted from the steam.

Most of the ethanol steam reforming studies reported to date
haveinvolved either inorganic oxides[16,17] oroxide-supported
metals
[23–31] as catalysts. Various catalyst
preparation
methods have been reported in the literature, including
precipitation [29,30], deposition–precipitation [23], co-precipi-
tation [30], sol–gel [31], sonochemical [32], and most frequently,
incipient
wetness
impregnation
[24–27].
Organometallic
cluster-derived nanoparticles have been previously reported to
be more stable and active than their salt-derived counterparts,
and were used successfully as catalysts for hydrogenation
reactions [33–35]. However, in spite of its demonstrated advan-
tages, to the best of our knowledge, no cluster-derived ethanol
steam reforming catalysts have been reported prior to our
recent communication [11]. Therein, the catalytic performance
of a monometallic Ru cluster-derived catalyst and a bimetallic
Ru–Pt cluster-derived catalyst outperformed all their salt-
derivedcounterparts, as well as a commercial Ru/Al2O3 catalyst.
In the previous report, the two cluster-derived catalysts
were prepared from the cluster anions [HRu3(CO)11] and
[Ru5PtC(CO)15]2 [11]. In this work, an additional cluster-
derived catalyst, also supported on g-Al2O3, was prepared
from the neutral cluster Ru3(CO)12. These cluster precursors
were chosen so that differences between neutral and charged
cluster precursors (Ru(2.5)[c0] versus Ru(2.5)[c]), as well as the
bimetallic effects of platinum (Ru(2.5)[c], Ru(2.5)[c0] versus
Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c]), could be studied. The differences between the
three cluster-derived catalysts vis-a
`-vis their salt-derived
counterparts were studied to allow for better rationalisation of
future catalyst designs. To probe such differences, various
techniques,
including
transmission
electron
microscopy
(TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-
programmed reduction (TPR), temperature-programmed H2
desorption (H2-TPD) and ethanol temperature-programmed
desorption (EtOH-TPD) have been employed. The results of
these studies will be discussed herein.

Experimental
2.1.
Precursor and catalyst preparation
Ru3(CO)12 (Oxkem) was puriﬁed by recrystallization according
to the supplier’s instructions before use. Gases and other
reagent
grade
chemicals
were
obtained
from
various
commercial sources and used without further puriﬁcation.
Distilled water was used to prepare aqueous solutions. The
cluster
compounds
[Et4N][HRu3(CO)11]
[36]
and
[PPh4]2[Ru5PtC(CO)15] [37] were synthesized following litera-
ture methods. Syntheses and manipulations of organome-
tallic clusters were carried out under an argon atmosphere,
using standard Schlenk techniques. Manipulations of inor-
ganic salts were carried out on the open bench, without
precautions to exclude oxygen or moisture.
Supported cluster-derived catalysts of nominal 2.5 wt.% Ru
loadings were prepared as previously described [11,33–35].
Brieﬂy, the cluster precursor and the g-Al2O3 (Merck) support
were slurred in a two-solvent system (diethyl ether/dichloro-
methane, or diethyl ether/ethanol). The system was chosen
such that the cluster was insoluble in the ﬁrst bulk solvent but
soluble in the second solvent, of which only a few drops were
added. The slurry was stirred for 2 d at room temperature to
load the cluster onto the support. The mixture was then ﬁltered
under Ar. The residue was washed with a small amount of the
ﬁrst solvent, which was then removed as before. Finally, the
residue was heated at 195 C under vacuum for 6 h to yield
the catalyst as a greyish powder. Catalysts were prepared from
Ru3(CO)12, [Et4N][HRu3(CO)11] and [PPh4]2[Ru5PtC(CO)15], and
will hereafter be referred to as Ru(2.5)[c0], Ru(2.5)[c], and
Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c], respectively, where [c0] refers to a neutral
cluster precursor and [c] an anionic cluster precursor.
Salt-derived Ru/Pt catalysts were prepared using the
incipient wetness impregnation method, with aqueous solu-
tions of RuCl3.nH2O and/or H2PtCl6.nH2O and g-Al2O3 as
support. Impregnation refers to the process by which the solid
support is contacted with a certain volume of solution con-
taining the precursor of the active catalyst element (the
inorganic salts in this case). If the solution volume equals, or is
smaller than, the pore volume of the support, then this
method is known as incipient wetness [38]. For simplicity,
salt-derived
impregnation
catalysts
will
be
denoted
as
Ru(x)Pt( y)[i], where x and y are the nominal weight percent-
ages of Ru and Pt, respectively. A 5 wt.% Ru/Al2O3 commercial
catalyst (Strem Chemicals) was also tested. This catalyst is
hereafter referred to as Ru(5)[com].
Finally, a 1% Rh catalyst was prepared using the incipient
wetnessimpregnationmethodfromaRhCl3.nH2Osolution,while
a ZnO-supported Co catalyst of nominal 2.5 wt.% Co was
prepared in accordance to the reported procedure [28]. These two
catalysts, hereafter referred to as Rh(1) and Co(2.5), are consid-
ered to be among the best performing ethanol steam reforming
catalysts [12,24,25] and were prepared for comparison.
2.2.
Catalyst characterisation
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and temperature-
programmed
desorption
of
H2
(H2-TPD)
studies
were
performed using a TPDRO 1100 series equipment (Thermo-
electron). For TPR study, the catalyst was ﬁrst heated at 500 C
under Ar gas ﬂow for 30 min to remove any absorbed species
such as CO2 or H2O. TPR was then carried out from room
temperature to 500 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min in the gas
ﬂow of 5% H2/Ar. For H2-TPD study, the catalyst was reduced at
500 C (for Ru/Pt catalysts)/300 C (for Rh catalyst) for 2 h, then
purged with Argas whilecooling downto 30 C.At 30 C,H2 was
i n t e r n a t i o n a l j o u r n a l o f h y d r o g e n e n e r g y 3 4 ( 2 0 0 9 ) 5 6 9 1 – 5 7 0 3

introduced again to allow adsorption for 1 h. After that, the
sample was purged by Ar at 30 C for another 1 h. The H2-TPD
was performed under the Ar ﬂow with a heating rate of 20 C/
min. The amount of H2 consumed/desorbed was measured as
a function of temperature by means of a thermal conductivity
detector
(TCD).
Dispersion
of
the
metallic
component,
expressed in terms of H/Metal ratio, was obtained assuming
that each metal atom chemisorbs one hydrogen atom.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was done on a FEI
Tecnai G2 microscope. All the samples were pre-reduced in
pure H2 at 800 C to get well crystalline images. X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a VG ESCALAB
250 spectrometer using a Mg Ka radiation source. Data was
processed using the XPS Peak 4.1 software [31,39], with respect
to the neutral carbon C1s peak set at 284.5 eV.
Ethanol temperature-programmed desorption (EtOH-TPD)
studies were performed with pre-reduced 20 mg samples in
a micro-quartz tube reactor system. The sample was ﬁrst
reduced at 800 C under H2 ﬂow for 30 min. After cooling to
room temperature in Ar ﬂow, the carrier gas was then bubbled
through ethanol at 30 C to allow for the adsorption of ethanol
on the catalyst. The bubbling was then stopped after 15 min,
and Ar was used to purge the system of any free ethanol by
passing it through the system for about an hour. The furnace
temperature was then increased to 600 C at a heating rate of
10 C/min. The products were monitored using a Hiden
Analytical HPR-20 mass spectrometer system. Signals at m/e
ratios of 44, 43, 40, 32, 31, 28, 26, 15 and 2 were assigned as CO2,
CH3CHO, Ar, O2, CH3CH2OH, CO, C2H4, CH4 and H2, respectively.
2.3.
Catalyst evaluation
Catalytic runs were carried out at atmospheric pressure in
a continuous-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed stainless steel micro-reactor (I.D.
4 mm) packed with 50 mg or 100 mg samples. All catalysts,
except Co(2.5), were ﬁrst reduced in situ under hydrogen
(40 ml/min) for 1 h at 800 C prior to each run. An ethanol/
water solution (1/3, v/v) was then introduced into a vaporiser
(150 C), by means of a HPLC pump (Shimadzu LC-20AT), at
a rate of 0.025 ml/min. N2 (300 ml/min) was used to carry the
vaporised mixture to the reactor. The reaction products were
measured by on-line gas chromatography on a Shimadzu GC-
2010 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and
a ﬂame ionising detector (FID). The TCD was used for detec-
tion of H2, C2H4, C2H6, CH4, CO, CO2 and N2; while the FID was
used for detection of CH3CHO, C2H5OH and other products. N2
was used as the internal standard.
The ethanol conversion (XEtOH), and the selectivities of C-
containing products (SC) of the various samples were calcu-
lated according to Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively:
XEtOH ¼ molEtOHin  molEtOHout
molEtOHin
 100%
(2)
SC ¼ molC
P

(3)
where Pi represents the molar yield of a detected C-containing
product. Calculations were done based on detected carbon
numbers only, on the assumption that no coke was formed.
This assumption is reasonable as the relatively high steam-to-
ethanol molar ratio used (w10:1) should minimise coke
formation [12,40]. Hydrogen yield ðYH2Þ was evaluated in terms
of the number of moles of H2 produced per mole of injected
ethanol, as given in Eq. (4):
YH2 ¼

(4)
The study of the inﬂuence of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV)
on catalytic performance was carried out in the same reactor
system by varying the gas ﬂow rate of the feed. The GHSV
cited in this study was calculated based on the total ﬂow rate
of the feed mixture in gas phase.

Results and discussion
3.1.
Preparation of cluster-derived catalysts
A ‘‘cluster’’ is deﬁned herein as ‘‘a discrete unit with at least
three metal atoms, and in which metal-metal bonds are
present’’ [41]. Organometallic clusters can be simplistically
viewed as metallic cores that are wrapped within a layer of
ligands. In the preparation of cluster-derived catalysts, clus-
ters of the desired metallic component(s) were ﬁrst loaded
onto the support material. With the Ru3(CO)12 cluster, a slight
colouration of the solvent was observed during ﬁltering and
washing. This indicated a slight leaching of the cluster
precursor from the support, which had not been observed
previously with the other two clusters [HRu3(CO)11] and
[Ru5PtC(CO)15]2. This was, however, not very surprising, as
the use of charged cluster precursors should limit cluster lost
due to stronger cluster-support electrostatic interactions.
Upon solvent removal, a coloured powder was obtained,
indicating the presence of adsorbed organometallic cluster on
the support’s surface. This was followed by gentle thermolysis
in vacuo, yielding a greyish powder. The heat treatment served
to remove the CO ligands, leaving behind the naked metallic
cores as supported nanoparticles (see Fig. 1). Indeed, the
carbonyl regions of the IR spectra (nujol mull) of such catalysts
became featureless.
Though slightly more tedious than the incipient wetness
impregnation preparation method, the cluster-derived method
has a great advantage in the control of the size and bimetallic
composition that it offers [33–35]. During the removal of the CO
ligands, the existing metal-metal bonds help to maintain the
integrity of the metallic cluster core. Consequently, most of the
yielded nanoparticles would retain the original bimetallic
composition of the cluster precursor. In addition, the relatively
low decarbonylation temperature used also ensured that sin-
tering was kept to a minimum. Indeed, subsequent TEM, TPR
and H2-TPD studies support this hypothesis (vide infra).

The resulting TPR proﬁles of Ru(2.5)[c], Ru(2.5)[c0], Ru(2.5)[i]
and Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i] catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The salt-
derived Ru(2.5)[i] showed a broad peak at about 190 C with
a shoulder at 155 C , which can be assigned to the reduction of
RuO2 to Ru0. This value is in good agreement with that
reported in a recent work, in which a hydrogen reduction peak
was observed at 480 K over a Ru/g-Al2O3 catalyst [42]. This
similarity
was
not
surprising
as
the
same
preparation
methods were used: therein, the authors had also prepared
their catalysts by impregnation of the support in an aqueous
solution of RuCl3.nH2O, followed by drying and calcinations.
The TPR proﬁle of Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i] in Fig. 2 shows a broad
response, peaking at about 170 C, with another smaller peak
at lower temperature of 120 C. This can be attributed to the
presence of PtO species, which are reducible at lower
temperatures than RuO2 [43]. The lowering of the RuO2
reduction temperature can be attributed to the effect of Pt
addition for Pt is more easily reduced than Ru, as had been
suggested by Bi et al. in their studies of Ru/ZrO2 and Pt-Ru/
ZrO2
catalysts
[43].
Interestingly,
the
reduction
peak
maximum of the Ru(2.5)[c0] and Ru(2.5)[c] catalysts were
shifted to a much higher temperature of about 350 to 380 C.
The increased difﬁculty in reduction is probably due to
a stronger metal-support interaction as a result of decreased
metallic particle size [44,45]. This is consistent with the
hypothesis that smaller nanoparticles can be obtained from
organometallic
cluster
precursors.
The
higher
reduction
temperature of Ru(2.5)[c] than Ru(2.5)[c0] (380 vs. 350 C)
supports that charged cluster precursors has stronger cluster-
support electrostatic interactions.
TEM and H2-TPD studies support the above conclusions.
TEM micrographs of the reduced catalysts are shown in Fig. 3.
It should be pointed out that under the reduction conditions
used (800 C, 1 h under pure H2), metal sintering is often
observed. Nonetheless, Ru particle sizes of cluster-derived
catalyst Ru(2.5)[c] (w1 to 2 nm) remained much smaller than
those of salt-derived Ru(2.5)[i] (w5 nm) and commercial
Ru(5)[com] (w10 nm). Table 1 summarises the data calculated
from H2-TPD results. The metal dispersion, expressed in terms
of H/Ru ratio, of the cluster-derived catalysts is more than 3
times that of the salt-derived catalysts.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study
the compositions and electronic states of the supported
particles. Unfortunately, the principal photoelectron spectral
lines of Ru3d5/2 and Pt4f7/2 fall in similar regions as those of
C1s and Al2 p, respectively. It was thus difﬁcult to identify the
various chemical states of all the elements unambiguously.
Nonetheless, as listed in Table 2, some chemical states were
identiﬁed. The identiﬁed Ru states corresponded to Ru0 and
RuO2 for pre-reduced Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i] and Ru(5)Pt(2)[i], as well as
to Ru0 for pre-reduced Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c]. In addition, a Pt0 state
was also assigned for both Ru(5)Pt(2)[i] and Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c]
catalysts, though that of the cluster-derived catalyst was
found to be considerably more electron deﬁcient. A striking
difference was noted for the Ru:Pt surface atomic ratios of the
Ru(5)Pt(2)[i] and Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] catalysts, which were calcu-
lated using area ratios of Ru3d and Pt4f to be 22.65 and 5.45,
respectively (see Table 2). It thus appears that the bulk of the
Pt was embedded under layers of Ru, and indeed, may also
account for the absence of Pt signals for the Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i]
catalyst. Recently, Alayoglu et al. reported marked improve-
ments in the preferential oxidation of CO in H2 feeds by Ru–Pt

core-shell nanoparticles over conventional PtRu alloy nano-
particles [46]. The authors attributed the enhanced perfor-
mance to the increased availability of Pt surface sites on the
Ru–Pt core-shell particles. Their results suggest a more
selective oxidation of CO over H2 for the cluster-derived
Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] catalyst as compared to the salt-derived cata-
lysts, as the latter have Pt-poor surfaces. This may possibly
account for the better CO2 selectivity of the cluster-derived
catalyst. At this point, we would also like to emphasize the
excellent control of bimetallic ratios that one has when using
the cluster decarbonylation method over the conventional
impregnation method. Note that the Ru:Pt surface atomic
ratio
of
the
cluster-derived
catalyst
(Ru:Pt z 5.45)
was
remarkably similar to the desired Ru:Pt molar ratio of 5; on the
other hand, for the salt-derived catalyst, Ru dominates the
surface (Ru:Pt z 22.65).

highly active at low temperatures (500 C and lower), and had
the highest ethanol conversion among all non-cluster-derived
catalysts. Strikingly, the three cluster-derived catalysts were
found to be signiﬁcantly more active than all Ru-based salt-
derived catalysts, Ru(5)[com] and Co(2.5). For example, at
a reforming temperature of 500 C, conversion of ethanol was
almost
complete

the
cluster-derived
catalysts,

compared to conversions of 50 % or lower for the others. It

should also be pointed out that the cluster-derived catalysts
werefoundtohavesimilarethanolconversionactivityas Rh(1).
Note that the Rh catalyst is often considered as one of the most
active catalyst for ethanol steam reforming reaction [12,24,25].
The CO2 selectivities of the various catalysts are presented
in Fig. 5. For effective hydrogen production, ethanol steam
reforming catalysts should have low selectivities for hydrogen
containing compounds (principally acetaldehyde, ethylene,
ethane, methane, but also other hydrocarbons). Also, as
mentioned in the introduction, PEMFCs have low CO-toler-
ance. As such, a high CO2 selectivity is desirable. The CO2
selectivities at 800 C were similar for all catalysts. However,
with decreasing temperatures, the improved CO2 selectivities
of the cluster-derived catalysts became evident. The CO2
selectivities
of
the
cluster-derived
catalysts
peaked
at
approximately 500–600 C, and fell sharply at lower tempera-
tures. At 350 C, negligible amounts of CO2 were detected over
all catalysts except Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] (w20%). These results
suggest that Pt would be a useful co-catalyst for low temper-
ature ethanol steam reforming, presumably as a promoter of
the water gas shift reaction [4] in the presence of excess steam
(Eq. (5)).

The improved ethanol steam reforming efﬁciencies of the
cluster-derived catalysts over the others become more evident
when the hydrogen yields ðYH2Þ are calculated. In the presence
of
excess
steam,
the
reaction
produces
a
theoretical
maximum of six moles of H2 for each mole of injected ethanol
(see Eq. (1)). As presented in Fig. 6, the cluster-derived cata-
lysts were producing hydrogen at, or close to, the theoretical
maximum for reforming temperatures of 550 C or greater. At
500 C, YH2 became negligible over the Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[i], Ru(2.5)[i],
and Ru(5)[com] catalysts, while Co(2.5) and Rh(1) yielded about
1 and 3.5 moles of H2 per mole of ethanol substrate, respec-
tively. In comparison, at this same temperature, the various
cluster-derived catalysts still had H2/EtOH molar yields of
approximately 4.5 to 5.5.

In short, the cluster-derived catalysts were found to be
signiﬁcantly more active and selective than the Ru, RuPt salt-
derived and commercial catalysts, as well as the Co/ZnO
catalyst. In addition, the cluster-derived catalysts were as
active, and slightly more selective, than a Rh catalyst. Under
the reaction conditions used herein, optimal reforming
temperatures over the cluster-derived catalysts would lie
between 500 to 600 C, while those of the other catalysts
would be at least 100 C higher. This clearly demonstrates
the
effectiveness
of
organometallic
clusters
as
catalyst
precursors.
3.4.
Inﬂuence of GHSV on catalytic performance
It should be pointed out that a Co/ZnO catalyst was reported to
have 100% ethanol conversion at 450 C [28]. However,
a conversion of only 20% was obtained at this same temper-
ature under our conditions using Co(2.5). A plausible expla-
nation would be the different experimental conditions used in
the two works. Several factors, such as the steam/ethanol
ratio and the rate at which ethanol is introduced would,
a priori, affect the percentage conversion of ethanol. The
ethanol/steam molar ratios used therein [28] (w1:13) and

(w1:10) in this paper were similar, and thus, unlikely to
account for such great differences. The more likely factor is
the gas hourly space velocity (GSHV), which represents the
relation between the volumetric gas ﬂow to the volume of the
catalyst [50]. In that work, the GHSV was varied from between
1,250 h1 to 30,000 h1; 100% ethanol conversion was achieved
only at GHSV of 15,000 h1 or lower, while at higher GHSV, and
thus
shorter
contact
times,
ethanol
conversion
was

incomplete. For example, at a GHSV of 30,000 h1, the reported
conversion was approximately 65% (Fig. 2 of ref. [28]). In this
paper, a much higher GHSV of approximately 360,000 h1 was
used. It is thus highly plausible that with the much shorter
contact times experienced in our catalytic runs, lower ethanol
conversions were obtained over Co(2.5).
As it appears that the conversion of ethanol is highly
dependent on the space velocity, a further series of tests was
done with the GHSV halved to 180,000 h1. As can be seen
from Fig. 7(a), lowering the GHSV leads to a corresponding
increase in catalytic activity of the three cluster-derived
catalysts. This clearly shows that, as predicted, higher
ethanol conversions were obtained with longer contact
times. The inﬂuence of GHSV on the selectivity of various C-
containing products, at temperatures of 400 C and 600 C, is
also presented in Fig. 7(b). At 600 C, the product distribution
remains
relatively
constant
over
GHSV
of
180,000
to
360,000 h1. Ethanol conversion was also almost complete
and invariant, suggesting all three cluster-derived catalysts
were operating close to the thermodynamic equilibrium at
this temperature. On the other hand, differences in the
product distribution were observed at 400 C. When GHSV
was lowered, signiﬁcant increases in CO2 and CH4 were
observed, with accompanying drops in CO and CH3CO. Only
traces of C2H4 were detected in all cases. These results
suggest that, at low reforming temperatures, ethanol dehy-
drogenation dominates over ethanol dehydration at the
beginning. At longer contact times, the acetaldehyde thus
formed is further reformed or decomposed, accounting for
the observed increases in CO2 and CH4. Note that a similar
trend had been previously reported by Cavallaro et al. over
a Rh/Al2O3 catalyst [51].
3.5.
Stability of catalysts
The long-term stability on-stream of cluster-derived catalyst,
Ru(2.5)[c0]
was
evaluated,
along
with
the
commercial
Ru(5)[com] catalyst for comparison. Their time-on-stream
behaviours, monitored at a constant reforming temperature
of
600 C,
are
presented
in
Fig.
8.
The
cluster-derived
Ru(2.5)[c0] catalyst gave complete ethanol conversion and
near maximum hydrogen yields (5.8–6.0) throughout the 48 h
of on-stream testing. The CO2 and CO selectivities were stable
throughout at 80–90% and 10–20%, respectively. On the other
hand, ethanol conversions over Ru(5)[com] dropped rapidly
from
the
16th
hour,
accompanied
with
corresponding
increases of CO and CH4 selectivity.
The time-on-stream runs showed that the cluster-derived
Ru(2.5)[c0] catalyst was more robust than a inorganic salt-
derived catalyst, maintaining high activity and selectivity
throughout 48 h of testing at 600 C. The cluster-derived
catalyst was also found to be quite stable over three catalytic
cycles, with the regeneration step carried out by heating the
catalyst
under
H2
at
800 C
for
1 h.
The
bimetallic
Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c0] was evaluated, and its H2 selectivity was found
to be relatively stable over the three cycles, although a slight
decrease in activity was evident with each run (see Fig. 9). The
high efﬁciency of cluster-derived catalysts has previously
been attributed to its small size [11]. As such, it is likely that
the observed drop in catalytic activity might be due to

EtOH-TPD studies of catalysts
The reaction of ethanol over Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] and Ru(2.5)[c0]
catalysts
was
studied
using
ethanol
temperature-pro-
grammed desorption (EtOH-TPD). Admittedly, the conditions
used for EtOH-TPD were not the same as the actual catalytic
conditions;
nevertheless,
mechanistic
insights
could
be
obtained with this technique, and it has been widely used by
others to study ethanol–catalyst interactions [15,52–57]. The
EtOH-TPD proﬁles of the two cluster-derived catalysts are
shown in Fig. 10. As expected, signiﬁcant amounts of H2
were detected over both catalysts, reﬂecting their high
activities. Two H2 desorption peaks were observed in each
case:
around
230 C
and
380 C
for
the
bimetallic
catalyst, and around 280 C and 460 C for the monometallic
catalyst. The lower desorption temperatures over the former
catalyst
suggests
a
synergistic
effect
between
the
two
metals. The presence of two H2 desorption peaks had
previously been reported over Rh–Pt/CeO2 (445 K, 655 K) [56]
and Ir/Al2O3 (520 K, 750 K) [15] catalysts. Some CO2 and
CH3CHO were also detected, consistent with what had been
previously reported for noble metal/Al2O3 catalysts [15].
However, while the authors only reported trace amounts of
CO, this was formed in comparable amounts to CO2 over the
cluster-derived
catalysts,
with
the
peaks
appearing
in
approximately the same temperature range as H2. The CO2
and CH3CHO peak maxima fell in the range of 350–450 C and
100–150 C, respectively. These were similar to the values
reported by Idriss et al. (650 K and 450 K, respectively) over
a supported Rh catalyst [54], but lower than those reported
Fig. 10 – Ethanol temperature-programmed desorption proﬁles of (a) Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[cL] and (b) Ru(2.5)[c0] catalysts.

by Erd}
ohelyi et al. (750 K and 500 K, respectively) over
a supported Ir catalyst [15]. Idriss proposed that for the
reaction of ethanol, there is an inverse correlation between
the desorption temperature of CH3CHO and the turnover
number [58]. A low CH3CHO desorption temperature, as in
the case of the cluster-derived catalysts, is thus desirable
since it would imply a high ethanol turnover number. Some
C2H4 was also formed, albeit in signiﬁcantly smaller quan-
tities. Its formation was expected since Al2O3, which favours
ethanol dehydration, was used as the support [15,52]. Inter-
estingly, only trace amounts of ethanol were detected,
primarily at temperatures below 200 C. This suggests that
the bulk of adsorbed ethanol had reacted at low tempera-
tures. These results support the conclusions obtained from
the series of GHSV experiments (vide supra); indeed, it
appears that the decomposition of ethanol occurs mainly via
its dehydrogenation over the metallic particles and, to
a lesser extent, its dehydration over the support.
Another point worthy of note is that signiﬁcant CH4
formation was only observed over Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c]. In studies
on Rh–Pt/CeO2 catalysts, Idriss and co-workers noted that
signiﬁcantly more CH4 was formed over Rh–Pt/CeO2 as
compared to Pt/CeO2 and Pd–Pt/CeO2, which led them to the
conclusion that the presence of Rh was crucial for a more
efﬁcient ethanol C–C bond dissociation [56,57]. The authors
proposed that, as a ﬁrst step, the O–H bond of the adsorbed
ethanol was cleaved (Eq. (6)). Over monometallic Pt or Pd
catalysts, this subsequently led to the formation CH3CHO and
H2 (Eqs. (7) and (8)). Over Rh–Pt catalysts, the formation of
a ﬁve-membered oxometallocycle was favoured (Eq. (9)), fol-
lowed by a C–C bond cleavage leading to the formation of CH4
and CO (Eq. (10)).

where [M] represents an active catalytic site.
In view of our similar observations, it is thus reasonable to
deduce that ethanol C–C bond dissociation is also more fav-
oured over the bimetallic Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] than over the
monometallic Ru(2.5)[c0] catalyst. Indeed, the desorption
peaks of both CH4 and CO appeared in the same regions, as
would have been expected from Eq. (10). It should be added
that the presence of the CH3CHO desorption peak suggests
that, for Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c], both reaction pathways may occur.
Over
the
monometallic
Ru
cluster-derived
catalyst,
the
ethanol reaction appears to proceed almost exclusively via the
CH3CHO intermediate.

Conclusion
Monometallic Ru and bimetallic Ru–Pt supported nano-
particles, derived from organometallic cluster precursors,
were found to be highly efﬁcient ethanol steam reforming
catalysts, outperforming all others that were tested under the
identical reaction conditions. The high catalytic efﬁciencies of
the cluster-derived catalysts are attributed to the very small
sizes of the metallic nanoparticles. Ethanol TPD experiments
suggested that the presence of Pt in the cluster-derived cata-
lyst lowers the H2 desorption temperature and increases the
efﬁciency of the ethanol C–C bond dissociation. Further, as
shown from XPS studies, the cluster decarbonylation method
was also shown to be much more reliable in the preparation of
supported catalysts of desired bimetallic compositions. In
view
of
all
results,
the
cluster-derived
bimetallic
Ru(2.5)Pt(1)[c] can be an excellent candidate catalyst for the
production of hydrogen via the steam reforming of ethanol.
