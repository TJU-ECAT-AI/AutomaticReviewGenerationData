The literature mainly discusses one synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts - the surface redox reaction, also referred to as the catalytic reduction method. This method was used to prepare Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge bimetallic catalysts supported on TiO2.

The surface redox reaction method appears to have the advantage of allowing the combination of bimetallic and support effects. In this case, it enabled the researchers to combine the bimetallic effect of Rh-Ge or Pt-Ge with the reducible support effect of TiO2.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods or discuss their relative advantages and efficacy. However, it does demonstrate that the surface redox reaction method is effective for producing bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions, specifically the hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols.

To fully answer the question about comparing different synthesis methods, additional information from other sources would be needed.

该文献主要讨论了一种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法 - 表面氧化还原反应，也称为催化还原法。这种方法被用来制备TiO2负载的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge双金属催化剂。

表面氧化还原反应法似乎具有结合双金属效应和载体效应的优势。在这个案例中，它使研究人员能够将Rh-Ge或Pt-Ge的双金属效应与TiO2的可还原载体效应相结合。

该文献并未提供不同合成方法的全面比较，也没有讨论它们的相对优势和效果。然而，它确实证明了表面氧化还原反应法在生产用于选择性氢化反应的双金属催化剂方面是有效的，特别是用于柠檬醛向不饱和醇的氢化反应。

要全面回答关于比较不同合成方法的问题，需要从其他来源获取额外的信息。
