The literature mainly discusses the surface redox reaction (also referred to as catalytic reduction method) for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts. This method was used to prepare Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2. 

The potential advantages of this method include:

1. It allows for combining the bimetallic effect with the reducible support effect (SMSI effect on TiO2).

2. It can produce catalysts with high selectivity for unsaturated alcohol production in citral hydrogenation.

3. It provides better stability of bimetallic particles on TiO2 compared to alumina or silica supports.

Applications mentioned include selective hydrogenation of citral to unsaturated alcohols.

The overall efficacy seems good, as the method produced catalysts with tunable properties and high selectivities. However, the literature does not directly compare this method to other synthesis techniques, so a comprehensive comparison of efficacy is not possible based solely on this text.

该文献主要讨论了表面氧化还原反应（也称为催化还原法）用于合成负载型双金属催化剂。这种方法被用来制备TiO2负载的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂。

这种方法的潜在优势包括：

1. 它可以结合双金属效应和可还原载体效应（TiO2上的SMSI效应）。

2. 它可以生产出在柠檬醛加氢反应中对不饱和醇生成具有高选择性的催化剂。

3. 与氧化铝或二氧化硅载体相比，它在TiO2上提供了更好的双金属颗粒稳定性。

提到的应用包括柠檬醛选择性加氢制不饱和醇。

整体效果似乎很好，因为该方法生产出了具有可调性能和高选择性的催化剂。然而，该文献并没有直接将这种方法与其他合成技术进行比较，因此仅基于这篇文本无法对效率进行全面比较。
