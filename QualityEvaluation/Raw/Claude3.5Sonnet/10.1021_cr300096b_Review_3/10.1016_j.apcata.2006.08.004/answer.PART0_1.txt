The literature discusses a few synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Surface redox reaction: Used to prepare Rh-Ge catalysts on alumina and silica supports in previous work.

2. Catalytic reduction: Employed to deposit germanium onto parent Rh and Pt catalysts supported on TiO2.

3. Combination of methods: The study combines the bimetallic effect (from adding Ge) with the reducible support effect (from using TiO2) to improve catalyst performance.

The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods. However, it demonstrates that combining multiple approaches (bimetallic formulation and reducible support) can potentially enhance catalyst efficacy for specific reactions like citral hydrogenation. The catalytic reduction method appears advantageous for precisely controlling germanium deposition onto parent metal catalysts.

该文献讨论了几种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 表面氧化还原反应：在先前的研究中用于制备氧化铝和二氧化硅负载的Rh-Ge催化剂。

2. 催化还原法：用于将锗沉积到TiO2负载的Rh和Pt母体催化剂上。

3. 方法组合：该研究结合了双金属效应（通过添加Ge）和可还原载体效应（使用TiO2），以提高催化剂性能。

该论文没有对不同合成方法进行全面比较。然而，它表明结合多种方法（双金属配方和可还原载体）可能会增强催化剂对特定反应（如柠檬醛氢化）的效能。催化还原法似乎在精确控制锗沉积到母体金属催化剂上方面具有优势。
