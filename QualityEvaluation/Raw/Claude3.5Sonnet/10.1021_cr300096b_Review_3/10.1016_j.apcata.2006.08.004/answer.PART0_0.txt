[1] "In previous works, we have prepared bimetallic Rh-Ge catalysts by surface redox reaction for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols"

[2] "In this paper, bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction were tested in selective hydrogenation of citral with the aim of combining the bimetallic effect and the reducible support effect."

[3] "The preparation of the various catalysts (parent monometallic, blank and bimetallic) is described in details in part I of this work"

The literature mentions surface redox reaction (also called catalytic reduction method) as a synthesis method for preparing supported bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts. This method allows combining the bimetallic effect with the support effect when using reducible supports like TiO2. However, the document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. To fully answer the question, more information would be needed on other common preparation techniques and their relative advantages.

文献提到表面氧化还原反应(也称为催化还原法)作为制备负载型双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂的合成方法。当使用可还原载体如TiO2时,该方法可以结合双金属效应和载体效应。然而,该文档并未对负载型双金属催化剂的不同合成方法进行全面比较。要完整回答这个问题,还需要更多关于其他常用制备技术及其相对优势的信息。
