The literature primarily discusses the surface redox reaction, also referred to as the catalytic reduction method, for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts. This method was used to prepare Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2. 

The main advantage of this method appears to be the ability to combine the bimetallic effect with the reducible support effect, particularly when using TiO2 as a support. This allows for potentially enhanced catalytic performance in reactions such as the selective hydrogenation of citral.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods, so it's not possible to directly compare the efficacy of the surface redox reaction to other methods based solely on this text. However, the repeated use of this method for different metal combinations (Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge) suggests that it is versatile and effective for producing a range of bimetallic catalysts.

The primary application discussed is the selective hydrogenation of citral, indicating that this synthesis method is suitable for producing catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.

该文献主要讨论了表面氧化还原反应，也称为催化还原法，用于合成负载型双金属催化剂。这种方法被用来制备负载在TiO2上的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂。

这种方法的主要优势似乎是能够将双金属效应与可还原支撑体效应相结合，特别是在使用TiO2作为支撑体时。这可能会在柠檬醛选择性加氢等反应中提高催化性能。

文献没有提供不同合成方法的全面比较，所以仅凭这篇文本无法直接比较表面氧化还原反应与其他方法的效果。然而，这种方法在不同金属组合（Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge）中的重复使用表明，它在生产各种双金属催化剂方面是多功能和有效的。

讨论的主要应用是柠檬醛的选择性加氢，这表明这种合成方法适合生产用于选择性加氢反应的催化剂。
