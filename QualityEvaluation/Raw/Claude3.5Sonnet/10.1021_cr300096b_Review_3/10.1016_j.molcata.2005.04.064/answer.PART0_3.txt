[1] "Preparation of metal nanoparticles (with a diameter of a few nanometres) has been successfully attempted using methods of colloid chemistry [16]. This is based on reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants which then form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles, as opposed to traditional preparation of metal blacks producing usually larger particles or their aggregates [7,17]."

[2] "Catalytic tests could be carried out on the nanoparticles alone or deposited on oxide supports, the latter being more suited for practical purposes. These behaved as conventional impregnated catalysts [18,20]. Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants, which form a protective layer around the nanoparticles to prevent aggregation. This method can produce very small particles (a few nanometers in diameter).

2. Synthesis in the presence of the support: This method involves carrying out the nanoparticle synthesis directly in the presence of the intended support material.

Comparing these methods:

Advantages of colloid chemistry:
- Can produce very small, uniform nanoparticles
- Allows good control over particle size

Advantages of synthesis with support present:
- Produces superior catalysts compared to depositing pre-formed nanoparticles on supports
- More suited for practical applications

The literature suggests that synthesizing nanoparticles in the presence of the support is more effective overall for producing high-quality supported catalysts for practical use. However, the colloidal method offers good control over particle properties if unsupported nanoparticles are desired.

文献讨论了两种主要的支持型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐，形成保护层包围纳米粒子以防止聚集。这种方法可以产生非常小的粒子（直径几纳米）。

2. 在支持材料存在下进行合成：这种方法涉及直接在预期的支持材料存在下进行纳米粒子合成。

比较这些方法：

胶体化学的优势：
- 可以生产非常小、均匀的纳米粒子
- 能够很好地控制粒子大小

在支持材料存在下合成的优势：
- 与将预制纳米粒子沉积在支持材料上相比，可以生产更优质的催化剂
- 更适合实际应用

文献表明，在支持材料存在下合成纳米粒子总体上更有效，可以为实际使用生产高质量的负载型催化剂。然而，如果需要未负载的纳米粒子，胶体法可以很好地控制粒子性质。
