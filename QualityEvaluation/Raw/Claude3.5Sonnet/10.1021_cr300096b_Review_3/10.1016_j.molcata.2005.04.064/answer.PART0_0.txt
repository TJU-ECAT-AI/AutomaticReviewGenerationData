[1] "Preparation of metal nanoparticles (with a diameter of a few nanometres) has been successfully attempted using methods of colloid chemistry [16]. This is based on reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants which then form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles, as opposed to traditional preparation of metal blacks producing usually larger particles or their aggregates [7,17]."

[2] "Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

[3] "Nanosized Pd, Pt and PdPt bimetallic particles were prepared by the reduction of K2PdCl4 (03.8 mM) and/or K2PtCl4 (02.8 mM) in the presence of cationic surfactant, C14TABr (19.5 mM)."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants to form nanoparticles. The surfactants create a surface layer that prevents small particles from coalescing. This method produces smaller particles compared to traditional metal black preparation techniques.

2. In-situ synthesis: Carrying out the synthesis in the presence of the intended support material. This method is reported to produce superior samples.

3. Reduction of metal salts: The specific example given is the preparation of Pd, Pt, and PdPt bimetallic particles by reducing K2PdCl4 and/or K2PtCl4 in the presence of a cationic surfactant (C14TABr).

Each method has its advantages. Colloid chemistry methods allow for better control of particle size and distribution. In-situ synthesis on supports can lead to better dispersion and interaction between the metal particles and the support. The reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants combines aspects of both methods, allowing for control of particle size while also enabling the production of bimetallic particles.

The efficacy of these methods depends on the specific application and desired properties of the catalyst. The choice of method can affect particle size, dispersion, metal-support interactions, and the formation of bimetallic particles, all of which can influence catalytic performance.

文献讨论了几种支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐以形成纳米粒子。表面活性剂形成一个表面层，防止小颗粒聚集。与传统的金属黑制备技术相比，这种方法产生的颗粒更小。

2. 原位合成：在预定支持材料存在下进行合成。据报道，这种方法能产生更优质的样品。

3. 金属盐还原：给出的具体例子是在阳离子表面活性剂（C14TABr）存在下还原K2PdCl4和/或K2PtCl4来制备Pd、Pt和PdPt双金属粒子。

每种方法都有其优势。胶体化学方法可以更好地控制粒子大小和分布。支持材料上的原位合成可以导致金属粒子与支持材料之间更好的分散和相互作用。在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐结合了两种方法的特点，既可以控制粒子大小，又可以生产双金属粒子。

这些方法的效果取决于催化剂的具体应用和所需性能。方法的选择可以影响粒子大小、分散度、金属-支持材料相互作用以及双金属粒子的形成，所有这些都可能影响催化性能。
