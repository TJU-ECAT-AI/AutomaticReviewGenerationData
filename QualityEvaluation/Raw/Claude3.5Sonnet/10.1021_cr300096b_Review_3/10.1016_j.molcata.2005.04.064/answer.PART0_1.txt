[1] "Preparation of metal nanoparticles (with a diameter of a few nanometres) has been successfully attempted using methods of colloid chemistry [16]. This is based on reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants which then form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles, as opposed to traditional preparation of metal blacks producing usually larger particles or their aggregates [7,17]."

[2] "Monometallic Pt and Pd [18,19] as well as PdPt particles [2022] were synthesized and tested in catalytic reactions [23]. Catalytic tests could be carried out on the nanoparticles alone or deposited on oxide supports, the latter being more suited for practical purposes."

[3] "Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants, which form a protective layer to prevent particle coalescence. This method produces smaller nanoparticles compared to traditional metal black preparation.

2. Direct synthesis of nanoparticles: Monometallic and bimetallic particles can be synthesized and then tested either alone or deposited on oxide supports for practical applications.

3. In-situ synthesis on supports: The literature mentions that superior samples were obtained when synthesis was carried out in the presence of the intended support material.

These methods have different advantages:

- Colloid chemistry allows for better control of particle size and prevents aggregation.
- Direct synthesis of nanoparticles offers flexibility in testing and application.
- In-situ synthesis on supports produces superior catalysts, likely due to better dispersion and interaction with the support.

The choice of method depends on the desired application and properties of the final catalyst. In-situ synthesis appears to be most effective for supported catalysts, while colloidal methods offer better control over particle characteristics.

Overall, these methods aim to produce well-dispersed, small bimetallic particles with controlled composition and size, which are crucial factors in catalyst performance.

文献讨论了几种双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐，形成保护层以防止粒子聚结。与传统的金属黑制备相比，这种方法产生更小的纳米粒子。

2. 纳米粒子直接合成：可以合成单金属和双金属粒子，然后单独测试或沉积在氧化物载体上以用于实际应用。

3. 载体上的原位合成：文献提到，当在预期载体材料存在下进行合成时，可以获得性能更优的样品。

这些方法具有不同的优势：

- 胶体化学方法可以更好地控制粒子大小并防止聚集。
- 纳米粒子的直接合成在测试和应用方面提供了灵活性。
- 载体上的原位合成产生性能更优的催化剂，可能是由于与载体的分散性和相互作用更好。

方法的选择取决于最终催化剂所需的应用和性能。原位合成似乎对负载型催化剂最有效，而胶体方法则能更好地控制粒子特性。

总的来说，这些方法旨在产生分散良好、组成和尺寸可控的小型双金属粒子，这些是催化剂性能的关键因素。
