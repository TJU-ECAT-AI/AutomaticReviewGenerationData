[1] "Preparation of metal nanoparticles (with a diameter of a few nanometres) has been successfully attempted using methods of colloid chemistry [16]. This is based on reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants which then form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles, as opposed to traditional preparation of metal blacks producing usually larger particles or their aggregates [7,17]."

[2] "Catalytic tests could be carried out on the nanoparticles alone or deposited on oxide supports, the latter being more suited for practical purposes. These behaved as conventional impregnated catalysts [18,20]. Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants to form nanoparticles. The surfactants create a surface layer that prevents small particles from coalescing. This method can produce particles with diameters of a few nanometers.

2. Traditional preparation of metal blacks: This method typically produces larger particles or aggregates compared to the colloid chemistry approach.

In terms of advantages and applications:

- Colloid chemistry methods offer better control over particle size and can produce smaller nanoparticles.
- Nanoparticles can be used alone or deposited on oxide supports, with supported catalysts being more practical for applications.
- Synthesis in the presence of the intended support produces superior catalysts.

Overall, the colloid chemistry approach seems to offer more control and flexibility in catalyst production, particularly for creating small, well-dispersed nanoparticles. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of efficacy between these methods.

文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐以形成纳米颗粒。表面活性剂创建了一个表面层，防止小颗粒聚集。这种方法可以生产直径为几纳米的颗粒。

2. 传统的金属黑制备：与胶体化学方法相比，这种方法通常会产生更大的颗粒或聚集体。

就优势和应用而言：

- 胶体化学方法能更好地控制颗粒大小，可以生产更小的纳米颗粒。
- 纳米颗粒可以单独使用或沉积在氧化物载体上，负载型催化剂在应用中更实用。
- 在预定载体存在下进行合成可以产生性能更优的催化剂。

总的来说，胶体化学方法似乎在催化剂生产方面提供了更多的控制和灵活性，特别是在创建小型、分散良好的纳米颗粒方面。然而，文献并未提供这些方法之间有效性的全面比较。
