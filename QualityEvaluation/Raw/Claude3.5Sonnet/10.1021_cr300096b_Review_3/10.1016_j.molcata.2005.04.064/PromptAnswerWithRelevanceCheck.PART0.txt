[1] "Preparation of metal nanoparticles (with a diameter of a few nanometres) has been successfully attempted using methods of colloid chemistry [16]. This is based on reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants which then form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles, as opposed to traditional preparation of metal blacks producing usually larger particles or their aggregates [7,17]."

[2] "Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

[3] "Nanosized Pd, Pt and PdPt bimetallic particles were prepared by the reduction of K2PdCl4 (03.8 mM) and/or K2PtCl4 (02.8 mM) in the presence of cationic surfactant, C14TABr (19.5 mM)."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants to form nanoparticles. The surfactants create a surface layer that prevents small particles from coalescing. This method produces smaller particles compared to traditional metal black preparation techniques.

2. In-situ synthesis: Carrying out the synthesis in the presence of the intended support material. This method is reported to produce superior samples.

3. Reduction of metal salts: The specific example given is the preparation of Pd, Pt, and PdPt bimetallic particles by reducing K2PdCl4 and/or K2PtCl4 in the presence of a cationic surfactant (C14TABr).

Each method has its advantages. Colloid chemistry methods allow for better control of particle size and distribution. In-situ synthesis on supports can lead to better dispersion and interaction between the metal particles and the support. The reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants combines aspects of both methods, allowing for control of particle size while also enabling the production of bimetallic particles.

The efficacy of these methods depends on the specific application and desired properties of the catalyst. The choice of method can affect particle size, dispersion, metal-support interactions, and the formation of bimetallic particles, all of which can influence catalytic performance.

文献讨论了几种支持型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐以形成纳米粒子。表面活性剂形成一个表面层，防止小颗粒聚集。与传统的金属黑制备技术相比，这种方法产生的颗粒更小。

2. 原位合成：在预定支持材料存在下进行合成。据报道，这种方法能产生更优质的样品。

3. 金属盐还原：给出的具体例子是在阳离子表面活性剂（C14TABr）存在下还原K2PdCl4和/或K2PtCl4来制备Pd、Pt和PdPt双金属粒子。

每种方法都有其优势。胶体化学方法可以更好地控制粒子大小和分布。支持材料上的原位合成可以导致金属粒子与支持材料之间更好的分散和相互作用。在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐结合了两种方法的特点，既可以控制粒子大小，又可以生产双金属粒子。

这些方法的效果取决于催化剂的具体应用和所需性能。方法的选择可以影响粒子大小、分散度、金属-支持材料相互作用以及双金属粒子的形成，所有这些都可能影响催化性能。

[2] "Monometallic Pt and Pd [18,19] as well as PdPt particles [2022] were synthesized and tested in catalytic reactions [23]. Catalytic tests could be carried out on the nanoparticles alone or deposited on oxide supports, the latter being more suited for practical purposes."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants, which form a protective layer to prevent particle coalescence. This method produces smaller nanoparticles compared to traditional metal black preparation.

2. Direct synthesis of nanoparticles: Monometallic and bimetallic particles can be synthesized and then tested either alone or deposited on oxide supports for practical applications.

3. In-situ synthesis on supports: The literature mentions that superior samples were obtained when synthesis was carried out in the presence of the intended support material.

These methods have different advantages:

- Colloid chemistry allows for better control of particle size and prevents aggregation.
- Direct synthesis of nanoparticles offers flexibility in testing and application.
- In-situ synthesis on supports produces superior catalysts, likely due to better dispersion and interaction with the support.

The choice of method depends on the desired application and properties of the final catalyst. In-situ synthesis appears to be most effective for supported catalysts, while colloidal methods offer better control over particle characteristics.

Overall, these methods aim to produce well-dispersed, small bimetallic particles with controlled composition and size, which are crucial factors in catalyst performance.

文献讨论了几种双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐，形成保护层以防止粒子聚结。与传统的金属黑制备相比，这种方法产生更小的纳米粒子。

2. 纳米粒子直接合成：可以合成单金属和双金属粒子，然后单独测试或沉积在氧化物载体上以用于实际应用。

3. 载体上的原位合成：文献提到，当在预期载体材料存在下进行合成时，可以获得性能更优的样品。

这些方法具有不同的优势：

- 胶体化学方法可以更好地控制粒子大小并防止聚集。
- 纳米粒子的直接合成在测试和应用方面提供了灵活性。
- 载体上的原位合成产生性能更优的催化剂，可能是由于与载体的分散性和相互作用更好。

方法的选择取决于最终催化剂所需的应用和性能。原位合成似乎对负载型催化剂最有效，而胶体方法则能更好地控制粒子特性。

总的来说，这些方法旨在产生分散良好、组成和尺寸可控的小型双金属粒子，这些是催化剂性能的关键因素。

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants to form nanoparticles. The surfactants create a surface layer that prevents small particles from coalescing. This method can produce particles with diameters of a few nanometers.

2. Traditional preparation of metal blacks: This method typically produces larger particles or aggregates compared to the colloid chemistry approach.

- Colloid chemistry methods offer better control over particle size and can produce smaller nanoparticles.
- Nanoparticles can be used alone or deposited on oxide supports, with supported catalysts being more practical for applications.
- Synthesis in the presence of the intended support produces superior catalysts.

Overall, the colloid chemistry approach seems to offer more control and flexibility in catalyst production, particularly for creating small, well-dispersed nanoparticles. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of efficacy between these methods.

文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐以形成纳米颗粒。表面活性剂创建了一个表面层，防止小颗粒聚集。这种方法可以生产直径为几纳米的颗粒。

2. 传统的金属黑制备：与胶体化学方法相比，这种方法通常会产生更大的颗粒或聚集体。

就优势和应用而言：

- 胶体化学方法能更好地控制颗粒大小，可以生产更小的纳米颗粒。
- 纳米颗粒可以单独使用或沉积在氧化物载体上，负载型催化剂在应用中更实用。
- 在预定载体存在下进行合成可以产生性能更优的催化剂。

总的来说，胶体化学方法似乎在催化剂生产方面提供了更多的控制和灵活性，特别是在创建小型、分散良好的纳米颗粒方面。然而，文献并未提供这些方法之间有效性的全面比较。

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants, which form a protective layer around the nanoparticles to prevent aggregation. This method can produce very small particles (a few nanometers in diameter).

2. Synthesis in the presence of the support: This method involves carrying out the nanoparticle synthesis directly in the presence of the intended support material.

Comparing these methods:

Advantages of colloid chemistry:
- Can produce very small, uniform nanoparticles
- Allows good control over particle size

Advantages of synthesis with support present:
- Produces superior catalysts compared to depositing pre-formed nanoparticles on supports
- More suited for practical applications

The literature suggests that synthesizing nanoparticles in the presence of the support is more effective overall for producing high-quality supported catalysts for practical use. However, the colloidal method offers good control over particle properties if unsupported nanoparticles are desired.

文献讨论了两种主要的支持型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐，形成保护层包围纳米粒子以防止聚集。这种方法可以产生非常小的粒子（直径几纳米）。

2. 在支持材料存在下进行合成：这种方法涉及直接在预期的支持材料存在下进行纳米粒子合成。

比较这些方法：

胶体化学的优势：
- 可以生产非常小、均匀的纳米粒子
- 能够很好地控制粒子大小

在支持材料存在下合成的优势：
- 与将预制纳米粒子沉积在支持材料上相比，可以生产更优质的催化剂
- 更适合实际应用

文献表明，在支持材料存在下合成纳米粒子总体上更有效，可以为实际使用生产高质量的负载型催化剂。然而，如果需要未负载的纳米粒子，胶体法可以很好地控制粒子性质。
