[1] "Preparation of metal nanoparticles (with a diameter of a few nanometres) has been successfully attempted using methods of colloid chemistry [16]. This is based on reduction of metal salts in the presence of surfactants which then form a surface adlayer preventing the coalescence of small particles, as opposed to traditional preparation of metal blacks producing usually larger particles or their aggregates [7,17]."

[2] "Superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the destined support [2326]."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Colloid chemistry methods: This involves reducing metal salts in the presence of surfactants to form nanoparticles. The surfactants create a surface layer that prevents the small particles from coalescing. This method can produce particles with diameters of a few nanometers.

2. In-situ synthesis on the support: The literature mentions that superior samples were obtained when the synthesis was carried out in the presence of the intended support material.

The colloid chemistry method has the advantage of producing very small, uniform nanoparticles. However, the presence of surfactants may interfere with catalytic activity. The in-situ synthesis on the support likely results in better dispersion and stronger metal-support interactions.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the overall efficacy or specific applications of these methods. More research would be needed to fully compare their advantages and effectiveness across different catalyst systems.

文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 胶体化学方法：这涉及在表面活性剂存在下还原金属盐以形成纳米颗粒。表面活性剂形成一个表面层，防止小颗粒凝聚。这种方法可以生产直径为几纳米的颗粒。

2. 载体上的原位合成：文献提到，当在预定载体存在下进行合成时，可以获得更优质的样品。

胶体化学方法的优势在于可以生产非常小的、均匀的纳米颗粒。然而，表面活性剂的存在可能会干扰催化活性。载体上的原位合成可能会导致更好的分散性和更强的金属-载体相互作用。

文献没有提供这些方法的整体效果或具体应用的全面信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面比较它们在不同催化剂系统中的优势和有效性。
