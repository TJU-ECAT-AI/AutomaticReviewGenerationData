[1] "Impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."

[2] "Compared to the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs, the preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified."

[3] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[4] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[5] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation/co-reduction: This straightforward method uses a strong reducing agent to prepare bimetallic alloy nanoparticles by co-introducing two metal precursors.

2. Successive two-step reduction: This nearly universal method for preparing coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles involves first forming the core nanoparticles, then depositing the shell metal on the pre-formed core.

3. One-step reduction: A more recently developed route that uses a suitable reducing agent to reduce metal cations with different reduction potentials simultaneously.

4. Galvanic replacement: An effective approach for fabricating hollow coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles based on the differences in reduction potentials between core and shell metals.

These methods compare as follows:

- Impregnation/co-reduction is simpler and more straightforward, suitable for alloy nanoparticles.
- The two-step reduction method offers more control over the core-shell structure but is more complicated.
- The one-step method is simpler than the two-step approach for core-shell structures but requires careful selection of the reducing agent.
- Galvanic replacement is particularly useful for creating hollow structures.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired nanoparticle structure (alloy vs. core-shell), level of structural control needed, and specific metal combinations. The two-step and one-step methods are generally more effective for producing well-defined core-shell structures, while impregnation/co-reduction is simpler for alloy nanoparticles.
