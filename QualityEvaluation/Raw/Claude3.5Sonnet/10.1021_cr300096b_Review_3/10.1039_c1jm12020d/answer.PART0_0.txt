[1] "Impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."

[2] "Compared to the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs, the preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified."

[3] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[4] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[5] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation/co-reduction: This straightforward method uses a strong reducing agent to prepare bimetallic alloy nanoparticles by co-introducing two metal precursors.

2. Successive two-step reduction: This nearly universal method for preparing coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles involves first forming the core nanoparticles, then depositing the shell metal on the pre-formed core.

3. One-step reduction: A more recently developed route that uses a suitable reducing agent to reduce metal cations with different reduction potentials simultaneously.

4. Galvanic replacement: An effective approach for fabricating hollow coreshell bimetallic nanoparticles based on the differences in reduction potentials between core and shell metals.

These methods compare as follows:

- Impregnation/co-reduction is simpler and more straightforward, suitable for alloy nanoparticles.
- The two-step reduction method offers more control over the core-shell structure but is more complicated.
- The one-step method is simpler than the two-step approach for core-shell structures but requires careful selection of the reducing agent.
- Galvanic replacement is particularly useful for creating hollow structures.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired nanoparticle structure (alloy vs. core-shell), level of structural control needed, and specific metal combinations. The two-step and one-step methods are generally more effective for producing well-defined core-shell structures, while impregnation/co-reduction is simpler for alloy nanoparticles.

最常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍/共还原法：这种直接的方法使用强还原剂通过共引入两种金属前驱体来制备双金属合金纳米粒子。

2. 连续两步还原法：这种几乎普遍适用于制备核壳结构双金属纳米粒子的方法首先形成核纳米粒子，然后在预先形成的核上沉积壳层金属。

3. 一步还原法：一种最近开发的路线，使用合适的还原剂同时还原具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子。

4. 置换反应法：基于核和壳层金属之间的还原电位差异，有效制备中空核壳双金属纳米粒子的方法。

这些方法的比较如下：

- 浸渍/共还原法更简单直接，适用于合金纳米粒子。
- 两步还原法对核壳结构的控制更好，但过程更复杂。
- 一步法比两步法更简单地制备核壳结构，但需要仔细选择还原剂。
- 置换反应法特别适用于创建中空结构。

总的来说，方法的选择取决于所需的纳米粒子结构（合金或核壳）、所需的结构控制水平以及特定的金属组合。两步法和一步法通常更有效地产生明确定义的核壳结构，而浸渍/共还原法则更简单地制备合金纳米粒子。
