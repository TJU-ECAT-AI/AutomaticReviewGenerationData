Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "Generally speaking, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."

[2] "Compared to the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs, the preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified."

[3] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[4] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[5] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation/co-reduction: This straightforward method uses a strong reducing agent to prepare bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) by co-introducing two metal precursors.

2. Successive two-step reduction: This universal method for coreshell bimetallic NPs involves depositing the shell metal on pre-formed core metal NPs.

3. One-step reduction: A recently developed route for coreshell NPs using a suitable reducing agent for metal cations with different reduction potentials.

4. Galvanic replacement: An effective approach to fabricate hollow coreshell NPs based on differences in reduction potentials between core and shell metal ions.

These methods compare as follows:

- Impregnation/co-reduction is simple and effective for alloy NPs but offers less control over structure.
- Successive reduction allows better control of coreshell structures but is more complex.
- One-step reduction simplifies the process for coreshell NPs but requires careful selection of reducing agents.
- Galvanic replacement enables hollow structures but is limited to certain metal combinations.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired nanoparticle structure, composition, and application. Successive reduction and one-step methods are particularly effective for producing well-defined coreshell catalysts with enhanced catalytic properties.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍/共还原法：这种简单的方法使用强还原剂通过共同引入两种金属前驱体来制备双金属合金纳米粒子（NPs）。

2. 连续两步还原法：这是制备核壳结构双金属NPs的通用方法，包括在预先形成的核心金属NPs上沉积壳层金属。

3. 一步还原法：最近开发的核壳NPs合成路线，使用适当的还原剂来还原具有不同还原电位的金属阳离子。

4. 置换反应法：基于核心和壳层金属离子还原电位差异，制备中空核壳NPs的有效方法。

这些方法的比较如下：

- 浸渍/共还原法简单有效，适用于合金NPs，但对结构控制较少。
- 连续还原法对核壳结构控制更好，但过程较复杂。
- 一步还原法简化了核壳NPs的制备过程，但需要谨慎选择还原剂。
- 置换反应法可制备中空结构，但仅限于某些金属组合。

总的来说，方法的选择取决于所需的纳米粒子结构、成分和应用。连续还原法和一步法特别有效，可生产具有增强催化性能的明确定义的核壳催化剂。
