[1] "Generally speaking, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs."

[2] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[3] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[4] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation/co-reduction: This method uses a strong reducing agent to prepare bimetallic alloy nanoparticles. It is straightforward and widely used.

2. Successive two-step reduction: This universal method involves separate reduction steps for core and shell nanoparticles. It is very effective for preparing core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles.

3. One-step reduction: A more recent development, this method uses a suitable reducing agent to reduce metal cations with different reduction potentials simultaneously. It is simpler than the two-step method but requires careful selection of the reducing agent.

4. Galvanic replacement: This approach creates bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles with hollow interiors by exploiting differences in reduction potentials between core and shell metal ions.

Each method has its advantages and applications:

- Impregnation/co-reduction is simple and effective for alloy nanoparticles.
- Successive two-step reduction offers better control over core-shell structures.
- One-step reduction simplifies the process but requires precise control of reduction conditions.
- Galvanic replacement is particularly useful for creating hollow structures.

The choice of method depends on the desired nanoparticle structure, composition, and application. Overall, these methods provide a range of options for synthesizing bimetallic catalysts with tailored properties for specific catalytic applications.
