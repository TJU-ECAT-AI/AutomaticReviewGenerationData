Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

[1] "Generally speaking, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs. The method is used in the synthesis of monometallic NPs but two metal precursors are co-introduced for bimetallic NPs."

[2] "Compared to the straightforward synthesis of bimetallic alloy NPs, the preparation strategies for bimetallic coreshell NPs are flexible and diversified."

[3] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs. The deposition of the shell metal on the pre-formed core metal NPs seems to be very effective."

[4] "Although the two-step reduction/epitaxial growth method is general but a bit complicated, a one-step route for bimetallic coreshell NPs has also been developed recently, in most of which a suitable reducing agent for the metal cations with differential reduction potentials is very important."

[5] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation/co-reduction: This straightforward method uses a strong reducing agent to simultaneously reduce two metal precursors, resulting in alloy nanoparticles.

2. Successive two-step reduction: This universal method for core-shell nanoparticles involves first forming the core metal nanoparticles, then depositing the shell metal on the pre-formed core.

3. One-step reduction: A more recent development for core-shell nanoparticles, this method uses a carefully selected reducing agent to exploit the differential reduction potentials of the two metals.

4. Galvanic replacement: This approach creates hollow core-shell nanoparticles by leveraging the differences in reduction potentials between the core and shell metals.

Each method has its advantages and applications. Impregnation/co-reduction is simple and effective for alloy nanoparticles. The successive two-step reduction offers more control over the core-shell structure. The one-step method can be faster and simpler for core-shell particles, but requires careful selection of the reducing agent. Galvanic replacement is particularly useful for creating hollow structures.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired nanoparticle structure (alloy vs. core-shell), the specific metals involved, and the level of control needed over the final product. The flexibility and diversity of preparation strategies, especially for core-shell structures, allow researchers to tailor the synthesis method to their specific requirements.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍/共还原法：这种直接的方法使用强还原剂同时还原两种金属前体，得到合金纳米粒子。

2. 连续两步还原法：这是制备核壳纳米粒子的通用方法，首先形成核金属纳米粒子，然后在预先形成的核上沉积壳层金属。

3. 一步还原法：这是核壳纳米粒子的一种较新的制备方法，利用精心选择的还原剂来利用两种金属的不同还原电位。

4. 镀层置换法：这种方法利用核和壳层金属之间的还原电位差异，创造出中空的核壳纳米粒子。

每种方法都有其优势和应用。浸渍/共还原法简单有效，适用于合金纳米粒子。连续两步还原法对核壳结构的控制更好。一步法对核壳粒子来说可能更快更简单，但需要仔细选择还原剂。镀层置换法特别适用于创造中空结构。

总的来说，方法的选择取决于所需的纳米粒子结构（合金还是核壳）、涉及的具体金属以及对最终产品所需的控制水平。制备策略的灵活性和多样性，尤其是对核壳结构而言，使研究人员能够根据具体要求定制合成方法。
