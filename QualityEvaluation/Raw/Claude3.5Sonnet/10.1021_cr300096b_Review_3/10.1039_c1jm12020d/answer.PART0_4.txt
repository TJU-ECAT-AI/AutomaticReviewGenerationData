[1] "Generally speaking, impregnation/co-reduction with a relatively strong reducing agent can be used for the preparation of bimetallic alloy NPs."

[2] "The successive two-step reduction for core and shell NPs, respectively, is almost universal to prepare coreshell bimetallic NPs."

[3] "Galvanic replacement is an effective approach to fabricate bimetallic coreshell NPs with hollow interiors based on the differences in the reduction potentials of core and shell metal ions."

[4] "Toshima and coworkers have proposed three possible routes for preparation of heterometallic coreshell NPs based on their long-term and systematic studies: 1) Pt@Pd coreshell NPs have been obtained by simultaneous gentle reduction with alcohol for H2PtCl6 and PdCl3 in the presence of PVP; 2) Pd@Pt coreshell NPs have been prepared by a so-called hydrogen-sacrificial protective strategy, in which hydrogen adsorbed on the surface of core-metal NPs works as reductant of the second metal ions to produce the shell; 3) physical mixture of two kinds of metal NP in dispersions can spontaneously produce coreshell-structured bimetallic NPs."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Impregnation/co-reduction: This method uses a strong reducing agent to prepare bimetallic alloy nanoparticles. It is relatively straightforward and widely used for alloy synthesis.

2. Successive two-step reduction: This approach involves separate reduction steps for core and shell formation, and is nearly universal for preparing core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles. It allows precise control over the core and shell compositions.

3. Galvanic replacement: This technique exploits differences in reduction potentials between metals to create hollow core-shell structures. It is effective for producing unique nanostructures.

4. Simultaneous gentle reduction: Using mild reducing agents like alcohols can produce core-shell structures in one step under certain conditions.

5. Hydrogen-sacrificial protective strategy: This method uses hydrogen adsorbed on core metal nanoparticles to reduce shell metal ions, creating well-defined core-shell structures.

6. Physical mixing: In some cases, simply mixing two types of metal nanoparticles can spontaneously produce core-shell bimetallic structures through self-organization.

Each method has advantages for particular applications. Impregnation/co-reduction is simple but offers less structural control. Successive reduction allows precise core-shell design but is more complex. Galvanic replacement creates unique hollow structures. The choice depends on the desired nanoparticle architecture, metals involved, and intended application. Overall, these methods provide a versatile toolkit for synthesizing a wide range of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts with controlled compositions and structures.
