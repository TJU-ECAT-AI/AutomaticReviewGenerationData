The literature does not directly discuss synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. The paper focuses on characterizing and testing specific Pt/C and PtZn/C catalysts, but does not provide a broad overview of synthesis methods. To properly answer this question would require additional information beyond what is presented in this document.

[1] "The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K, overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation (100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of 1 wt.%. The excess of solvent was removed by flowing nitrogen through the slurry at 333 K and the remaining solid was dried overnight at 383 K and heat treated in flowing helium (50 cm3 min1) at 673 K for 4 h (heating rate: 5 K min1) to decompose the nitrate precursor. After this treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration to load 0.2 wt.%."

The literature only describes one synthesis method for the bimetallic PtZn/C catalyst, which is sequential impregnation. This method involves first impregnating the support with a zinc precursor solution, drying and heat treating, then impregnating with a platinum precursor solution. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. To fully answer the question about advantages, applications and efficacy of different methods would require information beyond what is provided in this specific literature. A more extensive review of catalyst synthesis techniques would be needed to adequately address all aspects of the question.

这篇文献只描述了一种合成PtZn/C双金属催化剂的方法,即序贯浸渍法。这种方法首先用锌前驱体溶液浸渍载体,干燥和热处理,然后用铂前驱体溶液浸渍。文章没有对不同的双金属负载催化剂合成方法进行全面比较。要充分回答关于不同方法的优势、应用和效果的问题,需要超出本文提供的信息。需要对催化剂合成技术进行更广泛的综述,才能充分解答问题的所有方面。

The literature only describes one specific synthesis method for a supported PtZn bimetallic catalyst, namely sequential impregnation. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. To fully answer this question would require additional information beyond what is provided in the given text.

However, based on the details provided, we can infer that sequential impregnation allows for controlled deposition of each metal separately. This method involves first depositing zinc onto the support, followed by a heat treatment step, and then depositing platinum. This approach likely allows for better control over the final composition and distribution of the two metals on the support surface.

The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of the bimetallic PtZn catalyst compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst in both crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and iso-butane dehydrogenation reactions. However, without information on other synthesis methods, it's not possible to make a comprehensive comparison of advantages and overall efficacy.

该文献只描述了一种特定的负载型PtZn双金属催化剂的合成方法,即序列浸渍法。它没有提供不同合成方法的全面比较。要完整回答这个问题需要超出所给文本范围的额外信息。

然而,根据提供的细节,我们可以推断序列浸渍法允许分别控制沉积每种金属。这种方法首先将锌沉积到载体上,然后进行热处理步骤,最后沉积铂。这种方法可能允许更好地控制两种金属在载体表面的最终组成和分布。

这种方法的有效性通过双金属PtZn催化剂在巴豆醛加氢和异丁烷脱氢反应中相比单金属Pt催化剂的改进催化性能得到了证明。然而,由于缺乏其他合成方法的信息,无法对优势和整体效果进行全面比较。

The literature mainly discusses sequential impregnation as a synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts. In this method, each metal precursor is deposited onto the support separately in sequence. The advantages of this method include:

1. Control over individual metal loadings
2. Ability to use different solvents for each metal precursor
3. Potential for better dispersion of metals

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods. To fully answer this question, additional information on other common methods like co-impregnation, deposition-precipitation, and ion exchange would be needed to compare their advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production.

文献主要讨论了顺序浸渍法作为制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法。在这种方法中,每种金属前驱体被依次单独沉积到载体上。这种方法的优点包括:

1. 可以控制单个金属的负载量
2. 可以为每种金属前驱体使用不同的溶剂
3. 有潜力获得更好的金属分散度

然而,该文献并未提供不同合成方法的全面比较。要完整回答这个问题,还需要关于其他常见方法(如共浸渍法、沉淀-沉积法和离子交换法)的额外信息,以比较它们在催化剂生产中的优势、应用和整体效果。
