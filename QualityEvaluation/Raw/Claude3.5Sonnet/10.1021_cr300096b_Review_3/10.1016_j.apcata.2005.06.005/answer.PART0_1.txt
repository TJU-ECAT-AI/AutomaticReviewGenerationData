[1] "The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K, overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation (100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of 1 wt.%. The excess of solvent was removed by flowing nitrogen through the slurry at 333 K and the remaining solid was dried overnight at 383 K and heat treated in flowing helium (50 cm3 min1) at 673 K for 4 h (heating rate: 5 K min1) to decompose the nitrate precursor. After this treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration to load 0.2 wt.%."

The literature only describes one synthesis method for the bimetallic PtZn/C catalyst, which is sequential impregnation. This method involves first impregnating the support with a zinc precursor solution, drying and heat treating, then impregnating with a platinum precursor solution. The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. To fully answer the question about advantages, applications and efficacy of different methods would require information beyond what is provided in this specific literature. A more extensive review of catalyst synthesis techniques would be needed to adequately address all aspects of the question.

这篇文献只描述了一种合成PtZn/C双金属催化剂的方法,即序贯浸渍法。这种方法首先用锌前驱体溶液浸渍载体,干燥和热处理,然后用铂前驱体溶液浸渍。文章没有对不同的双金属负载催化剂合成方法进行全面比较。要充分回答关于不同方法的优势、应用和效果的问题,需要超出本文提供的信息。需要对催化剂合成技术进行更广泛的综述,才能充分解答问题的所有方面。
