[1] "The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K, overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation (100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of 1 wt.%."

[2] "After this treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration to load 0.2 wt.%."

The literature mainly discusses sequential impregnation as a synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts. In this method, each metal precursor is deposited onto the support separately in sequence. The advantages of this method include:

1. Control over individual metal loadings
2. Ability to use different solvents for each metal precursor
3. Potential for better dispersion of metals

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods. To fully answer this question, additional information on other common methods like co-impregnation, deposition-precipitation, and ion exchange would be needed to compare their advantages, applications, and overall efficacy in catalyst production.

文献主要讨论了顺序浸渍法作为制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法。在这种方法中,每种金属前驱体被依次单独沉积到载体上。这种方法的优点包括:

1. 可以控制单个金属的负载量
2. 可以为每种金属前驱体使用不同的溶剂
3. 有潜力获得更好的金属分散度

然而,该文献并未提供不同合成方法的全面比较。要完整回答这个问题,还需要关于其他常见方法(如共浸渍法、沉淀-沉积法和离子交换法)的额外信息,以比较它们在催化剂生产中的优势、应用和整体效果。
