[1] "The bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation of the previously dried support (383 K, overnight). First, zinc was deposited by impregnation (100 cm3 of solution per gram of support) with an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (from Aldrich, 98% purity) of the appropriate concentration to obtain a Zn loading of 1 wt.%. The excess of solvent was removed by flowing nitrogen through the slurry at 333 K and the remaining solid was dried overnight at 383 K and heat treated in flowing helium (50 cm3 min1) at 673 K for 4 h (heating rate: 5 K min1) to decompose the nitrate precursor. After this treatment, platinum was deposited by impregnation with an acetone solution of H2PtCl6 of the appropriate concentration to load 0.2 wt.%."

The literature only describes one specific synthesis method for a supported PtZn bimetallic catalyst, namely sequential impregnation. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. To fully answer this question would require additional information beyond what is provided in the given text.

However, based on the details provided, we can infer that sequential impregnation allows for controlled deposition of each metal separately. This method involves first depositing zinc onto the support, followed by a heat treatment step, and then depositing platinum. This approach likely allows for better control over the final composition and distribution of the two metals on the support surface.

The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the improved catalytic performance of the bimetallic PtZn catalyst compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst in both crotonaldehyde hydrogenation and iso-butane dehydrogenation reactions. However, without information on other synthesis methods, it's not possible to make a comprehensive comparison of advantages and overall efficacy.

该文献只描述了一种特定的负载型PtZn双金属催化剂的合成方法,即序列浸渍法。它没有提供不同合成方法的全面比较。要完整回答这个问题需要超出所给文本范围的额外信息。

然而,根据提供的细节,我们可以推断序列浸渍法允许分别控制沉积每种金属。这种方法首先将锌沉积到载体上,然后进行热处理步骤,最后沉积铂。这种方法可能允许更好地控制两种金属在载体表面的最终组成和分布。

这种方法的有效性通过双金属PtZn催化剂在巴豆醛加氢和异丁烷脱氢反应中相比单金属Pt催化剂的改进催化性能得到了证明。然而,由于缺乏其他合成方法的信息,无法对优势和整体效果进行全面比较。
