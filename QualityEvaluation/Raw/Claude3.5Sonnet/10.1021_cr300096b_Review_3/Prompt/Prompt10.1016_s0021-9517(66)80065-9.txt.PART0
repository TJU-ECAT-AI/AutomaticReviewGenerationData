The chemisorption of hydrogen on platinum deposited on two different supports, 
alumina and silica-alumina, has been investigated to determine the effect of the support 
on the degree of dispersion of the platinum. Measurements of the rate of dehydrogenation 
of cyclohexane were made to determine the corresponding effects on catalytic activity. 
The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the supports with chloroplatinic acid and 
were reduced in hydrogen prior to both the chemisorption and catalytic activity meas- 
urements. The chemisorption results indicated that the platinum was dispersed to a much 
higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. The higher activity of the platinum on 
alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater platinum disper- 
sion. For the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at 
moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent 
of 7-8 kcal/mole. 
The chemisorption of hydrogen on sup- 
ported platinunl catalysts has been investi- 
gated recently by several groups of workers 
(1-3). In most of these investigations, the 
platinum was impregnated on alumina with 
an aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, fol- 
lowed by calcination in air, and subsequent 
reduction in hydrogen at about 500C. For 
catalysts prepared in this way with platinum 
concentrations less than 1.0 wt %, the 
results generally indicated that the ratio of 
hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum 
atom was close to unity, suggesting high 
dispersion of the platinum on the support. 
Relatively little information on hydrogen 
chemisorption has been reported for plati- 
num deposited on other acidic supports such 
as silica-alumina. However, the data which 
are available suggest that the particular 
support used may have a substantial effect 
on the results (4). We have recently obtained 
some additional information in this regard 
and have investigated the effect on the 
catalytic properties of the platinum, using 
cyclohexane dehydrogenation as a test reac- 
tion. In addition, a rough estimate of the 
heat of adsorption of hydrogen was obtained 
at moderately high surface coverage on plati- 
num supported on alumina. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
The apparatus used for the hydrogen 
chemisorption measurements was a con- 
ventional glass vacuum system described 
previously (5). The system had an 80 liter/ 
sec oil diffusion pump. By means of a trap 
cooled in liquid nitrogen, ulthnate dynamic 
vacua of 10 
-7 torr were obtained. The sample 
cells were made of Pyrex glass and had two 
stopcocks to 
permit hydrogen to flow 
through the bed of catalyst. The amount of 
sample charged to the adsorption cell was 
approximately 2 g. The samples were re- 
duced in place in flowing hydrogen (500 
cc/min) for 3 hr at 450C, prior to evacua- 
tion at 450C and subsequent cooling to the 
temperature at which the adsorption iso- 
therm was to be obtained. 
The cyclohexane dehydrogenation meas- 
urements were made in a stainless steel 
reactor tube with an approxhnate ID of 
1.5 cm, employing a catalyst charge of 0.1 
to 1.0 g diluted uniformly with quartz chips 
to a volume of 3 cc. The reaction conditions 
471 
472 
CUSUMANO DEMBINSKI, AND SINFELT 
were 316C, 1 atm total pressure, and a 
hydrogen-to-cyclohexane mole ratio of 5:1. 
The catalysts were reduced in place in the 
reactor for 3 hr at 450C in flowing hydrogen. 
The extent of dehydrogenation to benzene 
was determined by chromatographic analy- 
sis, employing a 7,8-benzoquinoline column 
coupled directly to the reactor outlet. A 
sample of the reaction product was taken 
15 rain after the reactants were first intro- 
duced to the reactor. 
The platinum catalysts used in this work 
were prepared by impregnation of alumina 
or silica-alumina with aqueous chloroplatinic 
acid solution, followed by drying and sub- 
sequent calcination in air for 1 hr at 540C. 
The alumina was prepared by heating beta- 
alumina trihydrate, obtained from Davison 
Chemical Company, for 4 hr at 600C. The 
surface area of the alumina was 295 m/g. 
The silica-alumina used as a support was 
Type DA-1 cracking catalyst (nominally 
13% Al03, 87% SiO), also obtained from 
the Davison Chemical Company. The sur- 
face area was 450 m2/g. 
The cyclohexane used in this work was 
spectroscopic grade reagent and was ob- 
tained from Fisher Scientific Company. 
High-purity hydrogen was obtained from 
the Linde Company, Linden, New Jersey. It 
was further purified in a "Deoxo" unit con- 
taining palladium catalyst to remove trace 
amounts of oxygen. The water formed was 
then removed by a trap cooled in Dry Ice or 
by a molecular sieve dryer, the latter having 
been employed for the hydrogen used in the 
kinetic measurements. 
I:ESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Adsorption isotherms for hydrogen on the 
platinum catalysts and supports are shown 
in Fig. 1. In obtaining the isotherms, ap- 
proximately 30 rain was allowed before an 
equilibrium pressure reading was taken. 
This procedure was similar to that adopted 
by Spenadel and Boudart (1), who indicated 
that more than 90% of the hydrogen ad- 
sorption on platinum supported on alumina 
was instantaneous and that the rate of 
uptake was negligible after about 30 rain. 
From the isotherms in Fig. 1, it can be 
seen that the adsorption on the alumina, at 
either 200 
 or 300C, is small compared to 
the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on: 
alumina catalyst. The adsorption on the 
alumina is also seen to increase with increas- 
ing temperature. It appears that the adsorp- 
tion on alumina, in contrast to adsorption 
on platinum, is slow and that the increase 
in adsorption at the higher temperature 
reflects a higher rate rather than an effect 
of temperature on adsorption equilibrium. 
In the case of the silica-alumina and plati- 
num-on-silica-alumina samples, the adsorp- 
tion on the former is only about 15% of 
that on the latter at a pressure of 2 cm, but 
increases to about 50% at a pressure of 
20 era. 
When the adsorption isotherms for the 
platinum catalysts are corrected for adsorp- 
tion on the supports, net isotherms for ad- 
sorption on the platinum itself are obtained. 
Adopting this procedure and expressing the 
results as atoms of hydrogen adsorbed per 
atom of platinum, we obtain the isotherms 
shown in Fig. 2. In the case of the platinum- 
on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydro- 
gen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is 
essentially unity, corresponding to a high 
degree of dispersion of platinum. This is 
similar to the result observed by Spenadel 
and Boudart for 0.6% platinum on aIumina 
(1). The adsorption at 200 
 is higher than at 
300 
 
, indicating that the adsorption is 
exothermic. At the high coverage of platinum 
by hydrogen in these experiments (6 > 0.6), 
the isosteric heat of adsorption is low, about 
7-8 kcal/mole at 0 = 0.7. From experiments 
on the rate of desorption of hydrogen from 
platinum supported on alumina, Kubokawa 
and co-workers (6) determined a value of 
10 kcal/mole for the activation energy of 
des0rption at comparable high coverages. 
In the case of the platinum-on-silica- 
alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen 
on the platinum is about an order of magni- 
tude less than for the platinum-on-alumina 
catalyst. The dispel-sion of the platinum is 
therefore much poorer on silica-alumina than 
on alumina, i.e., the platinum surface area 
is about one-tenth as great on silica-alumina 
as on alumina. This difference in dispersion 
on the two supports is directionally similar 
to results reported previously for nickel (7),

except that the magnitude of the difference 
is much greater in the present work on 
platinum. Perhaps this is due to the much 
lower concentration of metal employed in 
the ease of platinum (2% vs. 10%). 
From the hydrogen ehemisorption data, 
an estimate of the average crystallite size 
of the platinum on the two different supports 
can be made. The determination of platinum 
erystallite size from adsorption data has 
been previously discussed in some detail by 
Spenadel and Boudart (1). In the ease of the 
platinum-on-alumina catalyst employed in 
the present study, the erystallite size of the 
platinum is less than 10 A. For the platinum- 
on-silica-alumina 
catalyst, 
the platinum 
erystallite size is 85 A. In these calculations 
it is assumed that the platinum erystallites 
are cubes. 
The effect of the difference in platinum 
dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by 
data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydro- 
genation to benzene over the two platinum 
catalysts. The data are given in Table 1.

The rates of dehydrogenation were deter- 
mined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and 
were calculated as the product of the quan- 
tity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x, 
where F represents the moles of eyclohexane 
charged per hour and W is the weight of 
catalyst in grams. The activity of the 
platinum-on-alumina 
catalyst was about 
six times as high as that of the platinum on 
silica-alumina. Interpreting the results in a 
strict manner, one would conclude that the 
difference in catalytic activity of the plati- 
num on the two supports was smaller than 
the difference in platinum surface area, since 
the platinum surface area on alumina was 
about 10 times higher than on silica-alumina. 
However, it is possible that the more active 
platinum-on-alumina 
catalyst may have 
been limited to some degree by pore diffu- 
sion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller 
than the true ratio of catalytic activities. 
In any case, there is little doubt that the 
major reason for the difference in catalytic 
activity is the difference in the platinum 
surface area on the two supports. In other 
words, the specific catalytic activity of the 
platinum (rate per unit platinum surface 
area) for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is 
essentially unaffected by the support. 
The results of the present investigation 
indicate that the support did not exert any 
specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic prop- 
erties of the platinum, but instead simply 
affected the degree of platinum dispersion. 
However, it should not be concluded that 
the role of the support is in general limited 
only to its effect on the surface area of the 
active catalytic component. Thus, it has 
been shown that the specific catalytic activ- 
ity of nickel for ethane hydrogenolysis varies 
markedly with the support employed for the 
nickel (7), i.e., the catalytic activity of the 
nickel is affected to a much greater extent 
by the support than is the corresponding 
nickel surface area. It would therefore 
appear that the effect of the support can 
vary significantly, depending on the specific 
catalyst and reaction under study.
