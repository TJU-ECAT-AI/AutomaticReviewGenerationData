Carbon nanotube-supported Pt-based bimetallic catalysts prepared by a microwave-assisted polyol reduction method and their catalytic applications in the selective hydrogenation
Abstract
Platinum-based bimetallic catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) were prepared by a facile microwave-assisted polyol reduction method (MAPR) and chemically probed in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. These bimetallic catalysts outperformed the catalysts prepared by the conventional impregnation method. CNT surface properties, selection of solvent and transition metal promoter were identified to be of great significance in tuning the catalytic performance. The best catalytic results were obtained on the Fe- and Co-modified Pt catalysts in the presence of ethyl acetate as the solvent after removing the oxygen-containing groups from CNT surfaces. Electrochemistry measurements including cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping, competitive hydrogenations of toluene and benzene, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were employed to gain insights into the physicochemical properties of catalysts. Both catalytic reactions and characterizations revealed that the MAPR method afforded close contact between promoters and platinum active sites, leading to superior catalytic properties.

1. Introduction
Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries
[1]
. Selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde (CALD) to cinnamal alcohol (CALC) is a representative example of such reactions.
[2]
. Nevertheless, hydrogenation of CALD forms other by-products such as hydrocinnamaldehyde (HALD) and hydrocinnamal alcohol (HALC) due to the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of CC double bonds of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes
[2]
,
[3]
. In many cases, by-products such as acetals and other unidentified high molecular weight compounds may also be produced in large quantity
[2]
,
[4]
. Research efforts have been devoted to improve the selectivity toward the desired unsaturated alcohol CALC. Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD
[1]
,
[5]
,
[6]
.
Recent studies have focused on the effects of supports and promoters on the activity and selectivity of Pt metallic nanoparticles in CALD selective hydrogenation. Different support materials may lead to distinctive hydrogenation results due to the specific interactions between support and Pt nanoparticles
[7]
. The catalytic performance of metallic nanoparticles may also be drastically changed by modifying the surface chemistry of the support, e.g., the activity of Pt nanoparticles was enhanced by a factor of 25 after removing the surface oxygen-containing groups from a carbon nanofiber (CNF) support
[8]
. Another promising approach to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles is to introduce a second metal (or metal oxide) to form bimetallic catalysts. It has been reported that metal promoters, such as Ga
[8]
, Co
[9]
and Ru
[10]
, play a vital role in CALD hydrogenation in the presence of supported Pt nanoparticles due to the synergetic interactions between Pt active sites and promoters.
In addition to support and promoter, other factors, e.g., the preparation method, may also affect the outcome of selective hydrogenation. Several methodologies have been developed to synthesize Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. Although the procedures of ion-exchange and impregnation (IMP) methods are simple, the activities of as-synthesized catalysts are usually poorer when compared to the catalysts prepared by more sophisticated approaches, such as homogeneous deposition precipitation (HDP) and reductive deposition precipitation (RDP)
[8]
. For the RDP method, hydrogen is adsorbed on the pre-reduced parent metallic catalyst, followed by depositing promoters on the pre-formed metal nanoparticles via the reduction of promoter precursors by the adsorbed hydrogen
[11]
. The successive reduction steps in RDP result in close contact between promoters and main active centers, which affords favorable catalytic properties in selective hydrogenation
[8]
. Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells
[12]
,
[13]
. Microwave irradiation allows uniform heating of the metal precursors to a high temperature within a few seconds, leading to a shorter crystallization time and more homogenous nucleation when compared to conventional preparation methods
[13]
.
In this contribution, we apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method. The effects on the catalytic performance of as-prepared bimetallic catalysts due to the pretreatment of multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) support surfaces, solvents and transition metal (metal oxide) promoters are examined. In addition to the conventional characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), competitive hydrogenations of toluene and benzene are employed to chemically probe the electron density of Pt nanoparticles. We also apply the electrochemistry measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and CO stripping to identify the nature of as-prepared bimetallic catalysts. It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metalmetal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites. Interestingly, other than generally adopted solvents such as alcohols
[1]
,
[2]
and alkanes
[14]
, the as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent.

Chemical Reagent), Nafion solution (5% in isopropanol and water, SigmaAldrich), CALD (>99%, Aldrich), tetradecane (>99.5%, Fluka), cyclohexane (99.5%, SigmaAldrich), 1-butanol (>99%, Sigma), ethanol (>99.5%, SigmaAldrich), 2-propanol (>99%, Sigma), EA (>99.5%, Acros), 1,4-dioxane (99.8%, SigmaAldrich), benzene (>99.9%, SigmaAldrich) and toluene (>99.9%, SigmaAldrich) were used as received without any further purification.
2.2. Synthesis
The pristine CNT (>95%, Cnano) was treated with concentrated and diluted nitric acids successively following the procedures as described by Lordi et al.
[15]
. The concentrated nitric acid removed the amorphous carbonaceous and metallic impurities; the diluted nitric acid slowly oxidized the purified CNT to create abundant surface functional groups, which facilitated the uniform deposition of metal precursors. To deposit Pt precursors onto functionalized CNT, 0.1 g of CNT was immersed in 722 μL of H2PtCl6·6H2O aqueous solution (20 mg/mL) and dried at 373 K in vacuum. EG (40 mL) was added to the above-mentioned PtCNT composite followed by sonicating for 10 min to afford a homogenous suspension. The said suspension was transferred into a three-neck flask with a condenser and placed in a microwave reactor (Sineo, MAS-II). The slurry was agitated by a magnetic stirrer, and the temperature inside the flask was monitored by an infrared sensor. The suspension was heated to 438 K in 0.5 min and kept at the same temperature for 1.5 min. After cooling to room temperature, the powder was filtrated and washed with deionized water, followed by drying at 373 K in vacuum. The as-synthesized catalyst was denoted as Pt/CNT and the expected Pt loading is 5 wt.% and confirmed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements. Pt/CNT was pretreated at various temperatures (673, 773, 873 and 973 K) in a nitrogen flow (20 mL/min) for 2 h to remove the oxygen-containing groups from CNT surfaces. The resulting catalysts were denoted as Pt/CNT-673, Pt/CNT-773, Pt/CNT-873 and Pt/CNT-973.
The preparations of bimetallic catalysts were similar to that of Pt/CNT but in the presence of both Pt and transition metal precursors. The Pt loading was kept at 5 wt.%, and the molar ratio of Pt to promoter was 1:1. All the as-synthesized bimetallic catalysts were pretreated at 973 K in nitrogen and were denoted as PtMn/CNT-973, PtFe/CNT-973, PtCo/CNT-973, PtNi/CNT-973, PtCu/CNT-973, PtZn/CNT-973 and PtSn/CNT-973. For comparison, Pt/CNT catalysts promoted with Fe or Co were also prepared by a conventional IMP method (denoted as PtFe/CNT-973-IMP and PtCo/CNT-973-IMP). Aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Co(NO3)2·6H2O) were impregnated onto the oxidized CNT followed by drying under ambient conditions overnight. The impregnated catalysts were pre-reduced in a hydrogen flow (50 mL/min) at 473 K for 2 h and subsequently exposed to a nitrogen flow (20 mL/min) at 973 K for another 2 h.
2.3. Selective hydrogenation of CALD
Selective hydrogenation of CALD was carried out in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner (Parr 4950, controller 4843). A certain amount of catalyst (0.01 g), 0.2 g of CALD (1.5 mmol) and 7.25 mL of solvent were added into the reactor. Tetradecane (38 μL, 0.146 mmol) was added as an internal standard. The air residue inside the reactor was expelled by pressurizing and releasing hydrogen several times. The reaction was performed at 333 K under 10 atm of hydrogen for either 1 or 0.5 h depending on the catalyst activity. In order to eliminate the external mass transfer limitation, the effect of stirring speed on CALD conversion was studied. The results show that CALD conversion is constant when the stirring speed is above 600 rpm, denoting a kinetics-controlled regime (see
