Electrocatalytic properties of supported platinumcobalt nanoparticles with uniform and controlled composition
Abstract
Platinumcobalt nanoparticles were prepared from water/Triton X-100/propanol-2/cyclohexane reverse microemulsions. The Pt:Co ratio in the nanoparticles was well controlled by the initial concentrations of Pt and Co in the precursor solution. The nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The PtCo nanoparticles supported on a carbon electrode possessed high dispersion and high catalytic activity for methanol oxidation in alkaline solution at room temperature. The optimum Pt:Co ratio for methanol oxidation was determined to be 1:0.5.
1. Introduction
Binary and ternary platinum based alloys have been actively studied for their enhanced electrocatalytic properties in fuel cell reactions

[5]
. To accelerate the search of the optimum alloy composition, fast screening combinatorial approaches have also been proposed
[4]

[5]
. From a more fundamental approach, some studies have focused on how the electronic character of the alloys affects their electrocatalytic properties. Goodenough et al.
[6]
reported a shift in the Pt 4f binding energy of a PtRu alloy using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Park et al.
[7]
investigated PtNi and PtRuNi alloy and claimed that electronic effects may contribute to the enhanced CO oxidation. Toda et al.
[8]
found that modification in the electronic structure enhanced the electrocatalytic activities of platinum alloy. Shukla et al.
[9]
studied the binary and ternary alloys of transition metals with platinized carbon and suggested that the enrichment in Pt sites in the electrocatalyst promoted its electrocatalytic activity. In addition to the search for the optimum chemical composition of electrocatalysts, recent research interests have also focused on nanoparticles for the enhanced activity and utilization of Pt-based alloys

. The behavior of nanoparticle alloys is expected to be different from that of their bulk state. It is important to study alloys with a narrow size distribution to avoid effects due to disparity in particle sizes. Investigations at the nanoparticle level are needed for an understanding of the mechanism of activity enhancement and the search for optimum alloy nanoparticles. Syntheses of nanoparticles with controlled size are therefore of great interest. An attempt has been made to study the optimum PtCo composition for formic acid oxidation using nanoparticles electrochemically deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
[18]
. Other techniques proposed include chemical reduction
[15]
, hydrolysis
[16]
, vacuum deposition
[17]
, and colloidal methods
[19]
. For these techniques, however, it is difficult to achieve a consistent alloy composition in the nanoparticles prepared. Preparation of nanoparticles using a microemulsion provides a convenient control of size and composition. Previously, bimetallic nanoparticles have been prepared using a water-in-oil reverse microemulsion and showed a high catalytic activity for methanol oxidation at room temperature
[20]
,
[21]
. The optimum composition of PtCo nanoparticles, however, has not been investigated. This paper reports the properties of bimetallic PtCo nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution and uniform composition. The electrocatalytic activities of binary PtCo nanoparticles of different compositions are studied for methanol oxidation in alkaline media.
2. Experimental
Platinumcobalt nanoparticles were prepared by a two-microemulsion technique
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
. The microemulsion system was composed of Triton X-100 as the surfactant, propanol-2 as a co-surfactant, and either the PtCo precursor solution or a hydrazine solution dispersed in a continuous oil phase of cyclohexane. The aqueous phases of the two microemulsion systems have the same volume fraction but are of different compositions as indicated in
Table 1
. The aqueous phase in microemulsion II contained hydrazine solution as the reducing agent. The amount of hydrazine was in stoichiometric excess compared with an equal volume of PtCo precursor solution in microemulsion I. The two microemulsions were prepared separately by mixing by volume 10% surfactant, 35% cyclohexane, 40% propanol-2 and 15% of the aqueous phase. A small amount of additional propanol-2 was then titrated slowly into each of the microemulsion systems with stirring until the microemulsion system became transparent. The two stable microemulsions were then mixed with a stirrer. Platinumcobalt nanoparticles were formed upon contact between the precursor containing microemulsion droplets and the hydrazine containing microemulsion droplets. Triton X-100 (t-octylphenolethoxylate), from Sigma Chemical Co., was used as received. Hydrazine hydrate, propanol-2 and cyclohexane (C6H12) were from BDH Chemical Ltd. The platinum source was dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV) hydrate(H2PtCl6 · xH2O) from Chempure Ltd. The cobalt source was cobalt(II) chloride from BDH Chemicals Ltd. De-ionized water of resistivity 18.2 MΩ was produced by a Milli-Q ultrapure system from Millipore Ltd., USA. The as synthesized PtCo nanoparticles protected by the surfactant formed a suspension in the cyclohexane phase and had a narrow size distribution. The suspension was the stock solution for preparation of samples of PtCo nanoparticles supported on either Vulcan XC-72 powder or a carbon cloth.

The PtCo nanoparticles were characterized by a JOEL 2000FX transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM sample was prepared by placing a 100 μl droplet of as synthesized PtCo nanoparticle suspension onto a carbon coated copper TEM grid and leaving this to dry in a desiccator. The PtCo nanoparticles were protected by surfactants from merging into larger particles. Their sizes were, therefore, not affected by the amount dispersed onto the TEM grid. Elemental analysis was obtained by a scanning electron microscope (Cambridge S360 UK) with an energy dispersion X-ray analysis detector (EDX) (Oxford Link eXL). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Siemens, D-5000, X-ray diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). The PtCo/C sample for XRD analysis was prepared by adding Vulcan XC72 high surface area carbon to a suspension of as synthesized PtCo nanoparticles. The PtCo nanoparticles protected by the surfactant are adsorbed together onto the Vulcan XC 72 carbon powder support. After filtering the PtCo containing carbon powder, the surfactant can be removed by washing with acetone solvent. The PtCo nanoparticle loaded carbon was then heated at 500 C in a nitrogen atmosphere, for better characterization of XRD. The micropores and mesopores of the Vulcan XC-72 confined the PtCo nanoparticles and limited their merging into larger particles. The sizes of the metal nanoparticles were not dependent on the metal loadings tested, which were below 20% (m/m). Upon heating to 500 C, however, the nanoparticles were more mobile and larger particles were formed and enabled X-ray diffraction patterns to be detected. XPS spectra were recorded by a Phi Quantum 2000 XPS system (Physical Electronics, Inc.) using Al Kα radiation at a base pressure below 5 × 109 Torr. The preparation of the PtCo/C sample for XPS analysis was the same as that for XRD except heating at 500 C. The XPS spectra were calibrated and corrected against the reference carbon peak line. Nonlinear least-square curve fitting was performed using Phi Multipack software (Physical Electronics, Inc.).
Instead of Vulcan XC 72 carbon powder, a 9-mm diameter circular carbon electrode (area 0.64 cm2) was used as the support for the PtCo nanoparticles in experiments to determine electrochemical activity. A suspension of as synthesized PtCo nanoparticles containing 0.87 mg Pt/ml was pipetted onto the surface of an ELAT carbon cloth electrode, supplied by E-TEK Inc., MA, USA. The loading of platinum was calculated by the amount of solution added to a known surface area of carbon electrode, assuming complete and uniform adsorption. After evaporation of the solvent at 60 C in an oven, the carbon electrode was rinsed several times in ethanol and then dried in air. No heat treatment was applied to the carbon cloth supported PtCo nanoparticles. When immersed into an aqueous electrolyte solution, the nanoparticles of the electrodes thus prepared did not re-dissolve and the electrolyte solution remained clear throughout. Electrochemical measurements were taken in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. Potentiostats/galvanostats used were a VOLTALAB 40 from Radiometer and a BAS LG-50 from Bioanalytical Systems Inc., USA. An HgHgO 1 M KOH reference electrode was used for the methanol oxidation experiments in alkaline solution.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Uniformity of size and composition of nanoparticles
The attractive feature of the two-step microemulsion reduction technique is the ease and accuracy in controlling the composition of the mixed metal nanoparticles. The reduction reaction occurs in a confined reaction zone within the microemulsions. The ultimate metal composition in the nanoparticles follows that in the precursor solution, without loss in control of the particle size. The adsorption of nanoparticles into a carbon support prevents any loss of size control. We performed preparations of various PtCo nanoparticles by changing the initial composition of the precursor solution. The volume fractions of the aqueous phase, surfactant, co-surfactant, and oil phase are given in
Table 1
. The concentration of the H2PtCl6 was kept at 10 mM but the CoCl2 concentration varied correspondingly. The size distributions of PtCo nanoparticles were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After preparation by the two-microemulsion technique, the nanoparticles suspended in solution were deposited onto a TEM grid and allowed to dry.
Fig. 1
shows a typical TEM micrograph of the PtCo nanoparticles, showing a narrow size distribution. From an enlarged print of the TEM micrograph, the sizes of a large number of particles were measured to construct a histogram of particle size distribution. The histogram is not shown here but can be constructed from
Table 2
detailing the size distributions of different batches of PtCo nanoparticles prepared with different precursor compositions. For all PtCo compositions, a narrow distribution centered around 2 nm was observed.

The PtCo compositions were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements on several different regions (with analytical areas down to 100 nm in diameter) of each sample of the unsupported PtCo nanoparticles. The PtCo compositions in different regions are in close agreement without significant deviations.
Table 3
gives the EDX results of PtCo nanoparticles prepared with different precursor concentrations. The EDX results show that the nanoparticles have almost the same Pt:Co ratios as in the initial precursor solutions. Therefore, uniformity in size and composition of PtCo nanoparticles was achieved. TEMEDX could give a smaller analytical region but was not performed here. In previous work
[21]
, TEMEDX was performed on PtRu nanoparticles prepared by the same two-microemulsion technique. A homogeneous composition was also confirmed in that study.

3.2. Electrocatalytic properties as a function of Pt:Co ratio
To study the effect of PtCo composition on the electrocatalytic performance, we prepared carbon cloth electrodes loaded with PtCo nanoparticles of different compositions but with the same loading of Pt. The electrodes with different PtCo compositions were tested for methanol oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte.
Fig. 2
shows the typical cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the electrodes with different Pt:Co ratios. The PtCo/C nanoparticle electrodes were prepared in the same manner with a platinum loading of 0.49 mg Pt/cm2. The electrolyte was 1 M KOH containing 1 M CH3OH. The best performance was observed in the electrode with a 1:0.5 atomic ratio of Pt:Co. The oxidation of methanol commences below 585 mV and reaches a peak of 235 mA/cm2 at 350 mV. The characteristic CV parameters of the different electrodes including the onset potential, peak potential Ep, the half peak potential Ep/2, and peak current density jp are tabulated in
Table 4
. To determine the onset potential, an onset oxidation current of 0.010 mA/cm2 was chosen arbitrarily. An anodic peak is observed in the reverse scan of some electrodes. The occurrence of a reverse anodic peak is generally accepted as the reduction and regeneration of the platinum oxide formed during the forward scan. From the cyclic voltammograms, the electrodes with low Co content (Pt:Co < 1:1) outperform those with high Co content ( Pt:Co > 1:1), while all Pt/Co electrodes are better than the pure Pt electrode. Comparing the onset potentials of the low Pt:Co ratio electrodes, the order of electrocatalytic performance is 1:0.5 > 1:0.25 > 1:0.75. Among the high Co content electrodes, the activity is very similar and not as good as the low Co content electrodes. The 1:0.5 atomic ratio of Pt:Co is clearly the best at low potentials. But at high potentials, the other low Co ratio electrodes, 1:0.75 and 1:0.25 have similar activity. The potential dependent activity may possibly be explained by a mechanism in which two or more reactions steps are differently affected by potential. The complete electrochemical oxidation of methanol involves the transfer of six electrons, which cannot be achieved in a single step. In alkaline media, the generally accepted mechanism

consists of initial steps of dehydrogenation to form formaldehyde or adsorbed CHO,

A comparison of steady-state currents was also made by current step experiments.
Fig. 3
shows the chronopotentiograms at 20 mA/cm2 for methanol oxidation at room temperature on electrodes with different Pt:Co ratios. In agreement with the transient CV results, the 1:0.5 atomic ratio of Pt:Co alloy shows the best performance with the highest catalytic activity of all the composition investigated. The order of activity is 1:0.5 > 1:0.75 > 1:0.25 > 1:3 > 1:2 > 1:1 > 1:0 in atomic ratios of Pt:Co. The electrode with pure Pt nanoparticles could not sustain a steady-state current at 20 mA/cm2 and appeared to be significantly poisoned by CO, the likely reaction product. Steady-state currents in a wider potential range were obtained by controlled potential experiments. The polarization curves of various electrodes are shown in
Fig. 4
for the electrodes with various ratios of Pt:Co nanoparticles supported on carbon. The steady-state current was measured 5 min after imposing the potential step. Based on the electrochemical experiments, it can be concluded that a 1:0.5 atomic ratio of Pt to Co nanoparticle alloy provides the best activity of the different Pt/Co compositions prepared with the same Pt loading.

In addition to the possible enhancement of formaldehyde oxidation by cobalt, the better performance of PtCo nanoparticles could have been due to changes in lattice structures or the electronic properties of the PtCo mixed metal nanoparticles. To investigate this, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were performed on nanoparticles of different Pt:Co ratios.
3.3. X-ray powder diffraction characterization of PtCo nanoparticles
X-ray powder diffraction was performed to analyze the structures of the platinumcobalt nanoparticles supported on carbon. The XRD results are displayed in
Fig. 5
for 2θ values of 2090. The patterns of pure Pt on carbon and pure Co on carbon are also shown in
Fig. 5
(curves a and h). Pure Pt has a face-centered-cubic structure (fcc) while pure Co has a hexagonal-closed-packed (hcp) structure. From the XRD spectra, the PtCo nanoparticles appeared to be polycrystalline and had less prominent diffraction peaks. The structures are, however, closer to the peaks of an fcc structure of Pt (curve a) with no obvious peaks related to those of the pure cobalt hcp structure (curve h). The fcc peaks in the PtCo nanoparticles (curves bg) are at slightly higher 2θ angles than those of pure Pt (curve a), indicating a decrease in the fcc lattice constant. This decrease in the lattice constant of the PtCo nanoparticles is due to the incorporation of Co atoms into the Pt fcc structure. The 2θ shift increases with the Co content and is roughly proportional to the atomic ratio of platinum and cobalt as indicated by Vegards law
[28]
,
[29]
. This shift, however, is not exactly linear, perhaps also due to the variable amounts of cobalt oxides present. The small changes in lattice spacing of the PtCo alloy could play a role to enhance some steps in the mechanism

in terms of adsorption of intermediates, e.g. OHad or the electronic binding energy of Pt and Co. A cobalt (II) oxide XRD peak is vaguely evident in the spectra of a few samples (e.g. curve e) but not in others (e.g. curves c and g). This oxides was probably formed during the heating at 500 C and the amount of oxide could depend on the Pt:Co ratio. Heating in nitrogen would be a better procedure to avoid this complication. However, in the XPS experiments to be discussed, cobalt (II) oxides were also observed while the samples were not heated to 500 C. Nevertheless, the XRD characterization provided some information about the structure of the PtCo alloys.

3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of PtCo nanoparticles
To investigate the oxidation states and possible changes of binding energies in different PtCo compositions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were performed. The samples for XPS, however, were supported on Vulcan 72 XC, rather than on the carbon cloth electrodes used in the electrochemical experiments. No heat treatment on the PtCo/C samples was needed.
Fig. 6
,
Fig. 7
show the typical XPS spectra for the binding energies of Pt and Co for one Pt:Co ratio. The spectra for different PtCo compositions are similar but with different shifts and intensities of peaks. In the Pt section shown in
Fig. 6
, the two peaks correspond to Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 states of metallic Pt0. There are minor discrepancies in the reference values of metallic Pt0. Ref.
[30]
gives 70.75 and 74.08 eV for the two peaks where as
[7]
reports values of 71.2 and 74.53 eV. A shoulder region at 7678 eV can be attributed to oxides of Pt. The values from
[30]
are 72.95, 75.49 eV for PtII and 74.35, 77.47 eV for PtIV. The Pt4f spectrum was de-convoluted into six separate peaks, two of each from Pt0, PtII and PtIV, and the re-combined curve fitted the original spectrum. The results of the shifts in the various peaks in the optimized fitting are shown in

for the various Pt:Co ratios, whereas the relative amounts of oxides are shown in

There has been some evidence for a change in the electronic structure of Pt when it was alloyed with Co. Shukla et al.
[9]
studied the electronic structure of Vulcan XC-72 supported PtCo(1:0.72) alloys by XPS and reported a negative shift in the 4f7/2 signal of the Pt0 species, compared with that of pure platinum. On the other hand, Toda et al.
[8]
reported a positive shift in the Pt 4f7/2 binding energy for several compositions of PtCo bulk alloys. We have also attempted to fit the XPS spectra optimized with shifts of the peaks. The resulting shifts are small and can be either negative or positive, depending on the Pt:Co ratio. Plotting the shifts in Pt4f XPS peaks versus the Pt:Co ratio in
Fig. 8
, it can be observed that the 1:0.5 Pt:Co ratio has the lowest values of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 binding energies. To investigate the correlation of the catalytic properties of PtCo nanoparticles to their electronic properties as a function of Pt:Co ratio, the steady-state currents at several potentials in
Fig. 5
are re-plotted in
Fig. 9
as a function of PtCo composition. To avoid a possible complication of mass-transfer effects, only steady-state currents at low operating potentials are selected for comparison. From
Fig. 9
, enhanced activity is clearly shown for Pt:Co ratios between 1:0.25 and 1:0.75 with the best at 1:0.5. In the same range of PtCo compositions, lower Pt 4f binding energies are shown in
Fig. 8
. Since the 1:0.5 Pt:Co ratio (electrode c) had the highest electrochemical activity, particularly at low potential (
Fig. 3
), the low binding energy of Pt4f may be correlated to the dehydrogenation steps of reaction
(1)
. The Pt 4f5/2 spectra have a shoulder region indicating the presence of platinum oxides. From
Table 6
, the total amount of platinum oxides (II and IV) varied from 27% to 38%. No correlation can be observed between the amount of platinum oxide determined by the Pt 4f5/2 XPS spectra and the relative electrochemical activity in various PtCo alloys. Since the platinum oxide can be reduced to platinum electrochemically, as is shown in the reverse scan of the cyclic voltammogram in
Fig. 3(a)
, it will not be meaningful to correlate the activity to the exact amount of platinum oxide. The XPS spectra were obtained for PtCo nanoparticles supported on Vulcan 72 XC powder, whereas the electrochemical activity was determined on PtCo nanoparticles supported on carbon cloth. The effect of the difference of the carbon support carbon on the electronic properties or activity has not been investigated here. The effect of the difference in carbon support, however, would be secondary to the difference in metal composition and metalmetal interaction. Our synthetic procedure to control the size of the nanoparticles and the composition uniformly, can help to reduce errors induced by discrepancies in size and composition.

In
Fig. 7
, the XPS section of Co 2p has several peaks and shoulders. In the literature
[9]
,
[30]
,
[31]
, there are some small discrepancies in the reference peaks for the various oxidations of cobalt. We have adopted the values from
[30]
,
[31]
with 778.3, 793.27 eV for Co0, 780.4, 795.8 eV for Co2+ and 778.5, 794.2 eV for Co3+. In addition, there are reference values of 784.2, 787.9 and 802.8 eV for the satellite shake up peaks of Co2+ and Co3+. Using the fixed values of these peaks, the spectra can be de-convoluted into nine separate peaks corresponding to Co0, Co2+ and Co3+. From the fitting of the XPS Co spectra, the relative amounts of Co0, Co2+ and Co3+ are determined and shown in
Table 7
. It can be seen that the cobalt was present mostly as Co2+. As the Pt/Co nanoparticles still retain the fcc structure of Pt, the higher oxidation state cobalt atoms are likely to be concentrated on the surface of the nanoparticles without forming a lattice. This can also explain the absence of a CoO peak in many of the XRD curves in
Fig. 5
, whereas cobalt oxides are observed in XPS data.

and the adsorption of carbonate and bicarbonate on the electrode surface reduced the extent of OH adsorption and caused a significant decrease in the methanol overall oxidation activity
[24]
. These observations suggested the presence of other oxygen-containing species such as cobalt oxides in alkaline media to be important. In the light of the bi-functional mechanism, Pt and its electronic character will affect mostly the CH cleavage occurring at a low overpotential. The role of Co or its oxides is likely to play the role of OHad and contribute to the removal of CO at higher potentials, as shown in reaction

With a complex methanol oxidation mechanism involving multiple steps and intermediates, the effects of composition on other intermediates and possible reaction steps remain unclear. Other contributing factors may include the changes in surface structure, surface Gibbs energy, specific methanol interaction with the surface atoms, geometrical considerations like the interatomic spacing in the alloy and its work function. The results here identified two possible correlations between electrocatalytic activity and the PtCo composition. The alloying of Co atoms to Pt lowers the electronic binding energy in Pt and favors the CH cleavage reaction at low potential. The presence of cobalt oxides provides an oxygen source for CO oxidation at high potential. The two combined considerations lead to an optimum Pt:Co ratio determined to be about 1:0.5. The electroactivity is determined by the overall current of a complex electrochemical reaction. Further investigations are needed to decipher the activity enhancement effect in each individual step of the oxidation mechanism. The present study shows that composition and size control of the microemulsion method allows characterization and activity studies to be performed at the nanoparticle level.
4. Conclusions
The synthesis of platinumcobalt nanoparticles from w/o microemulsions of water/Triton X-100/propanol-2/cyclohexane (w/o) allowed good control of the composition of the nanoparticles for convenient investigations of catalytic properties. XPS analysis indicated the presence of shifts in the binding energies of Pt for different Pt:Co ratios of the nanoparticles. Electrocatalytic activities of binary PtCo nanoparticles for methanol oxidation revealed an optimum ratio of 1:0.5 in Pt:Co. The changes in activities versus the Pt:Co ratio can be correlated roughly to the changes in electronic properties of platinum and the presence of cobalt oxides.
