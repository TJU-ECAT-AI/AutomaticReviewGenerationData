[1] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

[2] "As example of the commercial catalysts, a reference sample, containing the same total amount of noble metals, was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Pd- and Pt-containing salts on a silicaalumina by Engelhard, according to a widely claimed industrial patent"

The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used to prepare the Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay supports. This method involves exchanging metal salts with the support material.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: Used to prepare a reference Pd/Pt catalyst on silica-alumina support. This is described as a common commercial method.

The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. However, it can be inferred that ion exchange was chosen for the pillared clay catalysts, possibly due to the nature of the support material. The incipient wetness method is described as widely used commercially, suggesting it may have advantages in industrial applications.

The efficacy of the catalysts produced by these methods is not directly compared in the given text. To fully answer this question, more information from other sources would be needed to compare the advantages and applications of these synthesis methods.

文献提到了两种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 离子交换法：用于制备粘土支撑的Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。这种方法涉及金属盐与支撑材料之间的离子交换。

2. 浸渍法：用于制备硅铝支撑的参考Pd/Pt催化剂。这被描述为一种常见的商业方法。

文章并未对这些方法在优势、应用和整体效能方面进行全面比较。但可以推断，选择离子交换法制备柱状粘土催化剂可能是由于支撑材料的特性。浸渍法被描述为广泛应用于商业生产，表明它在工业应用中可能具有优势。

文中没有直接比较这些方法所产生的催化剂的效能。要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取更多信息，以比较这些合成方法的优势和应用。
