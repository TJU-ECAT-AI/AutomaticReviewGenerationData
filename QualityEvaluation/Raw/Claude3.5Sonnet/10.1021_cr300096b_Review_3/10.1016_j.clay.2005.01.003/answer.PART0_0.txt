[1] "A total of 2.000 g of NH4+PILC (60120 mesh) was added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing 0.037 g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O. The mixture was stirred for 96 h at r.t., and then washed with distilled water till Cl ions disappearance."

[2] "A total of 2.000 g of NH4+PILC (60120 mesh) was added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing 0.036 g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of HAuCl4. The catalyst preparation was then carried out as described in the previous sample."

The literature mentions three synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used for preparing Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay support. This involves adding the support to an aqueous solution of metal precursors, stirring for an extended period, washing, drying, and heat treatment.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: Used for preparing a reference Pd/Pt catalyst on silica-alumina support. This is described as a common commercial method.

3. Pillaring: Used to prepare the pillared clay support itself, though not directly for depositing the metal catalysts.

The ion exchange method appears advantageous for achieving high metal dispersion on the clay support. Incipient wetness impregnation is noted as an industrial standard, likely due to its simplicity and scalability. The choice of method impacts metal distribution and interaction with the support, which can affect catalyst performance. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison of the efficacy of these methods.

文献中提到了三种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 离子交换法：用于在柱撑粘土载体上制备Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。这种方法涉及将载体加入金属前驱体的水溶液中，长时间搅拌，洗涤，干燥和热处理。

2. 浸渍法：用于在硅铝载体上制备参考Pd/Pt催化剂。这被描述为一种常见的商业方法。

3. 柱撑法：用于制备柱撑粘土载体本身，而不是直接用于沉积金属催化剂。

离子交换法似乎有利于在粘土载体上实现高度金属分散。浸渍法被认为是工业标准，可能是由于其简单性和可扩展性。方法的选择会影响金属的分布和与载体的相互作用，从而影响催化剂的性能。然而，文献并未直接比较这些方法的效果。
