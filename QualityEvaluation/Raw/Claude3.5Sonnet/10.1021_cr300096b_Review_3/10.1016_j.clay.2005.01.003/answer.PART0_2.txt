[1] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

[2] "A total of 2.000 g of NH4+PILC (60120 mesh) was added to a 170 mL aqueous solution containing 0.037 g of [Pd(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O and 0.009 g of [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2*H2O. The mixture was stirred for 96 h at r.t., and then washed with distilled water till Cl ions disappearance."

[3] "As example of the commercial catalysts, a reference sample, containing the same total amount of noble metals, was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Pd- and Pt-containing salts on a silicaalumina by Engelhard, according to a widely claimed industrial patent"

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: This method was used to prepare the Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay supports. It involves adding the support material to an aqueous solution containing metal salts, stirring for an extended period, washing, drying, and then reducing the metals.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: This method was mentioned for preparing a reference catalyst on silica-alumina support. It is described as a widely used industrial method.

The ion exchange method may offer advantages in achieving a more uniform dispersion of metal particles throughout the support structure, as the metal ions can access the interlayer spaces of the clay. This could potentially lead to better catalyst performance. However, it is a more time-consuming process compared to impregnation.

Incipient wetness impregnation is likely faster and easier to scale up for industrial production, which may explain its widespread use. However, it may not achieve the same level of metal dispersion as ion exchange, especially for layered supports like clays.

The efficacy of these methods would depend on the specific application and desired catalyst properties. The study focuses on using these catalysts for hydrotreatment reactions, suggesting both methods can produce effective catalysts for this purpose. However, a direct comparison of their efficacy is not provided in the given literature.

该文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 离子交换法：该方法用于在柱撑粘土载体上制备Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。它涉及将载体材料加入含有金属盐的水溶液中，长时间搅拌，洗涤，干燥，然后还原金属。

2. 浸渍法：这种方法被提及用于在硅铝载体上制备参比催化剂。它被描述为一种广泛使用的工业方法。

离子交换法可能在实现金属颗粒在载体结构中更均匀分散方面具有优势，因为金属离子可以进入粘土的层间空间。这可能会带来更好的催化剂性能。然而，与浸渍法相比，它是一个更耗时的过程。

浸渍法可能更快，更容易扩大到工业生产规模，这可能解释了它的广泛使用。但是，它可能无法达到与离子交换相同水平的金属分散，特别是对于像粘土这样的层状载体。

这些方法的效果取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂特性。该研究侧重于将这些催化剂用于加氢处理反应，表明两种方法都可以为此目的生产有效的催化剂。然而，在给定的文献中没有提供它们效果的直接比较。
