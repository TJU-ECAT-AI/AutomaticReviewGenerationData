The literature describes two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used for the PILC-supported catalysts (CAT1 and CAT2). This involves adding the support to an aqueous solution of metal salts, stirring for an extended period, washing, drying, and heat treatment.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: Used for the reference commercial catalyst. This involves impregnating the support with a solution of metal salts.

The ion exchange method may offer better metal dispersion and stronger metal-support interactions, which can be advantageous for catalytic activity and stability. It is particularly suitable for supports with ion exchange capacity like clays. 

The incipient wetness method is simpler and widely used industrially. It allows for precise control of metal loading but may result in larger metal particles.

Both methods can produce effective catalysts, but the choice depends on the specific support, metals, and desired catalyst properties. The study demonstrates that both methods can create active catalysts for hydrotreatment reactions.

该文献描述了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法:

1. 离子交换法:用于PILC负载的催化剂(CAT1和CAT2)。这种方法包括将载体加入金属盐的水溶液中,长时间搅拌,洗涤,干燥和热处理。

2. 等体积浸渍法:用于参比商业催化剂。这种方法包括用金属盐溶液浸渍载体。

离子交换法可能提供更好的金属分散性和更强的金属-载体相互作用,这对催化活性和稳定性有利。它特别适用于具有离子交换能力的载体,如粘土。

等体积浸渍法更简单,在工业上广泛使用。它允许精确控制金属负载量,但可能导致较大的金属颗粒。

这两种方法都能产生有效的催化剂,但选择取决于特定的载体、金属和所需的催化剂性能。该研究表明,这两种方法都可以制备用于加氢处理反应的活性催化剂。
