[1] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

[2] "As example of the commercial catalysts, a reference sample, containing the same total amount of noble metals, was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Pd- and Pt-containing salts on a silicaalumina by Engelhard, according to a widely claimed industrial patent"

The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used to prepare the Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay supports. This method involves exchanging metal salts with the support material.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: Used to prepare a reference Pd/Pt catalyst on silica-alumina support. This is described as a common commercial method.

The document does not provide enough information to comprehensively compare these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. However, it suggests that ion exchange may be suitable for preparing noble metal catalysts on pillared clay supports, while incipient wetness impregnation is a widely used industrial method for silica-alumina supports. The choice of method likely depends on the specific support material and desired catalyst properties.

文献提到了两种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 离子交换法：用于在柱撑粘土载体上制备Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。这种方法涉及金属盐与载体材料的交换。

2. 浸渍法：用于在硅铝载体上制备参比Pd/Pt催化剂。这被描述为一种常见的商业方法。

文献并未提供足够的信息来全面比较这些方法在优势、应用和整体效率方面的差异。然而，它暗示离子交换法可能适用于在柱撑粘土载体上制备贵金属催化剂，而浸渍法是硅铝载体广泛使用的工业方法。方法的选择可能取决于特定的载体材料和所需的催化剂性能。
