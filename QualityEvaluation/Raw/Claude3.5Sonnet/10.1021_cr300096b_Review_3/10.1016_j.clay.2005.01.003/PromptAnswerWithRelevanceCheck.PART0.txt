The literature mentions three synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used for preparing Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay support. This involves adding the support to an aqueous solution of metal precursors, stirring for an extended period, washing, drying, and heat treatment.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: Used for preparing a reference Pd/Pt catalyst on silica-alumina support. This is described as a common commercial method.

3. Pillaring: Used to prepare the pillared clay support itself, though not directly for depositing the metal catalysts.

The ion exchange method appears advantageous for achieving high metal dispersion on the clay support. Incipient wetness impregnation is noted as an industrial standard, likely due to its simplicity and scalability. The choice of method impacts metal distribution and interaction with the support, which can affect catalyst performance. However, the literature does not provide a direct comparison of the efficacy of these methods.

文献中提到了三种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 离子交换法：用于在柱撑粘土载体上制备Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。这种方法涉及将载体加入金属前驱体的水溶液中，长时间搅拌，洗涤，干燥和热处理。

2. 浸渍法：用于在硅铝载体上制备参考Pd/Pt催化剂。这被描述为一种常见的商业方法。

3. 柱撑法：用于制备柱撑粘土载体本身，而不是直接用于沉积金属催化剂。

离子交换法似乎有利于在粘土载体上实现高度金属分散。浸渍法被认为是工业标准，可能是由于其简单性和可扩展性。方法的选择会影响金属的分布和与载体的相互作用，从而影响催化剂的性能。然而，文献并未直接比较这些方法的效果。

[1] "The active noble metals were then supported by ion exchange with the appropriate metal salts, to obtain the 1.0 wt.% final catalysts: Pd/Pt=5.0 atomic ratio (a.r.) (CAT1) and Pd/Au=5.0 a.r. (CAT2)."

The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used to prepare the Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay supports. This method involves exchanging metal salts with the support material.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: Used to prepare a reference Pd/Pt catalyst on silica-alumina support. This is described as a common commercial method.

The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. However, it can be inferred that ion exchange was chosen for the pillared clay catalysts, possibly due to the nature of the support material. The incipient wetness method is described as widely used commercially, suggesting it may have advantages in industrial applications.

The efficacy of the catalysts produced by these methods is not directly compared in the given text. To fully answer this question, more information from other sources would be needed to compare the advantages and applications of these synthesis methods.

文献提到了两种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 离子交换法：用于制备粘土支撑的Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。这种方法涉及金属盐与支撑材料之间的离子交换。

2. 浸渍法：用于制备硅铝支撑的参考Pd/Pt催化剂。这被描述为一种常见的商业方法。

文章并未对这些方法在优势、应用和整体效能方面进行全面比较。但可以推断，选择离子交换法制备柱状粘土催化剂可能是由于支撑材料的特性。浸渍法被描述为广泛应用于商业生产，表明它在工业应用中可能具有优势。

文中没有直接比较这些方法所产生的催化剂的效能。要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取更多信息，以比较这些合成方法的优势和应用。

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: This method was used to prepare the Pd/Pt and Pd/Au catalysts on pillared clay supports. It involves adding the support material to an aqueous solution containing metal salts, stirring for an extended period, washing, drying, and then reducing the metals.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: This method was mentioned for preparing a reference catalyst on silica-alumina support. It is described as a widely used industrial method.

The ion exchange method may offer advantages in achieving a more uniform dispersion of metal particles throughout the support structure, as the metal ions can access the interlayer spaces of the clay. This could potentially lead to better catalyst performance. However, it is a more time-consuming process compared to impregnation.

Incipient wetness impregnation is likely faster and easier to scale up for industrial production, which may explain its widespread use. However, it may not achieve the same level of metal dispersion as ion exchange, especially for layered supports like clays.

The efficacy of these methods would depend on the specific application and desired catalyst properties. The study focuses on using these catalysts for hydrotreatment reactions, suggesting both methods can produce effective catalysts for this purpose. However, a direct comparison of their efficacy is not provided in the given literature.

该文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 离子交换法：该方法用于在柱撑粘土载体上制备Pd/Pt和Pd/Au催化剂。它涉及将载体材料加入含有金属盐的水溶液中，长时间搅拌，洗涤，干燥，然后还原金属。

2. 浸渍法：这种方法被提及用于在硅铝载体上制备参比催化剂。它被描述为一种广泛使用的工业方法。

离子交换法可能在实现金属颗粒在载体结构中更均匀分散方面具有优势，因为金属离子可以进入粘土的层间空间。这可能会带来更好的催化剂性能。然而，与浸渍法相比，它是一个更耗时的过程。

浸渍法可能更快，更容易扩大到工业生产规模，这可能解释了它的广泛使用。但是，它可能无法达到与离子交换相同水平的金属分散，特别是对于像粘土这样的层状载体。

这些方法的效果取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂特性。该研究侧重于将这些催化剂用于加氢处理反应，表明两种方法都可以为此目的生产有效的催化剂。然而，在给定的文献中没有提供它们效果的直接比较。

The literature describes two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Ion exchange: Used for the PILC-supported catalysts (CAT1 and CAT2). This involves adding the support to an aqueous solution of metal salts, stirring for an extended period, washing, drying, and heat treatment.

2. Incipient wetness impregnation: Used for the reference commercial catalyst. This involves impregnating the support with a solution of metal salts.

The ion exchange method may offer better metal dispersion and stronger metal-support interactions, which can be advantageous for catalytic activity and stability. It is particularly suitable for supports with ion exchange capacity like clays. 

The incipient wetness method is simpler and widely used industrially. It allows for precise control of metal loading but may result in larger metal particles.

Both methods can produce effective catalysts, but the choice depends on the specific support, metals, and desired catalyst properties. The study demonstrates that both methods can create active catalysts for hydrotreatment reactions.

2. 等体积浸渍法:用于参比商业催化剂。这种方法包括用金属盐溶液浸渍载体。

离子交换法可能提供更好的金属分散性和更强的金属-载体相互作用,这对催化活性和稳定性有利。它特别适用于具有离子交换能力的载体,如粘土。

等体积浸渍法更简单,在工业上广泛使用。它允许精确控制金属负载量,但可能导致较大的金属颗粒。

这两种方法都能产生有效的催化剂,但选择取决于特定的载体、金属和所需的催化剂性能。该研究表明,这两种方法都可以制备用于加氢处理反应的活性催化剂。
