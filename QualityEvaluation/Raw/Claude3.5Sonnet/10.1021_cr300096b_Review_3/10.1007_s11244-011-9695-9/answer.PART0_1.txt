The most commonly used synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which can be done via co-impregnation or sequential addition of metal salts. However, this method often results in catalysts with unclear structures and non-uniform distributions of metals.

In contrast, colloidal chemical synthesis strategies allow for more precise control over nanoparticle size and composition. This enables the creation of well-defined model catalyst systems that can be studied using various in situ characterization techniques. The colloidal method provides advantages in terms of producing uniform, composition-controlled bimetallic nanoparticles.

Both methods have their applications, but colloidal synthesis offers greater control for fundamental studies. Incipient wetness may be more widely used industrially due to its simplicity, while colloidal methods are better suited for model catalyst systems in academic research. The efficacy depends on the specific application, with colloidal synthesis being more effective for creating uniform, well-defined nanoparticles for mechanistic studies.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是浸渍法,可以通过共浸渍或金属盐的连续添加来完成。然而,这种方法通常会产生结构不清晰、金属分布不均匀的催化剂。

相比之下,胶体化学合成策略可以更精确地控制纳米粒子的大小和成分。这使得能够创建明确定义的模型催化剂系统,可以使用各种原位表征技术进行研究。胶体法在生产均匀、成分可控的双金属纳米粒子方面具有优势。

这两种方法都有其应用,但胶体合成为基础研究提供了更大的控制性。浸渍法由于其简单性可能在工业上更广泛使用,而胶体法更适合于学术研究中的模型催化剂系统。效力取决于具体应用,胶体合成在创建用于机理研究的均匀、明确定义的纳米粒子方面更有效。
