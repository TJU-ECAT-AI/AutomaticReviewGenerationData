[1] "Typically studies of catalysts of this type have been prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using either co-impregnation or sequential addition of salts of the two metals [6, 10]."

[2] "Here, size- and composition-controlled synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles with composition down to a Pt:Co ratio of 1:10 allows exploration of a well-defined system catalytically and with a range of in situ characterization techniques."

[3] "Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading)."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Incipient wetness impregnation, using either co-impregnation or sequential addition of metal salts. This is a traditional method widely used in catalyst preparation.

2. Colloidal chemical synthesis of size- and composition-controlled nanoparticles, followed by deposition onto a support material. This allows for more precise control over particle size and composition.

3. Direct deposition of pre-synthesized nanoparticles onto porous supports like mesoporous silica.

The colloidal synthesis method offers advantages in terms of control over particle size and composition, allowing for well-defined model catalyst systems. This enables more detailed characterization and mechanistic studies. However, it may be more complex and costly than simple impregnation methods.

Incipient wetness impregnation is simpler and more widely used in industrial applications, but offers less control over the final catalyst structure. It may result in a less uniform distribution of metals.

The choice of method depends on the specific application and research goals. Colloidal methods are advantageous for fundamental studies, while impregnation may be preferred for large-scale production. Overall, the efficacy depends on the particular catalyst system and reaction being studied.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍法，使用共浸渍或金属盐的序贯添加。这是催化剂制备中广泛使用的传统方法。

2. 尺寸和成分可控的纳米粒子的胶体化学合成，然后沉积到载体材料上。这种方法可以更精确地控制粒子尺寸和成分。

3. 将预先合成的纳米粒子直接沉积到多孔载体（如介孔二氧化硅）上。

胶体合成方法在控制粒子尺寸和成分方面具有优势，可以制备出结构明确的模型催化剂体系。这使得更详细的表征和机理研究成为可能。然而，与简单的浸渍方法相比，它可能更复杂且成本更高。

浸渍法更简单，在工业应用中更广泛使用，但对最终催化剂结构的控制较少。它可能导致金属分布不太均匀。

方法的选择取决于具体的应用和研究目标。胶体方法有利于基础研究，而浸渍法可能更适合大规模生产。总的来说，效果取决于特定的催化剂体系和所研究的反应。
