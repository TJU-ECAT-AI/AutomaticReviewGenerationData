The most commonly used synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which can be done either by co-impregnation or sequential addition of metal salts. However, this method often results in catalysts with unclear structures and non-uniform distributions of metals.

In contrast, the study presents a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy that allows for more precise control over nanoparticle size and composition. This method produces well-defined bimetallic nanoparticles with known structures, making them useful as model catalysts for gaining atomic-level insights.

The colloidal synthesis approach offers advantages in terms of producing uniform, composition-controlled nanoparticles that can be thoroughly characterized. It is particularly effective for creating model catalyst systems for fundamental studies. However, incipient wetness methods may still be preferred for large-scale industrial catalyst production due to their simplicity and scalability.

Overall, the choice of synthesis method depends on the specific application and research goals. Incipient wetness is widely used but produces less controlled structures, while colloidal methods offer better control but may be more complex to implement at scale.

最常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法，可以通过共浸渍或金属盐的顺序添加来完成。然而，这种方法通常会产生结构不清晰、金属分布不均匀的催化剂。

相比之下，该研究提出了一种胶体化学合成策略，可以更精确地控制纳米粒子的尺寸和成分。这种方法生产具有已知结构的明确双金属纳米粒子，使其成为获得原子级见解的有用模型催化剂。

胶体合成方法在生产均匀、成分可控的纳米粒子方面具有优势，这些纳米粒子可以被彻底表征。它特别适合创建基础研究的模型催化剂系统。然而，由于简单性和可扩展性，浸渍法在大规模工业催化剂生产中可能仍然是首选。

总的来说，合成方法的选择取决于具体应用和研究目标。浸渍法被广泛使用，但产生的结构控制性较差，而胶体方法提供更好的控制，但在大规模实施时可能更为复杂。
