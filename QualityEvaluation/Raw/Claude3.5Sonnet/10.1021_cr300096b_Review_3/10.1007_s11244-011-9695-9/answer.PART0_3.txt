The most common synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts mentioned is incipient wetness impregnation, using either co-impregnation or sequential addition of metal salts. However, the study also describes a more controlled approach using colloidal synthesis of nanoparticles followed by deposition onto a support material. 

The incipient wetness method is widely used but can result in less control over particle size and composition. The colloidal synthesis approach allows for better control of nanoparticle size and composition before supporting them. This enables creation of more well-defined model catalysts for fundamental studies.

The controlled synthesis method has advantages for research purposes, allowing systematic exploration of size and composition effects. However, incipient wetness may be more practical for large-scale production. Overall, the choice of method depends on the specific application and whether precise control or ease of scaling is more important.

文中提到的最常见的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法,可以采用共浸渍或金属盐的序贯添加。但是,该研究还描述了一种更可控的方法,即胶体合成纳米粒子然后沉积到载体材料上。

浸渍法使用广泛,但对粒径和成分的控制较差。胶体合成方法可以在将纳米粒子负载到载体之前更好地控制其尺寸和成分。这使得可以创造出更明确定义的模型催化剂用于基础研究。

可控合成方法在研究目的上有优势,允许系统地探索尺寸和成分效应。然而,浸渍法可能更适合大规模生产。总的来说,方法的选择取决于具体应用,以及是精确控制还是易于放大更为重要。
