          [1] "Typically studies of catalysts of this type have been prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using either co-impregnation or sequential addition of salts of the two metals [6, 10]."

[2] "Here, size- and composition-controlled synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles with composition down to a Pt:Co ratio of 1:10 allows exploration of a well-defined system catalytically and with a range of in situ characterization techniques."

[3] "All synthesis was carried out using standard Schlenk techniques under an Ar atmosphere using a colloidal chemical synthesis strategy as follows."

[4] "Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading)."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Incipient wetness impregnation: This traditional method involves either co-impregnation or sequential addition of metal salts. It is widely used in industrial applications due to its simplicity and scalability, but offers less control over the final catalyst structure and may result in a less uniform distribution of metals.

2. Colloidal chemical synthesis: This method allows for size- and composition-controlled synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles. It offers better control over particle size and composition, enabling the creation of well-defined model catalyst systems. The synthesized nanoparticles are then deposited onto a support material.

3. Direct deposition: Pre-synthesized nanoparticles are directly deposited onto porous supports like mesoporous silica.

Comparison of methods:

- Advantages: Colloidal synthesis offers precise control over particle size and composition, making it ideal for fundamental studies and in-situ characterization. Incipient wetness impregnation is simpler and more suitable for large-scale production.

- Applications: Colloidal methods are preferred in research contexts where precise control and characterization are crucial. Incipient wetness is more commonly used in industrial settings.

- Efficacy: The choice of method depends on the specific application, research goals, and whether precise control or ease of scaling is more important. Colloidal synthesis is more effective for creating uniform, well-defined nanoparticles for mechanistic studies, while incipient wetness may be more practical for large-scale catalyst production.

          支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括：

1. 浸渍法：这种传统方法涉及共浸渍或金属盐的序贯添加。由于其简单性和可扩展性，它在工业应用中被广泛使用，但对最终催化剂结构的控制较少，可能导致金属分布不太均匀。

2. 胶体化学合成：这种方法允许尺寸和成分可控的双金属纳米粒子合成。它可以更好地控制粒子尺寸和成分，能够创建结构明确的模型催化剂系统。合成的纳米粒子随后被沉积到载体材料上。

3. 直接沉积：将预先合成的纳米粒子直接沉积到多孔载体（如介孔二氧化硅）上。

方法比较：

- 优势：胶体合成对粒子尺寸和成分的控制更精确，非常适合基础研究和原位表征。浸渍法更简单，更适合大规模生产。

- 应用：在精确控制和表征至关重要的研究环境中，胶体方法更受青睐。浸渍法在工业环境中更常用。

- 效力：方法的选择取决于具体应用、研究目标以及是精确控制还是易于放大更为重要。胶体合成在创建用于机理研究的均匀、明确定义的纳米粒子方面更有效，而浸渍法可能更适合大规模催化剂生产。
