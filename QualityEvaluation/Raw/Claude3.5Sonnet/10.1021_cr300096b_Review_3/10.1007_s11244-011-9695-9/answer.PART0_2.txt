[1] "Typically studies of catalysts of this type have been prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using either co-impregnation or sequential addition of salts of the two metals"

[2] "Here, size- and composition-controlled synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles with composition down to a Pt:Co ratio of 1:10 allows exploration of a well-defined system catalytically and with a range of in situ characterization techniques."

[3] "Nanoparticles were subsequently supported with a nominal 5 weight % Co loading in mesoporous silica, MCF-17 (in the samples containing 50% Pt, the Co concentration was reduced to a nominal 2.5% to avoid a dramatic variation in overall metal loading)."

The most commonly used synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is incipient wetness impregnation, which can be done through co-impregnation or sequential addition of metal salts. However, the literature also describes a more controlled approach using colloidal synthesis of bimetallic nanoparticles followed by deposition onto a support material.

The incipient wetness method is widely used due to its simplicity and scalability. However, it often results in less control over particle size and composition distribution.

The colloidal synthesis approach allows for better control of nanoparticle size and composition, enabling the creation of well-defined model catalyst systems. This method is particularly useful for fundamental studies and in-situ characterization, as it provides more uniform and predictable catalyst structures.

Both methods have their applications, with incipient wetness being more commonly used in industrial settings, while the colloidal approach is favored in research contexts where precise control and characterization are crucial. The choice between methods depends on the specific requirements of the application and the level of structural control needed.

最常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是浸渍法,可以通过共浸渍或金属盐的顺序添加来完成。然而,文献还描述了一种更可控的方法,即通过胶体合成双金属纳米颗粒,然后将其沉积在载体材料上。

浸渍法因其简单性和可扩展性而被广泛使用。然而,它通常对粒径和成分分布的控制较差。

胶体合成方法允许更好地控制纳米颗粒的尺寸和成分,能够创建定义明确的模型催化剂系统。这种方法特别适用于基础研究和原位表征,因为它提供了更均匀和可预测的催化剂结构。

这两种方法都有其应用领域,浸渍法在工业环境中更常用,而胶体法在精确控制和表征至关重要的研究环境中更受青睐。方法的选择取决于应用的具体要求和所需的结构控制水平。
