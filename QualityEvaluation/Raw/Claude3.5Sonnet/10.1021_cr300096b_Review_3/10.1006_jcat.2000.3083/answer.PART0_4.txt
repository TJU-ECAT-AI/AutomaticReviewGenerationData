[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."

[2] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and, in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."

[3] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are chemical methods, which include techniques like incipient wetness impregnation. However, these methods have limitations in controlling the size, structure, and composition of the bimetallic particles.

The laser vaporization technique is presented as an alternative method that offers several advantages:

1. It produces ligand-free metal clusters.
2. For bimetallic systems, it creates particles with a composition identical to the vaporized alloy target.
3. It yields bimetallic clusters with remarkably uniform composition.
4. The clusters are formed before deposition, ensuring compositional uniformity.

The laser vaporization method is more effective in producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts compared to chemical methods. It allows for better control over particle composition and uniformity, making it easier to study the effects of alloying on reactivity. This technique is particularly useful for creating model catalysts and studying fundamental aspects of bimetallic systems.

While the document doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of all synthesis methods, it highlights the advantages of laser vaporization over traditional chemical methods for producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是化学方法，包括浸渍法等技术。然而，这些方法在控制双金属颗粒的尺寸、结构和组成方面存在局限性。

文献中提出了激光蒸发技术作为一种替代方法，具有以下几个优势：

1. 它可以生产无配体的金属簇。
2. 对于双金属系统，它可以创造出与蒸发合金靶材组成相同的颗粒。
3. 它可以生成组成极其均匀的双金属簇。
4. 簇在沉积之前就已形成，确保了组成的均匀性。

与化学方法相比，激光蒸发方法在生产定义明确的双金属催化剂方面更为有效。它能更好地控制颗粒组成和均匀性，使研究合金化对反应活性的影响变得更加容易。这种技术特别适用于创建模型催化剂和研究双金属系统的基本特性。

虽然文献没有提供所有合成方法的全面比较，但它强调了激光蒸发技术相对于传统化学方法在生产定义明确的双金属催化剂方面的优势。
