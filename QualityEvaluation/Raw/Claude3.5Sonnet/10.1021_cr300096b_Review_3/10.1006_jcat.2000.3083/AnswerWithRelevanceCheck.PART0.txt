          [1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."

          [2] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and, in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."

          [3] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are:

          1. Chemical methods (e.g., incipient wetness impregnation)
          2. Laser vaporization technique

          Chemical methods:
          - Widely used but have limitations in controlling size, structure, and composition of bimetallic catalysts
          - Difficult to compare catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts to monometallic ones
          - Composition is governed by the affinity of precursors for the support

          Laser vaporization technique:
          - Produces ligand-free metal clusters
          - Generates bimetallic particles with uniform composition identical to the vaporized alloy target
          - Forms clusters before deposition, ensuring better control over composition
          - Yields remarkably uniform bimetallic clusters
          - Allows creation of bimetallic catalysts from non-miscible metals

          Comparison:
          - Laser vaporization appears more efficacious for producing well-defined supported bimetallic catalysts
          - Better for fundamental studies of alloying effects on reactivity
          - Enables easier comparison between mono- and bimetallic systems
          - More effective in controlling particle properties

          The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the relative industrial applications or broader comparisons of these methods. The choice of synthesis method depends on specific application and research goals, with chemical methods potentially having advantages in scalability and cost-effectiveness for large-scale production.

          支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是：

          1. 化学方法（如浸渍法）
          2. 激光蒸发技术

          化学方法：
          - 使用广泛，但在控制双金属催化剂的尺寸、结构和成分方面存在局限性
          - 难以比较双金属催化剂和单金属催化剂的催化性能
          - 成分由前驱体与支持物的亲和力决定

          激光蒸发技术：
          - 产生无配体的金属簇
          - 生成与蒸发合金靶材成分相同的均匀组成的双金属颗粒
          - 在沉积之前就形成簇，确保更好地控制成分
          - 产生成分高度均匀的双金属簇
          - 允许创造由不相混溶金属组成的双金属催化剂

          比较：
          - 激光蒸发技术在生产定义明确的支持型双金属催化剂方面似乎更有效
          - 更适合研究合金化对反应活性影响的基础研究
          - 使单金属和双金属系统之间的比较更容易
          - 在控制颗粒性质方面更有效

          文献并未提供这些方法在工业应用或更广泛比较方面的全面信息。合成方法的选择取决于特定的应用和研究目标，化学方法在大规模生产的可扩展性和成本效益方面可能具有优势。
