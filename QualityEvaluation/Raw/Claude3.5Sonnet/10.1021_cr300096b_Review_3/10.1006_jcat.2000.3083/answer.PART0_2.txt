[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."

[2] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and, in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."

[3] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are chemical methods, which include techniques like incipient wetness impregnation. However, these methods have limitations in controlling the size, structure, and composition of the bimetallic particles.

The laser vaporization technique is presented as an alternative method that offers several advantages:

1. It produces ligand-free metal clusters.
2. It generates bimetallic particles with compositions identical to the vaporized alloy target.
3. It creates remarkably uniform bimetallic clusters.
4. It forms clusters before deposition, avoiding composition variations due to precursor-support interactions.

The laser vaporization method is more effective in producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts, allowing for better comparison between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. It also enables the creation of bimetallic catalysts from non-miscible metals, expanding its potential applications.

Overall, while chemical methods are more common, the laser vaporization technique appears to be more efficacious in producing well-controlled bimetallic catalysts, particularly for fundamental studies of alloying effects on reactivity.

最常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法是化学方法，包括浸渍等技术。然而，这些方法在控制双金属颗粒的尺寸、结构和成分方面存在局限性。

激光气化技术作为一种替代方法，具有以下几个优势：

1. 它能产生无配体的金属簇。
2. 它能生成与气化合金靶材成分相同的双金属颗粒。
3. 它能创造出成分均匀性remarkably好的双金属簇。
4. 它在沉积之前就形成了簇，避免了由于前驱体-载体相互作用而导致的成分变化。

激光气化方法在生产well-defined的双金属催化剂方面更有效，使得单金属和双金属催化剂之间的比较更加容易。它还能够创造出由不相混的金属组成的双金属催化剂，扩大了其潜在应用范围。

总的来说，虽然化学方法更为常见，但激光气化技术在生产控制良好的双金属催化剂方面似乎更为有效，特别是对于研究合金化对反应活性影响的基础研究。
