[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."

[2] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and, in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."

[3] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are chemical methods, such as incipient wetness impregnation. However, these methods have limitations in controlling the size, structure, and composition of bimetallic catalysts. 

In comparison, laser vaporization is presented as a novel and more effective technique for producing supported bimetallic catalysts. This method offers several advantages:

1. It generates ligand-free metal clusters.
2. It produces bimetallic particles with a composition identical to the vaporized alloy target.
3. It results in remarkably uniform composition of bimetallic clusters.
4. The clusters are formed before deposition, ensuring better control over composition.

Laser vaporization appears to be more effective in catalyst production as it allows for better control and uniformity of the bimetallic particles. This makes it easier to study the effects of alloying on reactivity, independent of support effects. It also enables the creation of bimetallic catalysts from a wide range of alloys, including those with non-miscible metals.

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all synthesis methods or discuss their broader applications. The focus is primarily on highlighting the advantages of laser vaporization over traditional chemical methods for producing supported bimetallic catalysts.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是化学方法，如浸渍法。然而，这些方法在控制双金属催化剂的尺寸、结构和成分方面存在局限性。

相比之下，激光气化被提出作为一种新型且更有效的制备支持型双金属催化剂的技术。这种方法具有以下几个优点：

1. 它可以产生无配体的金属团簇。
2. 它产生的双金属粒子的成分与气化的合金靶材相同。
3. 它能产生成分高度均匀的双金属团簇。
4. 团簇在沉积之前就已形成，确保了对成分的更好控制。

激光气化在催化剂生产方面似乎更有效，因为它可以更好地控制双金属粒子的均匀性。这使得研究合金化对反应性的影响更加容易，而不受支持效应的影响。它还能够创造出各种合金的双金属催化剂，包括那些不相混溶的金属。

然而，文献并没有提供所有合成方法的全面比较，也没有讨论它们更广泛的应用。重点主要是强调激光气化相对于传统化学方法在制备支持型双金属催化剂方面的优势。
