[1] "Since the size, the structure, or the composition of supported bimetallics is difficult to control for active phases obtained by chemical methods, it is generally not straightforward to compare the catalytic properties of a bimetallic catalyst to those of a monometallic one."

[2] "The laser vaporization technique allows the generation of ligand-free metal clusters and, in the case of bimetallic systems, particles which all have a composition identical to that of the vaporized alloyed target."

[3] "The laser vaporization technique has proven to be a unique way to obtain bimetallic clusters with a remarkably uniform composition. A simple explanation for this uniformity lies in the fact that the clusters are already formed before the deposition, whereas in chemical methods the composition is governed by the respective affinity of the precursors for the support."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are chemical methods, such as incipient wetness impregnation. However, these methods have limitations in controlling the size, structure, and composition of the bimetallic particles. 

In comparison, the laser vaporization technique offers several advantages:

1. It produces ligand-free metal clusters.
2. It generates bimetallic particles with uniform composition identical to the vaporized target.
3. It allows better control over particle size and composition.
4. It forms clusters before deposition, avoiding composition variations due to precursor-support interactions.

The laser vaporization technique is particularly effective for producing well-defined bimetallic catalysts, even for immiscible metal combinations. This makes it a valuable tool for studying alloying effects on reactivity without interference from support effects.

However, chemical methods may still have advantages in terms of scalability and cost-effectiveness for large-scale catalyst production. The choice of synthesis method depends on the specific application and research goals.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是化学方法，如浸渍法。然而，这些方法在控制双金属颗粒的尺寸、结构和成分方面存在局限性。

相比之下，激光蒸发技术具有以下优势：

1. 它可以生产无配体的金属簇。
2. 它可以生成与蒸发靶材成分完全相同的双金属颗粒。
3. 它可以更好地控制颗粒尺寸和成分。
4. 它在沉积前就形成了簇，避免了由于前驱体-载体相互作用而导致的成分变化。

激光蒸发技术特别适合于生产明确定义的双金属催化剂，甚至可用于不相溶的金属组合。这使其成为研究合金化对反应性影响的有价值工具，而不受载体效应的干扰。

然而，化学方法在大规模催化剂生产的可扩展性和成本效益方面可能仍有优势。合成方法的选择取决于特定的应用和研究目标。
