[1] "Gold catalysts were synthesised by a deposition-precipitation technique of the gold nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (Degussa, P-25)."

[2] "Finally, the bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a proper amount of Pt onto the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council, using H2PtCl6 as precursor, followed by a treatment in H2 flow at 723 K."

The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Deposition-precipitation: Used to synthesize gold catalysts by depositing gold nanoparticles onto TiO2 support. 

2. Impregnation: Used to prepare bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts by impregnating platinum onto pre-existing Au/TiO2 catalysts.

The document does not provide sufficient information to compare these methods in terms of their advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. More context would be needed to fully answer the question about how these methods compare.

文献提到了两种支撑型双金属催化剂的合成方法:

1. 沉积-沉淀法:用于合成金催化剂,将金纳米粒子沉积在二氧化钛载体上。

2. 浸渍法:用于制备Au@Pt/TiO2双金属催化剂,通过将铂浸渍到预先存在的Au/TiO2催化剂上。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来比较这些方法在优点、应用和整体效果方面的差异。需要更多的上下文才能完整回答这些方法如何比较的问题。
