[1] "Gold catalysts were synthesised by a deposition-precipitation technique of the gold nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (Degussa, P-25)."

[2] "Finally, the bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a proper amount of Pt onto the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council, using H2PtCl6 as precursor, followed by a treatment in H2 flow at 723 K."

The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Deposition-precipitation: Used to synthesize gold catalysts by depositing gold nanoparticles onto TiO2 support.

2. Impregnation: Used to prepare bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts by impregnating platinum onto pre-existing Au/TiO2 catalyst.

The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. More information would be needed to fully answer the question about how these methods compare.

文献提到了两种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法:

1. 沉积-沉淀法:用于合成金催化剂,将金纳米颗粒沉积在TiO2载体上。

2. 浸渍法:用于制备双金属Au@Pt/TiO2催化剂,通过将铂浸渍到现有的Au/TiO2催化剂上。

该文件没有提供这些方法在优势、应用和整体效果方面的全面比较。要全面回答这些方法如何比较的问题,需要更多信息。
