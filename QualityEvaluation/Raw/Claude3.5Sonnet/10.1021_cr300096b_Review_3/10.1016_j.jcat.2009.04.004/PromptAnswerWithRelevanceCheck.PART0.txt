If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>

[1] "Gold catalysts were synthesised by a deposition-precipitation technique of the gold nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (Degussa, P-25)."

[2] "Finally, the bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a proper amount of Pt onto the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council, using H2PtCl6 as precursor, followed by a treatment in H2 flow at 723 K."

</quotes>

The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Deposition-precipitation: Used to synthesize gold catalysts by depositing gold nanoparticles onto TiO2 support.

2. Impregnation: Used to prepare bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts by impregnating platinum onto pre-existing Au/TiO2 catalyst.

The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. More information would be needed to fully answer the question about how these methods compare.

文献提到了两种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法:

1. 沉积-沉淀法:用于合成金催化剂,将金纳米颗粒沉积在TiO2载体上。

2. 浸渍法:用于制备双金属Au@Pt/TiO2催化剂,通过将铂浸渍到现有的Au/TiO2催化剂上。

该文件没有提供这些方法在优势、应用和整体效果方面的全面比较。要全面回答这些方法如何比较的问题,需要更多信息。

1. Deposition-precipitation: Used to synthesize gold catalysts by depositing gold nanoparticles onto TiO2 support.

2. Impregnation: Used to prepare bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts by impregnating platinum onto pre-made Au/TiO2 samples.

The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. However, it suggests that the impregnation method allows for the creation of bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal contents, which can lead to improved catalytic performance while maintaining desirable properties like chemoselectivity.
