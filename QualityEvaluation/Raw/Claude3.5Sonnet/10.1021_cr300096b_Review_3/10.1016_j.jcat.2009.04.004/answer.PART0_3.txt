[1] "Gold catalysts were synthesised by a deposition-precipitation technique of the gold nanoparticles onto the surface of TiO2 (Degussa, P-25)."

[2] "Finally, the bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a proper amount of Pt onto the Au/TiO2 sample provided by the World Gold Council, using H2PtCl6 as precursor, followed by a treatment in H2 flow at 723 K."

The literature mentions two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Deposition-precipitation: Used to synthesize gold catalysts by depositing gold nanoparticles onto TiO2 support.

2. Impregnation: Used to prepare bimetallic Au@Pt/TiO2 catalysts by impregnating platinum onto pre-made Au/TiO2 samples.

The document does not provide a comprehensive comparison of these methods in terms of advantages, applications, and overall efficacy. However, it suggests that the impregnation method allows for the creation of bimetallic catalysts with optimized metal contents, which can lead to improved catalytic performance while maintaining desirable properties like chemoselectivity.

文献中提到了两种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 沉积-沉淀法：用于合成金催化剂，将金纳米颗粒沉积到TiO2载体上。

2. 浸渍法：用于制备双金属Au@Pt/TiO2催化剂，通过将铂浸渍到预制的Au/TiO2样品上。

文献并未对这些方法在优势、应用和整体效果方面进行全面比较。不过，它表明浸渍法可以创造具有优化金属含量的双金属催化剂，从而在保持理想性能(如化学选择性)的同时提高催化性能。
