The literature provided does not contain information about commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts or comparisons of different methods. The text focuses on the synthesis and characterization of platinum nanoparticles using dendrimer templates, and their use as catalysts when supported on silica. It does not discuss bimetallic catalysts or compare different synthesis methods.

The document does not directly discuss synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. The literature focuses on the preparation and characterization of monometallic platinum catalysts using dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles. It does not provide information about bimetallic catalyst synthesis methods or compare different approaches.

[1] "Arguably the key challenge in heterogeneous catalysis for the 21st century is the control of selectivity in highly complex processes, and that requires exquisite control over the design of the catalytic active site."

[2] "Recently, though, novel colloidal and self-assembly approaches have been used to synthesize catalyst with metal nanoparticles displaying excellent size and shape distributions"

[3] "An alternative way to grow small nanoparticles, with diameter of the order of 12 nm and narrow size distributions, is using dendrimer templates"

[4] "Well-defined platinum-based catalysts were prepared via an initial synthesis of dendrimer-encapsulated Pt nanoparticles (Pt-DENs) and their subsequent dispersion onto a high-surface-area homemade solgel silica support."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly compare different synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. However, it does mention several approaches for synthesizing metal catalysts with controlled nanoparticle properties:

1. Colloidal and self-assembly methods to produce catalysts with well-defined nanoparticle size and shape distributions.

2. Dendrimer templating to synthesize small nanoparticles (1-2 nm) with narrow size distributions. 

3. A two-step process involving synthesis of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles followed by dispersion on a support material.

These methods aim to achieve precise control over the catalyst active sites, which is noted as a key challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. The dendrimer templating approach in particular seems to offer advantages in producing very small, uniform nanoparticles. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different methods in terms of advantages, applications and overall efficacy.

这篇文献并没有直接比较不同的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法。然而,它确实提到了几种合成具有可控纳米颗粒性质的金属催化剂的方法:

1. 胶体和自组装方法,用于生产具有良好定义的纳米颗粒尺寸和形状分布的催化剂。

2. 树枝状分子模板法,用于合成尺寸分布窄的小纳米颗粒(1-2 nm)。

3. 一个两步法,包括合成树枝状分子包覆的纳米颗粒,然后将其分散在载体材料上。

这些方法旨在精确控制催化剂活性位点,这被认为是多相催化领域的一个关键挑战。特别是树枝状分子模板法似乎在生产非常小且均匀的纳米颗粒方面具有优势。然而,这篇文献并未就不同方法的优势、应用和整体效果提供全面的比较。
