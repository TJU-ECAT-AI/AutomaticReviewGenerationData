[1] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)."

[2] "Chandler and co-workers, who showed that G5-OH(Pt50) and G5-OH(Pt100) DENs could be deposited onto commercial silica supports and then calcined at 300 C in a O2/He flow to yield supported Pt catalysts that largely retained their original size."

[3] "In addition to depositing DENs onto surfaces, it is also possible to incorporate them into inorganic matrixes to yield catalytically active heterogeneous materials. For example, we have shown that such materials can be prepared by incorporating DENs into solgel matrixes, and then calcining the composite to remove the dendrimer."

[4] "Supported bimetallic nanoparticles can also be prepared via this solgel route, and even after calcining to remove the dendrimer the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Deposition of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) onto supports like mica or graphite, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. However, this method often leads to particle growth.

2. Deposition of DENs onto commercial silica supports, followed by low-temperature calcination in O2/He flow. This method better preserves the original nanoparticle size.

3. Incorporation of DENs into sol-gel matrices, followed by calcination. This approach minimizes particle growth by isolating nanoparticles within the matrix.

4. Preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles via the sol-gel route, which retains both size and chemical composition of particles even after calcination.

The sol-gel method appears to be the most promising, as it allows for better control of particle size and composition. It has potential advantages in preserving the bimetallic structure and preventing agglomeration. The other methods may be simpler but can lead to more particle growth. Overall, these approaches offer ways to create supported bimetallic catalysts with controlled properties, which is crucial for various catalytic applications.

文献讨论了几种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 将树枝状大分子包裹的纳米粒子(DENs)沉积在云母或石墨等载体上，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状大分子。然而，这种方法往往导致粒子增大。

2. 将DENs沉积在商业二氧化硅载体上，然后在O2/He流中进行低温煅烧。这种方法能更好地保持原始纳米粒子的尺寸。

3. 将DENs掺入溶胶-凝胶基质中，然后进行煅烧。这种方法通过将纳米粒子隔离在基质中，最大限度地减少了粒子的生长。

4. 通过溶胶-凝胶法制备双金属纳米粒子，即使在煅烧后，也能保持粒子的尺寸和化学成分。

溶胶-凝胶法似乎是最有前途的，因为它能更好地控制粒子尺寸和成分。它在保持双金属结构和防止团聚方面具有潜在优势。其他方法可能更简单，但可能导致更多的粒子生长。总的来说，这些方法提供了创建具有受控性能的负载型双金属催化剂的方法，这对各种催化应用至关重要。
