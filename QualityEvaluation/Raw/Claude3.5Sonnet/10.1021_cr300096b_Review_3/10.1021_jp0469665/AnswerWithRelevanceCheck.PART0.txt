          [1] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)."

[2] "Chandler and co-workers, who showed that G5-OH(Pt50) and G5-OH(Pt100) DENs could be deposited onto commercial silica supports and then calcined at 300 C in a O2/He flow to yield supported Pt catalysts that largely retained their original size."

[3] "In addition to depositing DENs onto surfaces, it is also possible to incorporate them into inorganic matrixes to yield catalytically active heterogeneous materials. For example, we have shown that such materials can be prepared by incorporating DENs into solgel matrixes, and then calcining the composite to remove the dendrimer."

[4] "Supported bimetallic nanoparticles can also be prepared via this solgel route, and even after calcining to remove the dendrimer the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts include:

1. Direct deposition of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) onto supports like mica, graphite, or silica, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer.

2. Incorporation of DENs into inorganic matrices like sol-gel, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer.

3. Deposition of DENs onto commercial supports (e.g., silica) followed by low-temperature calcination in controlled atmospheres (e.g., O2/He flow).

Comparing these methods:

1. Direct deposition is simpler but may lead to particle growth during calcination, especially at higher temperatures.

2. Sol-gel incorporation provides better control over particle size and composition, even after calcination. This method is particularly effective for bimetallic catalysts, as it helps maintain both size and chemical composition of individual particles.

3. Deposition on commercial supports with controlled calcination offers a balance between simplicity and maintaining particle properties.

The sol-gel method appears to be the most effective in maintaining the size and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles, making it particularly useful for producing well-defined catalysts. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific application, desired particle properties, and available resources.

Overall, these methods offer advantages in terms of size control, composition control, dispersion, and stability of the nanoparticles. They show promise in producing well-defined supported bimetallic catalysts, although further research is needed to fully optimize these techniques.

          最常用的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法包括：

1. 将树枝状大分子包裹的纳米粒子（DENs）直接沉积到云母、石墨或二氧化硅等载体上，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状大分子。

2. 将DENs掺入溶胶-凝胶等无机基质中，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状大分子。

3. 将DENs沉积到商业载体（如二氧化硅）上，然后在受控气氛（如O2/He流）下进行低温煅烧。

比较这些方法：

1. 直接沉积方法较为简单，但在煅烧过程中可能导致粒子生长，尤其是在较高温度下。

2. 溶胶-凝胶掺入法在煅烧后仍能更好地控制粒子尺寸和成分。这种方法对双金属催化剂特别有效，因为它有助于维持单个粒子的尺寸和化学成分。

3. 在商业载体上沉积并进行受控煅烧的方法在简单性和保持粒子性质之间取得了平衡。

溶胶-凝胶法在保持双金属纳米粒子的尺寸和成分方面似乎最为有效，使其特别适合于生产定义明确的催化剂。然而，方法的选择可能取决于具体应用、所需的粒子性质和可用资源。

总的来说，这些方法在纳米粒子的尺寸控制、成分控制、分散性和稳定性方面具有优势。它们在生产定义明确的负载型双金属催化剂方面显示出了前景，尽管仍需要进一步的研究来充分优化这些技术。
