[1] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)."

[2] "Chandler and co-workers, who showed that G5-OH(Pt50) and G5-OH(Pt100) DENs could be deposited onto commercial silica supports and then calcined at 300 C in a O2/He flow to yield supported Pt catalysts that largely retained their original size."

[3] "In addition to depositing DENs onto surfaces, it is also possible to incorporate them into inorganic matrixes to yield catalytically active heterogeneous materials. For example, we have shown that such materials can be prepared by incorporating DENs into solgel matrixes, and then calcining the composite to remove the dendrimer."

[4] "Supported bimetallic nanoparticles can also be prepared via this solgel route, and even after calcining to remove the dendrimer the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Deposition of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) onto supports like mica or graphite, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. However, this method often leads to particle growth.

2. Deposition of DENs onto commercial silica supports, followed by low-temperature calcination in O2/He flow. This method better preserves the original nanoparticle size.

3. Incorporation of DENs into sol-gel matrices, followed by calcination. This approach minimizes particle growth by isolating nanoparticles within the matrix.

4. Preparation of bimetallic nanoparticles via the sol-gel route, which retains both size and chemical composition of particles even after calcination.

The sol-gel method appears to be the most promising, as it allows for better control of particle size and composition. It has potential advantages in preserving the bimetallic structure and preventing agglomeration. The other methods may be simpler but can lead to more particle growth. Overall, these approaches offer ways to create supported bimetallic catalysts with controlled properties, which is crucial for various catalytic applications.

文献讨论了几种合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 将树枝状大分子包裹的纳米粒子(DENs)沉积在云母或石墨等载体上，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状大分子。然而，这种方法往往导致粒子增大。

2. 将DENs沉积在商业二氧化硅载体上，然后在O2/He流中进行低温煅烧。这种方法能更好地保持原始纳米粒子的尺寸。

3. 将DENs掺入溶胶-凝胶基质中，然后进行煅烧。这种方法通过将纳米粒子隔离在基质中，最大限度地减少了粒子的生长。

4. 通过溶胶-凝胶法制备双金属纳米粒子，即使在煅烧后，也能保持粒子的尺寸和化学成分。

溶胶-凝胶法似乎是最有前途的，因为它能更好地控制粒子尺寸和成分。它在保持双金属结构和防止团聚方面具有潜在优势。其他方法可能更简单，但可能导致更多的粒子生长。总的来说，这些方法提供了创建具有受控性能的负载型双金属催化剂的方法，这对各种催化应用至关重要。

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts using dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) as precursors:

1. Deposition of DENs onto supports like mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. However, this method often led to particle growth and aggregation.

2. Deposition of DENs onto commercial silica supports, followed by calcination at 300°C in O2/He flow. This method, demonstrated by Chandler and co-workers, was more successful in retaining the original size of the nanoparticles.

4. Preparation of supported bimetallic nanoparticles using the sol-gel route, which can retain both the size and chemical composition of individual particles even after calcination.

These methods offer different advantages:

- The sol-gel method appears to be the most effective in maintaining particle size and composition, especially for bimetallic catalysts.
- The silica support method offers a balance between ease of preparation and retention of particle properties.
- Incorporation into inorganic matrices provides better control over particle growth during calcination.

Overall, the sol-gel route seems to be the most promising for producing supported bimetallic catalysts with well-controlled properties. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific application and desired catalyst characteristics.

文献讨论了几种使用树枝状分子包裹的纳米粒子(DENs)作为前体合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 将DENs沉积在云母或高定向热解石墨(HOPG)等支撑物上，然后煅烧去除树枝状分子。然而，这种方法常常导致粒子生长和聚集。

2. 将DENs沉积在商业二氧化硅支撑物上，然后在O2/He流中300°C煅烧。这种由Chandler及其同事展示的方法在保持纳米粒子原始尺寸方面更为成功。

3. 将DENs掺入无机基质中，如溶胶-凝胶基质，然后煅烧去除树枝状分子。这种方法通过在基质中隔离单个纳米粒子来帮助最小化粒子生长。

4. 使用溶胶-凝胶路线制备负载型双金属纳米粒子，即使在煅烧后也能保持单个粒子的尺寸和化学成分。

这些方法提供了不同的优势：

- 溶胶-凝胶方法似乎在保持粒子尺寸和成分方面最为有效，尤其是对于双金属催化剂。
- 二氧化硅支撑物方法在制备简便性和保持粒子特性之间提供了平衡。
- 掺入无机基质提供了在煅烧过程中更好地控制粒子生长的方法。

总的来说，溶胶-凝胶路线似乎是生产具有良好控制特性的负载型双金属催化剂的最有前景的方法。然而，方法的选择可能取决于特定的应用和所需的催化剂特性。

Moreover, single-particle EDS analysis following calcination of G4-NH2(Pd14Au41) DENs indicated average Pd and Au compositions of 19  2% and 81  2%, respectively, which are in good agreement with the molar percentages of PdCl42- and AuCl4- used in their preparation."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts using dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs):

1. Incorporation into inorganic matrices: DENs are incorporated into sol-gel matrices, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. This method yields catalytically active heterogeneous materials.

2. Deposition onto surfaces: DENs are deposited onto surfaces and then calcined to remove the dendrimer.

The sol-gel route appears to be particularly effective for bimetallic catalysts. Even after calcination to remove the dendrimer, the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained. For example, PdAu catalysts prepared this way showed only a modest increase in particle size after calcination (from 1.8 nm to 3.2 nm), and the final composition closely matched the initial precursor ratios.

These methods offer several advantages:

1. Precise control over nanoparticle size and composition before deposition
2. Retention of particle characteristics after dendrimer removal
3. Ability to create well-dispersed supported catalysts
4. Flexibility in choice of support material

Overall, these approaches seem to be effective in producing supported bimetallic catalysts with controlled properties, which is crucial for various catalytic applications.

文献讨论了使用树枝状分子包封纳米粒子（DENs）合成负载型双金属催化剂的两种主要方法：

1. 掺入无机基质：将DENs掺入溶胶-凝胶基质中，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状分子。这种方法可以得到具有催化活性的多相材料。

2. 沉积在表面上：将DENs沉积在表面上，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状分子。

溶胶-凝胶路线对于双金属催化剂似乎特别有效。即使在煅烧去除树枝状分子后，单个粒子的尺寸和化学成分仍基本保持不变。例如，通过这种方法制备的PdAu催化剂在煅烧后粒径只有适度增加（从1.8 nm增加到3.2 nm），最终成分与初始前驱体比例密切匹配。

这些方法具有几个优点：

1. 在沉积之前可以精确控制纳米粒子的尺寸和成分
2. 去除树枝状分子后仍能保持粒子特性
3. 能够创建分散良好的负载型催化剂
4. 支撑材料选择灵活

总的来说，这些方法在生产具有可控特性的负载型双金属催化剂方面似乎很有效，这对各种催化应用至关重要。

[1] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). For example, Pd DENs encapsulated within G6-NH2 were found to have strong interactions with the step edges of HOPG surfaces. However, upon calcination at 630 C the particles grew into large aggregates."

[2] "A much more successful example of this general approach was recently demonstrated by Chandler and co-workers, who showed that G5-OH(Pt50) and G5-OH(Pt100) DENs could be deposited onto commercial silica supports and then calcined at 300 C in a O2/He flow to yield supported Pt catalysts that largely retained their original size."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts based on the given literature include:

1. Direct deposition of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) onto supports followed by calcination. This method has shown mixed results, with some cases leading to particle growth and aggregation, while others maintain the original size.

2. Incorporation of DENs into inorganic matrices like sol-gel, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. This method has shown promising results in maintaining both size and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles.

3. Deposition of DENs onto commercial supports (e.g., silica) followed by low-temperature calcination in controlled atmospheres.

Each method has its advantages and challenges:

- Direct deposition is simpler but may lead to particle growth during calcination.
- Sol-gel incorporation provides better control over particle size and composition but involves more complex synthesis steps.
- Deposition on commercial supports with controlled calcination offers a balance between simplicity and maintaining particle properties.

Overall, the sol-gel method appears to be the most effective in maintaining the size and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles, making it particularly useful for producing well-defined catalysts. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific application, desired particle properties, and available resources.
