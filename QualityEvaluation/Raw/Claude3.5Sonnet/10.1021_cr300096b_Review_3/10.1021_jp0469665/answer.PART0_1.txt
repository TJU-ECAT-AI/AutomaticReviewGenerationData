[1] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG)."

[2] "A much more successful example of this general approach was recently demonstrated by Chandler and co-workers, who showed that G5-OH(Pt50) and G5-OH(Pt100) DENs could be deposited onto commercial silica supports and then calcined at 300 C in a O2/He flow to yield supported Pt catalysts that largely retained their original size."

[3] "In addition to depositing DENs onto surfaces, it is also possible to incorporate them into inorganic matrixes to yield catalytically active heterogeneous materials. For example, we have shown that such materials can be prepared by incorporating DENs into solgel matrixes, and then calcining the composite to remove the dendrimer."

[4] "Supported bimetallic nanoparticles can also be prepared via this solgel route, and even after calcining to remove the dendrimer the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts using dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) as precursors:

1. Deposition of DENs onto supports like mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. However, this method often led to particle growth and aggregation.

2. Deposition of DENs onto commercial silica supports, followed by calcination at 300°C in O2/He flow. This method, demonstrated by Chandler and co-workers, was more successful in retaining the original size of the nanoparticles.

3. Incorporation of DENs into inorganic matrices, such as sol-gel matrices, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. This method helps minimize particle growth by isolating individual nanoparticles within the matrix.

4. Preparation of supported bimetallic nanoparticles using the sol-gel route, which can retain both the size and chemical composition of individual particles even after calcination.

These methods offer different advantages:

- The sol-gel method appears to be the most effective in maintaining particle size and composition, especially for bimetallic catalysts.
- The silica support method offers a balance between ease of preparation and retention of particle properties.
- Incorporation into inorganic matrices provides better control over particle growth during calcination.

Overall, the sol-gel route seems to be the most promising for producing supported bimetallic catalysts with well-controlled properties. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific application and desired catalyst characteristics.

文献讨论了几种使用树枝状分子包裹的纳米粒子(DENs)作为前体合成负载型双金属催化剂的方法：

1. 将DENs沉积在云母或高定向热解石墨(HOPG)等支撑物上，然后煅烧去除树枝状分子。然而，这种方法常常导致粒子生长和聚集。

2. 将DENs沉积在商业二氧化硅支撑物上，然后在O2/He流中300°C煅烧。这种由Chandler及其同事展示的方法在保持纳米粒子原始尺寸方面更为成功。

3. 将DENs掺入无机基质中，如溶胶-凝胶基质，然后煅烧去除树枝状分子。这种方法通过在基质中隔离单个纳米粒子来帮助最小化粒子生长。

4. 使用溶胶-凝胶路线制备负载型双金属纳米粒子，即使在煅烧后也能保持单个粒子的尺寸和化学成分。

这些方法提供了不同的优势：

- 溶胶-凝胶方法似乎在保持粒子尺寸和成分方面最为有效，尤其是对于双金属催化剂。
- 二氧化硅支撑物方法在制备简便性和保持粒子特性之间提供了平衡。
- 掺入无机基质提供了在煅烧过程中更好地控制粒子生长的方法。

总的来说，溶胶-凝胶路线似乎是生产具有良好控制特性的负载型双金属催化剂的最有前景的方法。然而，方法的选择可能取决于特定的应用和所需的催化剂特性。
