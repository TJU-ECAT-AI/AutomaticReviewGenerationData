[1] "In addition to preparing DENs onto surfaces, it is also possible to incorporate them into inorganic matrixes to yield catalytically active heterogeneous materials. For example, we have shown that such materials can be prepared by incorporating DENs into solgel matrixes, and then calcining the composite to remove the dendrimer."

[2] "Supported bimetallic nanoparticles can also be prepared via this solgel route, and even after calcining to remove the dendrimer the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained."

[3] "For example, supported PdAu catalysts formed from G4-NH2(Pd27.5Au27.5) DENs were found to have an average particle size of 1.8  0.4 nm and 3.2  0.9 nm before and after calcination, respectively. Moreover, single-particle EDS analysis following calcination of G4-NH2(Pd14Au41) DENs indicated average Pd and Au compositions of 19  2% and 81  2%, respectively, which are in good agreement with the molar percentages of PdCl42- and AuCl4- used in their preparation."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts using dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs):

1. Incorporation into inorganic matrices: DENs are incorporated into sol-gel matrices, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. This method yields catalytically active heterogeneous materials.

2. Deposition onto surfaces: DENs are deposited onto surfaces and then calcined to remove the dendrimer.

The sol-gel route appears to be particularly effective for bimetallic catalysts. Even after calcination to remove the dendrimer, the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained. For example, PdAu catalysts prepared this way showed only a modest increase in particle size after calcination (from 1.8 nm to 3.2 nm), and the final composition closely matched the initial precursor ratios.

These methods offer several advantages:

1. Precise control over nanoparticle size and composition before deposition
2. Retention of particle characteristics after dendrimer removal
3. Ability to create well-dispersed supported catalysts
4. Flexibility in choice of support material

Overall, these approaches seem to be effective in producing supported bimetallic catalysts with controlled properties, which is crucial for various catalytic applications.

文献讨论了使用树枝状分子包封纳米粒子（DENs）合成负载型双金属催化剂的两种主要方法：

1. 掺入无机基质：将DENs掺入溶胶-凝胶基质中，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状分子。这种方法可以得到具有催化活性的多相材料。

2. 沉积在表面上：将DENs沉积在表面上，然后通过煅烧去除树枝状分子。

溶胶-凝胶路线对于双金属催化剂似乎特别有效。即使在煅烧去除树枝状分子后，单个粒子的尺寸和化学成分仍基本保持不变。例如，通过这种方法制备的PdAu催化剂在煅烧后粒径只有适度增加（从1.8 nm增加到3.2 nm），最终成分与初始前驱体比例密切匹配。

这些方法具有几个优点：

1. 在沉积之前可以精确控制纳米粒子的尺寸和成分
2. 去除树枝状分子后仍能保持粒子特性
3. 能够创建分散良好的负载型催化剂
4. 支撑材料选择灵活

总的来说，这些方法在生产具有可控特性的负载型双金属催化剂方面似乎很有效，这对各种催化应用至关重要。
