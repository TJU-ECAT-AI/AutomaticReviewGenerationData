[1] "Our first efforts to prepare dendrimer-free heterogeneous catalysts using DEN precursors focused on Pd DENs supported on mica or highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). For example, Pd DENs encapsulated within G6-NH2 were found to have strong interactions with the step edges of HOPG surfaces. However, upon calcination at 630 C the particles grew into large aggregates."

[2] "A much more successful example of this general approach was recently demonstrated by Chandler and co-workers, who showed that G5-OH(Pt50) and G5-OH(Pt100) DENs could be deposited onto commercial silica supports and then calcined at 300 C in a O2/He flow to yield supported Pt catalysts that largely retained their original size."

[3] "In addition to depositing DENs onto surfaces, it is also possible to incorporate them into inorganic matrixes to yield catalytically active heterogeneous materials. For example, we have shown that such materials can be prepared by incorporating DENs into solgel matrixes, and then calcining the composite to remove the dendrimer."

[4] "Supported bimetallic nanoparticles can also be prepared via this solgel route, and even after calcining to remove the dendrimer the size and chemical composition of individual particles are largely retained."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts based on the given literature include:

1. Direct deposition of dendrimer-encapsulated nanoparticles (DENs) onto supports followed by calcination. This method has shown mixed results, with some cases leading to particle growth and aggregation, while others maintain the original size.

2. Incorporation of DENs into inorganic matrices like sol-gel, followed by calcination to remove the dendrimer. This method has shown promising results in maintaining both size and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles.

3. Deposition of DENs onto commercial supports (e.g., silica) followed by low-temperature calcination in controlled atmospheres.

Each method has its advantages and challenges:

- Direct deposition is simpler but may lead to particle growth during calcination.
- Sol-gel incorporation provides better control over particle size and composition but involves more complex synthesis steps.
- Deposition on commercial supports with controlled calcination offers a balance between simplicity and maintaining particle properties.

Overall, the sol-gel method appears to be the most effective in maintaining the size and composition of bimetallic nanoparticles, making it particularly useful for producing well-defined catalysts. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific application, desired particle properties, and available resources.

根据给定文献,制备负载型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法包括:

1. 将树枝状大分子包裹的纳米粒子(DENs)直接沉积到载体上,然后进行焙烧。这种方法效果不一,有些情况下会导致粒子生长和聚集,而其他情况下则能保持原有尺寸。

2. 将DENs掺入溶胶-凝胶等无机基质中,然后焙烧去除树枝状大分子。这种方法在保持双金属纳米粒子的尺寸和成分方面显示出良好的效果。

3. 将DENs沉积到商业载体(如二氧化硅)上,然后在受控气氛下进行低温焙烧。

每种方法都有其优势和挑战:

- 直接沉积方法较为简单,但在焙烧过程中可能导致粒子生长。
- 溶胶-凝胶掺入法对粒子尺寸和成分的控制更好,但合成步骤更复杂。
- 在商业载体上沉积并进行受控焙烧的方法在简单性和保持粒子性质之间取得了平衡。

总的来说,溶胶-凝胶法在保持双金属纳米粒子的尺寸和成分方面似乎最为有效,使其特别适合于生产定义明确的催化剂。然而,方法的选择可能取决于具体应用、所需的粒子性质和可用资源。
