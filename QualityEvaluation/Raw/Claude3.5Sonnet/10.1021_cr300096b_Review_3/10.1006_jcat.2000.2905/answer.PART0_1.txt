[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."

[3] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

[4] "When the molecular cluster precursors were used as catalyst precursors, small and uniform bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersions were prepared."

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are:

1. Adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors followed by reduction
2. Adsorption of ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (e.g. organometallic clusters) followed by thermal ligand removal

The traditional methods using monometallic precursors are widely used but can suffer from chromatographic separation during impregnation, leading to non-uniform metal distributions. 

The molecular cluster precursor method offers potential advantages in producing small, uniform bimetallic particles with high metal dispersions. This approach allows for better control over particle size and composition compared to traditional methods.

Overall, the molecular precursor route appears promising for preparing well-defined bimetallic catalysts, though it may be less widely applied than conventional impregnation techniques. The choice of method depends on the specific catalyst system and desired properties.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是:

1. 单金属前体的吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀,然后还原
2. 配体稳定的双金属分子前体(如有机金属簇)的吸附,然后热去除配体

使用单金属前体的传统方法被广泛使用,但在浸渍过程中可能会出现色谱分离,导致金属分布不均匀。

分子簇前体方法在生产小而均匀的双金属颗粒方面具有潜在优势,具有高金属分散度。与传统方法相比,这种方法可以更好地控制粒径和成分。

总的来说,分子前体路线似乎在制备明确定义的双金属催化剂方面很有前景,尽管它可能不如常规浸渍技术应用广泛。方法的选择取决于具体的催化剂体系和所需的性能。
