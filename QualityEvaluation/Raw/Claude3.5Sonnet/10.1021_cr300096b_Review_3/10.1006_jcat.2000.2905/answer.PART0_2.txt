[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction)"

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support"

[3] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering"

[4] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

The most commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are:

1. Adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors followed by reduction. This is the most ubiquitous method.

2. Coimpregnation of metal precursors. However, this can lead to chromatographic separation of precursor ions in the support pores.

3. High-temperature reduction or annealing after impregnation. This can form more homogeneous alloys but risks sintering.

4. Adsorption of ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (e.g. organometallic clusters) followed by thermal ligand removal. This is a newer approach for preparing highly dispersed particles.

The traditional impregnation methods are widely used but can have issues with metal distribution and particle size control. The molecular precursor approach offers potential advantages in forming small, uniform bimetallic particles, but may be limited by available precursors. Overall, the choice of method depends on the specific metals, support, and desired catalyst properties.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是：

1. 单金属前体的吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀，然后还原。这是最普遍的方法。

2. 金属前体的共浸渍。但这可能导致前体离子在载体孔隙中的色谱分离。

3. 浸渍后的高温还原或退火。这可以形成更均匀的合金，但有烧结的风险。

4. 配体稳定的双金属分子前体(如有机金属簇)的吸附，然后热去除配体。这是一种用于制备高度分散颗粒的较新方法。

传统的浸渍方法使用广泛，但在金属分布和粒径控制方面可能存在问题。分子前体方法在形成小而均匀的双金属颗粒方面具有潜在优势，但可能受到可用前体的限制。总的来说，方法的选择取决于特定的金属、载体和所需的催化剂性能。
