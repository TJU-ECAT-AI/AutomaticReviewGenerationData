          [1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction)"

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support"

[3] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering"

[4] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

[5] "When the molecular cluster precursors were used as catalyst precursors, small and uniform bimetallic particles with high Pt dispersions were prepared."

[6] "Unfortunately, there are few bimetallic PtM clusters that are ligated exclusively by CO and carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable. There are many molecular PtM clusters stabilized by phosphine ligands (26, 27); however, previous studies using phosphine-stabilized PtAu clusters as catalyst precursors indicated that that the presence of phosphine residues controls the properties of the resulting catalysts (2832)."

          The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are:

1. Adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors followed by reduction. This is the most ubiquitous method.

2. Coimpregnation techniques, though these can suffer from chromatographic separation of precursor ions.

3. High-temperature reduction or annealing to form more homogeneous alloys, but this risks excessive sintering.

4. Adsorption of ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (like inorganic and organometallic clusters) followed by thermal ligand removal. This is a newer approach for preparing highly dispersed catalysts.

These methods compare as follows:

- Traditional methods (1-3) are widely used but can have issues with metal separation and sintering. They are simple and applicable to many metal combinations.

- The molecular precursor method (4) offers better control over particle size and composition, producing small, uniform bimetallic particles with high metal dispersions. However, it may be limited by available precursors. For example, carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable, and phosphine-ligated clusters can leave residues affecting catalyst properties.

Overall, the choice depends on the specific metals, support, and desired catalyst properties. The molecular precursor approach shows promise for producing well-dispersed bimetallic nanoparticles but is less established than traditional techniques.

          支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是：

1. 单金属前体的吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀,然后进行还原。这是最普遍的方法。

2. 共浸渍技术,但这可能会出现前体离子色谱分离的问题。

3. 高温还原或退火以形成更均匀的合金,但这有过度烧结的风险。

4. 吸附配体稳定的双金属分子前体(如无机和有机金属簇合物),然后热去除配体。这是制备高分散催化剂的较新方法。

这些方法的比较如下：

- 传统方法(1-3)广泛使用,但可能存在金属分离和烧结问题。它们简单且适用于许多金属组合。

- 分子前体法(4)可以更好地控制粒径和成分,生产小而均匀的双金属颗粒,具有高金属分散度。但可能受到可用前体的限制。例如,羰基配位的PtCu簇是不可用的,而膦配位的簇可能会留下影响催化剂性能的残留物。

总体而言,选择取决于具体的金属、载体和所需的催化剂性能。分子前体法在制备分散良好的双金属纳米粒子方面显示出前景,但不如传统技术成熟。
