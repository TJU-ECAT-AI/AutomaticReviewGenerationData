[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction) (13)."

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support (13)."

[3] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

[4] "Unfortunately, there are few bimetallic PtM clusters that are ligated exclusively by CO and carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable. There are many molecular PtM clusters stabilized by phosphine ligands (26, 27); however, previous studies using phosphine-stabilized PtAu clusters as catalyst precursors indicated that that the presence of phosphine residues controls the properties of the resulting catalysts (2832)."

The most common synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support, followed by an activation step like reduction. This method is widely used but can lead to issues like chromatographic separation of precursor ions in the support pores.

An alternative approach is using ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors, particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds. This method involves adsorbing these precursors onto the support and then thermally removing the ligands. It can produce highly dispersed metal particles.

Each method has advantages and drawbacks. The traditional monometallic precursor method is well-established and widely applicable, but may result in inhomogeneous metal distribution. The cluster precursor method can potentially yield more uniform, highly dispersed particles, but suitable precursors are limited for some metal combinations. For example, carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable, while phosphine-ligated clusters can leave residues that affect catalyst properties.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the specific metals, desired properties, and availability of suitable precursors. The cluster precursor method shows promise for producing well-dispersed bimetallic particles but may be limited by precursor availability for some systems.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是将单金属前体吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀到载体上，然后进行活化步骤(通常是还原)。这种方法被广泛使用，但可能导致前体离子在载体孔隙中发生色谱分离等问题。

另一种方法是使用配体稳定的双金属分子前体，特别是无机和有机金属簇化合物。这种方法涉及将这些前体吸附到载体上，然后热去除配体。它可以产生高度分散的金属颗粒。

每种方法都有优缺点。传统的单金属前体方法已经建立并广泛适用，但可能导致金属分布不均匀。簇前体方法可能产生更均匀、高度分散的颗粒，但对某些金属组合来说，合适的前体是有限的。例如，羰基配位的PtCu簇是不可用的，而膦配位的簇可能会留下影响催化剂性能的残留物。

总的来说，方法的选择取决于特定的金属、所需的性能以及合适前体的可用性。簇前体方法在生产良好分散的双金属颗粒方面显示出前景，但对某些体系可能受到前体可用性的限制。
