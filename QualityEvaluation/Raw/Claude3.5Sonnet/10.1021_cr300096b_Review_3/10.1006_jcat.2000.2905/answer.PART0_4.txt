[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction)"

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support"

[3] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering"

[4] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

The most common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are:

1. Adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors followed by reduction. This is the most widely used method but can lead to chromatographic separation of precursor ions.

2. High-temperature reduction or annealing to form more homogeneous alloys, though this risks sintering.

3. Adsorption of ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (e.g. organometallic clusters) followed by thermal ligand removal. 

The traditional impregnation methods are simple but can lead to inhomogeneous metal distributions. The cluster precursor method allows for more controlled synthesis of small, uniform bimetallic particles but requires more complex precursors. Overall, the choice of method depends on the desired catalyst properties and available precursors. The cluster method shows promise for producing highly dispersed bimetallic catalysts with unique properties.

支持的双金属催化剂最常见的合成方法是:

1. 单金属前体的吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀,然后还原。这是最广泛使用的方法,但可能导致前体离子的色谱分离。

2. 高温还原或退火形成更均匀的合金,但存在烧结风险。

3. 配体稳定的双金属分子前体(如有机金属簇)的吸附,然后热去除配体。

传统的浸渍方法简单,但可能导致金属分布不均匀。簇前体法允许更可控地合成小而均匀的双金属颗粒,但需要更复杂的前体。总的来说,方法的选择取决于所需的催化剂性能和可用的前体。簇方法显示出生产高度分散的具有独特性能的双金属催化剂的前景。
