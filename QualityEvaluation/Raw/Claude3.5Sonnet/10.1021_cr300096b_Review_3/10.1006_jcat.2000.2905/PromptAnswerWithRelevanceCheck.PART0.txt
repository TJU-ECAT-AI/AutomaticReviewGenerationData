[1] "Almost ubiquitously, supported bimetallic alloy catalysts are prepared via a technique involving the adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support followed by an activation step (usually reduction)"

[2] "A common problem that can arise from coimpregnation techniques is chromatographic separation of the precursor ions as they pass through the pore structure of the support"

[3] "A more homogeneous alloy may be formed with high-temperature reduction or annealing; however, this risks possible excessive sintering"

[4] "A different approach to the preparation of highly dispersed supported metal particle catalysts is to adsorb ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds) onto the support and thermally remove the ligands."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The most common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are:

1. Adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors followed by reduction. This is the most ubiquitous method.

2. Coimpregnation techniques, though these can suffer from chromatographic separation of precursor ions.

3. High-temperature reduction or annealing to form more homogeneous alloys, but this risks excessive sintering.

4. Adsorption of ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (like inorganic and organometallic clusters) followed by thermal ligand removal. This is a newer approach for preparing highly dispersed catalysts.

The traditional methods (1-3) are widely used but can have issues with metal separation and sintering. The molecular precursor method (4) offers better control over particle size and composition but may be limited by available precursors. Overall, the choice depends on the specific metals, support, and desired catalyst properties. The molecular precursor approach shows promise for producing well-dispersed bimetallic nanoparticles but is less established than traditional techniques.

支持型双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是：

1. 单金属前体的吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀,然后进行还原。这是最普遍的方法。

2. 共浸渍技术,但这可能会出现前体离子色谱分离的问题。

3. 高温还原或退火以形成更均匀的合金,但这有过度烧结的风险。

4. 吸附配体稳定的双金属分子前体(如无机和有机金属簇合物),然后热去除配体。这是制备高分散催化剂的较新方法。

传统方法(1-3)广泛使用,但可能存在金属分离和烧结问题。分子前体法(4)可以更好地控制粒径和成分,但可能受到可用前体的限制。总体而言,选择取决于具体的金属、载体和所需的催化剂性能。分子前体法在制备分散良好的双金属纳米粒子方面显示出前景,但不如传统技术成熟。

The most commonly utilized synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts are:

1. Adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors followed by reduction
2. Adsorption of ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors (e.g. organometallic clusters) followed by thermal ligand removal

The traditional methods using monometallic precursors are widely used but can suffer from chromatographic separation during impregnation, leading to non-uniform metal distributions. 

The molecular cluster precursor method offers potential advantages in producing small, uniform bimetallic particles with high metal dispersions. This approach allows for better control over particle size and composition compared to traditional methods.

Overall, the molecular precursor route appears promising for preparing well-defined bimetallic catalysts, though it may be less widely applied than conventional impregnation techniques. The choice of method depends on the specific catalyst system and desired properties.

总的来说,分子前体路线似乎在制备明确定义的双金属催化剂方面很有前景,尽管它可能不如常规浸渍技术应用广泛。方法的选择取决于具体的催化剂体系和所需的性能。

The most common synthesis method for supported bimetallic catalysts is adsorption, impregnation, deposition, or precipitation of monometallic precursors onto the support, followed by an activation step like reduction. This method is widely used but can lead to issues like chromatographic separation of precursor ions in the support pores.

An alternative approach is using ligand-stabilized bimetallic molecular precursors, particularly inorganic and organometallic cluster compounds. This method involves adsorbing these precursors onto the support and then thermally removing the ligands. It can produce highly dispersed metal particles.

Each method has advantages and drawbacks. The traditional monometallic precursor method is well-established and widely applicable, but may result in inhomogeneous metal distribution. The cluster precursor method can potentially yield more uniform, highly dispersed particles, but suitable precursors are limited for some metal combinations. For example, carbonyl-ligated PtCu clusters are unavailable, while phosphine-ligated clusters can leave residues that affect catalyst properties.

Overall, the choice of method depends on the specific metals, desired properties, and availability of suitable precursors. The cluster precursor method shows promise for producing well-dispersed bimetallic particles but may be limited by precursor availability for some systems.

支持的双金属催化剂最常用的合成方法是将单金属前体吸附、浸渍、沉积或沉淀到载体上，然后进行活化步骤(通常是还原)。这种方法被广泛使用，但可能导致前体离子在载体孔隙中发生色谱分离等问题。

另一种方法是使用配体稳定的双金属分子前体，特别是无机和有机金属簇化合物。这种方法涉及将这些前体吸附到载体上，然后热去除配体。它可以产生高度分散的金属颗粒。

每种方法都有优缺点。传统的单金属前体方法已经建立并广泛适用，但可能导致金属分布不均匀。簇前体方法可能产生更均匀、高度分散的颗粒，但对某些金属组合来说，合适的前体是有限的。例如，羰基配位的PtCu簇是不可用的，而膦配位的簇可能会留下影响催化剂性能的残留物。

总的来说，方法的选择取决于特定的金属、所需的性能以及合适前体的可用性。簇前体方法在生产良好分散的双金属颗粒方面显示出前景，但对某些体系可能受到前体可用性的限制。
