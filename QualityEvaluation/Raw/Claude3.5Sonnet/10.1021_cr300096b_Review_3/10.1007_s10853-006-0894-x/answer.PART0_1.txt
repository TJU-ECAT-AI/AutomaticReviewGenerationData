[1] "Cobalt was loaded on the supports by two methods. Classical impregnation with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O was used to prepare the precursor which was subsequently dried and calcined for 1 h at 773 K in air (samples designated from here on as samples I)."

[2] "The second method applied is described by Barbier et al. [10] as ammonia method. It leads to the formation of finely dispersed cobalt oxide on the support."

[3] "Platinum was introduced by impregnation with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 on the Co-containing supports after their calcination except for the kenyaite sample (Co/Ken-AM) where impregnation was performed on the freshly prepared (not calcined) precursor."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g., Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O), followed by drying and calcination.

2. Ammonia method: This technique leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves dissolving the metal precursor in water, adding ammonia, and then adding the support material.

For the bimetallic catalysts, platinum was typically introduced by impregnation on the cobalt-containing supports after calcination.

The ammonia method appears to have an advantage in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles, which can lead to better catalytic performance in some cases. The classical impregnation method, while simpler, tends to produce larger metal oxide particles.

The choice of method can significantly affect the final catalyst properties, including particle size, dispersion, and interactions between the metal and support. These factors, in turn, influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and overall efficacy in various applications such as complete oxidation of volatile organic compounds.

该文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 经典浸渍法：这种方法包括用金属前驱体的水溶液（例如Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O）浸渍载体，然后进行干燥和焙烧。

2. 氨法：这种技术可以在载体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它包括将金属前驱体溶解在水中，加入氨，然后加入载体材料。

对于双金属催化剂，铂通常是在钴含量的载体焙烧后通过浸渍法引入的。

氨法似乎具有生产更细分散的金属氧化物颗粒的优势，这在某些情况下可以带来更好的催化性能。经典的浸渍法虽然更简单，但往往会产生更大的金属氧化物颗粒。

方法的选择可以显著影响最终催化剂的性质，包括粒径、分散度以及金属与载体之间的相互作用。这些因素反过来又影响催化剂在各种应用中的活性、选择性和整体效果，如挥发性有机化合物的完全氧化。
