[1] "Cobalt was loaded on the supports by two methods. Classical impregnation with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O was used to prepare the precursor which was subsequently dried and calcined for 1 h at 773 K in air (samples designated from here on as samples I)."

[2] "The second method applied is described by Barbier et al. [10] as ammonia method. It leads to the formation of finely dispersed cobalt oxide on the support."

[3] "Platinum was introduced by impregnation with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 on the Co-containing supports after their calcination except for the kenyaite sample (Co/Ken-AM) where impregnation was performed on the freshly prepared (not calcined) precursor."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g. Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O), followed by drying and calcination.

2. Ammonia method: This technique leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves dissolving the metal precursor in water, adding ammonia, and then adding the support material.

For bimetallic catalysts, the second metal (e.g. Pt) is typically introduced by impregnation after the first metal has been deposited and calcined.

The ammonia method appears to have an advantage in producing more finely dispersed metal particles compared to classical impregnation. This can lead to better catalytic activity in some cases. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific metals, supports, and desired catalyst properties for a given application.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts or their overall efficacy across different applications. More research would be needed to make broader conclusions about the relative advantages of different preparation techniques.

该文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 经典浸渍法：这种方法涉及将载体浸渍在金属前体(如Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O)的水溶液中，然后进行干燥和焙烧。

2. 氨法：这种技术可在载体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它包括将金属前体溶解在水中，加入氨，然后加入载体材料。

对于双金属催化剂，第二种金属(如Pt)通常在第一种金属沉积和焙烧后通过浸渍法引入。

氨法似乎在产生更细分散的金属颗粒方面具有优势，相比于经典浸渍法。在某些情况下，这可以带来更好的催化活性。然而，方法的选择可能取决于特定的金属、载体和特定应用所需的催化剂性质。

该文献并未全面比较双金属催化剂的所有合成方法，也未比较它们在不同应用中的整体效果。需要进行更多研究才能对不同制备技术的相对优势得出更广泛的结论。
