[1] "Cobalt was loaded on the supports by two methods. Classical impregnation with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O was used to prepare the precursor which was subsequently dried and calcined for 1 h at 773 K in air (samples designated from here on as samples I)."

[2] "The second method applied is described by Barbier et al. [10] as ammonia method. It leads to the formation of finely dispersed cobalt oxide on the support."

[3] "Platinum was introduced by impregnation with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 on the Co-containing supports after their calcination except for the kenyaite sample (Co/Ken-AM) where impregnation was performed on the freshly prepared (not calcined) precursor."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g., Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O), followed by drying and calcination.

2. Ammonia method: This approach leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves using ammonia to functionalize the support surface, form metal amine ions, and precipitate metal hydroxides.

For introducing the second metal (platinum in this case), impregnation with an aqueous solution of the metal precursor (e.g., Pt(NH3)4Cl2) is used.

The ammonia method appears to have an advantage in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles compared to classical impregnation. This can lead to better catalytic performance in some cases. However, the choice of method may depend on the specific metals, supports, and desired catalyst properties for a given application.

The efficacy of these methods can vary depending on factors such as the support material, metal precursors, and preparation conditions. The literature suggests that the ammonia method generally produces more active catalysts for benzene oxidation compared to the impregnation method, likely due to the finer dispersion of metal oxide particles.

文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 经典浸渍法：这种方法包括用金属前驱体的水溶液（如Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O）浸渍载体，然后进行干燥和焙烧。

2. 氨法：这种方法可以在载体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它涉及使用氨来功能化载体表面，形成金属胺离子，并沉淀金属氢氧化物。

对于引入第二种金属（在本例中为铂），使用金属前驱体的水溶液（如Pt(NH3)4Cl2）进行浸渍。

氨法似乎在产生更细分散的金属氧化物颗粒方面具有优势，相比于经典浸渍法。这在某些情况下可能导致更好的催化性能。然而，方法的选择可能取决于特定的金属、载体和特定应用所需的催化剂性质。

这些方法的有效性可能因载体材料、金属前驱体和制备条件等因素而异。文献表明，氨法通常比浸渍法制备的催化剂在苯氧化反应中表现出更高的活性，这可能是由于金属氧化物颗粒分散得更细的缘故。

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g., Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O), followed by drying and calcination.

2. Ammonia method: This technique leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves dissolving the metal precursor in water, adding ammonia, and then adding the support material.

For the bimetallic catalysts, platinum was typically introduced by impregnation on the cobalt-containing supports after calcination.

The ammonia method appears to have an advantage in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles, which can lead to better catalytic performance in some cases. The classical impregnation method, while simpler, tends to produce larger metal oxide particles.

The choice of method can significantly affect the final catalyst properties, including particle size, dispersion, and interactions between the metal and support. These factors, in turn, influence the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and overall efficacy in various applications such as complete oxidation of volatile organic compounds.

对于双金属催化剂，铂通常是在钴含量的载体焙烧后通过浸渍法引入的。

氨法似乎具有生产更细分散的金属氧化物颗粒的优势，这在某些情况下可以带来更好的催化性能。经典的浸渍法虽然更简单，但往往会产生更大的金属氧化物颗粒。

方法的选择可以显著影响最终催化剂的性质，包括粒径、分散度以及金属与载体之间的相互作用。这些因素反过来又影响催化剂在各种应用中的活性、选择性和整体效果，如挥发性有机化合物的完全氧化。

The study primarily discusses two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g., cobalt nitrate), followed by drying and calcination.

2. Ammonia method: This technique leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves a more complex process using ammonia to functionalize the support surface and form metal amine ions.

For introducing the second metal (platinum in this case), impregnation was used in both cases.

The ammonia method appears to have an advantage in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles, which can lead to better catalytic performance in some cases. However, the classical impregnation method may be simpler to implement.

The study doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of all commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts, so a full assessment of their relative advantages, applications, and overall efficacy cannot be made based solely on this literature.

这项研究主要讨论了两种支撑型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 经典浸渍法：这种方法涉及用金属前体(如硝酸钴)的水溶液浸渍载体，然后进行干燥和煅烧。

2. 氨法：这种技术导致在载体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它涉及一个更复杂的过程，使用氨来功能化载体表面并形成金属胺离子。

对于引入第二种金属(在本例中为铂)，两种情况下都使用了浸渍法。

氨法似乎在产生更细分散的金属氧化物颗粒方面具有优势，这在某些情况下可能导致更好的催化性能。然而，经典浸渍法可能更容易实施。

该研究没有提供所有常用的支撑型双金属催化剂合成方法的全面比较，因此仅基于这篇文献无法对它们的相对优势、应用和整体效果进行全面评估。

However, the choice of method may depend on the specific metals, supports, and desired catalyst properties for a given application.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts or their overall efficacy across different applications. More research would be needed to make broader conclusions about the relative advantages of different preparation techniques.

The ammonia method shows advantages in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles compared to classical impregnation. This results in better catalytic performance for monometallic cobalt catalysts prepared by the ammonia method in benzene oxidation.

However, the efficacy of these methods can vary depending on the specific support and metal combinations used. For example, the promoting effect of platinum addition was more evident for samples prepared by impregnation compared to those prepared by the ammonia method.

Overall, both methods have their applications and potential advantages, with the choice depending on the desired catalyst properties and the specific reaction being targeted.

2. 氨法：这种技术可以在支撑体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它在制备过程中使用氨来官能化支撑体表面并形成金属胺离子。

对于双金属催化剂，铂通常是通过在含钴支撑体焙烧后进行浸渍而引入的。

氨法相比经典浸渍法显示出产生更细分散金属氧化物颗粒的优势。这导致氨法制备的单金属钴催化剂在苯氧化反应中表现出更好的催化性能。

然而，这些方法的有效性可能因所使用的特定支撑体和金属组合而异。例如，与氨法制备的样品相比，铂添加对浸渍法制备的样品的促进作用更为明显。

总的来说，这两种方法都有其应用和潜在优势，选择取决于所需的催化剂性质和所针对的特定反应。
