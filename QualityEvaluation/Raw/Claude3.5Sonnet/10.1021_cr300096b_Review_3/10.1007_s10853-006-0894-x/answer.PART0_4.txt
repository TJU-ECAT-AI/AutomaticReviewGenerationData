[1] "Cobalt was loaded on the supports by two methods. Classical impregnation with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O was used to prepare the precursor which was subsequently dried and calcined for 1 h at 773 K in air (samples designated from here on as samples I)."

[2] "The second method applied is described by Barbier et al. [10] as ammonia method. It leads to the formation of finely dispersed cobalt oxide on the support."

[3] "Platinum was introduced by impregnation with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 on the Co-containing supports after their calcination except for the kenyaite sample (Co/Ken-AM) where impregnation was performed on the freshly prepared (not calcined) precursor."

The literature discusses two main synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g., Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O), followed by drying and calcination.

2. Ammonia method: This technique leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves using ammonia in the preparation process to functionalize the support surface and form metal amine ions.

For the bimetallic catalysts, platinum was typically introduced by impregnation on the cobalt-containing supports after calcination.

The ammonia method shows advantages in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles compared to classical impregnation. This results in better catalytic performance for monometallic cobalt catalysts prepared by the ammonia method in benzene oxidation.

However, the efficacy of these methods can vary depending on the specific support and metal combinations used. For example, the promoting effect of platinum addition was more evident for samples prepared by impregnation compared to those prepared by the ammonia method.

Overall, both methods have their applications and potential advantages, with the choice depending on the desired catalyst properties and the specific reaction being targeted.

该文献讨论了两种主要的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 经典浸渍法：这种方法涉及将支撑体浸渍在金属前驱体的水溶液中（如Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O），然后进行干燥和焙烧。

2. 氨法：这种技术可以在支撑体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它在制备过程中使用氨来官能化支撑体表面并形成金属胺离子。

对于双金属催化剂，铂通常是通过在含钴支撑体焙烧后进行浸渍而引入的。

氨法相比经典浸渍法显示出产生更细分散金属氧化物颗粒的优势。这导致氨法制备的单金属钴催化剂在苯氧化反应中表现出更好的催化性能。

然而，这些方法的有效性可能因所使用的特定支撑体和金属组合而异。例如，与氨法制备的样品相比，铂添加对浸渍法制备的样品的促进作用更为明显。

总的来说，这两种方法都有其应用和潜在优势，选择取决于所需的催化剂性质和所针对的特定反应。
