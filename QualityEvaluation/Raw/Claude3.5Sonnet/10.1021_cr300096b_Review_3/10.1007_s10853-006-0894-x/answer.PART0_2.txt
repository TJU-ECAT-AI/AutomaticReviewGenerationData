[1] "Cobalt was loaded on the supports by two methods. Classical impregnation with aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 · 6H2O was used to prepare the precursor which was subsequently dried and calcined for 1 h at 773 K in air (samples designated from here on as samples I)."

[2] "The second method applied is described by Barbier et al. [10] as ammonia method. It leads to the formation of finely dispersed cobalt oxide on the support."

[3] "Platinum was introduced by impregnation with aqueous solution of Pt(NH3)4Cl2 on the Co-containing supports after their calcination except for the kenyaite sample (Co/Ken-AM) where impregnation was performed on the freshly prepared (not calcined) precursor."

The study primarily discusses two synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Classical impregnation: This method involves impregnating the support with an aqueous solution of metal precursor (e.g., cobalt nitrate), followed by drying and calcination.

2. Ammonia method: This technique leads to the formation of finely dispersed metal oxide on the support. It involves a more complex process using ammonia to functionalize the support surface and form metal amine ions.

For introducing the second metal (platinum in this case), impregnation was used in both cases.

The ammonia method appears to have an advantage in producing more finely dispersed metal oxide particles, which can lead to better catalytic performance in some cases. However, the classical impregnation method may be simpler to implement.

The study doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of all commonly used synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts, so a full assessment of their relative advantages, applications, and overall efficacy cannot be made based solely on this literature.

这项研究主要讨论了两种支撑型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 经典浸渍法：这种方法涉及用金属前体(如硝酸钴)的水溶液浸渍载体，然后进行干燥和煅烧。

2. 氨法：这种技术导致在载体上形成细分散的金属氧化物。它涉及一个更复杂的过程，使用氨来功能化载体表面并形成金属胺离子。

对于引入第二种金属(在本例中为铂)，两种情况下都使用了浸渍法。

氨法似乎在产生更细分散的金属氧化物颗粒方面具有优势，这在某些情况下可能导致更好的催化性能。然而，经典浸渍法可能更容易实施。

该研究没有提供所有常用的支撑型双金属催化剂合成方法的全面比较，因此仅基于这篇文献无法对它们的相对优势、应用和整体效果进行全面评估。
