The literature discusses a few common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Catalytic reduction method: This involves a surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic catalyst and a salt of the second metal dissolved in water. It was used to prepare Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts on TiO2 support.

2. Ion exchange method: This was used to prepare the parent monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts.

3. Surface redox reaction: This is mentioned as equivalent to the catalytic reduction method, used for preparing Rh-Ge catalysts on silica and alumina supports.

The catalytic reduction method appears to be the main focus of this study. Its advantages include the ability to deposit the second metal (germanium) in great interaction with the parent metal (Rh or Pt). However, it's noted that some deposition also occurs separately on the support. This method seems effective for producing bimetallic catalysts with strong metal-metal interactions, which can be beneficial for catalytic applications. The efficacy may depend on factors like the nature of the support and the metals involved.

The ion exchange method is used for preparing monometallic catalysts, which can then serve as parent catalysts for the bimetallic preparation.

Overall, the choice of method likely depends on the desired properties of the final catalyst and the specific metals and supports being used. The catalytic reduction method appears particularly useful for creating strong interactions between the two metals in bimetallic catalysts.

文献讨论了几种常见的负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 催化还原法：这涉及到在亲本单金属催化剂上活化的氢与溶解在水中的第二种金属盐之间的表面氧化还原反应。这种方法被用来制备TiO2负载的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂。

2. 离子交换法：这种方法被用来制备亲本单金属Rh/TiO2和Pt/TiO2催化剂。

3. 表面氧化还原反应：这被提及为等同于催化还原法，用于制备硅胶和氧化铝负载的Rh-Ge催化剂。

催化还原法似乎是这项研究的主要焦点。其优点包括能够使第二种金属（锗）与亲本金属（Rh或Pt）产生强烈的相互作用。然而，也注意到一些沉积也单独发生在载体上。这种方法似乎能有效地生产具有强金属-金属相互作用的双金属催化剂，这对催化应用可能有益。其效果可能取决于载体的性质和所涉及的金属等因素。

离子交换法用于制备单金属催化剂，然后可以作为双金属制备的亲本催化剂。

总的来说，方法的选择可能取决于最终催化剂的所需性质以及所使用的特定金属和载体。催化还原法似乎特别适用于在双金属催化剂中创造两种金属之间的强相互作用。
