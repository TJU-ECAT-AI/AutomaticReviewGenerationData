The literature mentions a few common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Catalytic reduction method: This involves a surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic catalyst and a salt of the second metal dissolved in water. It was used to prepare Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts on TiO2 support.

2. Ion exchange method: This was used to prepare the monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts, which served as parent catalysts for the bimetallic synthesis.

3. Support effects: The literature mentions combining the addition of a second metal with the use of a reducible support to enhance catalyst reactivity.

The catalytic reduction method appears to be the main focus of this study. Its advantages include the ability to deposit the second metal (germanium) in close interaction with the parent metal (Rh or Pt). However, some germanium also deposited separately on the support. This method allows for controlled synthesis of bimetallic catalysts with strong metal-metal interactions.

The efficacy of these methods depends on the specific application. In this case, the catalysts were being developed for selective hydrogenation reactions. The bimetallic catalysts prepared by catalytic reduction showed promise for improving selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols in citral hydrogenation.

Overall, the choice of synthesis method can significantly impact the final catalyst structure and performance. The catalytic reduction method offers good control over bimetallic interactions but may have limitations in terms of secondary deposition on the support.

文献中提到了几种常见的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

1. 催化还原法：这涉及到在母体单金属催化剂上活化的氢气与溶解在水中的第二种金属盐之间的表面氧化还原反应。这种方法被用来制备TiO2负载的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂。

2. 离子交换法：这种方法被用来制备单金属Rh/TiO2和Pt/TiO2催化剂，作为双金属合成的母体催化剂。

3. 载体效应：文献提到将第二种金属的添加与可还原载体的使用相结合，以增强催化剂的反应活性。

催化还原法似乎是这项研究的主要焦点。它的优点包括能够将第二种金属（锗）沉积在与母体金属（Rh或Pt）密切相互作用的位置。然而，一些锗也单独沉积在载体上。这种方法允许合成具有强金属-金属相互作用的双金属催化剂。

这些方法的效果取决于具体应用。在这种情况下，开发这些催化剂是为了进行选择性加氢反应。通过催化还原法制备的双金属催化剂在柠檬醛加氢反应中显示出提高不饱和醇选择性的潜力。

总的来说，合成方法的选择可以显著影响最终催化剂的结构和性能。催化还原法对双金属相互作用提供了良好的控制，但在载体上的次级沉积方面可能存在局限性。
