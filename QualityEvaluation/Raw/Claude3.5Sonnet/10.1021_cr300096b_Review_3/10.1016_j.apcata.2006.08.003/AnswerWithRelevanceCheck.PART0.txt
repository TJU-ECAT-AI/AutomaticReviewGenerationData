          [1] "Bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts were prepared by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic rhodium or platinum catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in water (catalytic reduction method)."

          [2] "Monometallic 1.0 wt.% Rh/TiO2 and 1.0 wt.% Pt/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by an ion exchange method using RhCl3 and H2PtCl6 as described elsewhere"

          [3] "We have previously reported our investigations concerning the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral over bimetallic Rh-Ge/silica and Rh-Ge/alumina catalysts prepared by a surface redox reaction, namely the catalytic reduction method"

          [4] "Monometallic catalysts usually produce the saturated aldehyde, and it is necessary to modify them either by support effects [...] or by addition of a second metal [...] to improve the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."

          [5] "Recently, Reyes et al. [...] as well as Silva et al. [...] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."

          The literature discusses several common synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

          1. Catalytic reduction method (also called surface redox reaction): This involves a surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic catalyst and a salt of the second metal dissolved in water. It was used to prepare Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts on TiO2, silica, and alumina supports.

          2. Ion exchange method: This was used to prepare the parent monometallic Rh/TiO2 and Pt/TiO2 catalysts.

          3. Support modification: This approach uses support effects to modify the properties of the catalyst.

          4. Direct addition of a second metal: This method directly adds a second metal to the catalyst to alter its properties.

          5. Combination approach: Some researchers have combined the addition of a second metal with the use of a reducible support to enhance catalyst performance.

          The catalytic reduction method appears to be the main focus of the studies. Its advantages include:
          - Controlled deposition of the second metal onto the parent metal surface
          - Creation of strong interactions between the two metals
          - Applicability to various metal combinations (e.g., Rh-Ge, Pt-Ge) and supports (TiO2, silica, alumina)

          The main application discussed is improving selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, specifically for producing unsaturated alcohols from α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.

          Each method has its own advantages, and the choice depends on the specific application and desired catalyst properties. However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all synthesis methods in terms of overall efficacy.

          文献讨论了几种常见的负载型双金属催化剂合成方法：

          1. 催化还原法（也称为表面氧化还原反应）：这涉及到在亲本单金属催化剂上活化的氢与溶解在水中的第二种金属盐之间的表面氧化还原反应。这种方法被用来制备TiO2、二氧化硅和氧化铝负载的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂。

          2. 离子交换法：这种方法被用来制备亲本单金属Rh/TiO2和Pt/TiO2催化剂。

          3. 载体修饰法：这种方法利用载体效应来改变催化剂的性质。

          4. 直接添加第二种金属：这种方法直接向催化剂中添加第二种金属以改变其性质。

          5. 组合方法：一些研究人员将添加第二种金属与使用可还原载体相结合，以增强催化剂性能。

          催化还原法似乎是这些研究的主要焦点。其优点包括：
          - 对第二种金属在亲本金属表面上的沉积进行控制
          - 在两种金属之间创造强相互作用
          - 适用于各种金属组合（例如，Rh-Ge，Pt-Ge）和载体（TiO2，二氧化硅，氧化铝）

          讨论的主要应用是改善加氢反应的选择性，特别是从α,β-不饱和醛生产不饱和醇。

          每种方法都有其自身的优势，方法的选择取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性质。然而，文献并没有对所有合成方法进行全面比较以评估其整体效果。
