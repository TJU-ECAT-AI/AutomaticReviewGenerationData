[1] "Monometallic catalysts usually produce the saturated aldehyde, and it is necessary to modify them either by support effects [...] or by addition of a second metal [...] to improve the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."

[2] "Bimetallic catalysts were prepared by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on metal parent (Rh or Pt) particles and the germanium salt (GeCl4) dissolved in water (catalytic reduction method)."

[3] "The purpose of the preparation of bimetallic catalysts by the catalytic reduction method is to deposit germanium by redox reaction between hydrogen activated over the metal parent surface and germanium ions following the procedure described in the experimental part."

The literature primarily discusses the catalytic reduction method for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts. This method involves a surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on parent metal particles and a salt of the second metal dissolved in water. 

The main advantages of this method appear to be:

1. It allows for controlled deposition of the second metal onto the parent metal particles.
2. It can improve selectivity towards desired reactions (e.g. carbonyl bond hydrogenation).
3. It enables modification of monometallic catalysts to enhance their properties.

The paper focuses on Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge bimetallic catalysts supported on TiO2, demonstrating the method's applicability to different metal combinations and supports.

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of different synthesis methods for bimetallic catalysts. To fully answer the question about how catalytic reduction compares to other methods in terms of advantages, applications and overall efficacy would require information from additional sources.

该文献主要讨论了催化还原法合成负载型双金属催化剂。这种方法涉及亲金属颗粒上活化的氢与溶解在水中的第二种金属盐之间的表面氧化还原反应。

这种方法的主要优点似乎是：

1. 它允许对第二种金属在亲金属颗粒上进行可控沉积。
2. 它可以提高对所需反应的选择性（例如羰基键氢化）。
3. 它能够修饰单金属催化剂以增强其性能。

该论文重点研究了TiO2负载的Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge双金属催化剂，展示了该方法对不同金属组合和载体的适用性。

然而，该文献并未提供双金属催化剂不同合成方法的全面比较。要全面回答催化还原法与其他方法在优点、应用和整体效果方面的比较问题，需要来自其他来源的信息。
