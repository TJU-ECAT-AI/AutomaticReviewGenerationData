[1] "Bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts were prepared by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic rhodium or platinum catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in water (catalytic reduction method)."

[2] "The preparation of bimetallic catalysts by the catalytic reduction method consists in depositing germanium by redox reaction between hydrogen activated over the rhodium (or platinum) surface and germanium ions."

[3] "Monometallic catalysts usually produce the saturated aldehyde, and it is necessary to modify them either by support effects [...] or by addition of a second metal [...] to improve the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."

The literature primarily discusses the catalytic reduction method for synthesizing supported bimetallic catalysts. This method involves a surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic catalyst and a salt of the second metal dissolved in water. 

Other common methods mentioned briefly include:

1. Support effects: Modifying the catalyst support to improve selectivity.

2. Addition of a second metal: Directly adding a second metal to the monometallic catalyst.

The catalytic reduction method has several advantages:

1. It allows for controlled deposition of the second metal onto the parent metal surface.

2. It can create strong interactions between the two metals.

3. It can be used with various metal combinations (e.g., Rh-Ge, Pt-Ge).

The main application discussed is improving selectivity in hydrogenation reactions, specifically for producing unsaturated alcohols from α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.

While the paper focuses on the catalytic reduction method, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of all synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts. Therefore, a full assessment of the overall efficacy of different methods cannot be made based solely on this literature.

该文献主要讨论了用于合成负载型双金属催化剂的催化还原法。这种方法涉及在亲金属催化剂上活化的氢与溶解在水中的第二种金属盐之间的表面氧化还原反应。

简要提到的其他常见方法包括：

1. 载体效应：修饰催化剂载体以提高选择性。

2. 添加第二种金属：直接向单金属催化剂中添加第二种金属。

催化还原法有几个优点：

1. 它允许对第二种金属在亲金属表面上的沉积进行控制。

2. 它可以在两种金属之间创造强相互作用。

3. 它可以用于各种金属组合（例如，Rh-Ge，Pt-Ge）。

讨论的主要应用是改善加氢反应的选择性，特别是从α,β-不饱和醛生产不饱和醇。

虽然该论文重点关注催化还原法，但它并没有对所有负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法进行全面比较。因此，仅基于这篇文献无法对不同方法的整体效果进行全面评估。
