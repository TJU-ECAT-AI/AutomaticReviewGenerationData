[1] "Bimetallic TiO2-supported Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts were prepared by surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic rhodium or platinum catalyst and a germanium salt dissolved in water (catalytic reduction method)."

[2] "Monometallic catalysts usually produce the saturated aldehyde, and it is necessary to modify them either by support effects [...] or by addition of a second metal [...] to improve the selectivity towards the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."

[3] "Recently, Reyes et al. [...] as well as Silva et al. [...] have combined these two effects, that is the addition of a second metal and the use of a reducible support, in order to enhance the reactivity towards hydrogenation of unsaturated alcohols."

The literature discusses several synthesis methods for supported bimetallic catalysts:

1. Catalytic reduction method: This involves a surface redox reaction between hydrogen activated on a parent monometallic catalyst and a salt of the second metal dissolved in water. This method allows for controlled deposition of the second metal onto the first.

2. Support modification: This approach uses support effects to modify the properties of the catalyst.

3. Addition of a second metal: This method directly adds a second metal to the catalyst to alter its properties.

4. Combination approach: Some researchers have combined the addition of a second metal with the use of a reducible support to enhance catalyst performance.

Each method has its own advantages. The catalytic reduction method allows for controlled deposition and strong interaction between the two metals. Support modification can alter catalyst properties without adding a second metal. Direct addition of a second metal can be simpler but may offer less control over metal distribution. The combination approach aims to leverage multiple effects for enhanced performance.

The choice of method depends on the specific application and desired catalyst properties. The catalytic reduction method described in detail in this paper seems particularly effective for producing well-dispersed bimetallic catalysts with strong metal-metal interactions.

文献讨论了几种制备负载型双金属催化剂的合成方法：

1. 催化还原法：这种方法涉及在父体单金属催化剂上活化的氢与溶解在水中的第二种金属盐之间的表面氧化还原反应。这种方法允许对第二种金属进行受控沉积。

2. 载体修饰法：这种方法利用载体效应来改变催化剂的性质。

3. 添加第二种金属：这种方法直接向催化剂中添加第二种金属以改变其性质。

4. 组合方法：一些研究人员将添加第二种金属与使用可还原载体相结合，以增强催化剂性能。

每种方法都有其自身的优势。催化还原法允许受控沉积和两种金属之间的强相互作用。载体修饰可以在不添加第二种金属的情况下改变催化剂性质。直接添加第二种金属可能更简单，但对金属分布的控制可能较少。组合方法旨在利用多种效应来增强性能。

方法的选择取决于具体应用和所需的催化剂性质。本文详细描述的催化还原法似乎特别有效，可以生产分散良好且金属间相互作用强的双金属催化剂。
