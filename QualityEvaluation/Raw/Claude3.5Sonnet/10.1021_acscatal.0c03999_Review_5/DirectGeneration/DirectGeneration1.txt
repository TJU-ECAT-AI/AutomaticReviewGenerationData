Zeolite-supported catalysts have emerged as promising materials for CO2-based oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reactions, offering significant potential for sustainable chemical production. The optimization of these catalysts involves carefully tuning their properties to enhance performance and selectivity. Key factors include pore structure, surface area, and acidity, which can be modified through various techniques such as ion exchange, dealumination, and impregnation with metal species. Acidity modification, in particular, plays a crucial role in controlling catalyst activity and product distribution. Researchers have explored methods like alkali treatment and incorporation of basic elements to modulate the acid-base properties of zeolites. These modifications can lead to improved propylene yield, reduced coke formation, and enhanced catalyst stability. Additionally, the synergistic effects between the zeolite support and active metal species have been investigated to optimize catalyst performance. By fine-tuning these parameters, researchers aim to develop highly efficient and selective zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, contributing to more environmentally friendly and economically viable propylene production processes.
