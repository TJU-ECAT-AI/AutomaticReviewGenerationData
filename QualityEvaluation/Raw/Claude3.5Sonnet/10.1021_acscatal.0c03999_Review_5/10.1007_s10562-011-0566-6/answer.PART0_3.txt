[1] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."

[2] "It has been shown that acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of Cr species."

[3] "Steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brnsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Wide range of topologies: With over 190 different structures available, zeolites offer diverse frameworks that can be tailored to specific catalytic needs.

2. Strong hydrothermal stability: This property ensures the catalyst support remains intact under harsh reaction conditions.

3. Modifiable surface properties: The ability to adjust hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity allows for fine-tuning of catalyst-reactant interactions.

4. Unique micropore environments: These provide ideal spaces for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for catalytic reactions.

Acidity modification techniques for zeolites include:

1. Dealumination: This process removes aluminum from the zeolite framework, reducing Brønsted acidity.

2. Steaming: An efficient method for reducing Brønsted acidity in zeolites, which can contribute to enhanced reaction stability.

These modifications optimize catalytic performance by:

1. Controlling the formation of active metal species: The acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of catalytic species like chromium.

2. Enhancing stability: Reducing acidity can lead to improved catalyst stability over time.

3. Tailoring selectivity: Modifying acidity can affect product distribution and selectivity.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Initial zeolite composition: The starting Si/Al ratio and framework type will influence the effectiveness of modification techniques.

2. Desired catalytic properties: The specific reaction requirements should guide the choice of modification method.

3. Preservation of structural integrity: Modifications should maintain the zeolite's overall structure and stability.

4. Balance between acidity and metal species formation: Optimize acidity reduction while ensuring proper formation and dispersion of active metal species.

5. Reaction conditions: Consider the impact of modifications on the catalyst's performance under specific reaction environments.

By carefully selecting and implementing these acidity modification techniques, researchers can optimize zeolite-supported catalysts for improved activity, selectivity, and stability in CO2-ODHP reactions.
