[1] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."

[2] "Moreover, steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brnsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Wide range of topologies: With over 190 different structures available, zeolites offer diverse framework architectures that can be tailored to specific catalytic needs.

2. Strong hydrothermal stability: This property ensures the catalyst support remains intact under the harsh reaction conditions typically encountered in ODHP processes.

3. Modifiable surface properties: The ability to adjust hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity allows for fine-tuning of catalyst-reactant interactions.

4. Unique micropore environments: These provide ideal spaces for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for catalytic reactions.

Regarding acidity modification techniques:

1. Steaming: This is an effective method for reducing Brønsted acidity in zeolites. The resulting decrease in acidic sites can contribute to enhanced reaction stability.

2. Dealumination: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this is another common technique used to modify zeolite acidity. It involves removing aluminum from the framework, which reduces the number of acid sites.

3. Weakening methods: These can include ion exchange or isomorphous substitution of framework atoms.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Desired catalytic performance: The choice of modification technique should align with the specific reaction requirements.

2. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may respond differently to various modification techniques.

3. Stability considerations: Ensure that the chosen modification method does not compromise the overall stability of the zeolite structure.

4. Balance between acidity reduction and catalytic activity: While reducing acidity can improve stability, it's crucial to maintain sufficient activity for the desired reaction.

5. Characterization of modified zeolites: Thorough analysis of the modified supports is essential to understand the changes in properties and their impact on catalytic performance.

By carefully selecting and implementing these acidity modification techniques, researchers can optimize zeolite supports for CO2-ODHP catalysts, potentially improving both activity and stability in the process.
