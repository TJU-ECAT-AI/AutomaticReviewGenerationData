[1] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."

[2] "Borosilicate has been claimed to be an effective support to prepare vanadium-loaded catalysts for the ODH of propane [17]."

[3] "Moreover, steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brnsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Wide range of topologies: With over 190 different structures available, zeolites offer diverse framework architectures that can be tailored to specific catalytic needs.

2. Strong hydrothermal stability: This property is crucial for maintaining catalyst integrity under harsh reaction conditions.

3. Modifiable surface properties: The ability to adjust hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity allows for fine-tuning of catalyst-reactant interactions.

4. Unique micropore environments: These provide confined spaces that can stabilize transition metal complexes, which are essential for catalytic reactions.

Regarding acidity modification techniques:

1. Dealumination: This process removes aluminum from the zeolite framework, reducing Brønsted acidity. While not explicitly mentioned in the text, it is a common technique for modifying zeolite acidity.

2. Steaming: The literature notes that steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brønsted acidity in zeolites. This decrease in acidic sites contributes to enhanced reaction stability.

3. Boron incorporation: The text mentions borosilicate as an effective support for vanadium-loaded catalysts in propane ODH. Boron incorporation can modify the acidity of the zeolite support.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Controlling acid site density and strength, which can influence product selectivity and catalyst stability.
2. Enhancing the dispersion and stabilization of active metal species on the support.
3. Improving resistance to coking and other deactivation mechanisms.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. The specific requirements of the target reaction (e.g., desired product selectivity, reaction conditions).
2. The initial properties of the chosen zeolite (e.g., Si/Al ratio, pore structure).
3. The nature of the active metal species to be supported.
4. The balance between acidity reduction and maintenance of zeolite structural integrity.

In conclusion, zeolites offer a versatile platform for designing CO2-ODHP catalysts, with various modification techniques available to optimize their performance. The choice and implementation of these strategies should be carefully considered based on the specific catalytic system and desired outcomes.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 多样的拓扑结构：拥有超过190种不同的结构，沸石可以提供多种框架结构，以适应特定的催化需求。

2. 强大的水热稳定性：这一特性对于在苛刻的反应条件下维持催化剂的完整性至关重要。

3. 可调节的表面性质：调整疏水性和亲水性的能力允许对催化剂-反应物相互作用进行精细调节。

4. 独特的微孔环境：这些提供了可以稳定过渡金属络合物的受限空间，这对催化反应至关重要。

关于酸性修饰技术：

1. 脱铝：这个过程从沸石骨架中去除铝，减少Brønsted酸性。虽然文本中没有明确提到，但这是一种常见的沸石酸性修饰技术。

2. 蒸汽处理：文献指出，蒸汽处理是减少沸石Brønsted酸性的有效方法。酸性位点的减少有助于提高反应稳定性。

3. 硼掺杂：文本提到硼硅酸盐是制备钒负载催化剂用于丙烷ODH的有效支撑材料。硼的掺入可以修饰沸石支撑材料的酸性。

这些修饰通过以下方式优化催化性能：

1. 控制酸性位点的密度和强度，这可以影响产品选择性和催化剂稳定性。
2. 增强活性金属物种在支撑材料上的分散和稳定性。
3. 提高抗结焦和其他失活机制的能力。

选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 目标反应的具体要求（如期望的产品选择性、反应条件）。
2. 所选沸石的初始性质（如Si/Al比率、孔道结构）。
3. 要负载的活性金属物种的性质。
4. 酸性减少与维持沸石结构完整性之间的平衡。

总之，沸石为设计CO2-ODHP催化剂提供了一个多功能平台，有多种修饰技术可用于优化其性能。这些策略的选择和实施应基于特定的催化系统和期望的结果进行仔细考虑。
