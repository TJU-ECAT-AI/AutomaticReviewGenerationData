[1] "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."

[2] "The chromium has been introduced to a number of molecular sieves by different methods and applied to a number of catalytic reactions [1416]. It has been shown that acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of Cr species."

[3] "Moreover, steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brnsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Wide range of topologies: With over 190 different structures available, zeolites offer diverse framework architectures that can be tailored to specific catalytic needs.

2. Strong hydrothermal stability: This property is crucial for maintaining catalyst integrity under harsh reaction conditions.

3. Modifiable surface properties: The ability to adjust hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity allows for fine-tuning of catalyst-reactant interactions.

4. Unique micropore environments: These provide ideal spaces for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are essential for catalytic reactions.

Regarding acidity modification techniques:

1. Steaming: This is an effective method for reducing Brønsted acidity in zeolites. The decrease in acidic sites can contribute to enhanced reaction stability, which is particularly important for industrial applications.

2. Dealumination: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, this is a common technique for modifying zeolite acidity. It involves removing aluminum from the framework, which reduces the number of acid sites.

3. Introduction of heteroatoms: The text mentions the use of boron in the zeolite framework, which can modify the acidity and influence the nature of introduced metal species (in this case, chromium).

Key considerations for selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Desired catalytic performance: The modification technique should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the CO2-ODHP reaction, such as activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. Type of zeolite: Different zeolites may respond differently to modification techniques, so the choice should be based on the specific zeolite structure being used.

3. Nature of the active metal: As shown in the case of chromium, the acidic properties of the zeolite support can strongly influence the formation of metal species. This interaction should be considered when selecting a modification technique.

4. Reaction conditions: The hydrothermal stability of the modified zeolite should be sufficient to withstand the reaction environment.

5. Balance between acidity reduction and structural integrity: While reducing acidity can improve stability, care must be taken not to compromise the zeolite's structural integrity or its ability to stabilize active metal species.

In conclusion, the selection and implementation of acidity modification techniques for zeolites in CO2-ODHP catalysts should be a carefully considered process, taking into account the specific zeolite structure, the nature of the active metal, and the desired catalytic performance.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有几个关键优势：

1. 广泛的拓扑结构：有超过190种不同的结构可供选择，沸石提供了多样化的框架结构，可以根据特定的催化需求进行定制。

2. 强的水热稳定性：这一特性对于在苛刻的反应条件下维持催化剂的完整性至关重要。

3. 可修饰的表面性质：调节疏水性和亲水性的能力允许对催化剂-反应物相互作用进行精细调整。

4. 独特的微孔环境：这为稳定过渡金属络合物提供了理想的空间，而这些络合物对催化反应至关重要。

关于酸性修饰技术：

1. 蒸汽处理：这是一种有效降低沸石Brønsted酸性的方法。酸性位点的减少可以提高反应稳定性，这对工业应用特别重要。

2. 脱铝：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但这是一种常见的修改沸石酸性的技术。它涉及从框架中去除铝，从而减少酸性位点的数量。

3. 引入杂原子：文本提到在沸石框架中使用硼，这可以修改酸性并影响引入的金属物种（在这种情况下是铬）的性质。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 所需的催化性能：应根据CO2-ODHP反应的特定要求（如活性、选择性和稳定性）来选择修饰技术。

2. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能对修饰技术的响应不同，因此选择应基于所使用的特定沸石结构。

3. 活性金属的性质：如铬的例子所示，沸石支撑体的酸性能强烈影响金属物种的形成。在选择修饰技术时应考虑这种相互作用。

4. 反应条件：修饰后的沸石的水热稳定性应足以承受反应环境。

5. 酸性降低和结构完整性之间的平衡：虽然降低酸性可以提高稳定性，但必须注意不要损害沸石的结构完整性或其稳定活性金属物种的能力。

总之，CO2-ODHP催化剂中沸石酸性修饰技术的选择和实施应该是一个经过仔细考虑的过程，需要考虑特定的沸石结构、活性金属的性质以及所需的催化性能。
