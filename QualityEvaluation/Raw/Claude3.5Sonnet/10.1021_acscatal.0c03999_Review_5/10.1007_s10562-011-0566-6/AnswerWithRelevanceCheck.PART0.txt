          "The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."

"It has been shown that acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of Cr species."

"Moreover, steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brnsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities."

"Borosilicate has been claimed to be an effective support to prepare vanadium-loaded catalysts for the ODH of propane [17]."

          Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Wide range of topologies: With over 190 different structures available, zeolites offer diverse framework architectures that can be tailored to specific catalytic needs.

2. Strong hydrothermal stability: This property ensures catalyst longevity under harsh reaction conditions.

3. Modifiable surface properties: The ability to adjust hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity allows for fine-tuning of catalyst-reactant interactions.

4. Unique micropore environments: These provide ideal spaces for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for catalytic reactions.

Acidity modification techniques for zeolites include:

1. Dealumination: This process removes aluminum from the zeolite framework, reducing Brønsted acidity.

2. Steaming: An efficient method for reducing Brønsted acidity in zeolites, which can contribute to enhanced reaction stability.

3. Boron incorporation: Using borosilicate as a support can modify the acidity of the zeolite.

These modifications optimize catalytic performance by:

1. Controlling the formation of active metal species: The acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of catalytic species like chromium.

2. Enhancing stability: Reducing acidity can lead to improved catalyst stability over time.

3. Tailoring selectivity: Modifying acidity can affect product distribution and selectivity.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Initial zeolite composition: The starting Si/Al ratio and framework type will influence the effectiveness of modification techniques.

2. Desired catalytic properties: The specific reaction requirements should guide the choice of modification method.

3. Preservation of structural integrity: Modifications should maintain the zeolite's overall structure and stability.

4. Balance between acidity and metal species formation: Optimize acidity reduction while ensuring proper formation and dispersion of active metal species.

5. Reaction conditions: Consider the impact of modifications on the catalyst's performance under specific reaction environments.

By carefully selecting and implementing these acidity modification techniques, researchers can optimize zeolite-supported catalysts for improved activity, selectivity, and stability in CO2-ODHP reactions.

          沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有几个关键优势：

1. 拓扑结构多样性：现有超过190种不同结构，可以根据特定的催化需求选择合适的框架结构。

2. 强烈的水热稳定性：这一特性确保了催化剂在苛刻反应条件下的长期稳定性。

3. 可调节的表面性质：能够调节疏水性和亲水性，从而精细调节催化剂-反应物的相互作用。

4. 独特的微孔环境：为稳定过渡金属配合物提供了理想空间，这对催化反应至关重要。

沸石的酸性修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：这一过程从沸石骨架中移除铝，从而降低Brønsted酸性。

2. 蒸汽处理：一种有效降低沸石Brønsted酸性的方法，可以提高反应稳定性。

3. 硼掺杂：使用硼硅酸盐作为支撑材料可以修饰沸石的酸性。

这些修饰优化催化性能的方式包括：

1. 控制活性金属物种的形成：沸石支撑材料的酸性强烈影响催化物种（如铬）的形成。

2. 提高稳定性：降低酸性可以提高催化剂的长期稳定性。

3. 调整选择性：修改酸性可以影响产物分布和选择性。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 初始沸石组成：起始Si/Al比和骨架类型将影响修饰技术的有效性。

2. 所需的催化性能：特定反应要求应指导修饰方法的选择。

3. 保持结构完整性：修饰应维持沸石的整体结构和稳定性。

4. 酸性和金属物种形成之间的平衡：在确保活性金属物种适当形成和分散的同时优化酸性降低。

5. 反应条件：考虑修饰对催化剂在特定反应环境下性能的影响。

通过谨慎选择和实施这些酸性修饰技术，研究人员可以优化沸石支撑的催化剂，以提高CO2-ODHP反应的活性、选择性和稳定性。
