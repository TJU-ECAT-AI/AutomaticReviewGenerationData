[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."

[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."

[4] "Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al25) was carried out at various temperatures (600, 650 and 700 ) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol•L1 HNO3 at 95  for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600  for 6 h."

[5] "As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120350 ), strong acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600 ) and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."

[6] "The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst affords the highest yield of propylene with an initial value of 29.7%. Even after 30 h on-stream operation, a high propylene yield up to 20.3% could still be maintained for this catalyst."

Zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional micropore structure
2. Large specific surface area
3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability
4. Resistance to coking due to medium pore size and channel structure

These properties make zeolites excellent candidates for catalyst supports in the petrochemical industry.

Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance. The main strategies discussed in the literature are:

1. Steaming treatment: This involves exposing the zeolite to high-temperature steam, followed by acid washing. This process reduces the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites.

2. Acid washing: Treating the steamed zeolite with HNO3 further modifies the acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Inhibiting oligomerization of propylene, which leads to enhanced propylene yield
2. Reducing coke formation, thus improving catalyst stability

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Temperature of steaming treatment: Higher temperatures lead to lower acidity, but there's an optimal point (650°C in this study) that balances acidity reduction with maintaining catalytic activity.

2. Duration of steaming and acid washing: These parameters need to be optimized for each zeolite type.

3. Si/Al ratio of the parent zeolite: This affects the initial acidity and the extent of modification needed.

4. Desired balance between activity and stability: More severe acidity reduction may improve stability but could potentially reduce initial activity.

5. Type of reaction: Different reactions may require different levels of acidity modification.

By carefully controlling these factors, researchers can tailor the acidity of zeolite supports to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, balancing high activity with improved stability and selectivity.

沸石，特别是ZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 三维微孔结构
2. 大比表面积
3. 高热稳定性和水热稳定性
4. 由于中等孔径和通道结构而具有抗结焦能力

这些特性使沸石成为石油化工行业催化剂支撑材料的优秀候选者。

酸性修饰技术，如脱铝和减弱方法，在优化催化性能方面起着关键作用。文献中讨论的主要策略包括：

1. 蒸汽处理：将沸石暴露在高温蒸汽中，然后进行酸洗。这个过程减少了Brønsted酸性位的数量和强度。

2. 酸洗：用HNO3处理蒸汽处理后的沸石进一步修饰酸性。

这些修饰通过以下方式优化催化性能：

1. 抑制丙烯的低聚反应，从而提高丙烯产率
2. 减少结焦形成，从而提高催化剂稳定性

选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 蒸汽处理温度：更高的温度导致更低的酸性，但存在一个最佳点（本研究中为650°C），在酸性降低和保持催化活性之间取得平衡。

2. 蒸汽处理和酸洗的持续时间：这些参数需要针对每种沸石类型进行优化。

3. 母体沸石的Si/Al比：这影响初始酸性和所需的修饰程度。

4. 活性和稳定性之间的理想平衡：更严格的酸性降低可能会提高稳定性，但可能会降低初始活性。

5. 反应类型：不同的反应可能需要不同程度的酸性修饰。

通过仔细控制这些因素，研究人员可以调整沸石支撑材料的酸性，以在CO2-ODHP反应中获得最佳性能，在高活性、改善的稳定性和选择性之间取得平衡。
