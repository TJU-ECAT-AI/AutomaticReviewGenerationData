[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."

[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."

[4] "Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al25) was carried out at various temperatures (600, 650 and 700 ) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol•L1 HNO3 at 95  for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600  for 6 h."

[5] "It can be seen that the activity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid sites."

[6] "The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support."

Zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional micropore structure
2. Large specific surface area
3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability
4. Resistance to coking due to medium pore size and channel structure

The study focuses on acidity modification techniques for HZSM-5, primarily through steaming treatment and acid washing. These modifications aim to optimize catalytic performance by:

1. Reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites
2. Inhibiting propylene oligomerization
3. Enhancing propylene yield
4. Improving catalyst stability

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Steaming temperature: The study tested temperatures of 600°C, 650°C, and 700°C
2. Steaming duration: 6 hours in this study
3. Acid washing: Using 1 mol/L HNO3 at 95°C for 24 hours
4. Post-treatment calcination: At 600°C for 6 hours

The optimal conditions found in this study were steaming at 650°C, which provided an appropriate balance between ZnO dispersion and Brønsted acidity. This resulted in the best catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation to propylene.

When implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites, it's crucial to consider:

1. The initial Si/Al ratio of the zeolite
2. The desired level of dealumination
3. The target acidity for the specific reaction
4. The impact on the zeolite's structural integrity
5. The interaction between the modified support and the active metal (e.g., ZnO in this case)

By carefully tuning these parameters, researchers can optimize zeolite supports for CO2-ODHP catalysts, balancing acidity reduction with maintenance of desirable structural properties.

The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."

[6] "The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst affords the highest yield of propylene with an initial value of 29.7%. Even after 30 h on-stream operation, a high propylene yield up to 20.3% could still be maintained for this catalyst."

2. Reducing coke formation, thus improving catalyst stability

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Temperature of steaming treatment: Higher temperatures lead to lower acidity, but there's an optimal point (650°C in this study) that balances acidity reduction with maintaining catalytic activity.

2. Duration of steaming and acid washing: These parameters need to be optimized for each zeolite type.

3. Si/Al ratio of the parent zeolite: This affects the initial acidity and the extent of modification needed.

4. Desired balance between activity and stability: More severe acidity reduction may improve stability but could potentially reduce initial activity.

5. Type of reaction: Different reactions may require different levels of acidity modification.

By carefully controlling these factors, researchers can tailor the acidity of zeolite supports to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODHP reactions, balancing high activity with improved stability and selectivity.

Zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional micropore structure
2. Large specific surface area
3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability
4. Medium pore size and channel structure that resists coking

These properties make zeolites excellent catalyst supports, providing a stable framework for active metal species and allowing for efficient mass transfer of reactants and products.

Acidity modification techniques for zeolites, such as dealumination and weakening methods, are crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The main strategies include:

1. Steaming treatment: This involves exposing the zeolite to high-temperature steam, followed by acid washing. This process removes framework aluminum, reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites.

2. Acid washing: Treatment with mineral acids like HNO3 further removes aluminum from the zeolite framework, decreasing acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Suppressing side reactions: Reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites inhibits unwanted reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and cracking.

2. Enhancing propylene yield: By suppressing side reactions, the selectivity towards the desired propylene product is increased.

3. Improving catalyst stability: Decreased acidity leads to reduced coke formation, resulting in superior long-term stability of the catalyst.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches based on their initial composition and structure.

2. Desired acidity level: The extent of modification should be carefully controlled to achieve the optimal balance between activity and selectivity.

3. Treatment conditions: Factors such as steaming temperature, duration, and acid concentration must be optimized for each specific zeolite and application.

4. Preservation of zeolite structure: Modifications should maintain the beneficial properties of the zeolite, such as its pore structure and surface area.

5. Metal-support interactions: The modified acidity should promote favorable interactions between the active metal species and the zeolite support.

By carefully considering these factors and implementing appropriate acidity modification techniques, researchers can tailor zeolite supports to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODHP catalysts, balancing high activity, selectivity, and stability.
