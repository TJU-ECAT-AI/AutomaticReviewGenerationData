[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."

[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brønsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."

[4] "Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al≈25) was carried out at various temperatures (600, 650 and 700 ℃) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol•L−1 HNO3 at 95 ℃ for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 ℃ for 6 h."

[5] "As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120–350 ℃), strong acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350–600 ℃) and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."

[6] "Therefore, the decrease in the number of Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst would suppress the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization, thus leading to the high propylene yield and superior stability due to the decrease in coke formation on the catalyst surface."

Zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional micropore structure
2. Large specific surface area
3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability
4. Medium pore size and channel structure that resists coking

These properties make zeolites excellent catalyst supports, providing a stable framework for active metal species and allowing for efficient mass transfer of reactants and products.

Acidity modification techniques for zeolites, such as dealumination and weakening methods, are crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The main strategies include:

1. Steaming treatment: This involves exposing the zeolite to high-temperature steam, followed by acid washing. This process removes framework aluminum, reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites.

2. Acid washing: Treatment with mineral acids like HNO3 further removes aluminum from the zeolite framework, decreasing acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Suppressing side reactions: Reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites inhibits unwanted reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and cracking.

2. Enhancing propylene yield: By suppressing side reactions, the selectivity towards the desired propylene product is increased.

3. Improving catalyst stability: Decreased acidity leads to reduced coke formation, resulting in superior long-term stability of the catalyst.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches based on their initial composition and structure.

2. Desired acidity level: The extent of modification should be carefully controlled to achieve the optimal balance between activity and selectivity.

3. Treatment conditions: Factors such as steaming temperature, duration, and acid concentration must be optimized for each specific zeolite and application.

4. Preservation of zeolite structure: Modifications should maintain the beneficial properties of the zeolite, such as its pore structure and surface area.

5. Metal-support interactions: The modified acidity should promote favorable interactions between the active metal species and the zeolite support.

By carefully considering these factors and implementing appropriate acidity modification techniques, researchers can tailor zeolite supports to achieve optimal performance in CO2-ODHP catalysts, balancing high activity, selectivity, and stability.

沸石，特别是ZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有几个关键优势：

1. 三维微孔结构
2. 大比表面积
3. 高热稳定性和水热稳定性
4. 中等孔径和孔道结构，有助于抗结焦

这些特性使沸石成为优秀的催化剂载体，为活性金属物种提供稳定的框架，并允许反应物和产物的高效传质。

沸石的酸性修饰技术，如脱铝和弱化方法，对于优化CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能至关重要。主要策略包括：

1. 蒸汽处理：将沸石暴露在高温蒸汽中，随后进行酸洗。这个过程去除骨架铝，减少Brønsted酸位的数量和强度。

2. 酸洗：用硝酸等矿酸处理进一步去除沸石骨架中的铝，降低酸度。

这些修饰有助于优化催化性能，具体表现在：

1. 抑制副反应：减少Brønsted酸位的数量和强度，抑制不需要的反应，如寡聚、环化和裂解。

2. 提高丙烯产率：通过抑制副反应，提高了目标产物丙烯的选择性。

3. 改善催化剂稳定性：降低酸度导致结焦减少，从而提高催化剂的长期稳定性。

选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要基于其初始组成和结构的不同修饰方法。

2. 所需酸度水平：应仔细控制修饰程度，以达到活性和选择性之间的最佳平衡。

3. 处理条件：蒸汽温度、持续时间和酸浓度等因素必须针对每种特定沸石和应用进行优化。

4. 保持沸石结构：修饰应保持沸石的有益特性，如其孔结构和比表面积。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：修饰后的酸度应促进活性金属物种与沸石载体之间的有利相互作用。

通过仔细考虑这些因素并实施适当的酸性修饰技术，研究人员可以定制沸石载体，以在CO2-ODHP催化剂中实现最佳性能，平衡高活性、选择性和稳定性。
