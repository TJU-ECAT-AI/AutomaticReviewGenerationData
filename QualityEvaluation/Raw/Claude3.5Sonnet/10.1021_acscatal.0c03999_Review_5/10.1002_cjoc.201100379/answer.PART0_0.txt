[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."

[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."

[4] "Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al25) was carried out at various temperatures (600, 650 and 700 ) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol•L1 HNO3 at 95  for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600  for 6 h."

[5] "It can be seen that the activity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid sites."

[6] "The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support."

Zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional micropore structure
2. Large specific surface area
3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability
4. Resistance to coking due to medium pore size and channel structure

The study focuses on acidity modification techniques for HZSM-5, primarily through steaming treatment and acid washing. These modifications aim to optimize catalytic performance by:

1. Reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites
2. Inhibiting propylene oligomerization
3. Enhancing propylene yield
4. Improving catalyst stability

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Steaming temperature: The study tested temperatures of 600°C, 650°C, and 700°C
2. Steaming duration: 6 hours in this study
3. Acid washing: Using 1 mol/L HNO3 at 95°C for 24 hours
4. Post-treatment calcination: At 600°C for 6 hours

The optimal conditions found in this study were steaming at 650°C, which provided an appropriate balance between ZnO dispersion and Brønsted acidity. This resulted in the best catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation to propylene.

When implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites, it's crucial to consider:

1. The initial Si/Al ratio of the zeolite
2. The desired level of dealumination
3. The target acidity for the specific reaction
4. The impact on the zeolite's structural integrity
5. The interaction between the modified support and the active metal (e.g., ZnO in this case)

By carefully tuning these parameters, researchers can optimize zeolite supports for CO2-ODHP catalysts, balancing acidity reduction with maintenance of desirable structural properties.

沸石，尤其是ZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 三维微孔结构
2. 大比表面积
3. 高热稳定性和水热稳定性
4. 由于中等孔径和通道结构而具有抗结焦性

该研究主要关注HZSM-5的酸性修饰技术，主要通过蒸汽处理和酸洗。这些修饰旨在通过以下方式优化催化性能：

1. 减少Brønsted酸位的数量和强度
2. 抑制丙烯的寡聚反应
3. 提高丙烯产率
4. 改善催化剂稳定性

选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 蒸汽处理温度：研究测试了600°C、650°C和700°C
2. 蒸汽处理时间：本研究中为6小时
3. 酸洗：使用1 mol/L HNO3，在95°C下处理24小时
4. 后处理煅烧：在600°C下煅烧6小时

本研究发现的最佳条件是在650°C下进行蒸汽处理，这在ZnO分散性和Brønsted酸性之间提供了适当的平衡。这导致了丙烷脱氢制丙烯的最佳催化性能。

在为不同类型的沸石实施这些策略时，需要考虑以下几点：

1. 沸石的初始Si/Al比
2. 所需的脱铝程度
3. 特定反应的目标酸度
4. 对沸石结构完整性的影响
5. 改性支撑材料与活性金属（如本例中的ZnO）之间的相互作用

通过仔细调整这些参数，研究人员可以优化CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石支撑材料，在酸度降低和保持理想结构性能之间取得平衡。
