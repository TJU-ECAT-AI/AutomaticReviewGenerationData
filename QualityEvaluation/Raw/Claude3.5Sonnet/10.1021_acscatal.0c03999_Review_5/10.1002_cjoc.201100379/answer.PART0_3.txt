[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."

[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."

[4] "Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al25) was carried out at various temperatures (600, 650 and 700 ) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol•L1 HNO3 at 95  for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600  for 6 h."

[5] "The activity decreases markedly after steaming treatment. This is indicative of the removal of some framework Al atoms in the HZSM-5 zeolite upon steaming treatment, since cumene cracking is catalyzed only by the Brnsted acid sites."

[6] "The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst affords the highest yield of propylene with an initial value of 29.7%. Even after 30 h on-stream operation, a high propylene yield up to 20.3% could still be maintained for this catalyst."

Zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional micropore structure
2. Large specific surface area
3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability
4. Medium pore size and channel structure that resists coking

These properties make zeolites excellent catalyst supports, providing a stable framework for active species and facilitating desired reactions while inhibiting unwanted side reactions.

Acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods, are crucial for optimizing catalytic performance. The main strategies discussed in this study include:

1. Steaming treatment: This involves exposing the zeolite to high-temperature steam, followed by acid washing. This process removes some framework aluminum atoms, reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites.

2. Acid washing: After steaming, the zeolite is washed with nitric acid, further modifying its acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites, which inhibits unwanted side reactions like propylene oligomerization.
2. Enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability by suppressing coke formation.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches. This study focused on HZSM-5.
2. Desired acidity level: The optimal acidity depends on the specific reaction. For propane dehydrogenation, moderate acidity is preferred.
3. Treatment conditions: Parameters like steaming temperature and duration, as well as acid concentration and washing time, need to be optimized.
4. Balance between acidity reduction and maintaining catalyst activity: Excessive dealumination can lead to loss of catalytic activity.

In this study, the optimal treatment for HZSM-5 was steaming at 650°C, which provided the best balance between reduced acidity and maintained catalytic activity, resulting in the highest propylene yield and catalyst stability.

沸石，尤其是ZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 三维微孔结构
2. 大比表面积
3. 高热稳定性和水热稳定性
4. 中等孔径和孔道结构，能够抑制结焦

这些特性使沸石成为优秀的催化剂载体，为活性物种提供稳定的框架，促进所需反应的同时抑制不良副反应。

酸性修饰技术，如脱铝和减弱方法，对于优化催化性能至关重要。本研究讨论的主要策略包括：

1. 蒸汽处理：将沸石暴露在高温蒸汽中，然后进行酸洗。这一过程会去除一些骨架铝原子，减少Brønsted酸位的数量和强度。

2. 酸洗：蒸汽处理后，用硝酸洗涤沸石，进一步修饰其酸性。

这些修饰对优化催化性能的贡献包括：

1. 减少Brønsted酸位的数量和强度，抑制丙烯寡聚等不良副反应。
2. 通过抑制积碳形成，提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要不同的修饰方法。本研究聚焦于HZSM-5。
2. 所需酸度水平：最佳酸度取决于特定反应。对于丙烷脱氢，中等酸度更为合适。
3. 处理条件：需要优化蒸汽处理温度和时间，以及酸浓度和洗涤时间等参数。
4. 酸度降低与保持催化活性之间的平衡：过度脱铝可能导致催化活性丧失。

在本研究中，HZSM-5的最佳处理条件是在650°C进行蒸汽处理，这在降低酸度和保持催化活性之间取得了最佳平衡，从而获得最高的丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性。
