[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."

[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."

[4] "Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al25) was carried out at various temperatures (600, 650 and 700 ) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol•L1 HNO3 at 95  for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600  for 6 h."

[5] "As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120350 ), strong acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350600 ) and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."

[6] "Therefore, the decrease in the number of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst would suppress the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization, thus leading to the high propylene yield and superior stability due to the decrease in coke formation on the catalyst surface."

Zeolites, particularly ZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional micropore structure
2. Large specific surface area
3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability
4. Resistance to coking due to medium pore size and channel structure

The main acidity modification technique discussed in this literature is steaming treatment, which is a form of dealumination. This process involves exposing the zeolite to high-temperature steam, followed by acid washing. The key considerations in implementing this strategy include:

1. Temperature of steaming: Higher temperatures lead to more extensive dealumination and lower acidity.
2. Duration of steaming: Longer treatment times can result in more pronounced effects.
3. Post-treatment acid washing: This helps remove extra-framework aluminum species.

The modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Reducing the number and strength of Brønsted acid sites
2. Inhibiting side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking, and aromatization
3. Enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability
4. Decreasing coke formation on the catalyst surface

When selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites, it's crucial to consider:

1. The initial Si/Al ratio of the zeolite
2. The desired level of acidity reduction
3. The specific requirements of the catalytic reaction
4. The balance between acidity reduction and maintenance of zeolite structure

Overall, the goal is to tailor the acidity of the zeolite support to achieve optimal catalytic performance while maintaining the beneficial structural properties of the zeolite.

沸石，尤其是ZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 三维微孔结构
2. 大比表面积
3. 高热稳定性和水热稳定性
4. 由于中等孔径和孔道结构而具有抗结焦性

本文献中讨论的主要酸性改性技术是蒸汽处理，这是一种脱铝方法。该过程包括将沸石暴露在高温蒸汽中，然后进行酸洗。实施这一策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 蒸汽处理温度：更高的温度会导致更广泛的脱铝和更低的酸性
2. 蒸汽处理时间：处理时间越长，效果可能越显著
3. 后处理酸洗：这有助于去除骨架外铝物种

这些改性有助于优化催化性能，具体表现为：

1. 减少Brønsted酸位的数量和强度
2. 抑制副反应，如寡聚、环化、裂解和芳构化
3. 提高丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性
4. 减少催化剂表面的积碳形成

在为不同类型的沸石选择和实施这些策略时，需要考虑以下几点：

1. 沸石的初始硅铝比
2. 所需的酸性降低程度
3. 催化反应的特定要求
4. 酸性降低和沸石结构维持之间的平衡

总的来说，目标是调整沸石支撑材料的酸性，以在保持沸石有益结构特性的同时实现最佳催化性能。
