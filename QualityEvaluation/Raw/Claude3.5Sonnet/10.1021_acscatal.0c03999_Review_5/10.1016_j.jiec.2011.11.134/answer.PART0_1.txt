[1] "In our previous work, HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was found to be highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased"

[2] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking"

[3] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."

[4] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."

[5] "The selectivity on Ga2O3/HZSM-48 was much higher than that on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 at low propane conversion. With the increase of propane conversion, the selectivity difference became smaller."

[6] "The differences in deactivation between Ga2O3/HZSM-48(130) and Ga2O3/HZSM-5(200) could be caused by different coke amount deposited on the catalysts."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and pore structures. Key properties that make them suitable include:

1. Adjustable Si/Al ratio: This allows control over the number and strength of acid sites. Increasing the Si/Al ratio decreases acidity, which can improve propene selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Medium pore size: This helps reduce side reactions like aromatization.

3. Weak acidity: This suppresses unwanted side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, and cracking.

Acidity modification techniques for optimizing catalytic performance include:

1. Dealumination: Increasing the Si/Al ratio by removing framework aluminum. This reduces the number of acid sites, especially strong ones.

2. Ion exchange: Replacing protons with other cations to weaken acidity.

3. Synthesis with high Si/Al ratios: Directly preparing zeolites with fewer acid sites.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies:

1. Balance between activity and selectivity: While reducing acidity improves selectivity, it may decrease overall activity. An optimal balance is needed.

2. Pore structure: Different zeolite types (e.g., HZSM-5 vs HZSM-48) have different pore geometries, affecting product diffusion and coke formation.

3. Stability: Weaker acidity can improve selectivity but may lead to faster deactivation due to coke formation on weak acid sites.

4. Reaction conditions: The optimal acidity may vary depending on reaction temperature, pressure, and feed composition.

5. Support-metal interaction: Acidity modifications can affect the interaction between the active metal (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support, influencing catalyst performance.

In conclusion, careful tuning of zeolite acidity through various modification techniques is crucial for optimizing CO2-ODHP catalyst performance, balancing activity, selectivity, and stability based on the specific zeolite type and reaction conditions.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的优良载体材料，主要归功于其可调节的酸度和孔结构。使其适用的关键特性包括：

1. 可调节的Si/Al比：这允许控制酸性位点的数量和强度。增加Si/Al比可降低酸度，从而提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 中等孔径：这有助于减少芳构化等副反应。

3. 弱酸性：这抑制了不需要的副反应，如寡聚、环化和裂解。

用于优化催化性能的酸度改性技术包括：

1. 脱铝：通过移除骨架铝来增加Si/Al比。这减少了酸性位点的数量，尤其是强酸性位点。

2. 离子交换：用其他阳离子替换质子以减弱酸度。

3. 高Si/Al比合成：直接制备具有较少酸性位点的沸石。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素：

1. 活性和选择性之间的平衡：虽然降低酸度可以提高选择性，但可能会降低整体活性。需要找到最佳平衡点。

2. 孔结构：不同类型的沸石（如HZSM-5与HZSM-48）具有不同的孔道几何结构，影响产物扩散和积碳形成。

3. 稳定性：较弱的酸度可以提高选择性，但可能由于弱酸性位点上的积碳形成而导致更快的失活。

4. 反应条件：最佳酸度可能因反应温度、压力和进料组成而异。

5. 载体-金属相互作用：酸度修饰可能影响活性金属（如Ga2O3）与沸石载体之间的相互作用，从而影响催化剂性能。

总之，通过各种改性技术仔细调节沸石酸度对于优化CO2-ODHP催化剂性能至关重要，需要根据特定的沸石类型和反应条件来平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。
