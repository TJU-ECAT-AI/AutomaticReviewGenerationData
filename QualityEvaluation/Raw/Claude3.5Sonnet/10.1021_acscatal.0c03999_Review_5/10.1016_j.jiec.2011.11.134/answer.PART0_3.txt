[1] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking"

[2] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."

[3] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."

[4] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength."

[5] "The number of both weak and strong acid sites decreases sharply with the increasing of Si/Al ratio. This decreasing may come from two aspects: the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-48 support directly related to the framework Al species; or on gallium oxides caused by weakening the interaction between the gallia and support."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and pore structure. The key properties that make them suitable are:

1. Adjustable acidity: By modifying the Si/Al ratio, the number and strength of acid sites can be controlled. This is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance.

2. Pore structure: Medium pore size zeolites like ZSM-48 can help reduce side reactions such as aromatization.

3. Stability: Proper acidity modification can enhance catalyst stability.

Acidity modification techniques include:

1. Dealumination: Increasing the Si/Al ratio reduces the number of acid sites, especially strong acid sites. This can be achieved through various methods like steaming or chemical treatments.

2. Weakening methods: These aim to reduce the acid strength without necessarily removing aluminum from the framework. Ion exchange or isomorphous substitution can be used for this purpose.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Improving selectivity: Reducing strong acid sites suppresses side reactions like oligomerization and cracking, leading to higher propene selectivity.

2. Enhancing stability: Fewer strong acid sites can reduce coke formation, improving catalyst longevity.

3. Balancing activity and selectivity: While reducing acidity generally decreases activity, it often improves selectivity. Finding the optimal balance is key.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites respond differently to modifications. For example, ZSM-48 and ZSM-5 show different behaviors after similar treatments.

2. Desired catalytic properties: The modification strategy should align with the target reaction. For propane dehydrogenation, weak to medium acidity is generally preferred.

3. Preservation of structure: Modification techniques should not significantly compromise the zeolite's structural integrity or desired pore characteristics.

4. Interaction with active phase: The impact of acidity modification on the interaction between the support and the active phase (e.g., Ga2O3) should be considered.

5. Economic feasibility: The cost and complexity of the modification process should be weighed against the performance improvements.

In conclusion, while acidity modification of zeolites offers significant potential for optimizing CO2-ODHP catalysts, careful consideration of the specific zeolite properties, desired catalytic performance, and practical implementation factors is necessary to develop effective catalysts.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想载体材料，主要原因在于其可调节的酸性和孔结构。使其适用的关键特性包括：

1. 可调酸性：通过调整Si/Al比，可以控制酸性位点的数量和强度。这对于优化催化性能至关重要。

2. 孔结构：像ZSM-48这样的中孔沸石可以帮助减少芳构化等副反应。

3. 稳定性：适当的酸性调节可以增强催化剂的稳定性。

酸性修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：增加Si/Al比可以减少酸性位点的数量，特别是强酸性位点。这可以通过蒸汽处理或化学处理等多种方法实现。

2. 弱化方法：这些方法旨在降低酸强度，而不必从骨架中移除铝。可以使用离子交换或同晶置换来实现这一目的。

这些修饰有助于优化催化性能，具体表现在：

1. 提高选择性：减少强酸性位点可抑制寡聚和裂解等副反应，从而提高丙烯选择性。

2. 增强稳定性：较少的强酸性位点可以减少积碳形成，提高催化剂寿命。

3. 平衡活性和选择性：虽然降低酸性通常会降低活性，但往往会提高选择性。找到最佳平衡点是关键。

选择和实施这些策略时的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石对修饰的反应不同。例如，ZSM-48和ZSM-5在经过类似处理后表现出不同的行为。

2. 期望的催化性能：修饰策略应与目标反应相一致。对于丙烷脱氢，通常倾向于弱到中等酸性。

3. 结构保持：修饰技术不应显著损害沸石的结构完整性或所需的孔特性。

4. 与活性相的相互作用：应考虑酸性修饰对载体与活性相（如Ga2O3）之间相互作用的影响。

5. 经济可行性：应权衡修饰过程的成本和复杂性与性能改进。

总之，虽然沸石的酸性修饰为优化CO2-ODHP催化剂提供了重要潜力，但需要仔细考虑特定沸石性质、期望的催化性能和实际实施因素，以开发出有效的催化剂。
