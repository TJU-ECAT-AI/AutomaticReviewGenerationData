[1] "In our previous work, HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was found to be highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased"

[2] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking"

[3] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."

[4] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."

[5] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. However, their stabilities are not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and pore structure. Key properties that make them suitable include:

1. Adjustable Si/Al ratio: This allows control over the number and strength of acid sites. Higher Si/Al ratios generally lead to fewer and weaker acid sites.

2. Pore size and structure: Medium pore size zeolites with appropriate channel systems can provide shape selectivity and influence product distribution.

3. Thermal and hydrothermal stability: Important for maintaining catalyst performance under reaction conditions.

Acidity modification techniques for optimizing catalytic performance include:

1. Dealumination: Removing framework aluminum to increase Si/Al ratio, reducing the number of acid sites and their strength.

2. Ion exchange: Replacing protons with other cations to modify acid strength.

3. Synthesis with high Si/Al ratios: Directly preparing zeolites with fewer acid sites.

4. Post-synthesis treatments: Such as steaming or acid leaching to modify acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Enhancing selectivity: Weaker acidity suppresses side reactions like oligomerization and cracking, improving propene selectivity.

2. Improving stability: Reducing strong acid sites can decrease coke formation and extend catalyst lifetime.

3. Tuning activity: Balancing the number of acid sites to achieve optimal conversion levels.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites respond differently to modifications. For example, HZSM-48 showed higher propene selectivity but lower stability compared to HZSM-5.

2. Desired catalytic properties: The balance between activity, selectivity, and stability should be considered when choosing modification techniques.

3. Pore structure preservation: Ensure that acidity modifications do not significantly alter the zeolite's pore structure, which can impact shape selectivity and diffusion.

4. Reaction conditions: The optimal acidity may vary depending on reaction temperature, feed composition, and the presence of co-reactants like CO2.

5. Characterization: Thorough analysis of modified zeolites is crucial to understand the impact of treatments on acidity, porosity, and other relevant properties.

In summary, careful selection and implementation of acidity modification techniques can significantly enhance the performance of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP, but must be tailored to the specific zeolite type and desired catalytic outcomes.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，主要是因为它们可调节的酸性和孔结构。使它们适用的关键特性包括：

1. 可调节的Si/Al比：这允许控制酸性位点的数量和强度。较高的Si/Al比通常会导致更少和更弱的酸性位点。

2. 孔径和结构：中等孔径的沸石具有适当的通道系统，可以提供形状选择性并影响产品分布。

3. 热稳定性和水热稳定性：对于在反应条件下保持催化剂性能很重要。

优化催化性能的酸性修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：去除骨架铝以增加Si/Al比，减少酸性位点的数量和强度。

2. 离子交换：用其他阳离子替换质子以修改酸强度。

3. 高Si/Al比合成：直接制备具有较少酸性位点的沸石。

4. 后合成处理：如蒸汽处理或酸浸出以修改酸性。

这些修饰有助于优化催化性能，通过：

1. 提高选择性：较弱的酸性抑制了如寡聚和裂解等副反应，提高丙烯选择性。

2. 改善稳定性：减少强酸位可以减少积碳形成并延长催化剂寿命。

3. 调节活性：平衡酸性位点的数量以达到最佳转化水平。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石对修饰的反应不同。例如，HZSM-48显示出较高的丙烯选择性但稳定性较低，相比于HZSM-5。

2. 所需的催化性能：在选择修饰技术时应考虑活性、选择性和稳定性之间的平衡。

3. 孔结构保持：确保酸性修饰不会显著改变沸石的孔结构，这可能影响形状选择性和扩散。

4. 反应条件：最佳酸性可能因反应温度、进料组成和CO2等共反应物的存在而变化。

5. 表征：对修饰后的沸石进行彻底分析对于理解处理对酸性、孔隙度和其他相关性质的影响至关重要。

总之，仔细选择和实施酸性修饰技术可以显著提高沸石支撑的CO2-ODHP催化剂的性能，但必须根据特定的沸石类型和所需的催化结果进行定制。
