[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19], is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."

[2] "The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio under identical conditions, since acid strength of the former is weaker than that of the latter, and our previous results revealed that the acid sites with medium-strong and strong strength could enhance the dehydrogenation by a surface migration reaction [7]."

[3] "However, the selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization."

[4] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking [11]."

[5] "The number of both weak and strong acid sites decreases sharply with the increasing of Si/Al ratio. This decreasing may come from two aspects: the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-48 support directly related to the framework Al species; or on gallium oxides caused by weakening the interaction between the gallia and support."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique pore structures and tunable acidity. Key properties that make them valuable include:

1. Pore geometry: Zeolites like ZSM-48 have well-defined channel systems that can influence product selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Adjustable acidity: The acid strength and density of zeolites can be modified by changing the Si/Al ratio or through post-synthesis treatments.

3. High thermal stability: Zeolites can withstand the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation reactions.

Acidity modification techniques for optimizing catalytic performance include:

1. Dealumination: Removing framework aluminum to increase the Si/Al ratio, which reduces the number and strength of acid sites.

2. Ion exchange: Replacing protons with other cations to alter the type and strength of acid sites.

3. Synthesis with high Si/Al ratios: Directly preparing zeolites with lower aluminum content to achieve weaker acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Improving selectivity: Weaker acidity can suppress undesired side reactions like oligomerization and cracking, enhancing propene selectivity.

2. Balancing activity and stability: While strong acidity can enhance dehydrogenation activity, it may also promote coke formation. Moderate acidity can provide a good balance.

3. Tailoring pore environment: Acidity modifications can alter the interaction between the active metal (e.g., Ga2O3) and the support, influencing catalytic properties.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches based on their initial properties and desired outcomes.

2. Target reaction: The optimal acidity for CO2-ODHP may differ from other reactions, necessitating careful tuning.

3. Maintaining structural integrity: Some modification techniques may affect the zeolite's crystallinity or pore structure, which should be monitored and controlled.

4. Balancing multiple factors: Acidity modifications should be considered alongside other factors like metal loading, preparation method, and reaction conditions to achieve optimal overall performance.
