[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19], is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."

[2] "The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio under identical conditions, since acid strength of the former is weaker than that of the latter, and our previous results revealed that the acid sites with medium-strong and strong strength could enhance the dehydrogenation by a surface migration reaction [7]."

[3] "However, the selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization."

[4] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking [11]."

[5] "The number of both weak and strong acid sites decreases sharply with the increasing of Si/Al ratio. This decreasing may come from two aspects: the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-48 support directly related to the framework Al species; or on gallium oxides caused by weakening the interaction between the gallia and support."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique pore structures and tunable acidity. Key properties that make them valuable include:

1. Pore geometry: Zeolites like ZSM-48 have well-defined channel systems that can influence product selectivity and catalyst stability.

2. Adjustable acidity: The acid strength and density of zeolites can be modified by changing the Si/Al ratio or through post-synthesis treatments.

3. High thermal stability: Zeolites can withstand the high temperatures required for dehydrogenation reactions.

Acidity modification techniques for optimizing catalytic performance include:

1. Dealumination: Removing framework aluminum to increase the Si/Al ratio, which reduces the number and strength of acid sites.

2. Ion exchange: Replacing protons with other cations to alter the type and strength of acid sites.

3. Synthesis with high Si/Al ratios: Directly preparing zeolites with lower aluminum content to achieve weaker acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Improving selectivity: Weaker acidity can suppress undesired side reactions like oligomerization and cracking, enhancing propene selectivity.

2. Balancing activity and stability: While strong acidity can enhance dehydrogenation activity, it may also promote coke formation. Moderate acidity can provide a good balance.

3. Tailoring pore environment: Acidity modifications can alter the interaction between the active metal (e.g., Ga2O3) and the support, influencing catalytic properties.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches based on their initial properties and desired outcomes.

2. Target reaction: The optimal acidity for CO2-ODHP may differ from other reactions, necessitating careful tuning.

3. Maintaining structural integrity: Some modification techniques may affect the zeolite's crystallinity or pore structure, which should be monitored and controlled.

4. Balancing multiple factors: Acidity modifications should be considered alongside other factors like metal loading, preparation method, and reaction conditions to achieve optimal overall performance.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，这是由于它们独特的孔结构和可调节的酸性。使它们有价值的关键特性包括：

1. 孔道结构：像ZSM-48这样的沸石具有明确的通道系统，可以影响产品选择性和催化剂稳定性。

2. 可调节的酸性：通过改变Si/Al比或通过后合成处理，可以修改沸石的酸强度和密度。

3. 高热稳定性：沸石可以承受脱氢反应所需的高温。

用于优化催化性能的酸性修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：移除骨架铝以增加Si/Al比，从而减少酸位的数量和强度。

2. 离子交换：用其他阳离子替换质子，以改变酸位的类型和强度。

3. 高Si/Al比合成：直接制备低铝含量的沸石以获得较弱的酸性。

这些修饰有助于优化催化性能，方式如下：

1. 提高选择性：较弱的酸性可以抑制不需要的副反应，如寡聚和裂解，从而提高丙烯选择性。

2. 平衡活性和稳定性：虽然强酸性可以增强脱氢活性，但也可能促进积碳形成。适度的酸性可以提供良好的平衡。

3. 调整孔道环境：酸性修饰可以改变活性金属（如Ga2O3）与载体之间的相互作用，影响催化性能。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要不同的修饰方法，这取决于它们的初始性质和所需的结果。

2. 目标反应：CO2-ODHP的最佳酸性可能与其他反应不同，需要仔细调整。

3. 保持结构完整性：某些修饰技术可能会影响沸石的结晶度或孔结构，应该对此进行监控和控制。

4. 平衡多个因素：在考虑酸性修饰的同时，还应考虑其他因素，如金属负载量、制备方法和反应条件，以实现最佳的整体性能。
