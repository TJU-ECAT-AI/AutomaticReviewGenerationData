[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19], is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."

[2] "The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio under identical conditions, since acid strength of the former is weaker than that of the latter, and our previous results revealed that the acid sites with medium-strong and strong strength could enhance the dehydrogenation by a surface migration reaction [7]."

[3] "The selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization."

[4] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking [11]."

[5] "The number of both weak and strong acid sites decreases sharply with the increasing of Si/Al ratio. This decreasing may come from two aspects: the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-48 support directly related to the framework Al species; or on gallium oxides caused by weakening the interaction between the gallia and support."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique structural properties and tunable acidity. Key properties that make zeolites attractive include:

1. Pore structure: Zeolites like ZSM-48 have well-defined pore channels that can influence product selectivity and catalytic performance.

2. Acidity: Zeolites possess tunable acidity, which can be modified to optimize catalyst performance.

3. High silicon content: Some zeolites like ZSM-48 have high Si/Al ratios, which can influence acid strength and stability.

Acidity modification techniques for zeolites include:

1. Dealumination: Removing aluminum from the zeolite framework to increase Si/Al ratio and decrease acidity.

2. Weakening methods: Techniques to reduce acid strength without necessarily changing Si/Al ratio.

3. Ion exchange: Replacing protons with other cations to modify acidity.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Controlling side reactions: Reducing strong acid sites can suppress undesired reactions like oligomerization and cracking.

2. Improving selectivity: Weaker acidity often leads to higher propene selectivity in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Enhancing stability: Modifying acidity can improve catalyst longevity by reducing coke formation.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches based on their initial properties.

2. Desired catalytic performance: The optimal acidity depends on the specific reaction and desired product distribution.

3. Stability requirements: Some modification techniques may impact long-term catalyst stability.

4. Reaction conditions: The chosen modification should be suitable for the intended reaction environment.

5. Balance between activity and selectivity: Acidity modifications often involve a trade-off between conversion and product selectivity.

In summary, carefully tailoring zeolite acidity through various modification techniques is crucial for optimizing CO2-ODHP catalyst performance, with the goal of achieving high propene selectivity and catalyst stability while maintaining sufficient activity.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，这主要归因于它们独特的结构性质和可调节的酸性。使沸石具有吸引力的关键特性包括：

1. 孔结构：像ZSM-48这样的沸石具有明确定义的孔道结构，可以影响产物选择性和催化性能。

2. 酸性：沸石具有可调节的酸性，可以通过修饰来优化催化剂性能。

3. 高硅含量：一些沸石如ZSM-48具有高Si/Al比，这可以影响酸强度和稳定性。

沸石的酸性修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：从沸石骨架中移除铝以增加Si/Al比并降低酸性。

2. 减弱方法：在不必改变Si/Al比的情况下减弱酸强度的技术。

3. 离子交换：用其他阳离子替换质子以修饰酸性。

这些修饰有助于优化催化性能，通过：

1. 控制副反应：减少强酸位可以抑制不需要的反应，如寡聚和裂解。

2. 提高选择性：较弱的酸性通常会导致脱氢反应中更高的丙烯选择性。

3. 增强稳定性：修饰酸性可以通过减少积碳来提高催化剂的寿命。

选择和实施酸性修饰策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要基于其初始性质采用不同的修饰方法。

2. 所需的催化性能：最佳酸性取决于特定反应和所需的产物分布。

3. 稳定性要求：某些修饰技术可能影响催化剂的长期稳定性。

4. 反应条件：所选择的修饰应适合预期的反应环境。

5. 活性和选择性之间的平衡：酸性修饰通常涉及转化率和产物选择性之间的权衡。

总之，通过各种修饰技术仔细调整沸石酸性对于优化CO2-ODHP催化剂性能至关重要，目标是在保持足够活性的同时实现高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。
