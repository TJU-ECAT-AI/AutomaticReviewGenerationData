[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional structure with large pores, allowing for efficient diffusion of reactants and products.

2. High thermal and acid stability, enabling them to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. Large specific surface area, which allows for high dispersion of active metal species like chromium.

Acidity modification techniques, particularly dealumination, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically using acid treatment. The main benefit is reducing the acidity of the zeolite, which can lead to improved selectivity towards desired products.

2. Impact on catalytic properties: Dealumination has a significant effect on the catalyst's behavior. Low acidity of dealuminated zeolites (like SiBeta) promotes high selectivity to propene, while high acidity of non-dealuminated zeolites (like AlBeta) can lead to undesired cracking reactions.

3. Implementation: The process typically involves treating the zeolite with an acid solution (e.g., HNO3) at elevated temperatures, followed by washing and drying.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Desired product selectivity: Lower acidity generally favors higher selectivity to the target product (e.g., propene in CO2-ODHP).

2. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different dealumination conditions or techniques.

3. Preservation of structure: The modification process should maintain the zeolite's structural integrity and beneficial properties like high surface area.

4. Degree of dealumination: The extent of aluminum removal can be controlled to achieve the optimal balance between acidity reduction and maintenance of other desirable properties.

5. Impact on metal dispersion: The dealumination process should ideally enhance or at least maintain the ability to disperse active metal species effectively.

By carefully considering these factors and tailoring the modification approach, researchers can optimize zeolite supports for improved performance in CO2-ODHP and similar catalytic applications.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有几个关键优势：

1. 三维结构和大孔径，有利于反应物和产物的有效扩散。

2. 高热稳定性和酸稳定性，能够承受苛刻的反应条件。

3. 大比表面积，可以实现活性金属物种（如铬）的高度分散。

酸性修饰技术，特别是脱铝，在优化催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用：

1. 脱铝：这涉及从沸石骨架中去除铝，通常使用酸处理。主要好处是降低沸石的酸性，可以提高对目标产物的选择性。

2. 对催化性能的影响：脱铝对催化剂的行为有显著影响。脱铝沸石（如SiBeta）的低酸性有利于提高丙烯的选择性，而未脱铝沸石（如AlBeta）的高酸性可能导致不希望的裂解反应。

3. 实施：该过程通常包括在高温下用酸溶液（如HNO3）处理沸石，然后洗涤和干燥。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 目标产物选择性：较低的酸性通常有利于提高目标产物的选择性（如CO2-ODHP中的丙烯）。

2. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要不同的脱铝条件或技术。

3. 结构保持：修饰过程应保持沸石的结构完整性和有益特性，如高比表面积。

4. 脱铝程度：可以控制铝去除的程度，以在酸性降低和维持其他理想特性之间达到最佳平衡。

5. 对金属分散的影响：脱铝过程理想情况下应增强或至少维持有效分散活性金属物种的能力。

通过仔细考虑这些因素并量身定制修饰方法，研究人员可以优化沸石支撑材料，以改善CO2-ODHP和类似催化应用的性能。

3. Large specific surface area, which facilitates high dispersion of active metal species like chromium.

Acidity modification techniques, particularly dealumination, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically using acid treatment. For example, SiBeta with a high Si/Al ratio of 1000 was obtained by treating TEABeta with nitric acid solution.

2. Impact on acidity: Dealumination reduces the overall acidity of the zeolite. Low acidity, as in SiBeta, is beneficial for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80%) in CO2-ODHP reactions.

3. Effect on catalytic properties: Dealumination has a significant impact on catalytic performance. Cr-containing SiBeta catalysts show superior performance compared to Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts with the same chromium content.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies:

1. Desired product selectivity: Lower acidity favors selectivity towards desired products (e.g., propene) and reduces unwanted side reactions like cracking.

2. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches. The choice depends on the initial Si/Al ratio and the desired final acidity.

3. Preservation of structure: Modification techniques should maintain the zeolite's structural integrity and beneficial properties like high surface area and thermal stability.

4. Active metal interaction: The modified support should still allow for efficient dispersion and stabilization of the active metal species.

5. Reaction requirements: The optimal acidity level may vary depending on the specific reaction and desired outcomes.

In summary, acidity modification, especially dealumination, is a powerful tool for tailoring zeolite properties to enhance their performance as supports in CO2-ODHP catalysts. The key is to balance reduced acidity with maintained structural integrity and desired catalytic properties.
