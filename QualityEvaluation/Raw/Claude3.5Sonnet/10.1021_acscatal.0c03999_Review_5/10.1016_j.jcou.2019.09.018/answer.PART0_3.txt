[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

[2] "The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight."

[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional porous structure with large pore openings, allowing for efficient diffusion of reactants and products.

2. High thermal and acid stability, enabling them to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. Large specific surface area, which facilitates high dispersion of active metal species.

Acidity modification techniques, particularly dealumination, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically using acid treatment. The study used 13 mol/L HNO3 solution to convert AlBeta (Si/Al = 17) to SiBeta (Si/Al = 1000).

2. Impact on acidity: Dealumination significantly reduces the acidity of the zeolite. Low acidity of SiBeta was found to be beneficial for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity of AlBeta promoted undesirable propane cracking.

3. Effect on catalytic properties: The study demonstrated that dealumination had a great impact on catalytic properties when comparing Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts supported on SiBeta and AlBeta.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies:

1. Desired product selectivity: Lower acidity favors higher propene selectivity, while higher acidity may lead to unwanted side reactions.

2. Catalyst stability: Ensure that the modification process does not compromise the zeolite's thermal and structural stability.

3. Metal dispersion: The modified support should still provide high dispersion of active metal species.

4. Pore structure preservation: Maintain the advantageous pore structure of the zeolite during modification.

5. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches based on their initial composition and structure.

6. Reaction conditions: Consider the specific requirements of the CO2-ODHP reaction when optimizing acidity.

By carefully considering these factors and implementing appropriate acidity modification techniques, researchers can tailor zeolite supports to achieve optimal catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个优势特性：

1. 具有大孔径开口的三维多孔结构，有利于反应物和产物的有效扩散。

2. 高热稳定性和酸稳定性，能够承受苛刻的反应条件。

3. 大比表面积，有利于活性金属物种的高度分散。

酸性修饰技术，特别是脱铝，在优化催化性能中起着至关重要的作用：

1. 脱铝：这涉及从沸石骨架中移除铝，通常使用酸处理。该研究使用13 mol/L的HNO3溶液将AlBeta（Si/Al = 17）转化为SiBeta（Si/Al = 1000）。

2. 对酸性的影响：脱铝显著降低了沸石的酸性。研究发现，SiBeta的低酸性有利于获得高丙烯选择性（超过80%），而AlBeta的高酸性促进了不良的丙烷裂解。

3. 对催化性能的影响：研究表明，在比较负载在SiBeta和AlBeta上的含Cr Beta沸石催化剂时，脱铝对催化性能有很大影响。

选择和实施酸性修饰策略的关键考虑因素：

1. 目标产物选择性：较低的酸性有利于提高丙烯选择性，而较高的酸性可能导致不希望的副反应。

2. 催化剂稳定性：确保修饰过程不会影响沸石的热稳定性和结构稳定性。

3. 金属分散：修饰后的载体仍应提供活性金属物种的高度分散。

4. 孔结构保持：在修饰过程中保持沸石的有利孔结构。

5. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要基于其初始组成和结构采用不同的修饰方法。

6. 反应条件：在优化酸性时考虑CO2-ODHP反应的具体要求。

通过仔细考虑这些因素并实施适当的酸性修饰技术，研究人员可以定制沸石载体，以在CO2-ODHP反应中实现最佳催化性能。
