[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

[2] "The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight."

[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional structure with large pores, allowing for efficient diffusion of reactants and products.

2. High thermal and acid stability, enabling them to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. Large specific surface area, which facilitates high dispersion of active metal species like chromium.

Acidity modification techniques, particularly dealumination, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically using acid treatment. For example, SiBeta with a high Si/Al ratio of 1000 was obtained by treating TEABeta with nitric acid solution.

2. Impact on acidity: Dealumination reduces the overall acidity of the zeolite. Low acidity, as in SiBeta, is beneficial for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80%) in CO2-ODHP reactions.

3. Effect on catalytic properties: Dealumination has a significant impact on catalytic performance. Cr-containing SiBeta catalysts show superior performance compared to Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts with the same chromium content.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies:

1. Desired product selectivity: Lower acidity favors selectivity towards desired products (e.g., propene) and reduces unwanted side reactions like cracking.

2. Zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches. The choice depends on the initial Si/Al ratio and the desired final acidity.

3. Preservation of structure: Modification techniques should maintain the zeolite's structural integrity and beneficial properties like high surface area and thermal stability.

4. Active metal interaction: The modified support should still allow for efficient dispersion and stabilization of the active metal species.

5. Reaction requirements: The optimal acidity level may vary depending on the specific reaction and desired outcomes.

In summary, acidity modification, especially dealumination, is a powerful tool for tailoring zeolite properties to enhance their performance as supports in CO2-ODHP catalysts. The key is to balance reduced acidity with maintained structural integrity and desired catalytic properties.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个优势特性：

1. 三维结构和大孔径，有利于反应物和产物的有效扩散。

2. 高热稳定性和酸稳定性，能够承受苛刻的反应条件。

3. 大比表面积，有利于活性金属物种（如铬）的高度分散。

酸性改性技术，尤其是脱铝，在优化催化性能方面起着关键作用：

1. 脱铝：这涉及从沸石骨架中去除铝，通常使用酸处理。例如，通过用硝酸溶液处理TEABeta获得了高Si/Al比（1000）的SiBeta。

2. 对酸性的影响：脱铝降低了沸石的整体酸性。在CO2-ODHP反应中，SiBeta的低酸性有利于获得高选择性的丙烯（80%以上）。

3. 对催化性能的影响：脱铝对催化性能有显著影响。相同铬含量的Cr-SiBeta催化剂比Cr-AlBeta催化剂表现出更优越的性能。

选择和实施酸性改性策略的关键考虑因素：

1. 目标产物选择性：较低的酸性有利于提高目标产物（如丙烯）的选择性，并减少不需要的副反应（如裂解）。

2. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要不同的改性方法。选择取决于初始Si/Al比和所需的最终酸性。

3. 结构保持：改性技术应保持沸石的结构完整性和有益特性，如高比表面积和热稳定性。

4. 活性金属相互作用：改性后的支撑材料仍应允许活性金属物种的有效分散和稳定。

5. 反应要求：最佳酸性水平可能因特定反应和所需结果而异。

总之，酸性改性，特别是脱铝，是调整沸石性质以提高其作为CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑材料性能的有力工具。关键是在降低酸性的同时保持结构完整性和所需的催化性能之间取得平衡。
