[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

[2] "The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight."

[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional structure with large pores, allowing for effective diffusion of reactants and products.

2. High thermal and acid stability, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst performance under reaction conditions.

3. Large specific surface area, enabling high dispersion of active metal species like chromium.

Acidity modification techniques, particularly dealumination, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically using acid treatment. For example, SiBeta with a high Si/Al ratio of 1000 was obtained by treating TEABeta with nitric acid solution.

2. Impact on acidity: Dealumination significantly reduces the acidity of the zeolite. Low acidity of SiBeta is beneficial for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80%), while high acidity of AlBeta promotes undesired propane cracking.

3. Effect on catalytic properties: Dealumination has a great impact on catalytic properties. Cr-containing SiBeta catalysts showed superior performance compared to Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts with identical Cr content.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies:

1. Desired product selectivity: Lower acidity favors selectivity towards propene, while higher acidity may lead to unwanted side reactions.

2. Catalyst stability: Ensure that the modification technique does not compromise the thermal and structural stability of the zeolite.

3. Preservation of pore structure: The modification should maintain the advantageous pore structure of the zeolite for efficient mass transfer.

4. Optimization of metal dispersion: The acidity modification should be balanced with the ability to achieve high dispersion of active metal species.

5. Zeolite type: Different types of zeolites may require tailored modification approaches to achieve optimal performance.

By carefully considering these factors and applying appropriate acidity modification techniques, researchers can develop highly effective zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions with improved selectivity and stability.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个优势特性：

1. 三维结构和大孔径，有利于反应物和产物的有效扩散。

2. 高热稳定性和酸稳定性，这对于在反应条件下保持催化剂性能至关重要。

3. 大比表面积，能够实现活性金属物种（如铬）的高度分散。

酸度调节技术，尤其是脱铝，在优化催化性能方面起着关键作用：

1. 脱铝：这涉及从沸石骨架中去除铝，通常使用酸处理。例如，通过用硝酸溶液处理TEABeta获得了具有高Si/Al比（1000）的SiBeta。

2. 对酸度的影响：脱铝显著降低了沸石的酸度。SiBeta的低酸度有利于获得高选择性的丙烯（80%以上），而AlBeta的高酸度则促进了不希望的丙烷裂解。

3. 对催化性能的影响：脱铝对催化性能有很大影响。含铬的SiBeta催化剂比含有相同铬含量的AlBeta催化剂表现出更优越的性能。

选择和实施酸度调节策略的关键考虑因素：

1. 目标产物选择性：较低的酸度有利于丙烯的选择性，而较高的酸度可能导致不需要的副反应。

2. 催化剂稳定性：确保改性技术不会影响沸石的热稳定性和结构稳定性。

3. 保持孔结构：改性应保持沸石有利于高效传质的孔结构。

4. 优化金属分散：酸度调节应与实现活性金属物种高分散的能力保持平衡。

5. 沸石类型：不同类型的沸石可能需要定制的改性方法以实现最佳性能。

通过仔细考虑这些因素并应用适当的酸度调节技术，研究人员可以开发出高效的沸石支撑催化剂，用于CO2-ODHP反应，提高选择性和稳定性。
