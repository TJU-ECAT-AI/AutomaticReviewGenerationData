[1] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

[2] "The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight."

[3] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to several key properties:

1. Three-dimensional structure with large pores, allowing for efficient diffusion of reactants and products.

2. High thermal and acid stability, enabling them to withstand harsh reaction conditions.

3. Large specific surface area, which facilitates high dispersion of active metal species like chromium.

Acidity modification techniques, particularly dealumination, play a crucial role in optimizing catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically using acid treatment. For example, SiBeta with a Si/Al ratio of 1000 was obtained by treating TEABeta with nitric acid solution.

2. Impact on acidity: Dealumination reduces the acidity of the zeolite. Low acidity of SiBeta leads to high selectivity for propene (above 80%), while high acidity of AlBeta promotes undesirable propane cracking.

3. Catalytic performance: Dealumination has a significant impact on catalytic properties. Comparison of Cr-containing SiBeta and AlBeta catalysts showed that the dealuminated SiBeta performed better.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies:

1. Desired product selectivity: Lower acidity favors higher propene selectivity, while higher acidity may lead to unwanted side reactions.

2. Stability of the zeolite structure: The modification method should not compromise the zeolite's structural integrity or thermal stability.

3. Dispersion of active sites: The modification should maintain or enhance the zeolite's ability to disperse active metal species.

4. Type of zeolite: Different zeolites may require different modification approaches based on their initial composition and structure.

5. Reaction conditions: The modified zeolite should be suitable for the specific reaction conditions of CO2-ODHP.

By carefully considering these factors and applying appropriate acidity modification techniques, researchers can optimize zeolite supports for improved catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有以下几个方面的优势：

1. 三维结构和大孔径，有利于反应物和产物的高效扩散。

2. 高热稳定性和酸稳定性，能够承受苛刻的反应条件。

3. 大比表面积，有利于活性金属物种（如铬）的高度分散。

酸性修饰技术，尤其是脱铝，在优化催化性能方面起着关键作用：

1. 脱铝：这涉及从沸石骨架中去除铝，通常使用酸处理。例如，通过用硝酸溶液处理TEABeta获得了Si/Al比为1000的SiBeta。

2. 对酸性的影响：脱铝降低了沸石的酸性。SiBeta的低酸性导致丙烯的高选择性（超过80%），而AlBeta的高酸性促进了不良的丙烷裂解。

3. 催化性能：脱铝对催化性能有显著影响。比较含Cr的SiBeta和AlBeta催化剂表明，脱铝后的SiBeta性能更好。

选择和实施酸性修饰策略的关键考虑因素：

1. 目标产物选择性：较低的酸性有利于提高丙烯选择性，而较高的酸性可能导致不需要的副反应。

2. 沸石结构的稳定性：修饰方法不应损害沸石的结构完整性或热稳定性。

3. 活性位点的分散：修饰应保持或增强沸石分散活性金属物种的能力。

4. 沸石类型：不同的沸石可能需要基于其初始成分和结构的不同修饰方法。

5. 反应条件：改性后的沸石应适合CO2-ODHP的特定反应条件。

通过仔细考虑这些因素并应用适当的酸性修饰技术，研究人员可以优化沸石支撑材料，以提高CO2-ODHP反应的催化性能。
