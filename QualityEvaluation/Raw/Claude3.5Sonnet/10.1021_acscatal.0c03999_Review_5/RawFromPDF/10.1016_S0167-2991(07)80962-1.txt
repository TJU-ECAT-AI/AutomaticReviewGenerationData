ABSTRACT 
 
High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence 
of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio. The 
propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was 
thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through 
dealumination of the zeolite. The reaction mechanism on the titled catalyst was discussed. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION        
 
The process of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane into propene is of increasing interest due 
to the growing demand for propene, an important raw material for producing polypropene, 
polyacrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid. The main problem of the current industrial process 
is that most catalysts, such as Cr2O3/Al2O3 [1] and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 [2], quickly deactivate during 
reaction, which is caused by the side reactions like oligomerization and cracking. The 
oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen has been proposed as an alternative, since 
coke can be consumed timely by oxygen during the reaction. However, the propene 
selectivity becomes a prominent problem because of the over-oxidation of propane to carbon 
dioxide. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes by carbon dioxide instead of oxygen 
has been reported to give rather high selectivity towards their corresponding alkenes over 
some catalysts, such as rare earth vanadates [3], supported Cr2O3 [4], and Ga2O3 [5,6]. 
Unfortunately, the stability of these catalysts is still rather poor and the activity declines 
dramatically with reaction time, which is fatal for industrial application [3-6].  
Aromatization of light paraffins over Ga-promoted HZSM-5 catalysts has been studied 
intensely in the previous decades. The aromatization reaction is thought to proceed via a 
bifunctional mechanism. Gallium oxide is responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation of 
propane while Bronsted acid sites account for catalyzing the oligomerization of light alkenes 
and the cyclization of C6 ~ C9 alkenes [7-10]. More recently, it has been discovered that 
carbon dioxide could markedly promote the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over 
supported gallium oxide catalysts [11]. Furthermore, distinct behavior is observed over 
different supported gallium oxide catalysts, such as Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/ZrO2, 
Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO. The support effect comes from their different H2 adsorption 
capacities and acid-base properties, caused by the intrinsic properties of the supports and their 
interactions with gallium oxide [12].

In this study, a highly active and stable catalyst Ga2O3 supported on HZSM-5 with high 
Si/Al ratio was reported for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of 
CO2. The possible reasons for the superior catalytic behavior were discussed.  
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
2.1. Catalyst preparation 
HZSM-5 zeolite with a Si/Al ratio of 60 was supplied by Shanghai Research Institute of 
Petrochemical Technology. HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by 
dealumination of the HZSM-5 at various steaming temperatures (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 
oC) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol/l HNO3 at 95 oC for 24 h, filtering, drying and 
calcining at 600 oC for 6 h. Silicalite was prepared according to the procedures in the 
literature [13]. 
Supported gallium oxide catalysts were prepared by impregnating HZSM-5, silicalite and 
TiO2 (Degussa P25) with an aqueous solution containing a calculated amount of 
Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (Aldrich) using an incipient wetness method. The impregnated samples were 
dried at 100 oC and calcined at 600 oC for 6 h in air flow. The obtained catalysts were 
designated as Ga2O3/HZSM-5(x), Ga2O3/silicalite and Ga2O3/TiO2, respectively, in which x 
represented the steaming temperature of the HZSM-5 support. Ga2O3/HZSM-5 stood for non-
steam treated HZSM-5(Si/Al=60) supported gallium oxide catalyst. The weight percentage of 
Ga2O3 in all catalysts was 5%.  
E-Ga2O3 was obtained by calcining Ga(NO3)3·xH2O at 600 oC for 6 h in air flow. 
 
2.2. Catalyst characterization 
The surface acidity was measured by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-
TPD) in a flow-type fixed-bed reactor at ambient pressure. The sample (100 mg) was 
preheated at 600 oC for 3 h and cooled to 120 oC in flowing He. At this temperature, sufficient 
pulses of NH3 were injected until adsorption saturation, followed by purging with He for 2 h. 
The temperature was then raised up from 120 to 600 oC at a rate of 10 oC/min, and the NH3 
desorbed was collected in a trap at liquid N2 temperature and detected by gas chromatography. 
X-ray power diffraction data were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-IIA diffractometer using Cu 
KD radiation at 30 kV and 20 mA. UV-vis spectra of the samples were recorded on a 
Shimadzu UV-2450 UV-visible spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment. 
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer TGA7 apparatus to 
determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after reaction. 20 mg of sample was 
heated from room temperature to 900 oC at a heating rate of 10 oC/min in flowing air.  
 
2.3. Reaction testing 
Catalytic tests for propane dehydrogenation were performed at 600 oC in a fixed-bed 
flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst load was 200 mg, and it was activated 
at 600 oC for 1 h in nitrogen flow prior to the reaction. Typically, the gas reactant contained 
2.5 vol% propane, 5 vol% carbon dioxide and balancing nitrogen. For reactions carried out 
with different CO2/propane ratios, the gas reactant contained 2.5 vol % propane, a calculated 
proportion of carbon dioxide and balancing nitrogen. The total flow rate of gas reactant was 
20 ml/min. 
The hydrocarbon products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph equipped 
with a 6-m packed column of Porapak Q and a FID. The gas products, such as N2, CO and 
CO2, were analyzed on-line by another chromatograph equipped with a 2-m packed column of 
1073 
carbon molecular sieve 601 and a TCD. The conversion and selectivity were calculated as

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1. Catalyst synthesis and characterization 
HZSM-5 with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by steaming treatment of HZSM-5 
with a Si/Al ratio of 60 at temperatures of 600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC, respectively. Since 
the results of chemical analysis of HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratios are often ambiguous, DRS 
spectra of HZSM-5 before and after steaming treatment were taken and shown in Fig. 1. It 
was reported that the UV adsorption band at about 240 nm corresponds to the amount of Al-O 
units of ZSM-5 zeolite while the band located at 320 nm is related to the extraframework 
oxoaluminum species [14]. It is clear that the intensity of 240 nm band decreases with rising 
steaming temperature, showing that the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 increases by the dealumination 
of the framework Al species through steaming treatment. The severer the steaming condition, 
the higher the Si/Al ratio of the treated HZSM-5 is.  
Supported gallium oxide catalysts containing 5% Ga2O3 on HZSM-5 with different Si/Al 
ratios as well as silicalite were prepared by an incipient wetness method. On the XRD patterns 
of the catalysts, no other diffraction peaks except those of the HZSM-5 supports were 
observed, indicating that gallium oxide is well dispersed on all the supports. The peak 
intensities of the samples are almost the same, which implies that the crystalline structure of 
HZSM-5 keeps intact after the steaming treatment.

3.2. Dehydrogenation activity 
Propane dehydrogenation reactions were carried out at 600 oC over various HZSM-5 
supported gallium oxide catalysts, together with the silicalite supported one. The variation of 
propane conversion versus time on stream for these catalysts is illustrated in Fig. 2. 
The initial propane conversion decreases as the steaming temperature rises, indicating 
that the dealumination of the HZSM-5 support has a significant effect on the dehydrogenation 
activity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. Ga2O3/silicalite, which has no aluminium in 
the framework of the support, has the lowest initial activity. The propane conversion of the 
supported gallium oxide catalysts is at least five times higher than that of the corresponding 
HZSM-5 supports (not shown). For all the supported catalysts, the propane conversion drops 
with reaction time and almost reaches steady state after 30 h. The decreasing rate of the 
catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the 
support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts 
are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support. The improvement of 
the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke 
deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h. As shown in Table 1, the amount of coke 
reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious 
initially. The steady state conversion of propane for the catalysts is in the order of 
> Ga2O3/HZSM-5 | Ga2O3/HZSM-5(800) | Ga2O3/silicalite.

Fig. 3 shows the yield of propene over supported gallium oxide catalysts as a function of 
reaction time. The propene yield of the Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst first increases with the 
reaction time up to 6 h, and then falls dramatically, finally it becomes stable after about 30 h. 
An optimal yield of propene (20 %) is obtained after 6 h on stream. The initial rise in propene 
yield is due to the sharp increase in the propene selectivity in the initial period of reaction. 
Similar trend of propene yield change was observed over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(600) and 
Ga2O3/HZSM-5(650) catalysts. However, the propene yield declines more slowly over these 
two catalysts than Ga2O3/HZSM-5 after the initial increase, indicating that the stability of the 
catalyst is improved when the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 increases. Thus, higher propene yield at 
steady state is obtained. The best performance was observed over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) 
catalyst, i. e., the propane yield keeps steadily at 22% after the initial rise. The propene yield 
is decreased as the steaming temperature of the HZSM-5 support is further increased, showing 
that over dealumination deteriorates the catalyst. 
The dehydrogenation reaction has been run continuously on Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) 
catalyst for 100 h and the results are shown in Fig. 4, together with those of E-Ga2O3 and 
Ga2O3/TiO2 for comparison. It can be seen that the catalyst is very stable after the initial 
period, and the propene yield over the catalyst maintains at about 22 % without any 
observable deactivation in 100 h. This is very different from all the other Ga2O3 
dehydrogenation catalysts such as E-Ga2O3 and TiO2 supported gallium oxide, whose propene 
yields have dropped to less than half of their initial values within 3 h. The high stability of the 
catalyst for propane dehydrogenation is extraordinary, and it is significant from the practical 
point of view. 
 
3.3. Acidity measurement 
The acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD method 
and the results are summarized in Table 2. There is only one identifiable desorption peak at 
264 oC in the NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5, and the amount of desorbed NH3 is small. This 
can be attributed to the few framework Al existing in HZSM-5 zeolite because of the high 
Si/Al ratio. When gallium oxide is supported on HZSM-5, a second peak at 465 oC emerges in 
its NH3-TPD profile, indicating that some strong acid sites emerge on the catalyst. The acid 
amount of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 is more than triple of that of HZSM-5, suggesting that Ga2O3 on 
the support may be the cause for the strong acidity of the catalyst. Meanwhile, dealumination

Table 2  
NH3-TPD data of various supported gallium oxide catalysts 
of HZSM-5 would weaken the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts. As the 
steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease 
1076 
markedly. Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid 
sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total 
acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses. The previous studies show that strong 
interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported 
gallium oxide catalysts [12, 15], so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with 
the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the 
dealumination of the zeolite.

The dehydrogenation of propane over gallium oxide or supported gallium oxide catalysts 
in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation

in which propane dissociatively adsorbs on the catalyst surface with the formation of gallium 
hydride and gallium alkoxide species (reaction (1)), and then the alkoxide further decomposes 
to form the dehydrogenation product (reaction (2)).  Reaction (2) is relatively slow and serves 
as the rate-determining step in this process [10]. The surface strong acid site would facilitate 
the conjugated effect of proton and gallium oxide (reaction (4) and (5)) and in turn promote 
the dehydrogenation reaction [16]. The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over 
HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support 
can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites. On the other hand, acid 
sites also catalyze coke formation via side reactions, such as oligomerization and cyclization. 
Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition 
on the catalyst surface. Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid 
sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane 
dehydrogenation. This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is 
significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through 
steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support.  
 It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play 
two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the 
catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role 
is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions. Therefore, the 
amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, 
and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700). 
 
3.4. Role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation 
CO was detected in the reaction products. The CO2 conversion and the CO yield in 
propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst are illustrated in Fig. 5(a). It has 
been reported that CO2 can react through the reverse water gas shift reaction and the 
Boudouard reaction [12], as shown below:

The proportion of CO2 participated in each reaction can be estimated from the amount of CO 
and CO2 present before and after reaction [12]. It can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that the amount 
of CO yield in the reaction is always twice as much as the CO2 conversion, indicating that 
almost all CO is produced via reaction (7) over Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst, so the main 
role of CO2 here is to eliminate coke formed on catalyst surface. 
1078 
The effect of CO2 partial pressure on the dehydrogenation of propane over 
Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700) catalyst was also studied, and the results are shown in Fig. 5(b). The 
initial propane conversion decreases as the CO2/C3H8 ratio rises, but the introduction of CO2 
into the feed gas enhance the stability of catalyst. However, too much CO2 will suppress the 
dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst. The highest activity after 6 h on stream is obtained at 
a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 2. Similar results were observed over other oxide supported Ga2O3 
catalysts, which was ascribed to the inhibition of propane adsorption on the catalyst by CO2 
[12].
