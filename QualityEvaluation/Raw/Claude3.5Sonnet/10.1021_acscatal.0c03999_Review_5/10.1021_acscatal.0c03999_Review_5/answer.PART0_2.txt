Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties make zeolites highly versatile and adaptable for catalytic applications.

The modification of acid sites in zeolites is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP, particularly to selectively activate C-H bonds rather than C-C bonds. Two main approaches are used to modify acidity: dealumination and weakening methods.

Dealumination, which eliminates surface acidity, can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments at high temperatures. This method is effective in reducing the concentration of strong acid sites, which are known to promote undesirable side reactions such as C3H8 cracking.

Weakening acidity methods include tuning the Al amount and incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brønsted acid sites. These techniques aim to create a balance between acidity and catalytic activity.

When selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies, several key considerations emerge:

1. Balancing acidity and activity: While reducing acidity can improve selectivity towards desired products, some level of acidity is beneficial for catalytic activity. Finding the optimal balance is crucial for maximizing performance.

2. Type of zeolite: Different zeolites (e.g., HZSM-5, HZSM-48) respond differently to acidity modifications. The choice of zeolite and modification technique should be tailored to the specific catalyst system.

3. Stability: Some modification techniques, such as steaming treatments, can improve catalyst stability by reducing coke formation.

4. Pore structure: Modifications should preserve the desirable pore structure of zeolites, as this affects reactant and product diffusion.

5. Active metal interaction: The acidity modification technique should be compatible with the active metal component (e.g., Cr, Ga, Zn) and enhance its dispersion and activity.

In general, reducing the number of acid sites appears to be more effective than merely weakening acidity for improving catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP. However, the optimal strategy may vary depending on the specific zeolite and active metal combination used in the catalyst system.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的前景，这是由于它们的微孔结构、大比表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。这些特性使得沸石在催化应用中具有高度的多功能性和适应性。

在CO2-ODHP中，修改沸石的酸性位对于优化催化性能至关重要，特别是为了选择性地活化C-H键而非C-C键。主要有两种方法来修改酸性：脱铝和弱化方法。

脱铝是通过酸处理或高温蒸汽处理来消除表面酸性。这种方法能有效减少强酸位的浓度，而强酸位会促进不希望的副反应，如C3H8的裂解。

弱化酸性的方法包括调节Al含量和将其他元素引入沸石骨架以取代强Brønsted酸位。这些技术旨在在酸性和催化活性之间创造平衡。

在选择和实施酸性修饰策略时，需要考虑几个关键因素：

1. 平衡酸性和活性：虽然降低酸性可以提高对目标产物的选择性，但一定程度的酸性对催化活性有利。找到最佳平衡对于最大化性能至关重要。

2. 沸石类型：不同的沸石（如HZSM-5、HZSM-48）对酸性修饰的响应不同。沸石的选择和修饰技术应根据特定的催化剂系统进行调整。

3. 稳定性：某些修饰技术，如蒸汽处理，可以通过减少积碳来提高催化剂的稳定性。

4. 孔结构：修饰应保持沸石理想的孔结构，因为这会影响反应物和产物的扩散。

5. 活性金属相互作用：酸性修饰技术应与活性金属组分（如Cr、Ga、Zn）兼容，并增强其分散性和活性。

总的来说，在CO2-ODHP中，减少酸性位的数量似乎比仅仅弱化酸性更有效地提高催化性能。然而，最佳策略可能因催化剂系统中使用的特定沸石和活性金属组合而异。
