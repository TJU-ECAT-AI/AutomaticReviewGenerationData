Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties make zeolites versatile and adaptable for various catalytic applications.

The modification of acid sites in zeolites is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP, particularly for selective CH bond activation over CC bond activation. Two main approaches are used to modify acidity: dealumination and weakening methods.

Dealumination is widely employed to eliminate surface acidity through acid treatment or steaming at high temperatures. This process reduces the number of acid sites and weakens the interaction between the active metal oxide (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support. The reduction in acid sites helps to minimize undesired side reactions, such as C3H8 cracking, which can lead to the formation of unwanted products like C2H6, C2H4, and CH4.

Weakening acidity is an alternative approach that involves tuning the Al content or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to replace strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones. This can be achieved by adjusting the Si/Al ratio or introducing elements like phosphorus.

When selecting and implementing these strategies, several key considerations must be taken into account:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites (e.g., Beta, ZSM-5, ZSM-48) have varying pore structures and initial acidity levels, which influence the effectiveness of modification techniques.

2. Desired selectivity: The goal is to achieve high selectivity towards propylene formation while minimizing side reactions and coke formation.

3. Stability: Modification techniques should enhance catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.

4. Balance between acidity and activity: While reducing strong acid sites is generally beneficial, some acidity may be necessary to maintain catalytic activity. Finding the optimal balance is crucial.

5. Interaction with active metal species: The modification technique should not negatively impact the dispersion or activity of the supported metal oxide.

In general, reducing the number of acid sites through dealumination has been found to be more effective in boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 compared to merely weakening the acidity. However, the optimal modification strategy may vary depending on the specific zeolite and active metal combination used in the catalyst.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，因为它们具有微孔结构、大比表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。这些特性使得沸石在各种催化应用中具有多功能性和适应性。

在CO2-ODHP中，修饰沸石的酸性位对于优化催化性能至关重要，特别是为了选择性地活化CH键而不是CC键。主要有两种方法来修饰酸性：脱铝和弱化方法。

脱铝广泛用于通过酸处理或高温蒸汽处理来消除表面酸性。这个过程减少了酸性位的数量，并削弱了活性金属氧化物（如Ga2O3）与沸石载体之间的相互作用。酸性位的减少有助于最小化不希望的副反应，如C3H8裂解，这可能导致不需要的产物如C2H6、C2H4和CH4的形成。

弱化酸性是另一种方法，涉及调节Al含量或将其他元素引入沸石骨架，以替代强Brønsted酸位。这可以通过调整Si/Al比或引入磷等元素来实现。

在选择和实施这些策略时，必须考虑几个关键因素：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石（如Beta、ZSM-5、ZSM-48）具有不同的孔结构和初始酸性水平，这会影响修饰技术的有效性。

2. 所需选择性：目标是实现高丙烯生成选择性，同时最小化副反应和积碳形成。

3. 稳定性：修饰技术应提高催化剂的稳定性和抗失活能力。

4. 酸性与活性之间的平衡：虽然减少强酸位通常是有益的，但保持一定的酸性可能对维持催化活性是必要的。找到最佳平衡至关重要。

5. 与活性金属物种的相互作用：修饰技术不应对负载的金属氧化物的分散性或活性产生负面影响。

总的来说，通过脱铝减少酸性位的数量被发现比仅仅弱化酸性更有效地促进C3H8脱氢生成C3H6。然而，最佳的修饰策略可能因催化剂中使用的特定沸石和活性金属组合而异。
