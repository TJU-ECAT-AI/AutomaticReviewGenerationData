Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties allow for high metal dispersion and preservation of redox Cr species, which are crucial for catalytic performance.

The modification of acid sites, particularly strong acid sites, is critical for selective CH bond activation over CC bond activation. Various acidity modification techniques are employed to optimize catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This method eliminates surface acidity through acid treatment or steaming treatments. It effectively reduces the number of acid sites, which is crucial because high concentrations of strong acid sites promote undesirable C3H8 cracking reactions.

2. Weakening acidity: This approach involves tuning the Al amount or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brønsted acid sites. Methods include increasing Si/Al ratios and introducing phosphorus into the zeolite structure.

The choice and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific zeolite type and desired catalytic properties:

- For HZSM-5, steaming treatments at different temperatures can effectively reduce acid sites and weaken the interaction between metal oxides (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support. This leads to improved catalytic performance by balancing activity promotion and coke formation prevention.

- Increasing Si/Al ratios in zeolites like HZSM-48 can lead to higher propylene selectivity but may compromise stability due to weak-acid-induced side reactions.

- Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones, but this approach may not be as effective as reducing the overall number of acid sites.

The key consideration in selecting and implementing these strategies is finding the optimal balance between acidity and activity. While some acidity is beneficial for promoting activity through the conjugated effect of protons and metal oxides, excess acid sites can lead to undesirable side reactions and coke formation. Generally, reducing the number of acid sites on zeolites like HZSM-5 appears to be more effective in boosting propane dehydrogenation to propylene than merely weakening the acidity.

In conclusion, the choice of acidity modification technique should be tailored to the specific zeolite support and desired catalytic properties, with the goal of achieving high selectivity towards propylene while maintaining catalyst stability and activity.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，因为它们具有微孔结构、大比表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。这些特性允许高金属分散度和保存氧化还原Cr物种，这对催化性能至关重要。

酸性位点的修饰，特别是强酸位点，对于选择性活化CH键而非CC键至关重要。采用各种酸性修饰技术来优化催化性能：

1. 脱铝：这种方法通过酸处理或蒸汽处理来消除表面酸性。它有效地减少了酸位点的数量，这一点很重要，因为高浓度的强酸位点会促进不需要的C3H8裂解反应。

2. 减弱酸性：这种方法涉及调整Al含量或将其他元素引入沸石骨架以取代强Brønsted酸位点。方法包括增加Si/Al比和将磷引入沸石结构。

这些策略的选择和实施取决于特定的沸石类型和所需的催化性能：

- 对于HZSM-5，在不同温度下进行蒸汽处理可以有效地减少酸位点并削弱金属氧化物（如Ga2O3）与沸石载体之间的相互作用。这通过平衡活性促进和焦炭形成预防，导致催化性能的改善。

- 增加HZSM-48等沸石的Si/Al比可以提高丙烯选择性，但可能会因弱酸诱导的副反应而影响稳定性。

- 将磷引入HZSM-5可以用较弱的Brønsted酸位点取代强酸位点，但这种方法可能不如减少总体酸位点数量有效。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素是找到酸性和活性之间的最佳平衡。虽然一些酸性有利于通过质子和金属氧化物的共轭效应促进活性，但过多的酸位点可能导致不需要的副反应和焦炭形成。总的来说，减少HZSM-5等沸石上的酸位点数量似乎比仅仅减弱酸性更有效地促进丙烷脱氢生成丙烯。

总之，酸性修饰技术的选择应根据特定的沸石载体和所需的催化性能进行调整，目标是在保持催化剂稳定性和活性的同时实现对丙烯的高选择性。

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties make zeolites versatile and adaptable for various catalytic applications.

The modification of acid sites in zeolites is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP, particularly for selective CH bond activation over CC bond activation. Two main approaches are used to modify acidity: dealumination and weakening methods.

Dealumination is widely employed to eliminate surface acidity through acid treatment or steaming at high temperatures. This process reduces the number of acid sites and weakens the interaction between the active metal oxide (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support. The reduction in acid sites helps to minimize undesired side reactions, such as C3H8 cracking, which can lead to the formation of unwanted products like C2H6, C2H4, and CH4.

Weakening acidity is an alternative approach that involves tuning the Al content or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to replace strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones. This can be achieved by adjusting the Si/Al ratio or introducing elements like phosphorus.

When selecting and implementing these strategies, several key considerations must be taken into account:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites (e.g., Beta, ZSM-5, ZSM-48) have varying pore structures and initial acidity levels, which influence the effectiveness of modification techniques.

2. Desired selectivity: The goal is to achieve high selectivity towards propylene formation while minimizing side reactions and coke formation.

3. Stability: Modification techniques should enhance catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.

4. Balance between acidity and activity: While reducing strong acid sites is generally beneficial, some acidity may be necessary to maintain catalytic activity. Finding the optimal balance is crucial.

5. Interaction with active metal species: The modification technique should not negatively impact the dispersion or activity of the supported metal oxide.

In general, reducing the number of acid sites through dealumination has been found to be more effective in boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 compared to merely weakening the acidity. However, the optimal modification strategy may vary depending on the specific zeolite and active metal combination used in the catalyst.

在CO2-ODHP中，修饰沸石的酸性位对于优化催化性能至关重要，特别是为了选择性地活化CH键而不是CC键。主要有两种方法来修饰酸性：脱铝和弱化方法。

脱铝广泛用于通过酸处理或高温蒸汽处理来消除表面酸性。这个过程减少了酸性位的数量，并削弱了活性金属氧化物（如Ga2O3）与沸石载体之间的相互作用。酸性位的减少有助于最小化不希望的副反应，如C3H8裂解，这可能导致不需要的产物如C2H6、C2H4和CH4的形成。

弱化酸性是另一种方法，涉及调节Al含量或将其他元素引入沸石骨架，以替代强Brønsted酸位。这可以通过调整Si/Al比或引入磷等元素来实现。

在选择和实施这些策略时，必须考虑几个关键因素：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石（如Beta、ZSM-5、ZSM-48）具有不同的孔结构和初始酸性水平，这会影响修饰技术的有效性。

2. 所需选择性：目标是实现高丙烯生成选择性，同时最小化副反应和积碳形成。

3. 稳定性：修饰技术应提高催化剂的稳定性和抗失活能力。

4. 酸性与活性之间的平衡：虽然减少强酸位通常是有益的，但保持一定的酸性可能对维持催化活性是必要的。找到最佳平衡至关重要。

5. 与活性金属物种的相互作用：修饰技术不应对负载的金属氧化物的分散性或活性产生负面影响。

总的来说，通过脱铝减少酸性位的数量被发现比仅仅弱化酸性更有效地促进C3H8脱氢生成C3H6。然而，最佳的修饰策略可能因催化剂中使用的特定沸石和活性金属组合而异。

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties make zeolites versatile and adaptable for catalytic applications.

The modification of acid sites, particularly strong acid sites, is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP. This is because strong acid sites tend to promote undesirable C-C bond cracking instead of the desired C-H bond activation, leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts like C2H6, C2H4, and CH4.

Two main approaches for acidity modification are dealumination and weakening methods:

1. Dealumination: This technique involves eliminating surface acidity through acid treatment or steaming treatments at high temperatures. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites on zeolites and weakens the interaction between the active metal oxide (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support.

When selecting and implementing these strategies, several key considerations should be taken into account:

1. Balance between activity and selectivity: While reducing acidity can improve selectivity towards the desired product (C3H6), it may also decrease overall catalytic activity. Finding the optimal balance is crucial for maximizing performance.

2. Stability and regeneration: Modified zeolites should maintain their structural integrity and thermal stability. Some modifications, like phosphorus incorporation, can improve hydrothermal stability.

3. Pore structure: Modifications should not significantly alter the zeolite's pore structure, as this can affect molecular diffusion and catalyst deactivation.

4. Type of zeolite: Different zeolites (e.g., Beta, ZSM-5, ZSM-48) may respond differently to acidity modifications, so the choice of modification technique should be tailored to the specific zeolite structure.

5. Active metal-support interaction: The acidity modification should be optimized to maintain an appropriate interaction between the active metal oxide and the zeolite support.

In conclusion, reducing the number of acid sites on zeolites, particularly through dealumination, appears to be more effective in boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 compared to merely weakening the acidity.

Overall, reducing the number of acid sites appears to be more effective in boosting propane dehydrogenation to propylene than merely weakening the acidity. However, the optimal approach may vary depending on the specific zeolite type and reaction conditions.

When implementing these strategies, it's important to consider the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability. Careful characterization and testing are necessary to determine the most suitable modification technique for each zeolite support in CO2-ODHP catalysts.
