Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties allow for high metal dispersion and preservation of redox Cr species, which are crucial for catalytic performance.

The modification of acid sites, particularly strong acid sites, is critical for selective CH bond activation over CC bond activation. Various acidity modification techniques are employed to optimize catalytic performance:

1. Dealumination: This method eliminates surface acidity through acid treatment or steaming treatments. It effectively reduces the number of acid sites, which is crucial because high concentrations of strong acid sites promote undesirable C3H8 cracking reactions.

2. Weakening acidity: This approach involves tuning the Al amount or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brønsted acid sites. Methods include increasing Si/Al ratios and introducing phosphorus into the zeolite structure.

The choice and implementation of these strategies depend on the specific zeolite type and desired catalytic properties:

- For HZSM-5, steaming treatments at different temperatures can effectively reduce acid sites and weaken the interaction between metal oxides (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support. This leads to improved catalytic performance by balancing activity promotion and coke formation prevention.

- Increasing Si/Al ratios in zeolites like HZSM-48 can lead to higher propylene selectivity but may compromise stability due to weak-acid-induced side reactions.

- Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones, but this approach may not be as effective as reducing the overall number of acid sites.

The key consideration in selecting and implementing these strategies is finding the optimal balance between acidity and activity. While some acidity is beneficial for promoting activity through the conjugated effect of protons and metal oxides, excess acid sites can lead to undesirable side reactions and coke formation. Generally, reducing the number of acid sites on zeolites like HZSM-5 appears to be more effective in boosting propane dehydrogenation to propylene than merely weakening the acidity.

In conclusion, the choice of acidity modification technique should be tailored to the specific zeolite support and desired catalytic properties, with the goal of achieving high selectivity towards propylene while maintaining catalyst stability and activity.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，因为它们具有微孔结构、大比表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。这些特性允许高金属分散度和保存氧化还原Cr物种，这对催化性能至关重要。

酸性位点的修饰，特别是强酸位点，对于选择性活化CH键而非CC键至关重要。采用各种酸性修饰技术来优化催化性能：

1. 脱铝：这种方法通过酸处理或蒸汽处理来消除表面酸性。它有效地减少了酸位点的数量，这一点很重要，因为高浓度的强酸位点会促进不需要的C3H8裂解反应。

2. 减弱酸性：这种方法涉及调整Al含量或将其他元素引入沸石骨架以取代强Brønsted酸位点。方法包括增加Si/Al比和将磷引入沸石结构。

这些策略的选择和实施取决于特定的沸石类型和所需的催化性能：

- 对于HZSM-5，在不同温度下进行蒸汽处理可以有效地减少酸位点并削弱金属氧化物（如Ga2O3）与沸石载体之间的相互作用。这通过平衡活性促进和焦炭形成预防，导致催化性能的改善。

- 增加HZSM-48等沸石的Si/Al比可以提高丙烯选择性，但可能会因弱酸诱导的副反应而影响稳定性。

- 将磷引入HZSM-5可以用较弱的Brønsted酸位点取代强酸位点，但这种方法可能不如减少总体酸位点数量有效。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素是找到酸性和活性之间的最佳平衡。虽然一些酸性有利于通过质子和金属氧化物的共轭效应促进活性，但过多的酸位点可能导致不需要的副反应和焦炭形成。总的来说，减少HZSM-5等沸石上的酸位点数量似乎比仅仅减弱酸性更有效地促进丙烷脱氢生成丙烯。

总之，酸性修饰技术的选择应根据特定的沸石载体和所需的催化性能进行调整，目标是在保持催化剂稳定性和活性的同时实现对丙烯的高选择性。
