Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties make them suitable for optimizing catalytic performance in the reaction.

The modification of acid sites, particularly strong acid sites, is crucial for selectively activating C-H bonds rather than C-C bonds. Various acidity modification techniques are employed to achieve this:

1. Dealumination: This method is widely used to eliminate surface acidity. It can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments at high temperatures. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites and weakens the interaction between the active metal (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support.

2. Weakening acidity: This approach involves controlling surface acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework. Methods include:

   a. Increasing Si/Al ratios: This weakens the overall acidity of the zeolite.
   b. Introducing phosphorus: This displaces strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones and improves hydrothermal stability.

The choice of modification technique depends on the specific zeolite and desired catalytic performance. Key considerations include:

1. Balancing acidity: While reducing strong acid sites is generally beneficial, some acidity is needed to facilitate the recovery of active sites and enhance activity. An optimal balance must be found.

2. Pore structure preservation: Some treatments may affect the zeolite's pore structure, potentially impacting catalyst stability and performance.

3. Active metal-support interaction: Modifications can alter the interaction between the active metal and the zeolite, affecting dispersion and catalytic activity.

4. Stability: Some modifications, like phosphorus incorporation, can improve hydrothermal stability.

Overall, reducing the number of acid sites appears to be more effective in boosting propane dehydrogenation to propylene than merely weakening the acidity. However, the optimal approach may vary depending on the specific zeolite type and reaction conditions.

When implementing these strategies, it's important to consider the trade-offs between activity, selectivity, and stability. Careful characterization and testing are necessary to determine the most suitable modification technique for each zeolite support in CO2-ODHP catalysts.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，这是由于它们的微孔结构、大比表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。这些特性使它们适合于优化反应中的催化性能。

酸性位点的改性，特别是强酸性位点的改性，对于选择性活化C-H键而非C-C键至关重要。为实现这一目标，采用了多种酸性改性技术：

1. 脱铝：这种方法被广泛用于消除表面酸性。可以通过酸处理或高温蒸汽处理来实现。脱铝减少了酸性位点的数量，并削弱了活性金属（如Ga2O3）与沸石载体之间的相互作用。

2. 弱化酸性：这种方法涉及通过调整Al含量或将其他元素引入沸石骨架来控制表面酸性。方法包括：

   a. 增加Si/Al比：这会削弱沸石的整体酸性。
   b. 引入磷：这会用较弱的Brønsted酸性位点取代强Brønsted酸性位点，并提高热水稳定性。

改性技术的选择取决于具体的沸石类型和所需的催化性能。关键考虑因素包括：

1. 平衡酸性：虽然减少强酸性位点通常是有益的，但某些酸性是必要的，以促进活性位点的恢复和提高活性。必须找到最佳平衡点。

2. 孔结构保护：某些处理可能会影响沸石的孔结构，潜在地影响催化剂的稳定性和性能。

3. 活性金属-载体相互作用：改性可能会改变活性金属与沸石之间的相互作用，影响分散性和催化活性。

4. 稳定性：一些改性，如引入磷，可以提高热水稳定性。

总的来说，减少酸性位点的数量似乎比仅仅弱化酸性更有效地促进丙烷脱氢生成丙烯。然而，最佳方法可能因具体的沸石类型和反应条件而异。

在实施这些策略时，重要的是要考虑活性、选择性和稳定性之间的权衡。需要进行仔细的表征和测试，以确定CO2-ODHP催化剂中每种沸石载体最合适的改性技术。
