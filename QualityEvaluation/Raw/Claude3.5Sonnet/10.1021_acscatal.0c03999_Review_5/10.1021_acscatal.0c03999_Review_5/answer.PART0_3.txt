[1] "Zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."

[2] "To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites."

[3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment and steaming treatments at temperatures."

[4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."

[5] "This demonstrates that a high concentration of strong acid prefers C3H8 cracking, thus significantly promoting the formation of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4."

[6] "The dealumination not only enables the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-5, but it also weakens the interaction between Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, resulting in an additional decease in the number of acid sites."

[7] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C"

[8] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties make zeolites versatile and adaptable for catalytic applications.

The modification of acid sites, particularly strong acid sites, is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP. This is because strong acid sites tend to promote undesirable C-C bond cracking instead of the desired C-H bond activation, leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts like C2H6, C2H4, and CH4.

Two main approaches for acidity modification are dealumination and weakening methods:

1. Dealumination: This technique involves eliminating surface acidity through acid treatment or steaming treatments at high temperatures. Dealumination reduces the number of acid sites on zeolites and weakens the interaction between the active metal oxide (e.g., Ga2O3) and the zeolite support. This can lead to improved catalytic performance by reducing side reactions and coke formation.

2. Weakening acidity: This approach involves controlling surface acidity by tuning the Al amount or incorporating other elements into the zeolite framework to replace strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones. Methods include increasing Si/Al ratios or introducing elements like phosphorus.

When selecting and implementing these strategies, several key considerations should be taken into account:

1. Balance between activity and selectivity: While reducing acidity can improve selectivity towards the desired product (C3H6), it may also decrease overall catalytic activity. Finding the optimal balance is crucial for maximizing performance.

2. Stability and regeneration: Modified zeolites should maintain their structural integrity and thermal stability. Some modifications, like phosphorus incorporation, can improve hydrothermal stability.

3. Pore structure: Modifications should not significantly alter the zeolite's pore structure, as this can affect molecular diffusion and catalyst deactivation.

4. Type of zeolite: Different zeolites (e.g., Beta, ZSM-5, ZSM-48) may respond differently to acidity modifications, so the choice of modification technique should be tailored to the specific zeolite structure.

5. Active metal-support interaction: The acidity modification should be optimized to maintain an appropriate interaction between the active metal oxide and the zeolite support.

In conclusion, reducing the number of acid sites on zeolites, particularly through dealumination, appears to be more effective in boosting C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 compared to merely weakening the acidity. However, the optimal approach may vary depending on the specific zeolite and active metal combination used in the catalyst system.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，这是由于它们的微孔结构、大比表面积、可调酸度和优异的热稳定性。这些特性使得沸石在催化应用中具有多功能性和适应性。

酸性位点的修饰，特别是强酸性位点的修饰，对于优化CO2-ODHP的催化性能至关重要。这是因为强酸性位点倾向于促进不希望的C-C键断裂，而不是所需的C-H键活化，导致形成不需要的副产品，如C2H6、C2H4和CH4。

酸度修饰的两种主要方法是脱铝和弱化方法：

1. 脱铝：这种技术通过酸处理或高温蒸汽处理来消除表面酸度。脱铝减少了沸石上的酸性位点数量，并削弱了活性金属氧化物（如Ga2O3）与沸石支撑体之间的相互作用。这可以通过减少副反应和焦炭形成来提高催化性能。

2. 弱化酸度：这种方法通过调节Al含量或将其他元素引入沸石骨架来控制表面酸度，以弱Brønsted酸性位点取代强酸性位点。方法包括增加Si/Al比或引入磷等元素。

在选择和实施这些策略时，应考虑几个关键因素：

1. 活性和选择性之间的平衡：虽然降低酸度可以提高对所需产物（C3H6）的选择性，但也可能降低整体催化活性。找到最佳平衡对于最大化性能至关重要。

2. 稳定性和再生：改性沸石应保持其结构完整性和热稳定性。一些改性，如磷的引入，可以提高水热稳定性。

3. 孔结构：改性不应显著改变沸石的孔结构，因为这可能影响分子扩散和催化剂失活。

4. 沸石类型：不同的沸石（如Beta、ZSM-5、ZSM-48）可能对酸度修饰的反应不同，因此修饰技术的选择应根据特定的沸石结构进行调整。

5. 活性金属-支撑体相互作用：应优化酸度修饰，以维持活性金属氧化物与沸石支撑体之间适当的相互作用。

总之，减少沸石上的酸性位点数量，特别是通过脱铝，似乎比仅仅弱化酸度更有效地促进C3H8脱氢生成C3H6。然而，最佳方法可能因催化剂系统中使用的特定沸石和活性金属组合而异。
