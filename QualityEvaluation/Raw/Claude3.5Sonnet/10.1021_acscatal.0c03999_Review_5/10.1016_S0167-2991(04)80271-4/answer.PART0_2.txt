[1] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m g"1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, XANES, and EXAFS spectroscopic measurements."

[3] "We have reported that only one kind of monochromate species was observed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, whereas several types of chromate species possibly including both monochromates and polychromates existed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method by UV Raman spectroscopy."

The literature does not specifically discuss zeolites or acidity modification techniques for CO2-ODHP catalysts. Instead, it focuses on MCM-41, a mesoporous molecular sieve, as a catalyst support for chromium in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

The properties that make MCM-41 a promising support material include:

1. Uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels
2. Controllable pore size (2-10 nm)
3. High surface area (around 1000 m2/g)

The study compares two synthesis methods for Cr-MCM-41 catalysts:

1. Direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis
2. Template-ion exchange (TIE) method

The DHT method resulted in one kind of monochromate species, while the TIE method produced several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates.

The study does not discuss acidity modification techniques or their impact on catalytic performance. Instead, it focuses on the structure-catalytic property relationships of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

该文献并未特别讨论沸石或CO2-ODHP催化剂的酸性改性技术。相反，它着重于MCM-41这种介孔分子筛作为铬催化剂在丙烷与CO2脱氢反应中的支撑材料。

使MCM-41成为有前景的支撑材料的特性包括：

1. 均匀和有序的介孔通道
2. 可控的孔径大小（2-10纳米）
3. 高比表面积（约1000平方米/克）

该研究比较了两种Cr-MCM-41催化剂的合成方法：

1. 直接水热（DHT）合成
2. 模板离子交换（TIE）方法

DHT方法产生了一种单铬酸盐物种，而TIE方法产生了几种铬酸盐物种，包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。

该研究并未讨论酸性改性技术或其对催化性能的影响。相反，它关注Cr-MCM-41催化剂在丙烷与CO2脱氢反应中的结构-催化性能关系。
