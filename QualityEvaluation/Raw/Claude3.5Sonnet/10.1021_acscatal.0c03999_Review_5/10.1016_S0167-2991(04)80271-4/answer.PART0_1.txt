[1] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m g"1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, XANES, and EXAFS spectroscopic measurements."

[3] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8"

The literature does not directly address zeolites or acidity modification techniques for CO2-ODHP catalysts. Instead, it focuses on MCM-41 as a mesoporous support material for chromium-based catalysts in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane.

MCM-41 is described as a promising catalyst support due to its uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes (2-10 nm) and high surface area (around 1000 m2/g). These properties likely contribute to better dispersion and accessibility of active sites.

The study primarily investigates Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis, rather than discussing acidity modifications. Various characterization techniques were used to analyze the structure and properties of the catalysts.

Different metal species (Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co) were tested on MCM-41, with Cr-MCM-41 showing the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane. This suggests that the choice of metal species is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in this reaction.

While the document does not address the specific questions about zeolites and acidity modifications, it does highlight the importance of support material properties and metal species selection in developing effective catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论沸石或CO2-ODHP催化剂的酸度改性技术。相反，它主要关注MCM-41作为铬基催化剂在丙烷CO2脱氢反应中的介孔载体材料。

MCM-41被描述为一种很有前景的催化剂载体，因为它具有均匀且有序的介孔通道，孔径可控（2-10纳米），并且具有高比表面积（约1000平方米/克）。这些特性可能有助于活性位的更好分散和可及性。

该研究主要考察了通过直接水热合成法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂，而不是讨论酸度改性。研究使用了各种表征技术来分析催化剂的结构和性质。

在MCM-41上测试了不同的金属物种（Cr、Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co），其中Cr-MCM-41在丙烷CO2脱氢反应中表现出最高的活性。这表明选择适当的金属物种对于优化该反应的催化性能至关重要。

虽然该文献没有涉及关于沸石和酸度改性的具体问题，但它确实强调了载体材料性质和金属物种选择在开发CO2辅助脱氢反应的有效催化剂中的重要性。
