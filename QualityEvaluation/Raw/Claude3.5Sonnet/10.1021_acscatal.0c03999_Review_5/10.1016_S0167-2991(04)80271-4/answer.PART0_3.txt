[1] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m g"1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UV-Vis, XANES, and EXAFS spectroscopic measurements."

[3] "We have reported that only one kind of monochromate species was observed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, whereas several types of chromate species possibly including both monochromates and polychromates existed on Cr-MCM-41 prepared by the TIE method by UV Raman spectroscopy."

The literature does not specifically discuss zeolites or acidity modification techniques for CO2-ODHP catalysts. Instead, it focuses on MCM-41, a mesoporous molecular sieve, as a catalyst support for chromium in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

MCM-41 is described as having promising properties for use as a catalyst support, including uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes (2-10 nm) and high surface area (about 1000 m2/g). These properties likely contribute to its effectiveness as a support material.

The study compares two synthesis methods for Cr-MCM-41 catalysts: direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis and template-ion exchange (TIE). The DHT method resulted in only one type of monochromate species, while the TIE method produced several types of chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates.

While this information is not directly related to zeolites or acidity modification techniques, it does highlight the importance of synthesis methods in determining the properties and performance of supported catalysts. The study suggests that the synthesis method can affect the dispersion and type of active species on the support, which in turn can influence catalytic performance.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论沸石或CO2-ODHP催化剂的酸度修饰技术。相反，它主要关注MCM-41这种介孔分子筛作为铬催化剂的载体，用于CO2环境下的丙烷脱氢反应。

MCM-41被描述为具有有希望的性质，可用作催化剂载体，包括均匀且有序的介孔通道，孔径可控（2-10 nm），以及高比表面积（约1000 m2/g）。这些特性可能有助于其作为有效的载体材料。

研究比较了两种Cr-MCM-41催化剂的合成方法：直接水热（DHT）合成和模板离子交换（TIE）。DHT方法只产生了一种单铬酸盐物种，而TIE方法产生了几种铬酸盐物种，包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。

虽然这些信息与沸石或酸度修饰技术没有直接关系，但它确实强调了合成方法在决定负载催化剂的性质和性能方面的重要性。研究表明，合成方法可以影响活性物种在载体上的分散和类型，从而影响催化性能。
