[1] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore size from 2 to 10 nm as well as high surface area (ca. 1000 m g"1), and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

The literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about zeolites and acidity modification techniques for CO2-ODHP catalysts. The text focuses on MCM-41, which is a mesoporous molecular sieve, rather than a zeolite. It mentions that MCM-41 has desirable properties as a catalyst support, including uniform mesoporous channels, controllable pore size, and high surface area. However, the document does not discuss zeolites specifically, nor does it address acidity modification techniques like dealumination or weakening methods. The text also does not provide information on how these modifications might optimize catalytic performance or considerations for selecting and implementing these strategies for different zeolites.

该文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于沸石和CO2-ODHP催化剂酸性改性技术的问题。文本主要关注MCM-41,这是一种介孔分子筛,而不是沸石。它提到MCM-41作为催化剂载体具有理想的特性,包括均匀的介孔通道、可控的孔径和高比表面积。然而,该文档并未具体讨论沸石,也没有涉及脱铝或减弱等酸性改性技术。文本也没有提供这些改性如何优化催化性能的信息,或者针对不同类型沸石选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素。
