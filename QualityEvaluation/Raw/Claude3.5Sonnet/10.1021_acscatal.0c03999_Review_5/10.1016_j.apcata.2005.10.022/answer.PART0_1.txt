[1] "Because of the uniform micropore size and controllable surface acidity, zeolites with the medium pore size [larger than the diameter of C4-olefin (0.51 nm) and smaller than the size of coke precursors] were being studied for use as the effective catalysts in C4-olefin cracking reaction"

[2] "ZSM-48 zeolite, first synthesized by Chu [10] in 1983, was one of the prospective candidates for this reaction because of its unique framework structure and uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.53 nm × 0.56 nm)."

[3] "The acidities of the samples were measured by NH3-TPD experiment and the TPD curves were deconvoluted into individual desorption peaks of Gaussian shape (Fig. 4). The resulting peaks were classified and grouped into two types of acid sites with different acidity strength, i.e., weak and strong, according to the temperature of the peak maximum."

[4] "With the increasing of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the total acid amount monotonously decreased, while the relative ratio of strong acid sites slightly increased."

[5] "Fig. 4 shows clearly that the temperature of desorption peak corresponding to strong acid sites in ZSM-5 is higher than that in ZSM-48, indicating that the acidity strength of ZSM-5 is stronger than that of ZSM-48."

This literature does not directly discuss CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites. However, it does provide some relevant insights into zeolite properties and acidity that can be extended to the question:

Zeolites are promising support materials for catalysts due to their uniform micropore size and controllable surface acidity. The medium pore size of zeolites, which is larger than reactant molecules but smaller than coke precursors, makes them effective for certain catalytic reactions.

ZSM-48 zeolite, with its unique framework structure and uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels, is a good candidate for certain reactions. This suggests that the specific structure of a zeolite is important in determining its suitability as a catalyst support.

The acidity of zeolites can be characterized by NH3-TPD experiments, which can distinguish between weak and strong acid sites. The ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 in zeolites affects their acidity - as this ratio increases, the total acid amount decreases, but the relative proportion of strong acid sites slightly increases.

Different types of zeolites have different acidity strengths. For example, ZSM-5 has stronger acidity than ZSM-48.

While the paper doesn't discuss specific acidity modification techniques, it's clear that controlling the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is one way to modify zeolite acidity. This could be considered a form of dealumination.

For CO2-ODHP catalysts specifically, the optimal acidity would depend on the reaction requirements. If weaker acidity is preferred, ZSM-48 might be a better choice than ZSM-5. If stronger acidity is needed, increasing the proportion of strong acid sites through careful control of the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio might be beneficial.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies would include:
1. The specific reaction requirements of CO2-ODHP
2. The initial acidity profile of the chosen zeolite
3. The desired balance between weak and strong acid sites
4. The impact of modifications on other zeolite properties, such as pore size and structure

Overall, while this paper doesn't directly address CO2-ODHP catalysts, it provides insights into how zeolite properties can be characterized and modified, which could be applied to optimizing zeolite supports for various catalytic applications, including CO2-ODHP.

这篇文献并未直接讨论CO2-ODHP催化剂或沸石的酸度修饰技术。然而，它确实提供了一些关于沸石性质和酸度的相关见解，可以延伸到问题中：

沸石之所以成为催化剂的有前景的支撑材料，是因为它们具有均匀的微孔尺寸和可控的表面酸度。沸石的中等孔径（大于反应物分子但小于焦炭前体）使它们对某些催化反应非常有效。

ZSM-48沸石由于其独特的骨架结构和非交叉的线性10元环通道，成为某些反应的良好候选者。这表明沸石的特定结构对于确定其作为催化剂支撑物的适用性很重要。

沸石的酸度可以通过NH3-TPD实验来表征，该实验可以区分弱酸位和强酸位。沸石中SiO2/Al2O3的比例影响其酸度 - 随着这个比例的增加，总酸量减少，但强酸位的相对比例略有增加。

不同类型的沸石具有不同的酸度强度。例如，ZSM-5的酸度比ZSM-48更强。

虽然这篇论文没有讨论具体的酸度修饰技术，但很明显，控制SiO2/Al2O3比例是修饰沸石酸度的一种方法。这可以被认为是一种脱铝形式。

对于CO2-ODHP催化剂，最佳酸度将取决于反应要求。如果需要较弱的酸度，ZSM-48可能比ZSM-5更好。如果需要更强的酸度，通过仔细控制SiO2/Al2O3比例来增加强酸位的比例可能会有益。

选择和实施酸度修饰策略的关键考虑因素包括：
1. CO2-ODHP的具体反应要求
2. 所选沸石的初始酸度概况
3. 弱酸位和强酸位之间的所需平衡
4. 修饰对沸石其他性质（如孔径和结构）的影响

总的来说，虽然这篇论文没有直接讨论CO2-ODHP催化剂，但它提供了关于如何表征和修饰沸石性质的见解，这可以应用于优化各种催化应用（包括CO2-ODHP）的沸石支撑物。
