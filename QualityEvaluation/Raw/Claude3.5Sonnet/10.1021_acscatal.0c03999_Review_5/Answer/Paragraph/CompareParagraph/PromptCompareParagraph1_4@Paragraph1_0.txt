Zeolites have emerged as promising support materials for CO2-ODHP (CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane) catalysts due to their unique properties and tunable acidity. This review focuses on the optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, emphasizing properties, acidity modification techniques, and performance enhancement.

Properties of Zeolites as Catalyst Supports:

1. Tunable acidity: The Si/Al ratio can be adjusted to control the number and strength of acid sites, crucial for optimizing catalytic performance [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011].

2. Three-dimensional micropore structure: This provides a stable framework for active metal species and allows efficient mass transfer of reactants and products [10.1002/cjoc.201100379].

3. High thermal and hydrothermal stability: Zeolites can withstand harsh reaction conditions, ensuring catalyst longevity [10.1007/s10562-011-0566-6].

4. Large specific surface area: This facilitates high dispersion of active metal species like Ga2O3 or Cr [10.1016/j.jcou.2019.09.018].

5. Shape selectivity: The pore structure of zeolites can influence product selectivity and reduce side reactions [10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80992-X].

Acidity Modification Techniques:

1. Dealumination: This process removes aluminum from the zeolite framework, reducing Brønsted acidity. Methods include:
   a. Steaming treatment: Exposing the zeolite to high-temperature steam (600-800°C) [10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1].
   b. Acid washing: Treatment with mineral acids like HNO3 further removes aluminum [10.1002/cjoc.201100379].

2. Increasing Si/Al ratio: This method effectively reduces both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011].

3. Incorporation of other elements: For example, introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 can displace strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_5].

4. Synthesis of high-silica zeolites: Directly preparing zeolites with fewer acid sites, such as ZSM-48 [10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134].

Performance Enhancement:

1. Improved selectivity: Reducing strong acid sites suppresses side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and cracking, leading to higher propene selectivity [10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134].

2. Enhanced stability: Fewer strong acid sites can reduce coke formation, improving catalyst longevity [10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1].

3. Balanced activity and selectivity: While reducing acidity generally decreases activity, it often improves selectivity. Finding the optimal balance is key [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011].

4. Optimized metal-support interactions: Acidity modifications can affect the dispersion and activity of supported metal species [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_5].

Key Considerations:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites (e.g., ZSM-5, ZSM-48, Beta) respond differently to modifications and exhibit varied catalytic behaviors [10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134].

2. Initial Si/Al ratio: The starting composition of the zeolite determines the extent of modification needed [10.1016/S0167-2991(07)80962-1].

3. Desired catalytic properties: The modification strategy should align with the target reaction. For CO2-ODHP, weak to medium acidity is generally preferred [10.1016/j.jiec.2011.11.134].

4. Preservation of zeolite structure: Modifications should maintain the beneficial properties of the zeolite, such as its pore structure and surface area [10.1002/cjoc.201100379].

5. Reaction conditions: The chosen modification strategy should produce a catalyst stable under the intended reaction environment, considering factors like CO2 presence [10.1016/j.cattod.2009.05.011].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The optimization of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions has shown significant progress through careful acidity modification techniques. However, there are still areas for future research and development:

1. Advanced characterization techniques: Developing more precise methods to quantify and map acid site distribution within zeolites could lead to more targeted modifications.

2. Hierarchical zeolites: Exploring the potential of hierarchical zeolites with both micro- and mesopores could enhance mass transfer while maintaining the benefits of zeolite acidity.

3. Novel zeolite structures: Investigating newly discovered zeolite frameworks or designing custom zeolites specifically for CO2-ODHP reactions could yield superior catalysts.

4. In-situ modification: Developing methods for dynamic acidity control during the reaction could allow for real-time optimization of catalyst performance.

5. Multifunctional catalysts: Combining acidity modifications with other strategies, such as incorporating promoters or creating core-shell structures, could lead to synergistic effects in catalyst performance.

6. Computational modeling: Utilizing advanced simulation techniques to predict optimal zeolite properties and modification strategies could accelerate catalyst development.

7. Sustainability considerations: Focusing on environmentally friendly modification techniques and exploring the use of renewable resources in zeolite synthesis could enhance the overall sustainability of the CO2-ODHP process.

These future directions could pave the way for more efficient, stable, and selective zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, contributing to the broader goal of sustainable chemical production.
