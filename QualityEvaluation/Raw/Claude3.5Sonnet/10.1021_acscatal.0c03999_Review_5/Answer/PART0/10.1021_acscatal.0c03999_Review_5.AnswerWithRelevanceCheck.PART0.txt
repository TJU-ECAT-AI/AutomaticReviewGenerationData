          [1] "Zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."

[2] "To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites."

[3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment and steaming treatments at temperatures."

[4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."

[5] "This demonstrates that a high concentration of strong acid prefers C3H8 cracking, thus significantly promoting the formation of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4."

[6] "NH3TPD results indicate that the number of acid sites monotonically decreases with the rise of steaming temperature."

[7] "The presence of strong acid sites on HZSM-5 can facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and gallium oxide, resulting in promoted activity. However, excess acid sites on HZSM-5 can promote coke formation via oligomerization and cyclization, causing deactivation."

[8] "Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."

[9] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

[10] "The dealumination not only enables the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-5, but it also weakens the interaction between Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, resulting in an additional decease in the number of acid sites."

[11] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C"

[12] "Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brnsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability."

          Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their microporosity, large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability. These properties make zeolites highly versatile and adaptable for catalytic applications.

The modification of acid sites in zeolites is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP, particularly to selectively activate C-H bonds rather than C-C bonds. Two main approaches are used to modify acidity: dealumination and weakening methods.

Dealumination, which eliminates surface acidity, can be achieved through acid treatment or steaming treatments at high temperatures. This method is effective in reducing the concentration of strong acid sites, which are known to promote undesirable side reactions such as C3H8 cracking, leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts like C2H6, C2H4, and CH4. The number of acid sites decreases monotonically with the rise of steaming temperature.

Weakening acidity methods include:
1. Tuning the Al amount (increasing Si/Al ratios)
2. Incorporating other elements (e.g., phosphorus) into the zeolite framework to displace strong Brønsted acid sites with weaker ones

These techniques aim to create a balance between acidity and catalytic activity. While the presence of strong acid sites can facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and metal oxides (e.g., gallium oxide), resulting in promoted activity, excess acid sites can promote coke formation via oligomerization and cyclization, causing deactivation.

When selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies, several key considerations emerge:

1. Balancing acidity and activity: Finding the optimal balance is crucial for maximizing performance.
2. Type of zeolite: Different zeolites (e.g., HZSM-5) respond differently to acidity modifications.
3. Stability: Some modification techniques, such as phosphorus incorporation, can improve hydrothermal stability.
4. Active metal interaction: The acidity modification technique should be compatible with the active metal component (e.g., Ga2O3) and enhance its dispersion and activity.

In general, reducing the number of acid sites appears to be more effective than merely weakening acidity for improving catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP. For example, dealumination not only reduces acid sites on HZSM-5 but also weakens the interaction between Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, resulting in an additional decrease in the number of acid sites. The optimal strategy may involve finding a balance between these effects, as demonstrated by the optimized catalytic performance of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700°C.

          沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的前景，这是由于它们的微孔结构、大比表面积、可调酸性和优异的热稳定性。这些特性使得沸石在催化应用中具有高度的多功能性和适应性。

在CO2-ODHP中，修改沸石的酸性位对于优化催化性能至关重要，特别是为了选择性地活化C-H键而非C-C键。主要有两种方法来修改酸性：脱铝和弱化方法。

脱铝是通过酸处理或高温蒸汽处理来消除表面酸性。这种方法能有效减少强酸位的浓度，而强酸位会促进不希望的副反应，如C3H8的裂解，导致形成不需要的副产品如C2H6、C2H4和CH4。随着蒸汽处理温度的升高，酸性位的数量单调递减。

弱化酸性的方法包括：
1. 调节Al含量（增加Si/Al比）
2. 将其他元素（如磷）引入沸石骨架以弱Brønsted酸性位取代强Brønsted酸性位

这些技术旨在在酸性和催化活性之间创造平衡。虽然强酸性位的存在可以促进质子和金属氧化物（如氧化镓）的共轭效应，从而提高活性，但过量的酸性位可能通过寡聚和环化促进积碳形成，导致失活。

在选择和实施酸性修饰策略时，需要考虑几个关键因素：

1. 平衡酸性和活性：找到最佳平衡对于最大化性能至关重要。
2. 沸石类型：不同的沸石（如HZSM-5）对酸性修饰的响应不同。
3. 稳定性：某些修饰技术，如磷的引入，可以提高水热稳定性。
4. 活性金属相互作用：酸性修饰技术应与活性金属组分（如Ga2O3）兼容，并增强其分散性和活性。

总的来说，在CO2-ODHP中，减少酸性位的数量似乎比仅仅弱化酸性更有效地提高催化性能。例如，脱铝不仅减少了HZSM-5上的酸性位，还削弱了Ga2O3与HZSM-5之间的相互作用，导致酸性位数量进一步减少。最佳策略可能涉及在这些效应之间找到平衡，正如在700°C处理的Ga2O3/HZSM-5上观察到的优化催化性能所示。
