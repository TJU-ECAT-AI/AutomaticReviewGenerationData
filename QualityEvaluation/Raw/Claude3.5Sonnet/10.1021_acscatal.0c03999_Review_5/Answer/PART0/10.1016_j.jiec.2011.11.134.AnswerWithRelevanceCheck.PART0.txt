          [1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19], is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."

[2] "The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio under identical conditions, since acid strength of the former is weaker than that of the latter, and our previous results revealed that the acid sites with medium-strong and strong strength could enhance the dehydrogenation by a surface migration reaction [7]."

[3] "The selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization."

[4] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking [11]."

[5] "The number of both weak and strong acid sites decreases sharply with the increasing of Si/Al ratio. This decreasing may come from two aspects: the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-48 support directly related to the framework Al species; or on gallium oxides caused by weakening the interaction between the gallia and support."

[6] "In our previous work, HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was found to be highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased"

[7] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."

[8] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."

[9] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. However, their stabilities are not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures."

          Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their unique properties:

1. Tunable acidity: The Si/Al ratio can be adjusted to control the number and strength of acid sites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance.

2. Pore structure: Medium pore size zeolites like ZSM-48 (0.53-0.56 nm) can influence product selectivity and reduce side reactions such as aromatization.

3. High silicon content: Some zeolites like ZSM-48 have high Si/Al ratios, which can influence acid strength and stability.

Acidity modification techniques include:

1. Dealumination: Increasing the Si/Al ratio reduces the number of acid sites, especially strong ones. This can be achieved through various methods like steaming or chemical treatments.

2. Weakening methods: These aim to reduce acid strength without necessarily removing aluminum from the framework. Ion exchange or isomorphous substitution can be used for this purpose.

3. Synthesis with high Si/Al ratios: Directly preparing zeolites with fewer acid sites.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Improving selectivity: Reducing strong acid sites suppresses side reactions like oligomerization, cyclization, and cracking, leading to higher propene selectivity.

2. Enhancing stability: Fewer strong acid sites can reduce coke formation, improving catalyst longevity.

3. Balancing activity and selectivity: While reducing acidity generally decreases activity, it often improves selectivity. Finding the optimal balance is key.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Zeolite type: Different zeolites (e.g., ZSM-48 vs. ZSM-5) respond differently to modifications and exhibit varied catalytic behaviors.

2. Desired catalytic properties: The modification strategy should align with the target reaction. For propane dehydrogenation, weak to medium acidity is generally preferred.

3. Pore structure preservation: Ensure that acidity modifications do not significantly alter the zeolite's pore structure, which can impact shape selectivity and diffusion.

4. Stability requirements: Some modification techniques may affect long-term catalyst stability, as seen with HZSM-48 catalysts showing higher selectivity but lower stability compared to HZSM-5.

5. Interaction with active phase: The impact of acidity modification on the interaction between the support and the active phase (e.g., Ga2O3) should be considered.

In conclusion, careful selection and implementation of acidity modification techniques can significantly enhance the performance of zeolite-supported catalysts for CO2-ODHP, balancing activity, selectivity, and stability based on the specific zeolite type and desired catalytic outcomes.

          沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，这主要归因于它们的独特性质：

1. 可调节的酸性：可以通过调整Si/Al比来控制酸性位点的数量和强度，这对于优化催化性能至关重要。

2. 孔结构：像ZSM-48这样的中孔沸石（0.53-0.56 nm）可以影响产物选择性并减少芳构化等副反应。

3. 高硅含量：一些沸石如ZSM-48具有高Si/Al比，这可以影响酸强度和稳定性。

酸性修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：增加Si/Al比可以减少酸性位点的数量，特别是强酸性位点。这可以通过蒸汽处理或化学处理等多种方法实现。

2. 弱化方法：这些方法旨在降低酸强度，而不必从骨架中移除铝。可以使用离子交换或同晶置换来实现这一目的。

3. 高Si/Al比合成：直接制备具有较少酸性位点的沸石。

这些修饰有助于优化催化性能，具体表现在：

1. 提高选择性：减少强酸性位点可抑制寡聚、环化和裂解等副反应，从而提高丙烯选择性。

2. 增强稳定性：较少的强酸性位点可以减少积碳形成，提高催化剂寿命。

3. 平衡活性和选择性：虽然降低酸性通常会降低活性，但往往会提高选择性。找到最佳平衡点是关键。

选择和实施这些策略时的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石类型：不同的沸石（如ZSM-48与ZSM-5）对修饰的反应不同，并表现出不同的催化行为。

2. 期望的催化性能：修饰策略应与目标反应相一致。对于丙烷脱氢，通常倾向于弱到中等酸性。

3. 孔结构保持：确保酸性修饰不会显著改变沸石的孔结构，这可能影响形状选择性和扩散。

4. 稳定性要求：某些修饰技术可能影响催化剂的长期稳定性，如HZSM-48催化剂表现出较高的选择性但较低的稳定性，相比于HZSM-5。

5. 与活性相的相互作用：应考虑酸性修饰对载体与活性相（如Ga2O3）之间相互作用的影响。

总之，仔细选择和实施酸性修饰技术可以显著提高沸石支撑的CO2-ODHP催化剂的性能，根据特定的沸石类型和所需的催化结果来平衡活性、选择性和稳定性。
