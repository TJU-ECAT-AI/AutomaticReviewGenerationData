          [1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results. When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."

[4] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst gives the best performance, with the highest steady propane conversion (41.5%), the highest steady propene yield (25.8%) and superior stability in the presence of CO2."

[5] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."

          Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and porous structure. The key property that makes zeolites advantageous is their ability to have their acidity modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods.

The main acidity modification technique discussed in this study is increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support. This method effectively reduces both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved stability: Higher Si/Al ratios lead to better catalyst stability by reducing the number of acid sites responsible for side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

2. Enhanced selectivity: Decreasing acidity improves propene selectivity by suppressing unwanted side reactions.

3. Balanced activity and stability: While higher Si/Al ratios decrease initial catalytic activity, they significantly improve long-term stability and overall propene yield.

4. Optimizing acid site distribution: An appropriate balance of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites is crucial for optimal catalytic performance.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Finding the optimal Si/Al ratio: In this study, HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 160 provided the best balance of activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. Characterizing acidity: Techniques like NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine are crucial for understanding the acidic properties of modified zeolites.

3. Balancing dehydrogenation activity and side reactions: The goal is to maintain sufficient acidity for the initial dehydrogenation step while minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

4. Considering the specific reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture influences the optimal catalyst properties, as CO2 plays multiple roles in the reaction system.

By carefully tailoring the acidity of zeolite supports through Si/Al ratio modification, researchers can develop more effective and stable catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, balancing activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.

          沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，这是由于它们可调节的酸性和多孔结构。使沸石具有优势的关键特性是其酸性可以通过脱铝和弱化等技术进行修饰。

本研究中讨论的主要酸性修饰技术是增加HZSM-5载体的硅铝比。这种方法有效地降低了Brønsted和Lewis酸性位点的数量，从而以多种方式优化了催化性能：

1. 提高稳定性：更高的硅铝比通过减少引起副反应（如裂解、寡聚和芳构化）的酸性位点数量，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。

2. 增强选择性：降低酸性通过抑制不需要的副反应来提高丙烯的选择性。

3. 平衡活性和稳定性：尽管更高的硅铝比降低了初始催化活性，但显著提高了长期稳定性和总体丙烯产率。

4. 优化酸性位点分布：路易斯酸位和布朗斯特酸位的适当平衡对于最佳催化性能至关重要。

选择和实施这些策略时的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 找到最佳硅铝比：在本研究中，硅铝比为160的HZSM-5提供了活性、选择性和稳定性的最佳平衡。

2. 表征酸性：NH3-TPD和吡啶吸附FT-IR光谱等技术对于理解改性沸石的酸性特性至关重要。

3. 平衡脱氢活性和副反应：目标是保持足够的酸性以进行初始脱氢步骤，同时最小化导致积碳形成和催化剂失活的副反应。

4. 考虑特定反应条件：反应混合物中CO2的存在会影响最佳催化剂特性，因为CO2在反应系统中扮演多重角色。

通过仔细调整沸石载体的酸性，研究人员可以开发出更有效和稳定的CO2-ODHP反应催化剂，平衡活性、选择性和长期稳定性。
