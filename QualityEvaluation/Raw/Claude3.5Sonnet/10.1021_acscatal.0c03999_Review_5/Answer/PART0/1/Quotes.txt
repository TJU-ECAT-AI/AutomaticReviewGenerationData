[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."

[2] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."

[3] "HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by dealumination of the HZSM-5 at various steaming temperatures (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol/l HNO3 at 95 oC for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 oC for 6 h."

[4] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."

[5] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h. As shown in Table 1, the amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."

[6] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

[1] "Zeolites are also promising support materials because of their microporosity with large surface area, tunable acidity, and excellent thermostability."

[2] "To selectively activate CH bond rather than CC bond, the modification of acid sites is critical, especially the strong acid sites."

[3] "Dealumination is widely used to eliminate the surface acidity, and approaches include acid treatment and steaming treatments at temperatures."

[4] "Weakening acidity is an alternative to control the surface acidity and can be achieved by tuning the Al amount and incorporating another element into the framework of zeolite to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites."

[5] "This demonstrates that a high concentration of strong acid prefers C3H8 cracking, thus significantly promoting the formation of C2H6, C2H4, and CH4."

[6] "NH3TPD results indicate that the number of acid sites monotonically decreases with the rise of steaming temperature."

[7] "The presence of strong acid sites on HZSM-5 can facilitate the conjugated effect of protons and gallium oxide, resulting in promoted activity. However, excess acid sites on HZSM-5 can promote coke formation via oligomerization and cyclization, causing deactivation."

[8] "Increasing Si/Al ratios is an option to weaken the acidity."

[9] "Clearly, reducing the number of acid sites on HZSM-5 is a more effective approach to boost C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 than weakening the acidity."

[10] "The dealumination not only enables the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-5, but it also weakens the interaction between Ga2O3 and HZSM-5, resulting in an additional decease in the number of acid sites."

[11] "Therefore, a balance of such a trade-off can optimize the catalytic performance on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 treated at 700 C"

[12] "Introducing phosphorus into HZSM-5 is another option to displace the original strong Brnsted acid sites by newly created weakened Brnsted acid sites, as well as to improve hydrothermal stability."

[1] "ZSM-48, first synthesized by Chu [19], is another prospective candidate for supporting Ga2O3, because ZSM-48 is a high Si-containing zeolite with the uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.530.56 nm) and its acid strength is relatively weaker than that of ZSM-5 [20]."

[2] "The activity of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is lower as compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio under identical conditions, since acid strength of the former is weaker than that of the latter, and our previous results revealed that the acid sites with medium-strong and strong strength could enhance the dehydrogenation by a surface migration reaction [7]."

[3] "The selectivity to propene of Ga2O3/HZSM-48 is a bit higher due to the suppression of some side reactions, such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization."

[4] "The high propene yield and superior stability were ascribed to the decrease in the number of acid sites with medium to strong strength on the catalysts, which resulted in the suppression of the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and cracking [11]."

[5] "The number of both weak and strong acid sites decreases sharply with the increasing of Si/Al ratio. This decreasing may come from two aspects: the reduction of the acid sites on HZSM-48 support directly related to the framework Al species; or on gallium oxides caused by weakening the interaction between the gallia and support."

[6] "In our previous work, HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was found to be highly active and stable for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 when the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support was increased"

[7] "In order to reduce the possibility of aromatization, the ideal support should be a zeolite with medium pore size and weak acidity."

[8] "The activity decreases with the increase of Si/Al ratio of catalyst support while the selectivity to propene shows a contrary trend."

[9] "HZSM-48 supported catalysts exhibit higher selectivities to propene than the HZSM-5 supported ones at similar propane conversion, due to their weak acid strength. However, their stabilities are not so good as those of the latters, owing to their more weak acid sites and unidimensional pore structures."

[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes"
          [2] "It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite; and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
          [3] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
          [4] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

"The use of zeolitic materials as the supports for the catalyst preparation has recently attracted much attention. The availability of a wide range of topologies (more than 190 presently), the strong hydrothermal stability, various and readily-modified surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) and their unique micropore environments provide great potentials for stabilizing transition metal complexes, which are crucial for the catalytic reactions."

"It has been shown that acidic properties of the zeolite support strongly influence the formation of Cr species."

"Moreover, steaming is an efficient method for reducing Brnsted acidity in the zeolites, and the resulting decrease in acidic sites might contribute to the enhanced reaction stabilities."

"Borosilicate has been claimed to be an effective support to prepare vanadium-loaded catalysts for the ODH of propane [17]."

[1] "ZSM-5, a typical MFI-type zeolite, has been widely used in the petrochemical industry. Owing to the tri-dimensional micropore structure, large specific surface area, high thermal and hydrothermal stability, the ZSM-5 zeolite is considered to be a good catalyst or support."

[2] "Moreover, medium pore size and pore channel structure render ZSM-5 zeolite resistant to coking."

[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brønsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."

[4] "Steaming treatment of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al≈25) was carried out at various temperatures (600, 650 and 700 ℃) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol•L−1 HNO3 at 95 ℃ for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 ℃ for 6 h."

[5] "As presented in Table 2, the number of weak acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 120–350 ℃), strong acid sites (expressed as the amount of NH3 desorbed at 350–600 ℃) and total acid sites of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 are evidently lower than those of the parent HZSM-5. The severer the steaming condition, the lower the acidity."

[6] "Therefore, the decrease in the number of Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst would suppress the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization, cracking and aromatization, thus leading to the high propylene yield and superior stability due to the decrease in coke formation on the catalyst surface."

"Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion"

"The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L1 HNO3 solution at 80 C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95 C overnight."

"Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

"Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."

[1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results. When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."

[4] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst gives the best performance, with the highest steady propane conversion (41.5%), the highest steady propene yield (25.8%) and superior stability in the presence of CO2."

[5] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."
