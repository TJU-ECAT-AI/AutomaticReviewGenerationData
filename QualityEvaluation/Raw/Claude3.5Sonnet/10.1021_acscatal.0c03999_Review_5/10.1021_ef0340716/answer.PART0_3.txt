[1] "Chang and co-workers 75,76 investigated the dehydrogenation of EB with CO2 over a ZSM-5-supported iron oxide catalyst, a commercial catalyst (K-Fe2O3), and unsupported iron oxide (Fe3O4), for comparison. They found that EB was predominantly converted to styrene via an oxidative manner. CO2 in this reaction played the role of an oxidant to greatly improve catalytic activity as well as coke resistance of the catalyst."

[2] "They suggested that an active phase for the dehydrogenation with CO2 over ZSM-5-supported iron oxide catalyst would, instead, be a reduced and isolated magnetite (Fe3O4)-like phase that has a oxygen deficiency in the zeolite matrix."

The literature does not provide detailed information specifically about zeolite acidity modification techniques for CO2-ODHP catalysts. However, it does mention that ZSM-5 zeolite was used as a support for iron oxide catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. The zeolite matrix provided a beneficial environment for the active iron oxide phase, allowing for improved catalytic activity and coke resistance compared to unsupported catalysts. 

The active phase was suggested to be a reduced and isolated magnetite-like structure within the zeolite pores, indicating that the zeolite framework helps to disperse and stabilize the active metal species. This suggests that the porous structure and potential for metal-support interactions make zeolites promising supports for CO2-ODHP catalysts.

While acidity modification techniques are not explicitly discussed, the mention of an "oxygen deficiency in the zeolite matrix" hints at the importance of tuning the electronic and structural properties of the zeolite support. Techniques like dealumination or introduction of other heteroatoms could potentially be used to optimize these properties and enhance catalyst performance, though further research would be needed to determine the most effective strategies for different zeolite types and reaction conditions.

文献中没有提供关于CO2-ODHP催化剂沸石酸性改性技术的详细信息。然而,它确实提到ZSM-5沸石被用作氧化铁催化剂的载体,用于在CO2存在下进行乙苯脱氢。沸石基质为活性氧化铁相提供了有利的环境,与非负载催化剂相比,可以提高催化活性并增强抗积碳能力。

活性相被认为是在沸石孔道内的还原和分离的类磁铁矿结构,这表明沸石骨架有助于分散和稳定活性金属物种。这表明多孔结构和金属-载体相互作用的潜力使沸石成为CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体。

虽然没有明确讨论酸性改性技术,但提到"沸石基质中的氧缺陷"暗示了调整沸石载体的电子和结构性质的重要性。脱铝或引入其他杂原子等技术可能被用来优化这些性质并提高催化剂性能,尽管还需要进一步研究来确定不同沸石类型和反应条件下最有效的策略。
