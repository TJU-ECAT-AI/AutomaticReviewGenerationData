<questions>

Analyze the properties that make zeolites promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts, and critically evaluate the various acidity modification techniques, such as dealumination and weakening methods. How do these modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance, and what are the key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies for different types of zeolites used as supports?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites used as catalyst supports. The review focuses mainly on the synthesis and catalytic applications of small-pore (8-membered ring) zeolites, particularly in reactions such as methanol-to-olefins, selective catalytic reduction of NOx, and partial oxidation of methane. It does not discuss CO2-ODHP or acidity modification strategies in detail. Therefore, I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to this question based solely on the information given in the document.

给出的文献并不包含特别针对CO2-ODHP催化剂或用作催化剂载体的沸石酸性改性技术的信息。该综述主要集中在小孔(8元环)沸石的合成和催化应用上,特别是在甲醇制烯烃、NOx选择性催化还原和甲烷部分氧化等反应中。文中没有详细讨论CO2-ODHP或酸性改性策略。因此,仅基于文档中给出的信息,我无法对这个问题提供全面的回答。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing CO2-ODHP catalysts, zeolite acidity modifications, or optimizing catalytic performance through dealumination or other weakening methods. The document primarily focuses on the synthesis and catalytic applications of small-pore zeolites, particularly in reactions such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), methanol-to-olefins (MTO), and partial oxidation of methane. It does not discuss CO2-ODHP or acidity modification techniques in the context requested by the question.

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing CO2-ODHP catalysts, zeolite acidity modifications like dealumination, or how these modifications optimize catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP. The text focuses primarily on small-pore zeolites and their synthesis methods, as well as applications in other catalytic processes like methanol-to-olefins, selective catalytic reduction of NOx, and methane oxidation. Without relevant information on CO2-ODHP catalysts and zeolite acidity modifications, I cannot provide a substantive answer to this question based solely on the given literature.

给定的文献中没有专门涉及CO2-ODHP催化剂、沸石酸性改性(如脱铝)或这些改性如何优化CO2-ODHP催化性能的信息。该文本主要集中在小孔沸石及其合成方法,以及在其他催化过程中的应用,如甲醇制烯烃、NOx选择性催化还原和甲烷氧化。由于缺乏关于CO2-ODHP催化剂和沸石酸性改性的相关信息,我无法仅基于给定的文献对这个问题提供实质性的回答。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites as catalyst supports. The document primarily focuses on the synthesis and catalytic applications of small-pore zeolites, particularly in areas such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx, methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reactions, and partial oxidation of methane. It does not discuss CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) or acidity modification strategies for zeolites in this context.

To properly answer this question, additional literature sources specifically addressing CO2-ODHP catalysts and zeolite acidity modifications would be needed. The current document does not provide sufficient information to evaluate the properties of zeolites as supports for CO2-ODHP catalysts or to critically assess acidity modification techniques and their impact on catalytic performance in this specific reaction.

给定的文献并不包含特别针对CO2-ODHP催化剂或沸石作为催化剂载体的酸性改性技术的信息。该文档主要关注小孔沸石的合成和催化应用，特别是在选择性催化还原(SCR)NOx、甲醇制烯烃(MTO)反应和甲烷部分氧化等领域。它没有讨论CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢(CO2-ODHP)或在这种背景下的沸石酸性改性策略。

要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的专门讨论CO2-ODHP催化剂和沸石酸性改性的文献资料。目前的文档没有提供足够的信息来评估沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂载体的性质，或者批判性地评估酸性改性技术及其对这种特定反应中催化性能的影响。
