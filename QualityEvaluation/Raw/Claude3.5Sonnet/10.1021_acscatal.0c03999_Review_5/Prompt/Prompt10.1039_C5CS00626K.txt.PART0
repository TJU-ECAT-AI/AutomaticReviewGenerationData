zeolite-catalyzed chemical industry processes
Jing Shi,a Yangdong Wang,a Weimin Yang,a Yi Tang*b and Zaiku Xie*c
The kaleidoscopic applications of zeolite catalysts (zeo-catalysts) in petrochemical processes has been
considered as one of the major accomplishments in recent decades. About twenty types of zeolite have
been industrially applied so far, and their versatile porous architectures have contributed their most
essential features to affect the catalytic efficiency. This review depicts the evolution of pore models
in zeolite catalysts accompanied by the increase in industrial and environmental demands. The
indispensable roles of modulating pore models are outlined for zeo-catalysts for the enhancement of
their catalytic performances in various industrial processes. The zeolites and related industrial processes
discussed range from the uni-modal micropore system of zeolite Y (12-ring micropore, 12-R) in fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC), zeolite ZSM-5 (10-R) in xylene isomerization and SAPO-34 (8-R) in olefin
production to the multi-modal micropore system of MCM-22 (10-R and 12-R pocket) in aromatic alkylation
and the hierarchical pores in FCC and catalytic cracking of C4 olefins. The rational construction of pore
models, especially hierarchical features, is highlighted with a careful classification from an industrial
perspective accompanied by a detailed analysis of the theoretical mechanisms.
1. Introduction
The petrochemical industry plays a crucial role in the economic
growth of our modern society. Zeolite catalysts (zeo-catalysts),
being famous for their porous features, have found widespread
applications and have proved to be substantial and paradigmatic
in oil refining and petrochemical processes, such as fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC), aromatics conversion and olefin production.16
It is unequivocal that the commercial utilization of zeo-catalytic
technologies has significantly promoted the development of the

petrochemical industry over recent decades, and investigations
on zeo-catalytic materials have become an increasingly hot topic
in academia and industry.79 So far, more than two hundred
zeolitic frameworks have been defined and announced by the
International Zeolite Association, and each framework is
described using a three-letter code.10 However, even with natural
zeolites, the emphasis for industrially applied zeo-catalysts in oil
refining and petrochemical process is still placed on zeolites
Y (FAU), ZSM-5 (MFI), mordenite (MOR), beta (BEA), MCM-22
(MWW) and zeolite-like SAPO-34 (CHA) etc.11,12 The most prob-
able reason could be due to their unique pore architectures that
provide a perfect match with the requirement of target reactions,
and their possessing a suitable accessibility of active sites for
guest molecules.1318
With the increasing demand for sustainability and environ-
mental protection, many engineers and scientists have devoted
themselves to improve the efficiency of current industrial
processes or explore new techniques for developing new (petro)-
chemical processes. However, two major challenges still remain
in zeo-catalyzed processes:1924 (1) the necessity to develop new
processes and catalysts for poor-quality or alternative raw
materials, for example, the production of light olefins from
coal or biomass instead of a conventional oil route has attracted
much attention in the past two decades;25 although an indirect
method from synthesis gas (syngas) to light olefins is now on its
way to being commercialized, a direct process is highly desir-
able. And (2) the demand for maximizing the efficiency and
reducing the energy consumption in currently available tech-
nology. One example in this aspect is a tandem reaction which
integrates different reactions in one-pot.26 Eco-efficiency and
added value to the manufacture process would be significantly
enhanced by avoiding separation, transference and reservation of
intermediates. Therefore, to fit in with the higher requirements
of zeo-catalysts for plentiful feed stocks and novel reactions,
explorations on the construction of proper pore architectures
and their effects, especially those of hierarchical structures, are
particularly attractive.27
Several famous zeo-catalysts have been fabricated and applied
in industrial processes as milestones in history, and have
brought on huge changes in petrochemicals. For example, the
introduction of zeolite Y into the FCC process greatly increased
the catalytic efficiency for fuel production, in which the intra-
crystalline supercage of 1.3 nm coupling with the 12-ring (12-R)
micropores at 0.74 nm brought about the concept of the porous
effect.1,28 Later on, the ZSM-5 zeolite with an intersected 10-R
micropore system with sinusoidal channels of 0.51  0.55 nm
and straight channels of 0.53  0.56 nm gave rise to the well-
known concept of shape-selective catalysis maximizing the
benefits in many petrochemical processes.29 In the 1980s,
a SAPO-34 molecular sieve with a narrower 8-R window
(0.380.5 nm) was successfully fabricated boasting excellent
performance in the conversion of natural gas and coal to
chemicals via methanol. Recently, small pore zeo-catalysts have
attracted much attention for the requirements of special
shape-selectivity for small olefins.30,31 Since the 1990s, a new
type of zeo-catalyst has been proposed with a multi-modal
micropore system instead of a unimodal one. For instance,

zeolite MWW with two dimensional 10-R sinusoidal channels
and 12-R supercages located between the layers has provided
fantastic, versatile architectures with unexpected performances
in the alkylation of aromatics.3234
Apart from the innovation of uni- and multi-modal micro-
pores in industrial zeo-catalysts, model constructions of hierar-
chical pores35 have gained increasing interest, and the synthesis
and application of hierarchical zeolites have been reviewed by
many research groups.3639 The hierarchical catalysis concept
was accordingly proposed.40 Thanks to hierarchical pore systems
with multi-functions of micro-meso-macropores, multiple-step
reactions could be carried out in one single zeo-catalyst. As the
product from the previous step could be the reactant of the next
step, energy consumption required for separation, purification
and transformation could be avoided. Many studies and reviews
have indicated that the application of hierarchical zeolites in
various reactions would greatly improve their catalytic perfor-
mances due to the combination of the advantages of both multi-
modal porous systems and the natural properties of zeolite
crystal themselves.41 Being consistent with theoretical and experi-
mental results, some specific cases with hierarchically porous
zeolites used as industrial catalyst were studied by Sinopec.
A micro- and mesoporous structure with the nest-shaped Y
zeolite (called NSY) was successfully synthesized by Sinopec for
a catalytic cracking process through the in situ growth of NaY
zeolite on grains of Kaolin clay.42 With the aid of a special
bi-modal pore system, the NSY catalyst exhibited higher activity
for heavy oil, higher selectivity for gasoline and lower yield for
diesel than commercial systems. Another significant develop-
ment of Sinopec is the full-crystalline zeo-catalyst (zeolite pellets
without binder) with a hierarchical pore structure for the cata-
lytic cracking of C4 olefins prepared via vapor-phase crystal
transformation. Its volume of micropores for catalytic reaction
and that of macropores for molecule diffusion increased as
much as 47.8 and 9.4% compared to the conventional zeolite
catalyst, respectively. Propylene selectivity and stability were
dramatically improved for C4 catalytic cracking when using the
full-crystalline ZSM-5 catalyst. An industrial plant for the cata-
lytic cracking of C4 using such a catalyst has been operating in
China since 2009.43
As indicated from the above crucial cases, the evolution of
industrial zeo-catalysis is closely related to the development of
their pore systems. No matter if it is the unimodal pore system
for zeolites Y (12-R), ZSM-5 (10-R) to SAPO-34 (8-R), or the multi-
modal pore system such as those in zeolite MCM-22 (12-R and
10-R), or the micro-mesoporous zeolite NSY and the macro-
meso-microporous zeolite ZSM-5, the pore model construction
generally plays an indispensable role in the advancement of
zeo-catalysts and the innovation of zeo-catalysis. Inspired by the
abundant studies on the pore construction of zeolites and their
great success in broad applications in the petrochemical field
including those of Sinopec, this review seeks to (1) thoroughly
describe the development and advances of zeo-catalysts in the
fundamental industrial processes of FCC, aromatic conversion
and olefin production, and (2) rationally propose a perspective
for the model construction of pore systems in zeo-catalysts from
the industrial viewpoint through the rational classification of
pore topological types and the theoretical analysis of their effects
on the catalytic properties.
2. Overview of the development of
industrially applied zeo-catalysts
2.1
Zeo-catalysts for FCC process
The development of zeo-catalysts is generally summarized in
Fig. 1. The introduction of Y zeolite in FCC is regarded as a
milestone both for the petroleum industry and for zeo-catalysts.
From then, the porous effect on catalytic processes has become
an attractive point for scientists and has gradually been applied
in the design of industrial catalysts. Many studies have been
carried out to innovate the uni-modal micropore system within
the zeolite to match the ever changing requirements of crude
oil quality and production efficiency.4447 For example, Corma
et al.48 reported a new zeolite ITQ-21 (ITO structure, Fig. 2)
which has cavities as spacious as those in zeolite Y but with the
interconnection of six 12-R windows of 0.74 nm rather than the
four in Y zeolite. Its large void space with controlled size and
connectivity was considered beneficial for the diffusion of large
guest molecules and accessibility of the interior active sites.
Catalytic tests showed that ITQ-21 zeolite exhibited an excellent
performance for vacuum gas oil (VGO) cracking with a conver-
sion of 72.5%, compared to a conversion of 68% by USY zeolite.
In order to satisfy the demand for a higher octane number in
gasoline distillation and good yields of light olefins, addition of a
tiny amount of stream-treated ZSM-5 (10-R) in Y (12-R) zeolite has
been widely adopted in the FCC process. The boosted gasoline
octane number and increased yield of propylene can be explained
by the restrained hydrogen transfer and the enhanced selective
cracking of C7C13 alkanes with straight or short branched
chains in the medium micropore system of ZSM-5 zeolite.4951
Owing to the success of ZSM-5 zeolite, much effort has been
devoted to the exploration of zeolites with different microporous
topologies as cracking additives (Fig. 3).52 The zeolites MCM-22,53
beta54 and IM-555 have been tried in gasoline cracking. The REY,
USY, mordenite,56 ITQ-7,57 TNU-9 and SSZ-3358 zeolites have been
used for VGO cracking and SAPO-5, MCM-41 and VPI-5 have been
applied in residue cracking. The bi-modal microporosity combi-
nation displayed an obvious synergism in the catalysis. Besides,
it is found from Fig. 3 that more and more zeolites with a larger

micropore size have been employed as additives to improve the
catalytic performance of the FCC process. The mechanical
mixture of two zeolites with different micropore windows, i.e.
the mixing of zeo-catalysts, turned out to be a new direction for
the FCC process with well controlled product selectivity.
With the rapid development of industrial catalytic technol-
ogy, strategies for regulating zeolitic micropore structures have
advanced to chemical methods instead of simple mechanical-
mixing.28 For example, a ZSM-5/Y zeolite composite was synthe-
sized through an in situ crystallization of zeolite NaY gel. The
catalytic results implied that the composite ZSM-5/Y zeo-catalyst
with a peculiar reaction space showed an equivalent light
oil (gasoline and diesel) yield and a higher diesel yield and
diesel/gasoline ratio than the mechanically mixed catalyst due to
the improved intracrystal mass transportation.59 Other multi-
microporous composite zeo-catalysts such as zeolites ZSM-5/
SAPO-11 and MFI/MAZ have also been tested.6062
Another aspect to improve the catalytic properties of FCC
lies in conquering the diffusion limitation of the micropore
system for large molecules in crude oil by manipulating the
accessibility of the inner active sites. The composition of the
feedstock for FCC depends on the source and the previous
treatment of crude oil. Processing increasingly heavier feedstock
is accompanied with increasing mass transfer limitations.28
Although zeolite Y with supercages and 12-R windows performs
well in the cracking reaction, large molecules of the reactant/
intermediate/product still suffer from their difficulty in diffusing
into or out of the channels, which might seriously affect the
reaction efficiency and coke formation.63,64 Exploration of the
mesopore system for application in the FCC process has been
made by many groups.6567 MCM-41, with highly regular arrays
of uniform channels on the mesoscale (Fig. 1), is typical.
Although its activity and selectivity is close to or even higher
than that of USY zeolite,66,67 MCM-41 presents a lower stability
(hydrothermal and mechanical) and a reduced acidity, which
limits its actual application. One strategy to solve this problem
is to construct composites of mesoporous materials and micro-
porous zeolites, such as silicalite-1, L, and USY/Y.6870 For
example, FAU zeolite was coated with a thin layer (520 nm)
of mesoporous MCM-41 (MCM-41/USY) by Kloetstra et al.71 and
was tested in cracking of vacuum gas oil. The experimental
results showed that MCM-41/USY exhibited a higher selectivity
for light cycle oil and gasoline and a lower formation of coking
for the cracking of heavier fractions when compared with

uncoated USY. This contributed to the enlarged pore size
caused by mixing the micropore and mesopore together. Moreover,
the coreshell structured meso-HZSM-5@Al-MCM-41 was also pre-
pared from the sequential desilication (HZ-MT and HZ-ET) and
recrystallization (HZ-MR and HZ-ER) of the parent HZSM-5 and
displayed an excellent catalytic performance in the catalytic crack-
ing of supercritical n-dodecane (500 1C, 4 MPa). By analyzing the
product distribution, it is reasonable to conclude that the pre-
cracking of n-dodecane over Al-MCM-41 shell and the enhanced
diffusion in the meso-HZSM-5 core played an important role in the
increased conversion of dodecane (Fig. 4).72 Therefore, this kind of
multi-modal pore material provides another possibility for design-
ing industrial zeolite catalysts in a chemical sense.

Kaolin and provided the mass transportation path for large
molecular reactants. The mesophase contained the primary
and the secondary structural building units of zeolite Y and
supplied the space for pre-cracking of heavy oil molecules
before their entrance into the micropores of Y zeolite. This
advanced gradient pore system significantly facilitated mass
transfer of guest molecules and greatly improved the accessi-
bility to active sites, leading to increased yields of gasoline and
reduced amounts of coke and dry gas. Furthermore, the
asphaltenes (polymeric structures of up to 350 Å) in the heavy
oil would not penetrate into the intracrystalline micropores of
HY zeolites and affect the catalytic cracking in the micropores
of the zeolite.
Hence, the key point in the design of an excellent zeolitic
catalyst for cracking reactions lies in the construction of a
hierarchical structure to optimize the porous gradient for mass
transfer and accelerate the elementary reactions of reactants
with distinct diameters.
In addition to fabricating composites of different zeolites
with various porosities, a more promising idea is to integrate
the dual/multi-sizes or structures of pores into one crystal.75
Park et al. demonstrated gas-oil cracking on a mesoporous
ZSM-5 zeo-catalyst for the first time with intracrystal mesopores
of 2.2 and 5.2 nm (MSU-MFI(2.2) and MSU-MFI(5.2)) shown in
Fig. 6a prepared using a soft templating method.76 Notably, the
nitrogen uptake at P/P0 = 0.100.90 for the MSU-MFI derivatives
was higher than that of ZSM-5 due to the capillary condensation
of the adsorbate in the small mesopores (Fig. 6b). Jin et al.77
presented a facile method for the fabrication of mesoporous
zeolite Y with bifunctional [(CH3O)3SiC3H6N(CH3)2C18H37]Cl
as a template. With the introduced intracrystalline mesoporosity
in zeolite Y (Fig. 6e and f), this material showed superior catalytic
performance for heavy oil catalytic cracking (Fig. 6d). A signifi-
cant increase in yields of gasoline and reduction in yields of coke
and dry gas were achieved with mesoporous zeolite Y as com-
pared with the classical microporous zeolite Y.
The development of zeo-catalysts shows that the rational
design and regulation of the pore structure is of significance in
determining the conversion of the raw material and the distribu-
tion of the final products in the FCC process. The matching of the
pore system with the reactants and the target products is very
important. The existence of large pores and spaces would increase
the accessibility of the interior active sites while the small ones
would mainly give rise to spaces for reactions with high activity
and shape-selectivity. The tendency to design catalysts for oil
refining processes will grow, not only in the combination of
various zeolites with different pore sizes or pore structures, but
also in the integration of hierarchical pores with specially
designed macro-meso-micropores in zeolite crystals.
2.2
Zeo-catalysts for conversion of aromatics
The replacement of liquid acid catalysts by solid ones provides
a solution to the potential environmental problems in indus-
trial processes.78,79 Owing to the perfect geometric matching of
aromatics and micropores,8083 zeolites have become the most
attractive catalysts for the selective conversion of aromatics,
such as p-xylene production through xylene isomerization and
alkylbenzene preparation via benzene alkylation. So far, industrial
technology for the shape-selective transformation of aromatics has
been viewed as a dominant trend in zeo-catalysts. The construction
of pore systems in zeo-catalysts, especially multi-modal pore struc-
tures, has a great impact on the development of these processes. An
enhanced efficiency of catalysts is achieved via lowering of the
diffusion limitation of the reactant/product but maintaining the
shape-selectivity of the intrinsic microporosity of the zeolite.

aromatics might also occur. Its selectivity is therefore a main
concern for catalytic evaluation. It has long been assumed that the
zeo-catalyzed mechanism of xylene isomerization was largely
governed by the pore structures of the zeolite, i.e. the space
confinement and molecule proximity inside the cavities of the
zeolites could favor bimolecular over unimolecular reactions on
amorphous silicaalumina.85 Besides, for large-pore zeolites
with bigger void spaces or wider pore sizes, the isomerization
would undergo a bimolecular mechanism and require dispro-
portionation and transalkylation involving tri- and tetramethyl-
ated diphenylmethane (3mDPM and 4mDPM) derivatives as
reaction intermediates.84,93 Consequently, the catalytic perfor-
mance will be greatly dependent on the pore architecture of the
zeolite used.
Industrially, the zeolite mordenite has a good performance
due to its wide micropore aperture with 12-R (0.570.70 nm),
which is convenient for access of the reactant. However, this
large pore size also provides sufficient space for transalkylation
and causes the non-negligible generation of by-products, such
as toluene and C9-aromatics, while with ZSM-5 zeolite the
transalkylation reaction is greatly inhibited due to its confined
space for the bi-molecuear reaction. However, the smaller pores
of the industrialized zeolite ZSM-5 also promote the undesired
dealkylation process and reduce the amount of the target
aromatic produced.8690 To solve such a problem, a special bi-
modal micropore EU-1 zeolite, with medium 10-R pores (similar
to ZSM-5) and large 12-R side pockets, was studied and indus-
trialized for the isomerization of xylene.91 Its unique bimodal
micropore structure could not only offer a shape-selective
reaction space for the main isomerization reaction but also
promote the diffusion of product molecules and thereby inhibit
the dealkylation, which renders it with a possibility of both high
conversion and high selectivity under milder conditions. Indus-
trialized plants based on these zeo-catalysts are in operation all
over the world, as listed in Table 1 and Fig. 7.
Additionally, many studies have been conducted for the
development of this process.92 Hong et al.93 compared the
catalytic properties of up to 16 zeolites with different frame-
work topologies for this aromatic transformation. These zeo-
lites can be generally classified into two types: (1) zeolites with a
uni-micropore system containing 12-R or 10-R channels such as
mordenite, beta, Y, H-ZSM-5, H-IM-5, H-ITQ-2, H-ZSM-22 and
H-ZSM-23 and (2) zeolites with a bi-micropore system with 12-R
plus 10-R (e.g. H-MCM-22, H-TNU-9, H-NU-87 and H-EU-1) and
10-R plus 8-R channels (e.g. H-ZSM-57, H-TNU-10, H-SUZ-4, and
H-ferrierite). It was found that for uni-micropore systems, the
zeolites with a medium size gave a notably higher conversion
and higher yield than any of those with a large pore size, such as
H-Y, H-beta, and H-mordenite via the bimolecular mechanism. For
the bi-micropore system, the shortest dimensions (4.0 or 4.1 Å) of
the 10-ring portals in H-MCM-22 imparted a smaller intracrystal-
line diffusivity of m-xylene and presented a fairly low conversion
and product yield. H-TNU-10 (STI) and H-ZSM-57 (MFS) with
intersecting 10- plus 8-ring channels showed slightly lower and
higher conversions at 523 K than HZSM-5, respectively, but gave
rise to considerably higher p-xylene/o-xylene ratios than H-ZSM-5.
As for H-TNU-9 (TUN) and H-NU-87 with 10-ring and 12-ring
pockets, a higher m-xylene conversion was observed, suggesting
their promising potential as isomerization catalysts (Fig. 8).
2.2.2
Zeo-catalysts for alkylation of benzene and ethylene. As
an important intermediate in styrene production, ethylbenzene
(EB) is highly required in the petrochemical industry for use in
making polystyrene.94 Industrially, EB is mainly fabricated
through two methods, i.e., alkylation of benzene with ethylene
in the gaseous phase or liquid phase. Some commercial pro-
cesses are listed in Table 2.
2.2.2.1 Gas phase. Mobil and Badger developed an indus-
trialized alkylation technology for EB fabrication in the vapor
phase on the basis of the ZSM-5 catalyst.95,96 Thanks to the
proper pore size of this zeolite, the efficiencies for EB diffusion
and alkyl transfer were drastically increased while the production
of polyethylbenzene was greatly suppressed.97 However, the pure
zeolite ZSM-5 catalyst suffered from severe disadvantages. For
example, the high benzene to ethylene molar ratio (B/E of about
816) required more energy for the separation of EB. The high
level of byproducts, the low selectivity toward EB and the rapid
deactivation of the catalyst required severe operating conditions
and frequent regeneration.98 Thereafter, improvement of this
zeo-catalyst was highly desired for this process.
An intergrown structure of ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 zeolites with
special reaction space of multi-micropores was synthesized

by Mobil.99,100 The skeletal drawing of its periodic framework is
shown in Fig. 9A. Xu et al.101,102 successfully synthesized a
series of ZSM-5/ZSM-11 co-crystalline zeolites with various
compositions and morphologies via an organic template-free
hydrothermal route (Fig. 9B and C) and studied their alkylation
kinetics and coking behaviors. It was found that this mechani-
cally bi-micropore structure favored the diffusion of large inter-
mediates and the selective formation of ethylbenzene, but
inhibited the generation of multinuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
for coke formation. Based on research of the reaction behavior
with time, temperature, reactants and products during the
alkylation process, the coking rate followed the order of ethyl-
benzene 4 ethylene 4 propylene 4 benzene for single com-
ponents, and benzeneethylene 4 benzenepropylene for
bi-components. Thanks to the decreased coke deposition and
prolonged stability of the catalyst, ZSM-5/ZSM-11 intergrown
zeolite was successfully industrialized for ethylbenzene pre-
paration by DICP in China.103,104
Since the similar boiling points of xylene and ethylbenzene
often lead to a serious problem in the separation process,

the co-existence of xylene as a by-product, even in trace amounts,
is fatal in the alkylation process of EB fabrication.105,106 It is
found that the formation of xylene is generally ascribed to the
cracking and consequent transalkylation of EB (Fig. 10). There-
fore, to inhibit its generation, the diffusion properties of the
zeo-catalyst needs to be improved. On the one hand, zeolites
with bi-micropores in one crystal, such as NU-87 (NES) zeolite
with 10-R channels intersected by perpendicular 12-R cavities,107109
may provide an interesting candidate for this catalysis. Its large
12-R cavities provide the spaces for the diffusion and reaction
of large molecules, while its unique bi-micropore system would
allow the products to diffuse at different rates. On the other
hand, hierarchical pore zeolites with intra- or inter-crystalline
mesoporosity interconnecting with the inherent microporosity

would improve the additional mass transportability of guest
species through the micropore-to-mesopore and mesopore-to-
mesopore networks.110 MCM-36 zeolite, derived from MCM-22(P)
with silica species pillared between the layers, possessed a unique
pseudo-hierarchical porous structure with micro- and meso-
pores. Such a meso/microporous system had abundant exposed
acid sites and promoted the diffusion of products in the porous
networks, which consequently reduced/inhibited the formation
of xylene.111 Furthermore, studies on the synthesis of meso-
porous ZSM-5 zeolite with meso- and micro-pores both existing
in a crystal have also been reported recently.112 The catalytic
properties of this bi-modal pore in the alkylation of benzene
with ethylene are shown in Fig. 11A and B. The authors
attributed the improved catalytic activity and the high selectivity
of ethylbenzene to the rapid diffusion of desired products in the
interconnected mesoporous networks, which shortened the path
length of the micropores within each individual zeolite crystal.
Such connection of the hierarchical pore network could also
be confirmed using laser-hyperpolarized 129Xe NMR (HP 129Xe
NMR)113 on the synthesized mesoporous ZSM-5 zeolite using
tetrapropylammonium hydroxide with starch as the co-template
(Fig. 11C and D). The results of the two-dimensional exchange

spectroscopy (EXSY) indicate that even at very low temperature,
Xe atoms still undergo much faster exchange between meso-
pores and micropores in meso-ZSM-5 than conventional ZSM-5.
2.2.2.2 Liquid phase. The adoption of Y zeolite as a catalyst
for benzene alkylation in the liquid phase was explored by UOP/
Lummus/Unocal.114 Afterwards, zeolite beta with high defects
was gradually applied in this process for its higher selectivity of
EB. The three-dimensional 12-R interconnected chiral micro-
pore network with a pore size relatively smaller than that of Y
zeolite greatly matched the reaction requirements and effi-
ciently prevented the formation of bulky by-products. However,
the diffusion limit in these uni-micropores was still consider-
able at low temperature in the liquid phase, and in this case,
bulky by-products of alkylbenzene would be generated from
further alkylation of benzene and led to a high B/E ratio in the
raw material in the industrial process.115,116
In the 1990s, bi-modal zeolite MCM-22 was gradually developed
for its application in the liquid phase alkylation of benzene with a
low ratio of B/E, such as the famous EBMax process developed by
Mobil.117 This novel zeolite possesses a unique 10-R pore and 12-R
half-supercage as well as a lamellar structure.118120 On the one
hand, its 10-R pore with a certain degree of shape-selectivity could
promote the formation of EB in alkylation more than that in the
12-R pore of zeolite beta. On the other hand, its layered structure
and large-sized supercage would supply enough space for the
diffusion of bulky products which could efficiently decrease coke
formation to improve the stability of the catalyst. In the litera-
ture,121 the role of the pore system in the valued MCM-49 system,
possessing nearly the same framework topology as calcinated
MCM-22 (only the average unit cell c-parameter is 0.02 nm longer
in MCM-49),33 was studied through the coking and poisoning of
the distinct pores or cages. It was found that the main reaction
occurred in the pockets at the surface while coke deposition and
oligomerization of ethylene were more favorably produced in the
large space of the supercages and 10-R pores. Shu et al.122124
obtained MCM-49 zeolite via the transformation from NaA (LTA)
zeolite in the synergism of hexamethyleneimine (HMI), NaOH,
and SiO2 (Fig. 12A). The easy accessibility of active sites provided
simultaneous improvement in ethylene conversion and EB selec-
tivity. Afterwards, this group further investigated the size control
and morphology control of the obtained MCM-49 (Fig. 12B and C).
By changing the original size of the parent FAU zeolites via
topology reconstruction (Fig. 12B), size controlled synthesis of
MCM-49 zeolites was achieved. This demonstrated that the
smaller the MCM-49, the better the accessibility to the active
centers for benzene and the higher the geometrical regularity of
the zeolite, which ensured excellent catalytic performance in the
liquid-phase alkylation of benzene with ethylene. For morphol-
ogy tailoring, they post-treated the as-synthesized MCM-49 with
tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) and obtained different
samples from rose-like shapes to small irregular sheets packed
in disorder (Fig. 12C). These materials with increased surface
areas and pore volumes would offer more opportunities for
reactants to access the active centers to increase ethylene con-
version without loss of EB selectivity.
2.2.3
Zeolites for cumene synthesis. The development
and catalytic ability of pore systems with different zeolites in
cumene synthesis are listed in Table 3. In the alkylation of
benzene with propylene, byproducts like n-propylbenzene would
be favored instead of cumene (IPB) when ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is
used (Fig. 13),106 and a higher reaction temperature is needed
to circumvent the diffusion limitation in the 10-R pores of
ZSM-5.125,126 Therefore, the main trend in industrial processes
was to use zeolites X, Y or mordenite with large uni-micropore
sizes for cumene synthesis.127 The catalytic properties of zeo-
lites beta, ZSM-12, ERB-1, Y and mordenite were compared for
cumene synthesis via experimental and computational methods
(Fig. 14).126,128 Among these zeolites, beta zeolite appeared to be
the most efficient catalyst producing the smallest amount of
propylene oligomers and n-propylbenzene on account of the
differences in the diffusion barriers and the binding energy in
the micropores. Furthermore, it exhibited high cumene selectivity
as well as catalytic activity due to the three-dimensional network
with sufficient pore space and appropriate acid strength. Con-
sequently, this new alkylation catalyst for cumene was studied by
UOP and the so-called Q-Max process was successfully developed
in the early 1990s.129 Concluding from the applied patents, the
catalyst named MgAPSO-31 in such a process was beta zeolite.
The efficacy of the uni-micropore system in zeolite beta and
the bi-micropore system in the MCM-22 catalyst was tested using
a real feed under experimental conditions.130 Zeolite MCM-22
produced a lower yield of unknown oligomer and deactivated
more slowly than zeolite beta. The diffusion of benzene and
cumene in either of the two pore systems of zeolite MCM-22 was
hampered by a high energy barrier, while for beta zeolite, both
benzene and cumene could diffuse without great difficulty due
to the lower steric hindrance. Corma et al.33 treated a sample of
zeolite MCM-22 with 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, which was too
large to diffuse through 10-R windows and channels, to passivate
the external surface of MCM-22 without poisoning the internal
acid sites of this zeolite.
It was found that the oligomer produced inside the 10-R
cavities of MWW zeolite would not affect the alkylation of
benzene with propylene which mainly occurred in the 12-R cups
or the pore mouths on the external surface. Moreover, the improve-
ment of diffusion rate in the 12-R pores would benefit the genera-
tion of cumene with the advantage of dynamic diffusion, and
remarkably decrease the production of n-propylbenzene.34 How-
ever, due to the unavoidable condensation of interlamellar SiOH
in calcination, the open half-supercage of MWW zeolite usually
converted into the closed cage, leading to the obvious diminishing
of accessible acid sites.131 Sinopec recently developed a new
technology for the preparation of lamellar MWW zeolite using
an organosilicone hybrid method.132 Grafting organosilicones
in situ on the layer could efficiently inhibit the condensation of
SiOH groups and hence generate a long-range disordered
lamellar structure. Such an open-pore structured zeolite with
an organosilicone hybrid lamellar was named SRZ-21 by Sinopec
and commercialized in 2010, and exhibited good catalytic per-
formance for the industrial alkylation process of cumene with a
low benzene/propylene (B/P) ratio.

Recently, a new kind of zeolite with a bi-micropore system,
zeolite ITQ-39, was prepared. It possessed an outstanding pore
system with interconnected large pores of 12-R and medium
pores of 10-R and therefore achieved an effective pore diameter
between ZSM-5 and beta zeolites.133,134 In the alkylation
of benzene with propylene, such a bi-modal 12-R plus 10-R
pore network exhibited improved diffusion properties and an
increased selectivity of the target product (Fig. 15AD). Besides,
ITQ-24, another new bi-micropore zeolite, containing two sets
of 12-R channels and one 10-R channel system that intersected
perpendicularly to both 12-R channel systems has been found
to be catalytically active and selective for the alkylation of

It is reasonable to conclude that pore model construction from
uni-micropore to bi-micropore or even pseudo-hierarchical pores
could find a foothold to improve industrial alkylation processes
and would further direct the development of zeo-catalysis.
2.3
Zeo-catalysts for olefin production
Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene were traditionally
produced via thermal cracking of hydrocarbons at high
temperature.138 After 2000, the zeo-catalysts SAPO-34 and zeo-
lite ZSM-5 were demonstrated to be of use for the conversion of
methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and the cracking of C4/C5 olefins,
respectively and the related techniques were successfully com-
mercialized.139,140 These two processes mainly involved the
transformation of intermediates in the hydrocarbon pool which
could be tuned and regulated by means of precisely controlling
the pore system in the zeolite catalyst.

including light olefins could be produced from methanol when
catalyzed by H-ZSM-5, which was the so-called methanol-to-
hydrocarbons (MTH) conversion.141 This process has emerged as
an attractive alternative to the re-emergence of the coal chemical
industry.142146 The raw material methanol can be converted to
diverse products through methanol-to-olefin (MTO), methanol-
to-propylene (MTP) and methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) conver-
sions, when catalyzed by different zeolites with specific pore
structures (Fig. 16).147
The reaction mechanism of MTO conversion is very compli-
cated due to the complex product distribution (olefins, alkanes,
and aromatics). During the past four decades, over 20 different
reaction mechanisms were proposed, and many experimental
and theoretical works have been dedicated to understand the
MTO reaction mechanism.148,149,152,153 More details can be found
in recent reviews.152,153 Herein, the viewpoints on the MTO
reaction mechanisms are concisely summarized. A direct
coupling mechanism, displayed in Fig. 17A, involving C1 species
like carbenium, carbene, and oxonium-ylide, were proved impos-
sible due to the higher energy barriers.150152 Later, an indirect
reaction mechanism, known as a hydrocarbon pool mechanism,
see Fig. 17B, has gained wide acceptance.153 In this mechanism,
certain organic reaction centers, called hydrocarbon pool spe-
cies, act as co-catalysts at which methanol reacts to form alkyl
chains, and then these alkyl chains eliminate to produce light
olefins as products. Both polymethylbenzenes and olefins them-
selves were once proposed as the primary hydrocarbon pool
species in the MTO conversion. A dual-cycle concept was then
proposed according to the features of the hydrocarbon pool.154
In H-ZSM-5, Svelle et al.145 proposed that ethylene was exclu-
sively produced from an aromatic-based cycle, while propylene
and higher olefins were produced from an olefin-based cycle. In
the aromatic-based cycle, the alkyl side chain could be formed by
side chain or paring reaction routes. It was theoretically found
that it was a side chain cycle rather than a paring route which
played an important role in this cycle in H-SAPO-34. Polymethyl-
benzenium cations and species with exocyclic double bonds
were believed to be important intermediates in the side chain
aromatic-based cycle. In the olefin-based cycle (see Fig. 17C),
methanol reacted with olefins to form higher carbenium
cations and then the latter cracked into lighter olefins. In this
proposed olefin-based cycle, all the observed products includ-
ing olefins, alkanes, and aromatics could be formulated. We
theoretically indicated that the distribution of cracking pre-
cursors (carbenium cations, alkoxides, and higher olefins)
affected the product distribution.
A large number of zeolites or aluminosilicate zeotypes either
with uni-micropores like ZSM-48, ZSM-12, ZSM-22 or those with
bi-micropores like SAPO-46 and EU-1, etc. have been extensively
explored for MTO conversion (Table 4).155157 Song et al.157
reported that for one-dimensional (1D) zeolite catalysts with
similar pore structures, it is a difference of 0.3 Å in pore size
(e.g., 5.6  6.0 Å for H-ZSM-12 and 4.6  5.7 Å for H-ZSM-22)
that leads to an activity difference for the MTO process. The
sizes of the main hydrocarbon pool intermediates for the MTO
process are suggested to be between 5.7 and 6.0 Å. Olsbye and
Svelle et al.155 systematically compared the distribution of
products in 1D 10-R zeolites, such as ZSM-22, ZSM-23, ZSM-48
and EU-1. Although the ZSM-22 and ZSM-23 zeolites both
possess 1D channel structures of 10-R, the activity and product
distributions are obviously different, as shown in Fig. 18A. In
another set of 10-R zeolites with different volumes at channel
intersections (TNU-9, IM-5, ZSM-11, and ZSM-5, Fig. 18C), Olsbye
et al.158 found that the effluent products were strikingly similar
with different life-time durations. The presence of larger cavities
in TNU-9 and IM-5 resulted in the formation of polyaromatics
and fast deactivation compared to ZSM-5 and ZSM-11. By care-
fully selecting SAPO molecular sieves with different cavity sizes
but having identical 8-R pore openings, Liu et al.159 compared
the confinement effects on the intermediates in olefin genera-
tion. Verified using isotopic tracing methods and theoretical
calculations based on the observation of two types of carbenium
intermediates, polyMB+ and polyMCP+, the cavity size controlled
the intermediate type and resulted in different MTO activity and
product selectivity. Dai et al.160 also compared different frame-
works of SAPO-11 (10-R, 4  6.5 Å), SAPO-46 (12-R, 7  7 Å) and
SAPO-41 (10-R, 4.3  7.0 Å) possessing 2D and 3D pore archi-
tectures for MTO. The results in Fig. 18B indicated that the
oversized pore windows/cages of SAPO-46 permitted the diffu-
sion of high-carbon branched hydrocarbons (4C4) and alkyl-
benzenes, and exhibited a quite low catalytic activity. By slightly
increasing the pore size as in SAPO-11 and SAPO-41, initial
methanol conversion could be enhanced effectively. Although
the selectivity to olefins in SAPO-41 was not as high as that in
SAPO-34, the lifetime of the former was superior to SAPO-11 and
SAPO-34 due to its moderate pore size and sufficient Brnsted
acid sites. These features facilitated the diffusion of inter-
mediates from re-methylation on the one hand, and prevented
deactivation of the zeo-catalyst on the other hand. Davis et al.16
compared the catalytic performance of zeolites containing
8-R pores with different cavity geometries (SSZ-13, SSZ-16, and
SSZ-17). They observed that the selectivity to ethylene decreased
as the cage size increased, and the propylene selectivity for
SSZ-13 exceeded those of either SSZ-16 or SSZ-17. Liu et al.161

also compared zeolites with 8-R pores (H-SAPO-18, H-SAPO-34,
and H-SAPO-35). They found that the primary products in
H-SAPO-34 and H-SAPO-18 were propylene and butylene, while
the primary products in H-SAPO-35 were ethylene and propylene,
and in particular ethylene was predominantly produced. The
formed coke species was found to greatly depend on the reaction
temperature and cage size. Employing a classical molecular
dynamics method, we found that the diffusion abilities of
ethylene and propylene varied with the zeolite framework
topology.162 The diffusion of propylene in CHA with 8-R pores
was severely restricted since the diffusion barrier was more
than 20 kJ mol1, and the ratio of the self-diffusion coefficient
of ethylene/propylene was as high as 18 kJ mol1. By using
12C-/13C-methanol switching technology, Liu et al. comparatively
studied MTO conversion over ZSM-5, ZSM-22 and SAPO-34.163

was found to be hindered in TON-structured ZSM-22 with a one
dimensional channel structure without intersections. Since it
could provide a large space at 5.7  4.6 Å2, a low selectivity was
observed with the mechanism through the methylation and
cracking steps. However zeolite ZSM-5, which had a dual inter-
connected channel structure, provided suitable space for the
evolution of hydrocarbon pool species and produced a relatively
high selectivity for ethylene and propylene. In contrast, due to
the smaller pore size, SAPO-34 was found to produce a lower
amount of aromatics than ZSM-5 and presented the highest
selectivity for light olefins. Additionally, this process was also
tested for USM-12 (ERI), H-SSZ-13 (CHA), H-SAPO-34 (CHA) and
H-SAPO-17 (ERI) by Lee et al.164 It was demonstrated that the
intermediate of phenanthrene rather than methylphenanthrenes
could be detected in the deactivated zeolite with CHA topology.
However in the ERI-type architecture, the trend was opposite.
Both methylphenanthrenes and methylanthracenes were detect-
able in the products. It is well known that methylanthracenes are
slightly narrower but longer than methylphenanthrenes which
matched perfectly with the ERI cage that was slightly narrower
but had a longer space than the CHA cage. This suggests that in
the small-pore cage-based material, the shapes and sizes of
cavities/windows may act as reverse templates for the formation
of the accumulated aromatics and finally govern the MTO
catalytic activity, selectivity and deactivation. Therefore, fine
tuning of the pore structure in zeolites is a very critical factor
for the catalytic performance in MTO conversion.
In addition to the precise control of the uni-micropore and
bi-mircopore zeolites either through the morphology or the
particle size,165,166 the introduction of hierarchical-pores into a
microporous zeolite framework can not only improve the
accessibility of the active sites for molecules of a special size,
but also influence the shape selectivity to reactants/intermediates/
products of zeolitic pore structures. Several works have reported
the preparation of hierarchical zeolites through (1) a bottom-up
method with templates followed by calcination or (2) a top-down
strategy with extraction of one framework element from the
zeolite. The referred-to templates of mesoporous zeolites for
the MTO process mainly include carbon nanomaterials and
nanotubes,167 P123168,169 and N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantan-
ammonium hydroxide (TMAdOH).170 Extraction was mainly
performed using an acid or basic treatment like NaOH171 and
fluoride ions.172 Furthermore, SAPO-34/Kaolin microspheres
(4-SCKMs) were obtained under hydrothermal conditions using
TEAOH as a template after pre-treating the Kaolin with 4 wt%
NaOH solution.173 Its catalytic activity could be preserved for
more than 960 min because of the existence of mesopores (pore
size 17.4 nm) which improved the diffusion of larger molecules
and decreased the formation of coking.

Zeo-catalysts for catalytic cracking of C4 olefins. In
recent years, the catalytic cracking of C4 olefins has been proved
to be important in boosting the demand of light olefins and
there has been an increasing interest in the catalytic cracking of
butene to produce ethylene and propylene. The representative
technologies for the catalytic cracking of C4 olefins are the MOI
technology from Mobil, the Superflex technology from ARCO
and the Propylur technology from Lurgi. These processes are
mainly catalyzed by the acidic ZSM-5 zeolite with a medium
