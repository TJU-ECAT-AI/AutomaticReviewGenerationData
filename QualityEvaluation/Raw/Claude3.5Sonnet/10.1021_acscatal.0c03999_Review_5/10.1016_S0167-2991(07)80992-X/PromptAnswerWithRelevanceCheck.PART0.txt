The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing zeolites as support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques such as dealumination. The text focuses on the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins over different zeolite catalysts (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) to produce propylene. It does not discuss CO2-ODHP reactions or acidity modification strategies for zeolites. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided information.

The literature does not directly address CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites. However, it does provide some insights into zeolite properties and their catalytic performance in related reactions.

Zeolites are promising support materials due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. These properties make them widely used in industrial processes.

The study compared three zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) for C4-olefin cracking reactions. While this is not CO2-ODHP, it provides some relevant information on zeolite performance:

1. Acid strength varied among zeolites, with H-SAPO-34 having the lowest and H-mordenite the highest.
2. Stability in catalytic tests was highest for H-SAPO-34 and H-ZSM-5, with H-mordenite being less stable.
3. H-ZSM-5 was found to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene.
4. Smaller crystal size in H-ZSM-5 led to higher stability over longer periods.

While the study doesn't discuss acidity modification techniques, it demonstrates that zeolite properties like acid strength and crystal size can significantly impact catalytic performance and stability. These factors would likely be important considerations when selecting and modifying zeolites for CO2-ODHP catalysts as well.

The optimal zeolite and modification strategy would depend on the specific requirements of CO2-ODHP reactions, which may differ from C4-olefin cracking. Further research would be needed to determine how these properties and potential modifications could be optimized for CO2-ODHP catalysts specifically.

该文献没有直接涉及CO2-ODHP催化剂或沸石的酸性改性技术。然而，它确实提供了一些关于沸石性质及其在相关反应中的催化性能的见解。

沸石是很有前景的支撑材料，因为它们具有热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性。这些特性使它们在工业过程中得到广泛应用。

该研究比较了三种沸石（H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34）在C4烯烃裂解反应中的性能。虽然这不是CO2-ODHP，但它提供了一些关于沸石性能的相关信息：

1. 不同沸石的酸强度不同，H-SAPO-34最低，H-mordenite最高。
2. 在催化测试中，H-SAPO-34和H-ZSM-5的稳定性最高，H-mordenite的稳定性较低。
3. H-ZSM-5被发现是C4烯烃裂解生产丙烯的最佳催化剂。
4. H-ZSM-5的晶体尺寸较小，长期稳定性更高。

虽然该研究没有讨论酸性改性技术，但它表明沸石的性质，如酸强度和晶体尺寸，可以显著影响催化性能和稳定性。在选择和改性用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石时，这些因素可能也是重要的考虑因素。

最佳的沸石和改性策略将取决于CO2-ODHP反应的具体要求，这可能与C4烯烃裂解不同。需要进行进一步的研究来确定这些性质和潜在的改性如何能够针对CO2-ODHP催化剂进行优化。

The given literature does not directly address CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites. However, it does provide some insights into zeolite properties and their use as catalysts in general.

Zeolites are promising support materials due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. These properties make them widely used in industrial processes. The literature compares three types of zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) for C4-olefin cracking reactions, which may provide some insights applicable to other catalytic processes.

The study found that acid strength varied among the zeolites, with H-SAPO-34 having the lowest acidity, followed by H-ZSM-5, and H-mordenite having the highest acidity. However, stability in catalytic tests followed a different order, with H-SAPO-34 and H-ZSM-5 showing higher stability than H-mordenite.

H-ZSM-5 was identified as the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. Additionally, the crystal size of H-ZSM-5 was found to affect its stability, with smaller crystal sizes exhibiting higher stability over longer periods.

While the literature does not discuss specific acidity modification techniques or their application to CO2-ODHP catalysts, it does highlight the importance of considering factors such as acid strength, stability, and crystal size when selecting and optimizing zeolite catalysts for specific reactions. These considerations could potentially be applied when developing strategies for modifying zeolites for use as supports in CO2-ODHP catalysts.

给定的文献并未直接讨论CO2-ODHP催化剂或沸石的酸性改性技术。然而，它确实提供了一些关于沸石性质及其作为催化剂的一般用途的见解。

沸石作为有前景的支撑材料，归因于其热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性以及形状选择性。这些特性使得它们在工业过程中得到广泛应用。文献比较了三种类型的沸石（H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34）在C4-烯烃裂解反应中的性能，这可能为其他催化过程提供一些适用的见解。

研究发现，沸石之间的酸强度有所不同，H-SAPO-34的酸性最低，其次是H-ZSM-5，H-mordenite的酸性最高。然而，在催化测试中的稳定性顺序不同，H-SAPO-34和H-ZSM-5显示出比H-mordenite更高的稳定性。

H-ZSM-5被确定为C4-烯烃裂解生产丙烯的最佳催化剂。此外，H-ZSM-5的晶体尺寸被发现会影响其稳定性，较小的晶体尺寸在较长时间内表现出更高的稳定性。

虽然文献没有讨论具体的酸性改性技术或其在CO2-ODHP催化剂中的应用，但它确实强调了在选择和优化特定反应的沸石催化剂时，考虑诸如酸强度、稳定性和晶体尺寸等因素的重要性。这些考虑因素可能在开发用于CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑物的沸石改性策略时具有潜在的应用价值。
