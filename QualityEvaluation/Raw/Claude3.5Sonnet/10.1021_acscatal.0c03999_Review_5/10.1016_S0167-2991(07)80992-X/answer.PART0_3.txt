The literature does not directly address CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites. However, it does provide some general insights into zeolite properties and their use as catalysts.

Zeolites are promising support materials due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. These properties make them widely used in industrial processes. 

The study compares three zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) for C4-olefin cracking, which is a different reaction than CO2-ODHP. It found that acid strength and stability varied among the zeolites, with H-ZSM-5 showing the best overall performance for propylene production.

While the paper doesn't discuss acidity modification techniques, it does note that crystal size affects catalyst performance. Smaller H-ZSM-5 crystals exhibited higher stability over time compared to larger ones.

The study doesn't provide specific information on dealumination or other acidity modification methods. However, the findings suggest that controlling acid strength and crystal size could be important strategies for optimizing zeolite catalysts for various reactions, potentially including CO2-ODHP.

该文献并未直接讨论CO2-ODHP催化剂或沸石的酸性改性技术。然而，它确实提供了一些关于沸石性质及其作为催化剂使用的一般见解。

由于沸石具有热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，使其成为有前景的载体材料。这些特性使得沸石在工业过程中得到广泛应用。

该研究比较了三种沸石（H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34）在C4-烯烃裂解中的性能，这与CO2-ODHP是不同的反应。研究发现，这些沸石的酸强度和稳定性各不相同，其中H-ZSM-5在丙烯生产方面表现最佳。

虽然这篇论文没有讨论酸性改性技术，但它确实指出晶体尺寸会影响催化剂性能。较小的H-ZSM-5晶体与较大晶体相比，随时间推移表现出更高的稳定性。

该研究没有提供关于脱铝或其他酸性改性方法的具体信息。然而，研究结果表明，控制酸强度和晶体尺寸可能是优化各种反应的沸石催化剂的重要策略，可能包括CO2-ODHP反应。
