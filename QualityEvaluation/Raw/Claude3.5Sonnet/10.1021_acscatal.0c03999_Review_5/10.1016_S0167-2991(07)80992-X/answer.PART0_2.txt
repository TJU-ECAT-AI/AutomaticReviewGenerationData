The given literature does not directly address CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites. However, it does provide some insights into zeolite properties and their use as catalysts in general.

Zeolites are promising support materials due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. These properties make them widely used in industrial processes. The literature compares three types of zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) for C4-olefin cracking reactions, which may provide some insights applicable to other catalytic processes.

The study found that acid strength varied among the zeolites, with H-SAPO-34 having the lowest acidity, followed by H-ZSM-5, and H-mordenite having the highest acidity. However, stability in catalytic tests followed a different order, with H-SAPO-34 and H-ZSM-5 showing higher stability than H-mordenite.

H-ZSM-5 was identified as the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. Additionally, the crystal size of H-ZSM-5 was found to affect its stability, with smaller crystal sizes exhibiting higher stability over longer periods.

While the literature does not discuss specific acidity modification techniques or their application to CO2-ODHP catalysts, it does highlight the importance of considering factors such as acid strength, stability, and crystal size when selecting and optimizing zeolite catalysts for specific reactions. These considerations could potentially be applied when developing strategies for modifying zeolites for use as supports in CO2-ODHP catalysts.

给定的文献并未直接讨论CO2-ODHP催化剂或沸石的酸性改性技术。然而，它确实提供了一些关于沸石性质及其作为催化剂的一般用途的见解。

沸石作为有前景的支撑材料，归因于其热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性以及形状选择性。这些特性使得它们在工业过程中得到广泛应用。文献比较了三种类型的沸石（H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34）在C4-烯烃裂解反应中的性能，这可能为其他催化过程提供一些适用的见解。

研究发现，沸石之间的酸强度有所不同，H-SAPO-34的酸性最低，其次是H-ZSM-5，H-mordenite的酸性最高。然而，在催化测试中的稳定性顺序不同，H-SAPO-34和H-ZSM-5显示出比H-mordenite更高的稳定性。

H-ZSM-5被确定为C4-烯烃裂解生产丙烯的最佳催化剂。此外，H-ZSM-5的晶体尺寸被发现会影响其稳定性，较小的晶体尺寸在较长时间内表现出更高的稳定性。

虽然文献没有讨论具体的酸性改性技术或其在CO2-ODHP催化剂中的应用，但它确实强调了在选择和优化特定反应的沸石催化剂时，考虑诸如酸强度、稳定性和晶体尺寸等因素的重要性。这些考虑因素可能在开发用于CO2-ODHP催化剂支撑物的沸石改性策略时具有潜在的应用价值。
