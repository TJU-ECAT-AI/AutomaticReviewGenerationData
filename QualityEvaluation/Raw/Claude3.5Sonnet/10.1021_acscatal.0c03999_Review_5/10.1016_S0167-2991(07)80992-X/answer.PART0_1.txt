The literature does not directly address CO2-ODHP catalysts or acidity modification techniques for zeolites. However, it does provide some insights into zeolite properties and their catalytic performance in related reactions.

Zeolites are promising support materials due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. These properties make them widely used in industrial processes.

The study compared three zeolites (H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34) for C4-olefin cracking reactions. While this is not CO2-ODHP, it provides some relevant information on zeolite performance:

1. Acid strength varied among zeolites, with H-SAPO-34 having the lowest and H-mordenite the highest.
2. Stability in catalytic tests was highest for H-SAPO-34 and H-ZSM-5, with H-mordenite being less stable.
3. H-ZSM-5 was found to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene.
4. Smaller crystal size in H-ZSM-5 led to higher stability over longer periods.

While the study doesn't discuss acidity modification techniques, it demonstrates that zeolite properties like acid strength and crystal size can significantly impact catalytic performance and stability. These factors would likely be important considerations when selecting and modifying zeolites for CO2-ODHP catalysts as well.

The optimal zeolite and modification strategy would depend on the specific requirements of CO2-ODHP reactions, which may differ from C4-olefin cracking. Further research would be needed to determine how these properties and potential modifications could be optimized for CO2-ODHP catalysts specifically.

该文献没有直接涉及CO2-ODHP催化剂或沸石的酸性改性技术。然而，它确实提供了一些关于沸石性质及其在相关反应中的催化性能的见解。

沸石是很有前景的支撑材料，因为它们具有热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性。这些特性使它们在工业过程中得到广泛应用。

该研究比较了三种沸石（H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34）在C4烯烃裂解反应中的性能。虽然这不是CO2-ODHP，但它提供了一些关于沸石性能的相关信息：

1. 不同沸石的酸强度不同，H-SAPO-34最低，H-mordenite最高。
2. 在催化测试中，H-SAPO-34和H-ZSM-5的稳定性最高，H-mordenite的稳定性较低。
3. H-ZSM-5被发现是C4烯烃裂解生产丙烯的最佳催化剂。
4. H-ZSM-5的晶体尺寸较小，长期稳定性更高。

虽然该研究没有讨论酸性改性技术，但它表明沸石的性质，如酸强度和晶体尺寸，可以显著影响催化性能和稳定性。在选择和改性用于CO2-ODHP催化剂的沸石时，这些因素可能也是重要的考虑因素。

最佳的沸石和改性策略将取决于CO2-ODHP反应的具体要求，这可能与C4烯烃裂解不同。需要进行进一步的研究来确定这些性质和潜在的改性如何能够针对CO2-ODHP催化剂进行优化。
