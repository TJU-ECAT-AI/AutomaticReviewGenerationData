[1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results. When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."

[4] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."

[5] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and porous structure. The key property that makes them suitable is the ability to modify their acidity through various techniques, primarily by adjusting the Si/Al ratio.

The main acidity modification technique discussed in this study is increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 zeolites. This method effectively reduces both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Increasing the Si/Al ratio has several effects on catalyst properties and performance:

1. Improved stability: Higher Si/Al ratios lead to better catalyst stability by reducing the number of acid sites, which suppresses side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

2. Decreased initial activity: The catalytic activity initially decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, as some acidity is necessary for the dehydrogenation reaction.

3. Increased selectivity: The selectivity towards propene improves with higher Si/Al ratios due to the suppression of side reactions.

4. Optimum balance: An optimal Si/Al ratio (in this case, 160) provides the best balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Balancing acidity reduction with catalytic activity: While reducing acidity improves stability and selectivity, some acid sites are necessary for the initial dehydrogenation step.

2. Tailoring the modification to the specific zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different Si/Al ratios to achieve optimal performance.

3. Considering the target reaction: The optimal acidity modification may vary depending on the specific dehydrogenation reaction and desired products.

4. Evaluating the long-term stability: The impact of acidity modification on catalyst lifetime and regeneration ability should be considered.

In conclusion, acidity modification through Si/Al ratio adjustment is a powerful tool for optimizing zeolite-supported catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, allowing for a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and porous structure. The key property that makes zeolites suitable is their ability to have their acidity modified through techniques like dealumination and weakening methods.

The main acidity modification technique discussed in this study is increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 zeolites. This effectively reduces both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. As the Si/Al ratio increases, the overall acidity decreases, leading to improved catalyst stability and suppression of side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

However, there is a trade-off between stability and activity. While higher Si/Al ratios improve stability, they also reduce catalytic activity. The optimal performance is achieved by finding a balance between these factors. In this study, the ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/Al ratio of 160 showed the best overall performance.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Desired balance between activity and stability
2. Type of reactions to be suppressed (e.g., cracking, oligomerization)
3. Optimal acid site distribution (Brønsted vs. Lewis)
4. Interaction between the active metal (e.g., ZnO) and the support

For different types of zeolites, the optimal degree of dealumination or weakening may vary. It's crucial to characterize the acidity using techniques like NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine to understand the acid site distribution and strength.

In summary, acidity modification of zeolites, particularly through Si/Al ratio adjustment, is a powerful tool for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The key is to find the right balance between activity and stability for the specific reaction and catalyst system.
