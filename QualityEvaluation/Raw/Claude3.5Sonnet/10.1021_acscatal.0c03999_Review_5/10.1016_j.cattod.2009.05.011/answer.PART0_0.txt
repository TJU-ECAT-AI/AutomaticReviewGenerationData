[1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results. When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."

[4] "The initial propane conversion decreases as the Si/Al ratio increases, suggesting that the acidities of the supported zinc oxide catalysts have a great effect on their dehydrogenation activity."

[5] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and porous structure. The key property that makes them suitable is the ability to modify their acidity through various techniques, primarily by adjusting the Si/Al ratio.

The main acidity modification technique discussed in this study is increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 zeolites. This method effectively reduces both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

Increasing the Si/Al ratio has several effects on catalyst properties and performance:

1. Improved stability: Higher Si/Al ratios lead to better catalyst stability by reducing the number of acid sites, which suppresses side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

2. Decreased initial activity: The catalytic activity initially decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, as some acidity is necessary for the dehydrogenation reaction.

3. Increased selectivity: The selectivity towards propene improves with higher Si/Al ratios due to the suppression of side reactions.

4. Optimum balance: An optimal Si/Al ratio (in this case, 160) provides the best balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Balancing acidity reduction with catalytic activity: While reducing acidity improves stability and selectivity, some acid sites are necessary for the initial dehydrogenation step.

2. Tailoring the modification to the specific zeolite type: Different zeolites may require different Si/Al ratios to achieve optimal performance.

3. Considering the target reaction: The optimal acidity modification may vary depending on the specific dehydrogenation reaction and desired products.

4. Evaluating the long-term stability: The impact of acidity modification on catalyst lifetime and regeneration ability should be considered.

In conclusion, acidity modification through Si/Al ratio adjustment is a powerful tool for optimizing zeolite-supported catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions, allowing for a balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，这是由于它们可调节的酸性和多孔结构。使它们适用的关键性质是通过各种技术修改其酸性的能力，主要是通过调整Si/Al比。

本研究讨论的主要酸性修饰技术是增加HZSM-5沸石的Si/Al比。这种方法有效地减少了Brønsted和Lewis酸性位点，这对于优化CO2-ODHP反应中的催化性能至关重要。

增加Si/Al比对催化剂性质和性能有几个影响：

1. 提高稳定性：更高的Si/Al比通过减少酸性位点数量来提高催化剂稳定性，从而抑制了裂解、寡聚和芳构化等副反应。

2. 降低初始活性：随着Si/Al比的增加，催化活性最初会下降，因为脱氢反应需要一定的酸性。

3. 提高选择性：由于抑制了副反应，Si/Al比越高，对丙烯的选择性越好。

4. 最佳平衡：最佳Si/Al比（在本例中为160）在活性、选择性和稳定性之间提供了最佳平衡。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 平衡酸性降低与催化活性：虽然降低酸性可以提高稳定性和选择性，但初始脱氢步骤需要一些酸性位点。

2. 根据特定沸石类型定制修饰：不同的沸石可能需要不同的Si/Al比来实现最佳性能。

3. 考虑目标反应：最佳酸性修饰可能因特定的脱氢反应和所需产品而异。

4. 评估长期稳定性：应考虑酸性修饰对催化剂寿命和再生能力的影响。

总之，通过调整Si/Al比进行酸性修饰是优化CO2-ODHP反应中沸石载体催化剂的有力工具，可以在活性、选择性和稳定性之间取得平衡。
