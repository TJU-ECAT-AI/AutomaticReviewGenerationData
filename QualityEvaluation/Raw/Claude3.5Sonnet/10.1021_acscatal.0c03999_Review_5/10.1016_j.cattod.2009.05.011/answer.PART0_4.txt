[1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."

[4] "When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable. This is understandable since the presence of Brnsted sites on HZSM-5 supported zinc oxide catalysts should be directly related to the framework Al species, which is reduced with raising the Si/Al ratio."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and porous structure. The key property that makes zeolites suitable is their ability to have their acidity modified through techniques like dealumination and weakening methods.

The main acidity modification technique discussed in this study is increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 zeolites. This effectively reduces both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites. As the Si/Al ratio increases, the overall acidity decreases, leading to improved catalyst stability and suppression of side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

However, there is a trade-off between stability and activity. While higher Si/Al ratios improve stability, they also reduce catalytic activity. The optimal performance is achieved by finding a balance between these factors. In this study, the ZnO/HZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/Al ratio of 160 showed the best overall performance.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Desired balance between activity and stability
2. Type of reactions to be suppressed (e.g., cracking, oligomerization)
3. Optimal acid site distribution (Brønsted vs. Lewis)
4. Interaction between the active metal (e.g., ZnO) and the support

For different types of zeolites, the optimal degree of dealumination or weakening may vary. It's crucial to characterize the acidity using techniques like NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine to understand the acid site distribution and strength.

In summary, acidity modification of zeolites, particularly through Si/Al ratio adjustment, is a powerful tool for optimizing catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP reactions. The key is to find the right balance between activity and stability for the specific reaction and catalyst system.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想载体材料，这主要归功于它们可调节的酸性和多孔结构。使沸石适用的关键特性是它们的酸性可以通过脱铝和弱化等技术进行修饰。

本研究中讨论的主要酸性修饰技术是增加HZSM-5沸石的Si/Al比。这有效地减少了Brønsted和Lewis酸性位点。随着Si/Al比的增加，整体酸性降低，导致催化剂稳定性提高，并抑制了裂解、寡聚和芳构化等副反应。

然而，稳定性和活性之间存在权衡关系。虽然较高的Si/Al比可以提高稳定性，但也会降低催化活性。最佳性能是通过在这些因素之间找到平衡来实现的。在本研究中，Si/Al比为160的ZnO/HZSM-5催化剂显示出最佳的整体性能。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 活性和稳定性之间的理想平衡
2. 需要抑制的反应类型（如裂解、寡聚）
3. 最佳酸性位点分布（Brønsted vs. Lewis）
4. 活性金属（如ZnO）与载体之间的相互作用

对于不同类型的沸石，最佳的脱铝或弱化程度可能会有所不同。使用NH3-TPD和吡啶吸附FT-IR光谱等技术表征酸性，对于理解酸性位点分布和强度至关重要。

总之，沸石的酸性修饰，特别是通过调整Si/Al比，是优化CO2-ODHP反应中催化性能的有力工具。关键是为特定的反应和催化剂系统找到活性和稳定性之间的适当平衡。
