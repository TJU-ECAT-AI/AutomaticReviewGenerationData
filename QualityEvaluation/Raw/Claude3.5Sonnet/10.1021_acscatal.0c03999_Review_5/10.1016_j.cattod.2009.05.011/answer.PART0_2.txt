[1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results. When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."

[4] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst gives the best performance, with the highest steady propane conversion (41.5%), the highest steady propene yield (25.8%) and superior stability in the presence of CO2."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and porous structure. The key property that makes zeolites advantageous is their ability to have their acidity modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods.

The main acidity modification technique discussed in this study is increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support. This method effectively reduces both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which contributes to optimizing catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved stability: Higher Si/Al ratios lead to better catalyst stability by reducing the number of acid sites responsible for side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

2. Enhanced selectivity: Decreasing acidity improves propene selectivity by suppressing unwanted side reactions.

3. Balanced activity and stability: While higher Si/Al ratios decrease initial catalytic activity, they significantly improve long-term stability and overall propene yield.

4. Coke reduction: Lower acidity reduces coke formation, which is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Optimizing the Si/Al ratio: Finding the right balance between activity and stability is crucial. In this study, a Si/Al ratio of 160 provided the best overall performance.

2. Characterization techniques: Utilizing methods like NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine to accurately assess acidity changes.

3. Reaction conditions: Considering the presence of CO2 and its effects on catalyst performance when modifying acidity.

4. Catalyst composition: Balancing the acidity modification with the active metal component (ZnO in this case) to maintain desired catalytic properties.

5. Regeneration potential: Considering how acidity modifications affect the catalyst's ability to be regenerated and maintain performance over multiple cycles.

By carefully considering these factors, researchers can effectively modify zeolite supports to create optimized catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions, balancing activity, selectivity, and long-term stability.

沸石作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，这主要归因于其可调节的酸性和多孔结构。使沸石具有优势的关键特性是其酸性可以通过脱铝和弱化等技术进行修饰。

本研究中讨论的主要酸性修饰技术是增加HZSM-5载体的硅铝比。这种方法有效地降低了Brønsted和Lewis酸性位点的数量，从而以多种方式优化了催化性能：

1. 提高稳定性：更高的硅铝比通过减少引起副反应（如裂解、寡聚和芳构化）的酸性位点数量，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。

2. 增强选择性：降低酸性通过抑制不需要的副反应来提高丙烯的选择性。

3. 平衡活性和稳定性：尽管更高的硅铝比降低了初始催化活性，但显著提高了长期稳定性和总体丙烯产率。

4. 降低积碳：较低的酸性减少了积碳的形成，而积碳是催化剂失活的主要原因。

选择和实施这些策略时的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 优化硅铝比：找到活性和稳定性之间的正确平衡至关重要。在本研究中，硅铝比为160时提供了最佳的整体性能。

2. 表征技术：利用NH3-TPD和吡啶吸附FT-IR光谱等方法准确评估酸性变化。

3. 反应条件：在修饰酸性时考虑CO2的存在及其对催化剂性能的影响。

4. 催化剂组成：平衡酸性修饰与活性金属组分（本例中为ZnO）以保持所需的催化特性。

5. 再生潜力：考虑酸性修饰如何影响催化剂的再生能力及其在多个循环中保持性能的能力。

通过仔细考虑这些因素，研究人员可以有效地修饰沸石载体，为CO2-ODHP反应创造优化的催化剂，平衡活性、选择性和长期稳定性。
