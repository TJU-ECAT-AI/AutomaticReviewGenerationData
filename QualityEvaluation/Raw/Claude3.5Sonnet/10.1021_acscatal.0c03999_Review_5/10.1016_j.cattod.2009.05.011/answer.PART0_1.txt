[1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results."

[4] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst gives the best performance, with the highest steady propane conversion (41.5%), the highest steady propene yield (25.8%) and superior stability in the presence of CO2."

[5] "Thus, appropriate amount of acid sites is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of ZnO/HZSM-5(160) in our present study."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and structural properties. The key modification technique discussed in this study is increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 zeolites, which is a form of dealumination.

Increasing the Si/Al ratio contributes to optimizing catalytic performance in several ways:

1. Improved stability: Higher Si/Al ratios lead to better catalyst stability by reducing the number of acid sites, which suppresses side reactions like cracking, oligomerization, and aromatization.

2. Enhanced selectivity: The reduction in acidity improves propene selectivity by minimizing unwanted side reactions.

3. Balancing activity and stability: While higher Si/Al ratios decrease initial activity, they significantly improve long-term stability and overall performance.

4. Optimizing acid site distribution: An appropriate balance of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites is crucial for optimal catalytic performance.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Finding the optimal Si/Al ratio: In this study, HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 160 provided the best balance of activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. Characterizing acidity: Techniques like NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine are crucial for understanding the acidic properties of modified zeolites.

3. Balancing dehydrogenation activity and side reactions: The goal is to maintain sufficient acidity for the initial dehydrogenation step while minimizing side reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

4. Considering the specific reaction conditions: The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture influences the optimal catalyst properties, as CO2 plays multiple roles in the reaction system.

By carefully tailoring the acidity of zeolite supports through Si/Al ratio modification, researchers can develop more effective and stable catalysts for CO2-ODHP reactions.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，这是由于它们可调节的酸性和结构特性。本研究讨论的主要改性技术是增加HZSM-5沸石的Si/Al比，这是一种脱铝形式。

增加Si/Al比通过以下几种方式有助于优化催化性能：

1. 提高稳定性：较高的Si/Al比通过减少酸性位点数量来提高催化剂稳定性，抑制裂解、寡聚和芳构化等副反应。

2. 提高选择性：酸性的降低通过最小化不需要的副反应来提高丙烯选择性。

3. 平衡活性和稳定性：虽然较高的Si/Al比降低了初始活性，但显著提高了长期稳定性和整体性能。

4. 优化酸性位点分布：路易斯酸位和布朗斯特酸位的适当平衡对于最佳催化性能至关重要。

选择和实施这些策略的主要考虑因素包括：

1. 找到最佳Si/Al比：在本研究中，Si/Al比为160的HZSM-5提供了活性、选择性和稳定性的最佳平衡。

2. 表征酸性：NH3-TPD和吸附吡啶的FT-IR光谱等技术对于理解改性沸石的酸性特性至关重要。

3. 平衡脱氢活性和副反应：目标是保持足够的酸性以进行初始脱氢步骤，同时最小化导致积碳形成和催化剂失活的副反应。

4. 考虑特定反应条件：反应混合物中CO2的存在会影响最佳催化剂特性，因为CO2在反应系统中扮演多重角色。

通过仔细调整沸石载体的酸性，研究人员可以开发出更有效和稳定的CO2-ODHP反应催化剂。
