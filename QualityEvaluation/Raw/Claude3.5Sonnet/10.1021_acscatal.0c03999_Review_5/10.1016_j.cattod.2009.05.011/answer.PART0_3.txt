[1] "The stability of supported ZnO catalysts for the reaction improves with increasing the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support, while the catalytic activity shows a contrary trend."

[2] "The results of NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectra of pyridine adsorption reveal that the enhancement of the catalytic stability stems from the decrease in acidity of the catalysts, resulting in the suppression of the side reactions, such as cracking, oligomerization and aromatization."

[3] "As the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, the amounts of both Lewis and Brnsted sites decrease, which is consistent with the NH3-TPD results. When the Si/Al ratio reaches 201 and above, Brnsted acidity is undetectable."

[4] "The ZnO/HZSM-5(160) catalyst gives the best performance, with the highest steady propane conversion (41.5%), the highest steady propene yield (25.8%) and superior stability in the presence of CO2."

Zeolites are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity, which can be modified through techniques such as dealumination and weakening methods. These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by balancing activity and stability.

The key considerations in selecting and implementing acidity modification strategies include:

1. Si/Al ratio: Increasing the Si/Al ratio improves stability but decreases activity. Finding the optimal ratio is crucial for balancing performance.

2. Acidity control: Reducing the number of acid sites, especially strong acid sites, suppresses side reactions and improves propene selectivity and catalyst stability.

3. Lewis vs. Brønsted acidity: Modifying the ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites can influence catalyst performance. Higher Si/Al ratios tend to decrease both types of acid sites, with Brønsted sites becoming undetectable at very high ratios.

4. Optimal performance: In this study, ZnO/HZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 160 showed the best balance of activity, stability, and propene yield.

5. Characterization techniques: NH3-TPD and FT-IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine are valuable tools for assessing acidity modifications.

When implementing these strategies, researchers should consider the specific requirements of their catalyst system and the desired balance between activity and stability. The optimal acidity modification technique may vary depending on the type of zeolite used as a support and the specific reaction conditions.

沸石是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料,因为它们的酸度可以调节,可以通过脱铝和弱化等技术进行修饰。这些修饰通过平衡活性和稳定性来优化催化性能。

选择和实施酸度修饰策略的主要考虑因素包括:

1. Si/Al比: 提高Si/Al比可以改善稳定性,但会降低活性。找到最佳比例对于平衡性能至关重要。

2. 酸度控制: 减少酸性位点的数量,特别是强酸性位点,可以抑制副反应,提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. Lewis酸vs.Brønsted酸: 修改Lewis酸与Brønsted酸位点的比例可以影响催化剂性能。较高的Si/Al比往往会减少这两种酸性位点,在非常高的比例下Brønsted酸性位点会变得无法检测。

4. 最佳性能: 在本研究中,Si/Al比为160的ZnO/HZSM-5显示出活性、稳定性和丙烯产率的最佳平衡。

5. 表征技术: NH3-TPD和吸附吡啶的FT-IR光谱是评估酸度修饰的有价值工具。

在实施这些策略时,研究人员应考虑其催化剂系统的具体要求以及所需的活性和稳定性之间的平衡。最佳的酸度修饰技术可能因使用的沸石载体类型和特定的反应条件而异。
