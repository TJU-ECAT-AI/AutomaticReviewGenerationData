      [1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."

[2] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."

[3] "HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by dealumination of the HZSM-5 at various steaming temperatures (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol/l HNO3 at 95 oC for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 oC for 6 h."

[4] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."

[5] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h. As shown in Table 1, the amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."

[6] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

      Zeolites, particularly HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and structural properties. Key properties that make zeolites suitable include:

1. Adjustable Si/Al ratio: This allows for fine-tuning of the catalyst's acidity, which is crucial for optimizing catalytic performance.
2. Thermal stability: Zeolites can withstand high temperatures required for dealumination and reaction conditions.
3. High surface area: This provides ample sites for dispersing active metal oxides like Ga2O3.

Acidity modification techniques, primarily dealumination, play a critical role in optimizing catalytic performance:

1. Steaming: This is the primary dealumination method used, with temperatures ranging from 600-800°C. Higher steaming temperatures result in higher Si/Al ratios and lower acidity.
2. Acid washing: Following steaming, acid washing with HNO3 further removes aluminum from the zeolite framework.
3. Calcination: A final calcination step at 600°C helps stabilize the modified zeolite structure.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Enhancing stability: Reducing excess acidity decreases coke formation, leading to improved catalyst longevity.
2. Balancing activity and selectivity: Moderate acidity promotes dehydrogenation while limiting side reactions.
3. Improving metal oxide dispersion: Dealumination can create defect sites that enhance metal oxide anchoring.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Initial Si/Al ratio: The starting composition of the zeolite determines the extent of modification needed.
2. Desired acidity level: The optimal acidity depends on the specific reaction and active metal used.
3. Stability requirements: More severe dealumination may be necessary for reactions requiring extended catalyst lifetime.
4. Metal-support interactions: The degree of dealumination affects the interaction between the active metal and the support.
5. Reaction conditions: The chosen modification strategy should produce a catalyst stable under the intended reaction environment.

In conclusion, carefully controlled acidity modification of zeolites, primarily through dealumination, is crucial for developing high-performance CO2-ODHP catalysts. The optimal strategy balances the need for activity, selectivity, and stability, tailored to the specific zeolite type and reaction requirements.

      沸石，尤其是HZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，这主要归功于它们可调节的酸度和结构特性。使沸石成为理想选择的关键特性包括：

1. 可调节的硅铝比：这允许对催化剂的酸度进行精细调节，这对于优化催化性能至关重要。
2. 热稳定性：沸石能够承受脱铝和反应条件所需的高温。
3. 高比表面积：这为分散活性金属氧化物（如Ga2O3）提供了充足的位点。

酸度修饰技术，主要是脱铝，在优化催化性能方面起着关键作用：

1. 蒸汽处理：这是主要使用的脱铝方法，温度范围从600-800°C。更高的蒸汽处理温度会导致更高的硅铝比和更低的酸度。
2. 酸洗：蒸汽处理后，用HNO3进行酸洗进一步去除沸石骨架中的铝。
3. 煅烧：最后在600°C进行煅烧有助于稳定改性后的沸石结构。

这些修饰通过以下方式有助于优化催化性能：

1. 提高稳定性：减少过量酸度降低了积碳形成，从而提高了催化剂的寿命。
2. 平衡活性和选择性：适度的酸度促进脱氢反应，同时限制副反应。
3. 改善金属氧化物分散：脱铝可以创造缺陷位点，增强金属氧化物的锚定。

选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 初始硅铝比：沸石的起始组成决定了所需修饰的程度。
2. 所需酸度水平：最佳酸度取决于特定的反应和所使用的活性金属。
3. 稳定性要求：对于需要延长催化剂寿命的反应，可能需要更严格的脱铝。
4. 金属-载体相互作用：脱铝程度影响活性金属与载体之间的相互作用。
5. 反应条件：选择的修饰策略应产生在预期反应环境下稳定的催化剂。

总之，对沸石进行精心控制的酸度修饰，主要通过脱铝，对于开发高性能CO2-ODHP催化剂至关重要。最佳策略平衡了活性、选择性和稳定性的需求，并根据特定的沸石类型和反应要求进行量身定制。
