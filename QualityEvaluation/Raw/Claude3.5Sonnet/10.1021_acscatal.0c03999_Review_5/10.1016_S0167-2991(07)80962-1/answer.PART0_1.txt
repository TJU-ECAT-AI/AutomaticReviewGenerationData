[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."

[2] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."

[3] "HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by dealumination of the HZSM-5 at various steaming temperatures (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol/l HNO3 at 95 oC for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 oC for 6 h."

[4] "It is clear that the intensity of 240 nm band decreases with rising steaming temperature, showing that the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 increases by the dealumination of the framework Al species through steaming treatment."

[5] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h. As shown in Table 1, the amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."

[6] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses."

[7] "The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts, so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."

[8] "Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. This is probably the reason why the stability of supported Ga2O3 catalysts is significantly enhanced by reducing the amount of strong acid sites appropriately through steaming treatment of the HZSM-5 support."

[9] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

Zeolites, particularly HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and structural properties. The key considerations in optimizing their catalytic performance through acidity modification include:

1. Dealumination: This is a primary technique used to modify zeolite acidity. Steaming at high temperatures (600-800°C) followed by acid washing is effective in removing framework aluminum, thereby increasing the Si/Al ratio and reducing the overall acidity of the zeolite.

2. Acidity-activity relationship: Strong acid sites enhance catalytic activity by providing alternative reaction pathways. However, excessive acidity promotes side reactions and coke formation, leading to catalyst deactivation. Therefore, a balance must be struck between activity and stability.

3. Coke formation: Higher Si/Al ratios (i.e., lower acidity) result in less coke deposition, improving catalyst stability. This highlights the importance of controlling acidity to minimize unwanted side reactions.

4. Interaction with active phase: The acidity modification affects the interaction between the support and the active phase (e.g., Ga2O3). Dealumination can weaken this interaction, potentially impacting the overall catalyst performance.

5. Optimization strategy: The goal is to find an optimal level of acidity that maintains high activity while minimizing deactivation. This often involves systematic studies of different dealumination conditions to achieve the right balance.

6. Support-specific considerations: The extent and method of acidity modification may vary depending on the specific zeolite type and the desired catalytic properties for the target reaction.

In implementing these strategies, researchers must carefully consider the trade-offs between activity and stability, and tailor the modification techniques to the specific zeolite support and catalytic system in question. The optimal approach will depend on the particular requirements of the CO2-ODHP reaction and the desired catalyst lifespan.

沸石，特别是HZSM-5，是CO2-ODHP催化剂的有前景的载体材料，这是由于其可调节的酸性和结构特性。通过酸性修饰优化其催化性能的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 脱铝：这是修饰沸石酸性的主要技术。在高温（600-800°C）下进行蒸汽处理，然后进行酸洗，可以有效去除骨架铝，从而增加Si/Al比并降低沸石的整体酸性。

2. 酸性-活性关系：强酸位可以通过提供替代反应途径来增强催化活性。然而，过度的酸性会促进副反应和积碳形成，导致催化剂失活。因此，必须在活性和稳定性之间取得平衡。

3. 积碳形成：较高的Si/Al比（即较低的酸性）会导致较少的积碳沉积，从而提高催化剂的稳定性。这突出了控制酸性以最小化不需要的副反应的重要性。

4. 与活性相的相互作用：酸性修饰会影响载体与活性相（如Ga2O3）之间的相互作用。脱铝可能会削弱这种相互作用，潜在地影响整体催化剂性能。

5. 优化策略：目标是找到一个最佳的酸性水平，既能保持高活性，又能最小化失活。这通常涉及对不同脱铝条件进行系统研究，以达到适当的平衡。

6. 特定载体考虑：酸性修饰的程度和方法可能会因特定的沸石类型和目标反应所需的催化特性而有所不同。

在实施这些策略时，研究人员必须仔细考虑活性和稳定性之间的权衡，并根据特定的沸石载体和催化系统来调整修饰技术。最佳方法将取决于CO2-ODHP反应的特定要求和所需的催化剂寿命。
