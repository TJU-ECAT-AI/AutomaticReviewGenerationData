[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."

[2] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."

[3] "HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by dealumination of the HZSM-5 at various steaming temperatures (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol/l HNO3 at 95 oC for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 oC for 6 h."

[4] "The improvement of the catalyst stability with increasing Si/Al ratio can also be verified by measuring the coke deposited on the catalysts after on stream for 24 h. As shown in Table 1, the amount of coke reduces as the Si/Al ratio of the HZSM-5 support increases, and the reduction is more obvious initially."

[5] "Obviously, the decrease in acid amount does not result only from the loss of acid sites present on HZSM-5, since the amount of acid sites reduced is greater than that of total acid sites the HZSM-5 originally possesses. The previous studies show that strong interactions between Ga2O3 species and the support enhance the acidity of the supported gallium oxide catalysts, so the extra decrease in acid amount may be connected with the weakening of the interaction between Ga2O3 species and the HZSM-5 support due to the dealumination of the zeolite."

[6] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions. Therefore, the amount of strong acid sites present on the catalysts is critical for gaining an optimal result, and this goal is achieved in the case of Ga2O3/HZSM-5(700)."

Zeolites, particularly HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their adjustable acidity and stability. The key properties that make zeolites suitable include:

1. Tunable Si/Al ratio: This allows for precise control over the acidity of the catalyst support.

2. Stability at high temperatures: Zeolites can withstand the harsh conditions of dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Strong interactions with metal oxides: This enhances the overall catalytic performance.

Acidity modification techniques for zeolites include:

1. Dealumination: This is the primary method used to modify acidity. It involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically through steaming at high temperatures (600-800°C) followed by acid washing.

2. Weakening methods: These involve reducing the strength of acid sites without necessarily removing them. This can be achieved through various techniques such as ion exchange or post-synthesis treatments.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Balancing acidity: Reducing excess acidity helps prevent side reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

2. Enhancing stability: Higher Si/Al ratios generally lead to improved catalyst stability and reduced coke deposition.

3. Optimizing activity: A certain level of acidity is necessary for high catalytic activity, but excessive acidity can be detrimental.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Initial Si/Al ratio of the zeolite: This determines the starting point for modifications.

2. Desired catalytic properties: The optimal acidity depends on the specific reaction and metal oxide being supported.

3. Severity of treatment: The degree of dealumination or weakening should be carefully controlled to achieve the desired balance between activity and stability.

4. Preservation of zeolite structure: Overly harsh treatments can damage the zeolite framework, reducing its effectiveness as a support.

5. Interaction with the supported metal oxide: The acidity modification should enhance, not hinder, the interaction between the zeolite and the active metal oxide component.

In conclusion, the careful tailoring of zeolite acidity through dealumination and weakening methods is crucial for developing high-performance CO2-ODHP catalysts. The optimal strategy will depend on the specific zeolite type and the desired catalytic properties, requiring a balanced approach to maximize both activity and stability.

沸石，尤其是HZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，这主要归因于其可调节的酸度和稳定性。使沸石成为合适支撑材料的关键特性包括：

1. 可调的Si/Al比：这允许精确控制催化剂支撑材料的酸度。

2. 高温稳定性：沸石能够承受脱氢反应的苛刻条件。

3. 与金属氧化物的强相互作用：这提高了整体催化性能。

沸石的酸度修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：这是修改酸度的主要方法。它涉及从沸石骨架中移除铝，通常通过高温（600-800°C）蒸汽处理，随后进行酸洗。

2. 弱化方法：这些方法涉及减弱酸性位点的强度，而不一定要移除它们。这可以通过各种技术实现，如离子交换或后合成处理。

这些修饰有助于优化催化性能，通过：

1. 平衡酸度：减少过量酸度有助于防止导致积碳和催化剂失活的副反应。

2. 提高稳定性：较高的Si/Al比通常会导致催化剂稳定性提高，积碳减少。

3. 优化活性：一定程度的酸度对于高催化活性是必要的，但过度的酸度可能有害。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石的初始Si/Al比：这决定了修饰的起点。

2. 所需的催化特性：最佳酸度取决于特定的反应和被支撑的金属氧化物。

3. 处理的严重程度：应仔细控制脱铝或弱化的程度，以在活性和稳定性之间达到理想的平衡。

4. 保持沸石结构：过于严苛的处理可能会损坏沸石骨架，降低其作为支撑材料的有效性。

5. 与被支撑的金属氧化物的相互作用：酸度修饰应增强而不是阻碍沸石与活性金属氧化物组分之间的相互作用。

总之，通过脱铝和弱化方法仔细调整沸石酸度对于开发高性能CO2-ODHP催化剂至关重要。最佳策略将取决于特定的沸石类型和所需的催化特性，需要采取平衡的方法来最大化活性和稳定性。
