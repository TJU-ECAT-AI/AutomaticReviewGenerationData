[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."

[2] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."

[3] "HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by dealumination of the HZSM-5 at various steaming temperatures (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol/l HNO3 at 95 oC for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 oC for 6 h."

[4] "The surface acidity was measured by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) in a flow-type fixed-bed reactor at ambient pressure."

[5] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."

[6] "The decrease of the initial dehydrogenation activity over HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts with increasing Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support can be attributed to the reduction of the amount of strong acid sites."

[7] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

[8] "It could be concluded that the strong acid sites on supported gallium oxide catalysts play two opposite roles in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The positive role is to enhance the catalyst activity by providing alternative reaction path to the slow step, and the negative role is to accelerate the catalyst deactivation by catalyzing a series of side reactions."

Zeolites, particularly HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and stability. The key properties that make zeolites suitable include:

1. Adjustable Si/Al ratio: This allows for fine-tuning of the catalyst's acidity.
2. Thermal stability: Zeolites can withstand high temperatures required for dealumination and reaction conditions.
3. High surface area: Provides good dispersion of active metal oxide species.

Acidity modification techniques:

1. Dealumination: This is the primary method used to modify zeolite acidity. It involves removing aluminum from the zeolite framework, typically through steaming at high temperatures (600-800°C) followed by acid washing.

2. Weakening methods: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, these could include ion exchange or chemical treatments to reduce the strength of acid sites.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Balancing activity and stability: Reducing strong acid sites decreases initial activity but improves long-term stability by inhibiting coke formation.
2. Tuning selectivity: Adjusting acidity can influence product distribution and minimize unwanted side reactions.
3. Enhancing metal-support interactions: Modifying the support's acidity can affect the dispersion and stability of the active metal oxide species.

Key considerations for selecting and implementing these strategies:

1. Initial Si/Al ratio of the zeolite: This determines the starting acidity and the extent of modification required.
2. Desired balance between activity and stability: The optimal acidity depends on the specific reaction requirements.
3. Steaming temperature and duration: These parameters control the degree of dealumination and must be carefully optimized.
4. Post-treatment procedures: Acid washing and calcination steps are crucial for removing extraframework aluminum and stabilizing the modified structure.
5. Characterization methods: Techniques like NH3-TPD are essential for quantifying the changes in acidity and guiding further modifications.

In conclusion, the key to successful acidity modification of zeolites for CO2-ODHP catalysts lies in finding the optimal balance between maintaining sufficient activity while enhancing stability and selectivity. This requires a thorough understanding of the zeolite's initial properties and careful control of the modification process.

沸石，特别是HZSM-5，由于其可调节的酸性和稳定性，是CO2-ODHP催化剂的理想支撑材料。使沸石适合的关键特性包括：

1. 可调节的Si/Al比：这允许对催化剂的酸性进行精细调节。
2. 热稳定性：沸石能够承受脱铝和反应条件所需的高温。
3. 高比表面积：为活性金属氧化物提供良好的分散性。

酸性修饰技术：

1. 脱铝：这是修改沸石酸性的主要方法。它涉及从沸石骨架中去除铝，通常通过高温（600-800°C）蒸汽处理，然后进行酸洗。

2. 弱化方法：虽然文本中没有明确提到，但这可能包括离子交换或化学处理以减弱酸性位点的强度。

这些修饰通过以下方式优化催化性能：

1. 平衡活性和稳定性：减少强酸位点降低了初始活性，但通过抑制积碳形成改善了长期稳定性。
2. 调节选择性：调整酸性可以影响产物分布并最小化不需要的副反应。
3. 增强金属-载体相互作用：修改载体的酸性可以影响活性金属氧化物的分散性和稳定性。

选择和实施这些策略的关键考虑因素：

1. 沸石的初始Si/Al比：这决定了起始酸性和所需的修饰程度。
2. 活性和稳定性之间的理想平衡：最佳酸性取决于具体的反应要求。
3. 蒸汽处理温度和持续时间：这些参数控制脱铝程度，必须仔细优化。
4. 后处理程序：酸洗和煅烧步骤对于去除骨架外铝和稳定修饰后的结构至关重要。
5. 表征方法：像NH3-TPD这样的技术对于量化酸性变化和指导进一步修饰至关重要。

总之，成功修饰CO2-ODHP催化剂用沸石的酸性的关键在于找到维持足够活性的同时增强稳定性和选择性的最佳平衡。这需要对沸石的初始性质有透彻的了解，并对修饰过程进行仔细控制。
