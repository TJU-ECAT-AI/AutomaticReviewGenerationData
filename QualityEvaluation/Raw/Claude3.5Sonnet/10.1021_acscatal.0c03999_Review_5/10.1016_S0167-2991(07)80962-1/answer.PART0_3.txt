[1] "High catalytic activity and stability of dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 were achieved over Ga2O3 catalyst supported on HZSM-5 with high Si/Al ratio."

[2] "The propene yield stabilized at about 22 % without observable deactivation in 100 h, which was thought to be caused by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst appropriately through dealumination of the zeolite."

[3] "HZSM-5 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared by dealumination of the HZSM-5 at various steaming temperatures (600, 650, 700, 750 and 800 oC) for 6 h, followed by washing with 1 mol/l HNO3 at 95 oC for 24 h, filtering, drying and calcining at 600 oC for 6 h."

[4] "The decreasing rate of the catalytic activity is much slower for those catalysts with the steaming temperature of the support higher than 650 oC, suggesting that the HZSM-5 supported gallium oxide catalysts are more resistant to deactivation after the dealumination of the support."

[5] "As the steaming temperature rises, the acid strength and acid amount of the catalysts decrease markedly."

[6] "The surface strong acid site would facilitate the conjugated effect of proton and gallium oxide (reaction (4) and (5)) and in turn promote the dehydrogenation reaction."

[7] "Catalyst deactivation in dehydrogenation reactions is mainly attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Thus, inhibiting these side reactions through removing the excess acid sites present on the catalysts would improve the stability of the catalysts for propane dehydrogenation."

Zeolites, particularly HZSM-5, are promising support materials for CO2-ODHP catalysts due to their tunable acidity and stability. The key properties that make zeolites effective are:

1. High Si/Al ratio: This contributes to improved catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.

2. Tunable acidity: The acidity of zeolites can be modified to optimize catalytic performance.

3. Structural stability: Zeolites maintain their crystalline structure even after modifications.

Acidity modification techniques for zeolites include:

1. Dealumination: This is achieved through steaming at high temperatures (600-800°C) followed by acid washing. It increases the Si/Al ratio and reduces the number of acid sites.

2. Weakening methods: These involve reducing the strength of acid sites without necessarily removing them.

These modifications contribute to optimizing catalytic performance by:

1. Enhancing stability: Reducing excess acid sites inhibits coke formation, leading to improved catalyst longevity.

2. Balancing activity and selectivity: Moderate acidity promotes dehydrogenation while minimizing side reactions.

3. Tuning product yield: Proper acidity adjustment can stabilize propene yield over extended periods.

Key considerations in selecting and implementing these strategies include:

1. Initial Si/Al ratio of the zeolite: This determines the extent of modification needed.

2. Desired catalytic properties: The balance between activity and stability should be considered.

3. Reaction conditions: The modification technique should be tailored to the specific reaction environment.

4. Type of active metal: The interaction between the modified support and the active metal (e.g., Ga2O3) should be optimized.

5. Characterization methods: Proper analysis techniques should be employed to confirm the effectiveness of the modifications.

In conclusion, acidity modification of zeolites is a powerful tool for optimizing CO2-ODHP catalysts, but it requires careful consideration of various factors to achieve the desired balance between activity, selectivity, and stability.

沸石，尤其是HZSM-5，作为CO2-ODHP催化剂的支撑材料具有很大的潜力，这主要归因于其可调节的酸度和稳定性。使沸石成为有效支撑材料的关键特性包括：

1. 高Si/Al比：这有助于提高催化剂的稳定性和抗失活能力。

2. 可调节的酸度：沸石的酸度可以被修饰以优化催化性能。

3. 结构稳定性：即使经过修饰，沸石仍能保持其晶体结构。

沸石的酸度修饰技术包括：

1. 脱铝：这是通过高温（600-800°C）蒸汽处理后进行酸洗来实现的。它可以增加Si/Al比并减少酸性位点的数量。

2. 酸性减弱方法：这些方法涉及减弱酸性位点的强度，而不一定要去除它们。

这些修饰对优化催化性能的贡献包括：

1. 提高稳定性：减少过量的酸性位点可抑制积碳形成，从而提高催化剂的使用寿命。

2. 平衡活性和选择性：适度的酸度可促进脱氢反应，同时最小化副反应。

3. 调节产物收率：适当的酸度调节可以在长时间内稳定丙烯的收率。

选择和实施这些策略时的关键考虑因素包括：

1. 沸石的初始Si/Al比：这决定了所需修饰的程度。

2. 所需的催化性能：应考虑活性和稳定性之间的平衡。

3. 反应条件：修饰技术应根据特定的反应环境进行调整。

4. 活性金属类型：应优化修饰后的支撑材料与活性金属（如Ga2O3）之间的相互作用。

5. 表征方法：应采用适当的分析技术来确认修饰的有效性。

总之，沸石的酸度修饰是优化CO2-ODHP催化剂的有力工具，但需要仔细考虑各种因素，以在活性、选择性和稳定性之间达到理想的平衡。
