[1] "The formation of short chain hydrocarbons (cracking) and coke (coking) are the main undesired reactions associated with propane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, coke is rapidly formed at high temperatures and as a consequence the catalyst is deactivated and needs to be regenerated."

[2] "A LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism provides the best fit for propane dehydrogenation, while a monolayermultilayer mechanism is proposed for modelling the coke formation."

[3] "Coke formation experiments were performed in a CI Electronics thermobalance, under several different conditions. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in nitrogen."

[4] "The range of operating conditions was as follows: temperature, 460540 8C; molar fraction of propane, 0.250.70; catalyst mass, 200 mg; particle size of 160250 mm; atmospheric pressure and total flow rates of 300 cm3(STP) min1."

The literature does not provide detailed information on the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. However, it does mention that coke formation is one of the main undesired reactions in propane dehydrogenation, occurring rapidly at high temperatures and leading to catalyst deactivation.

The document proposes a monolayer-multilayer mechanism for modeling coke formation, suggesting that coke deposits may have a layered structure. This implies that the composition and nature of coke may vary depending on the extent of deposition.

Regarding analytical techniques, the literature mentions the use of a CI Electronics thermobalance for coke formation experiments. This technique allows for the measurement of coke accumulation over time under various reaction conditions.

The study investigated coke formation under different operating conditions, including temperatures ranging from 460°C to 540°C, propane molar fractions of 0.25-0.70, and using a PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the specific composition of coke deposits and how it varies across these conditions is not detailed in the given text.

The literature does not provide information on other analytical techniques that might have been used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化系统中焦炭沉积物成分在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下的变化的详细信息。然而，它确实提到焦炭形成是丙烷脱氢中主要的不良反应之一，在高温下迅速发生并导致催化剂失活。

文档提出了一个单层-多层机制来模拟焦炭形成，这表明焦炭沉积物可能具有分层结构。这意味着焦炭的成分和性质可能会随沉积程度的不同而变化。

关于分析技术，文献提到使用CI Electronics热天平进行焦炭形成实验。这种技术允许在各种反应条件下测量焦炭随时间的积累。

该研究在不同的操作条件下研究了焦炭形成，包括460°C到540°C的温度范围，0.25-0.70的丙烷摩尔分数，并使用PtSnK/Al2O3催化剂。然而，给定的文本中没有详细说明焦炭沉积物的具体成分以及它如何随这些条件而变化。

文献没有提供可能用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性的其他分析技术的信息。
