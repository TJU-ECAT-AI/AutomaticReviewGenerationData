[1] "Formation of coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation originates almost solely from propylene [25]."

[2] "The model used in this work to describe coke formation is a simple mechanistic model called the monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM)."

[3] "The presence of steam in the reaction mixture leads to a continuous gasification of the deposited coke so that the experimentally measured rate of coke formation is a net rate resulting from both deposition and gasification [28]."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on the composition of coke deposits across different reaction conditions and catalyst types for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It mentions that coke formation originates mainly from propylene and describes coke formation using a monolayer-multilayer coke growth model. The presence of steam leads to gasification of deposited coke. However, the document does not discuss specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the question about coke composition variations and analytical methods.

该文献没有提供关于不同反应条件和催化剂类型下丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭沉积物组成的全面信息。它提到焦炭形成主要来源于丙烯,并使用单层-多层焦炭生长模型来描述焦炭形成。蒸汽的存在会导致沉积焦炭的气化。然而,该文档并未讨论用于阐明焦炭成分性质和多样性的具体分析技术。需要进行更详细的研究才能充分回答有关焦炭组成变化和分析方法的问题。
