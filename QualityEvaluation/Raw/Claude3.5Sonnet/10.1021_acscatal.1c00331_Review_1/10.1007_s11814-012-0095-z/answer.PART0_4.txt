The given literature does not contain specific information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on modeling catalyst deactivation in PDH with oxygenated additives, but does not go into detail about the chemical makeup of coke or methods to analyze it. To properly answer this question would require information from other sources not provided in this text.
