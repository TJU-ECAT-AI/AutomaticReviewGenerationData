INTRODUCTION 
In spite of its far reaching industrial implications catalyst deactivation by coke formation has 
been studied with insufficient depth and rigor. A better understanding of the interaction between 
the hydrocarbons and the catalytic sites leading to coke formation and a more detailed modeling of 
its rate might contribute to the development of catalysts generating less coke and/or less subject to 
deactivation. To reach this goal it has to be kept in mind that the study of coke formation and the 
associated catalyst deactivation is not different from the study of any catalytic process; coke is 
formed through one or more reactions, involving intermediates also acting in the "main" reactions. 
The influence of the coke on the reaction(s) causing catalyst deactivation is then naturally dealt 
with in terms of the real variables and the elementary steps. Presently this is still done in an 
empirical way by multiplying the rate of the main reaction(s) by a deactivation function which is 
often related to time, 
tO =fit) 
(1) 
where e.g. 
j'( t) = e -at 
although it would be preferable to relate it to the true deactivating agent, coke itself : 
tp =f(Cc) 
(2) 
where e.g. 
f(Cc) = e -ace 
An exponential function of the coke content has been derived for a variety of processes [De 
Pauw & Froment, 1975; Dumez & Froment, 1976; Hatcher, 1985; Beirnaert et al, 1994]. The 
approach symbolized by (1) is easier since it does not require measuring the coke content of the 
catalyst, as (2) does. However, measurement of coke content is no longer a problem; adequate 
equipment has been developed that permits the simultaneous study of the main reaction(s) and coke 
54 
formation, namely an electrobalance with or without recycle of the products and the TEOM 
[Beirnaert et al, 1994; Chen et al, 1996]. 
The shortcomings of the approach symbolized by (1) have been extensively discussed 
[Froment, 1976]. Briefly, if coke is not measured, the deactivation of the coking reaction itself can 
not be accounted for, so that (1) is really a very biased equation. This approach cannot predict the 
coke profile in a reactor, although the knowledge of this profile in an industrial reactor is of key 
importance for the operation of the catalyst regeneration. 
When the coke content of the catalyst is measured a distinction can be made between the 
deactivation function for the main reaction, CpA, 
and that for the coking reaction Cpc 
defined by : 
F 
A -" FA(DA 
(3) 
and 
r c = rc%Pc 
(4) 
where rA 
 and rc 
 are the initial rates, i.e. the rates at zero coke content. These are modeled in terms 
of the Hougen and Watson approach, accounting for the competitive adsorption of the reacting 
components and coke. 
Any progress in understanding the effects of coke on the rates of the reactions beyond the 
empirical level of the type of equation (2) requires more information on the structure of the coke 
and of the catalyst. In other words: is the effect of coke limited to the coverage of sites? Or can it 
grow to a size blocking the pores? What is the pore size distribution of the catalyst? Are the pores 
interconnected? 
The present paper aims at reviewing progress in the modeling of coke formation and catalyst 
deactivation along the lines set in Table 1, although it stresses to a large extent the kinetic 
formulation, an area in which considerable progress has been achieved.

2. COKE FORMATION ON THE MICRO-LEVEL: SITE COVERAGE AND 
COKE GROWTH 
2.1. Rate equations for simple, ideal cases 
For a simple reaction A  
B occurring on single sites and with the reaction between adsorbed 
species as the rate determining step the classical Hougen & Watson approach leads to [Froment & 
Bischoff, 1990]: 
Ct_Cc l kACtKA( Ca -)

kcCtKACA 
rcl = Ctr 
s =

(6) 
C t 
1 + K A 
C A -- KsC e 
where KA is replaced by KB in the numerator of (6) and KACA in the denominator by KBCB when 
the coke precursor is formed out of B (consecutive coking). The coke precursor is defined as the 
first of the components in the coking sequence which is irreversibly adsorbed. 
The rate of coke formation is related to the rate of irreversible fractional site coverage, rs, 
through: 
rc = eCtMcr = dC 
(7) 
dt 
provided there is no multilayer growth of the coke. 
For a given gas phase concentration integration of (7) yields: 
C c =6CtMc(1-exp(-r

For dual site reactions the relation between {p and Cc is non linear. Even with single site 
reactions a non linear relation would be obtained if there were a distribution in the strength of the 
sites. 
The deactivation functions {PA and {Pc would not be identical if a different number of sites were 
involved in the main and in the coking reaction. 
56 
2.2. Catalyst deactivation by site coverage simultaneous with coke growth 
The main reaction is affected only through the site coverage. For given PA, PB 
.... the following 
formula was derived by Beeckman & Froment [1979] for the deactivation function of the main 
reaction: 
Pa :exp(-rot)

degree of polymerization:

9A differs from 9c and is no longer a linear function of the coke content Cc. Whereas 9A is a 
measure of the coverage and always decreases, 9c may exceed one, depending upon the value of 
the ratio rp 
 Only when all the coke molecules have the same size can 9c be directly related 
to the site coverage. 
2.3 Rate equations for complex industrial processes 
In steam reforming for synthesis gas production from natural gas on a Ni/alumina catalyst, coke 
is mainly formed by the cracking of hydrocarbons. For a methane feed the main reactions and the 
coking reactions can be represented by: 
CH 
4 + H20  
CO + 3H 
2 
CH 
4 + 21120  
C02 + 4H2 
(13) 
CO + 1-120  C02 + 112 
CH 
4  C + 2H

(14) 
Fig. 1 represents the reaction mechanism involved in H 2, CO and CO2-production derived by 
Xu and Froment [1989] and by Snoeck and Froment [1997] for coke formation. 
In the steam reforming sequence (2) - (9), leading to CO, the rate determining step is (8), in the 
sequence (2) - (7), leading to CO 
2 it is step (7), in the water gas shift step (10). In the coking 
sequence (2) - (3) - (4) - (12) - (13) the rate determining step is the first H-abstraction, (3). 
By way of example the following rate equation for the formation of CO was obtained by Xu and 
Froment [

Clearly the rate equation for the cracking of methane, i.e. for the coke formation is not 
fundamentally different from that of one of the main reactions (12). What remains to be done is to 
link the coke content of the catalyst to the rate of the main reactions. Thereby a specific aspect of 
coke formation on Ni/alumina catalysts has to be accounted for, namely whisker formation. The 
rate equation (16) is not directly applicable because it contains the concentration of coke adsorbed 
on the Ni-surface, which is not accessible, just like Celia. 
l, CH_

.... The latter are eliminated through 
adsorption-isotherms in favor of the measurable gas phase partial pressures PCH4, Pn2, but this is 
not possible for coke. What is done in the derivation of (5) and (6), where the same problem is 
already encountered, is to manipulate the expressions so as to factor out the Ccl, thus yielding the 
58 
ratio (C t - Ccl)/Ct, defined as the deactivation function [Froment & Bischoff, 1990]. This cannot be 
done here because of an additional complication: carbon segregates on the side of the Ni-particle 
facing the gas, where its concentration is represented by CcNif, dissolves in the Ni, diffuses 
through it and precipitates at the rear of the particle, lifting it 'progressively from the alumina 
support, thus leading to a whisker carrying the Ni-parficle at its top. This was also accounted for 
by Snoeck and Froment [1997] who obtained an implicit rate equation for r 
c containing the 
diffusivity of carbon in Ni and the saturation concentration of carbon in Ni, assuming that the 
supersaturation is low. Therefore, at steady state there is no deactivation. The latter is only 
observed when the Ni is encapsulated by coke growing on coke, but the modeling of this aspect 
remains to be developed. 
Chemical processes encountered in petroleum refining are far more complex than steam 
reforming. The feedstocks are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons of various types each of which 
is converted along intricate pathways. 
So far these processes have been modeled in terms of lumps. In catalytic cracking the 3-lump - 
and the 10-lump model [Nace et al, 1971; Jacob et al, 1976] are still widely used although the 
lumps are based on boiling ranges rather than on chemical nature. These models contain in general 
only one deactivation function of an empirical nature for the reactions of the various lumps. In their 
study of the catalytic cracking of n-hexane on a US-Y-zeolite in an electrobalance with recycle 
Beimaert et al, [1994] derived an empirical deactivation function of the type (2) for the various 
reactions, but with different o-values, as illustrated in Table 2 for the isomerizations.

Note that the coke formation itself is not deactivated. This is probably due to the growth of 
coke, which is not hampered yet in this zeolite with its relatively large pore size, unlike that 
observed on ZSM-48 [Froment et al, 1990]. 
Fig. 2 shows a reaction scheme for the cracking of n-hexane on a US-Y-zeolite, illustrating 
again how the main reactions and the coke formation are closely related and involve similar 
reactions [Froment, 1996]. The monomethylpentanes and also the dimethylbutanes are rigorously 
lumped, since the equilibrium between the components is rapidly established. The alkylation of 
nC 6 and its isomers leads to a lump C 
k which cracks or cyclicizes and dehydrogenates into 
aromatics and into coke, either directly or through alkylation of the aromatics. The network 
contains 5 reacting components involved in 14 reactions belonging to 6 types (4 for the main 
reactions, 2 for the coke formation) so that 6 rate coefficients have to be determined. If all the 
reactions occur on the same type of sites and involve the same number of sites all the rate equations 
have the same denominator and the number of adsorption equilibrium constants amounts to 14 (3 
for the hexane isomers, 6 for the saturated C 
3 to C 5 molecules and their corresponding olefins, 1 
for the Ck-lum 
p and 1 for the aromatics lump). When the deactivation is expressed in terms of an 
59 
exponential function with respect to the coke content, 6 additional parameters are introduced, one 
for each type of reaction, excluding the coke formation which is not deactivated.

Reaction network in terms of elementary steps of carbenium-ion chemistry for the 
catalytic cracking of n-hexane. 
Clearly, applying this "molecular" approach to the cracking of a complex mixture like vacuum 
gas oil is an impossible task: the number of parameters would be overwhelming. Indeed, even in a 
homologous series of n-paraffins each molecule reacts at a different rate; the rate coefficient for the 
disappearance of the molecule increases with chain length. 
60 
The only way out is to express the transformation of the molecules in terms of the elementary 
steps of carbenium-ion chemistry: protonation, H- and Me-shifts, protonated cyclo-propane-type 
isomerization, 13-scission ... [Froment, 1996]. In Fig. 3 the cracking of n-hexane is represented in 
terms of the single event approach introduced by Froment and co-workers [Baltanas et al 1989; 
Vynckier and Froment, 1991; Froment, 1991; Svoboda et al, 1995]. 
Excluding CH3 
+ and primary carbenium ions which are far less stable than secondary and 
tertiary carbenium ions, leads to 17 rate coefficients for paraffin cracking in general and 26 
adsorption equilibrium constants, therefore a total of 43 parameters, which is more than the 26 
parameters in the molecular model. The superiority of the single event approach becomes evident 
when mixtures have to be dealt with. The rate coefficients of the elementary steps of the carbenium 
ions may be assumed to be independent of the chain length, so that the number of parameters does 
not increase for complex mixtures, unlike what happens with the molecular approach. Analogous 
assumptions are made within the naphthenes- and aromatics-families so that the total number of 
parameters entering in the kinetic modeling of the cracking of a vacuum gas oil and the associated 
coke formation is of the order of 40 to 50. 
It should be added here that these huge reaction networks have to be generated by computer 
[Baltanas & Froment, 1985]. Booleans relation matrices were used to describe the molecules and 
carbenium ions. Since a component analysis of a vacuum gas oil is not entirely feasible some 
lumping is inevitable but the rate coefficients for the reactions between the lumps can be 
constructed from those of the single events entering in the reactions of the components of the lump 
[Vynckier & Froment, 1991 
]. 
2.4. Clusters of uniform sites 
For multi-site reactions a site is only active when it is surrounded by the required number of 
vacant sites. The probability of such a configuration decreases as more sites become irreversibly 
covered. Also, certain reaction steps are only possible when the sites are covered by a specific set 
of molecules. These aspects are not accounted for in the phenomenological approach introduced in 
Section 2.1. 
Beeckman et al. [ 
1987], pursuing work by Nam and Froment [ 
1987], developed an approach 
accounting explicitly for the topology of a cluster of sites occupied by reacting species. Using 
probability calculus they derived expressions for % and qu in terms of the degree of coverage, co. 
When the coking reaction and the main reaction involve more than one site the deactivation function 
develops a dependence on the number of sites in the cluster. Both reactions now become structure 
sensitive. When the number of sites required by the coking reaction is higher than that of the main 
reaction a high metal dispersion- a small cluster size - decreases the selectivity for coke formation. 
Such a trend is well known in metal supported catalysis. The selectivities of the various main 
reactions can also be influenced as illustrated by Fig. 4. The topological model provides guidelines 
for optimizing the cluster size so as to achieve maximum selectivity for the main reaction and a 
maximum resistance to coke formation. 
2.5. Sites of different nature: Dual function catalysts 
The catalytic reforming of naphtha and the hydrocracking of heavy oil fractions are based on 
dual-function catalysts. These contain a metal component (Pt, Pte, Pt/Sn in reforming, Pt, Pd, 
Ni/Mo in hydrocracking) and an acidic component, (alumina in reforming, alumina or zeolite Y in 
hydrocracking). (De)hydrogenation occurs on the metal component, isomerizations and cracking 
on the acid component. In dual-function catalysis species formed on one type of site have to move 
to the other before the next step of the reaction sequence can take place. Evidently, proximity of 
both types of sites is required, although it has been shown that even a physical mixture of the two 
catalyst components can achieve the desired result. As sites are being covered by coke produced by 
side reactions the rate of the reactions decreases, but since the distance between sites remaining 
active increases, an additional effect has to be accounted for. Singh and Froment [1997] recently 
developed a probabilistic model for the deactivation of a dual function catalyst by coke formation 
accounting for reaction and surface migration. The reaction sequence was the isomerization of n- 
61 
into i-pentane on Pt/alumina, studied in an isothermal tubular reactor by De Pauw and Froment 
[1975] and represented schematically in Fig. 5 in which  stands for Pt-sites, x for acid alumina 
sites and coke is formed on x-sites only. All the reactions are assumed to occur on single sites.

Figure 5. Schematic representation of a process consisting of various adsorptions, desorptions, 
reactions and migrations. 
A square grid of x and o-sites was selected with only one site on each node of the grid. The 
migrating species randomly chooses its direction upon encountering a site which is covered already 
by a reacting component or by coke. Each migration step is limited to the adjacent site only. 
The expected distance for the migration of n-C5-- can be written: 
L1 =( 
1- 
Ps'''/dPs,,,) 
(17) 
62 
where d(A) is the length of a segment and Pfs is the conditional probability that a site encountered 
by n-C: is a free x-site. A similar formula is derived for L2, the distance of migration of i-C5

replacing:. 
The conditional probability Pews 
can be written 9 
p., , = 
(18) 
P//,P + Po/oPo + P//,P, + Po/,P + Pd/,P, 
where Pf/,, Po/ are the probabilities that a -site is free or occupied and Pf/, Po/, Pd/ are the 
probabilities that a x-site is free, occupied by the reacting species or by coke and, therefore, 
deactivated. The probability that a site randomly located on the catalyst surface is a x-site e.g. is 
given by: where Ct is the total concentration of both - and x-sites and C,, is the total concentration 
of x-sites. The probability that this x-site is free is given by:

Assuming coke formation from i-Cs--only, the parameters were estimated from the data of De 
Pauw and Froment [ 1975]. 
Fig. 6 shows the evolution with the coke content of the migration distances in a point of the 
reactor where the partial pressure of n-pentane has decreased from its inlet value of 0.757 atm to a 
value of 0.675. Initially, i.e. at zero coke content L and L 2 amount to 3.31 and 2.47 ]k 
respectively. The migration distances vary with the coke content as a consequence of two opposing 
effects: the coverage of x-sites by coke formed from i-C5-- that increases L l and L 2 and the 
deactivating effect of coke on the reaction n-C:x ---) i-C:x that decreases the coverage of x-sites by 
i-Cs--, thus reducing L 1 
and L 2. The magnitude of the variations of L 1 and L 2 depends on the local 
concentrations of n-C 
5 and i-C 
5 in the reactor. 
3. COKE FORMATION ON THE MESO-LEVEL 
The case of site coverage and coke growth was already discussed in Section 2.2. Coke can 
grow to a size sufficient to block even mesopores [Levinter, 1967]. Since there is no preferential 
location for the coverage of a site and the subsequent blockage of the pore Beeckman & Froment 
[ 
1979] used a probabilistic approach. The deactivation function is nothing but the probability that a 
I- I 
site is still active, q) equals the product of the conditional probability S that the site is not covered 
with P, the probability that it is accessible:

When the growth of the coke is instantaneous, which is the case when in (12) rp

 in 
other words when the rate determining step in the coking sequence is the production of the coke 
precursor, all the coke has the same size, determined by the pore diameter. Blockage of the pore 
causes coke profiles even when there are no concentration gradients of the reacting species. Also, 
q)A :(PC" 
In the more general case when the potential rate of polymerization is of the same order of 
magnitude as the potential rate of site coverage, two periods have to be distinguished: a first 
ranging from t = o to t = t 
b, the time required to reach a size sufficient to block the pore and during 
which only site coverage and cokes growth occur and a second, starting at t = t 
b, during which 
blockage occurs and the deactivation also depends upon the site density, as shown in Fig. 7. 
It is very questionable if a single pore is sufficiently representative for a catalyst particle in 
which the pores are interconnected. Beeckman and Froment [1979] modeled a particle of an 
amorphous catalyst in terms of a Bethe tree, which is a branching structure without closed loops. 
The type of tree they considered has a coordination number of three, while the pores are 
characterized by two stochastic variables: their length and their diameter. The probability P in (23) 
now becomes a much more complex function. The model was applied to a meso-macro porous 
structure representative of a chromia-alumina catalyst used in butene dehydrogenation and for 
single site coking and instantaneous growth of coke. C
p
A
 then equals (Pc but their value drops to 
zero long before all the sites are covered with coke, because of pore blockage. The approach was 
applied to the butene dehydrogenation data of Dumez and Froment [1976] by Matin et al [1986]. 
Beeckman and Froment [ 1982] also extended the approach to account for diffusional limitations. 
For consecutive coking a saddle-like coke profile through the particle was predicted.

A Bethe-tree is a particular case of more general networks considered in percolation theory. 
Sahimi and Tsotsis [ 
1985] applied percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulation to deactivation in 
zeolites, approximated by a simple cubic lattice. Beyne and Froment [1990, 1993] applied 
percolation theory to reaction, diffusion and deactivation in the real ZSM-5 lattice. The finite rate of 
growth was described in terms of a polymerization mechanism. Pore blockage was reached in this 
small pore zeolite. It also affects the path followed by the diffusing molecules that becomes more 
tortuous, so that the effective diffusivity has to be expressed in terms of the blockage probability.

Figure 8. Variation of (q)A)d 
and (tpc) 
d with the coke content for consecutive coking in a ZSM-5 
particle. 
Fig. 8 illustrates the variation of (q)A)d and ((pc) 
d with the coke content for consecutive coking. 
The index d indicates that, besides deactivation, diffusional limitations also affect the rate of 
transformation of A. The steep drop in activity corresponds to a coke content at which the 
65 
percolation threshold has been reached. Curves of this shape have been reported in the literature 
[Dejaifve et al, 1981]. 
Recently Gottifredi and Froment [ 1997] dealt with reaction, diffusion and coke formation in a 
catalyst particle, mainly focusing on the derivation and application of approximate but accurate 
formulae for the calculation of transport fluxes and deactivation functions. In the case of parallel 
coking and an exponential deactivation function the time behavior profile of the rate of the main 
reaction can be represented as in Fig. 9. Whereas for short times the highest rate is observed at the 
surface, with increasing reduced time, x, an internal maximum develops, the location of which 
shifts towards the center of the particle. Indeed, for parallel coking the coke content is always 
highest at the surface, since the diffusion limitation leads to a concentration profile of A which 
decreases towards the center of the particle. The deactivating effect of the coke is strongest at the 
surface. Inside the particle the coke content is lower and the rate is less affected so that a maximum 
in rA 
develops. The figure is similar to that derived by Froment and Bischoff (1961) for 
deactivation by coke formation in a tubular reactor without diffusional limitations inside the catalyst 
particles, however.

4. THE MACRO-LEVEL: 
DEACTIVATION IN A REACTOR 
Beyne and Froment [ 1993] simulated a tubular reactor with plug flow and diffusional limitations 
inside the catalyst for the process discussed already in Section 3. The main reaction is of the type 
A  B and coke is formed through a polymerization mechanism from a site covered by coke 
66 
precursor onwards. Transport, site coverage and blockage in the ZSM-5 catalyst is dealt with 
through percolation theory and effective medium approximation. Fig. 10 shows how for parallel 
coking the prof'lle of the effective rate of reaction of A through the reactor evolves with time. 
Initially the highest effective rate (the rate in the presence of diffusional limitations) is located at the 
inlet, but as time evolves a maximum develops that moves downstream through the reactor. For 
parallel coking the coke content of the catalyst is always highest at the inlet of the reactor and that is 
where the rate of disappearance of A is more affected, leaving a larger fraction of A to be converted 
in downstream zones as the run length increases. 
Such a wave does not develop with consecutive coking. As shown in Fig. 11 in such a case and 
pure A feed the coke content increases through the reactor, thus enhancing the importance of the 
upstream zone. With increasing time a smaller fraction of the reactor is participating in the reaction. 
Such a behavior was predicted by Froment and Bischoff [ 
1961], but without including diffusional 
limitations inside the catalyst particle.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
Studies of catalyst deactivation by coke formation should be conducted along the lines followed 
in the study of the main reactions of the process. By doing so advantage can be taken from the 
analogy between steps pertaining to both the main- and coking reaction pathways. The insight 
gained by such an approach will also permit one to distinguish between the deactivating effect of 
coke on various types of reaction and to model the evolution of the selectivity in terms of the 
increasing coke content. 
Catalyst deactivation has such an impact on the design and operation of plants that studies along 
the approach outlined here are fully justified. They should be an integrated part of the process 
development.
