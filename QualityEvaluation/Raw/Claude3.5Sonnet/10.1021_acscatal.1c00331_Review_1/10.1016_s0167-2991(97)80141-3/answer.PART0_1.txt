The given literature does not contain specific information about the composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents. The document focuses more broadly on catalyst deactivation by coke formation in various processes, but does not go into detail about PDH reactions or coke composition analysis. To properly answer this question, additional sources specifically addressing coke formation in PDH catalysts would be needed.

给定的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭沉积物成分或用于研究焦炭成分的分析技术的具体信息。该文档更广泛地关注各种过程中由焦炭形成引起的催化剂失活,但没有详细讨论PDH反应或焦炭成分分析。要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门讨论PDH催化剂中焦炭形成的资料。
