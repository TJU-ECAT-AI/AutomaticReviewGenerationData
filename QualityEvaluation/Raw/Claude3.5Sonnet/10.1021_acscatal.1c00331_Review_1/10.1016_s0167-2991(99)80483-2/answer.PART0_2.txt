[1] "Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500 °C. The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions. Studies have identified multiple types of coke:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The distribution and amounts of these coke types depend on the specific reaction conditions.

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke, allowing researchers to distinguish between coke deposits on various parts of the catalyst.

For instance, Lin et al. observed two main TPO peaks at 450°C and 500°C, attributed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively. Larsson et al. expanded on this, identifying a third type of coke (graphitic coke on the support) in addition to the two types mentioned by Lin et al.

These findings highlight the complexity of coke formation in PDH reactions and demonstrate how the nature of coke deposits can vary depending on their location on the catalyst (metal vs. support) and their structural characteristics (e.g., graphitic vs. non-graphitic).

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因催化剂类型和反应条件而异。研究已经确定了多种类型的积碳：

1. 金属上的积碳
2. 载体上的积碳
3. 金属附近的积碳
4. 载体上的石墨化积碳

这些积碳类型的分布和数量取决于特定的反应条件。

程序升温氧化(TPO)是用于阐明PDH系统中积碳成分复杂性和多样性的主要分析技术。TPO实验揭示了与不同类型积碳相对应的不同氧化峰，使研究人员能够区分催化剂各部分的积碳沉积。

例如，Lin等人观察到在450°C和500°C有两个主要的TPO峰，分别归因于金属上的积碳和载体上的积碳。Larsson等人在此基础上进一步研究，除了Lin等人提到的两种类型外，还确定了第三种类型的积碳（载体上的石墨化积碳）。

这些发现突出了PDH反应中积碳形成的复杂性，并展示了积碳沉积物的性质如何随其在催化剂上的位置（金属vs载体）和结构特征（如石墨化vs非石墨化）而变化。
