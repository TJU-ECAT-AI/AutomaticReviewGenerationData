[1] "Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500°C. The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."

[3] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has frequently been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions. Studies have identified multiple types of coke:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The distribution of these coke types depends on the specific reaction conditions. 

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke, allowing researchers to differentiate between coke formed on metal sites versus support sites.

While the literature provides insights into the general categories of coke, it does not offer detailed information on the molecular composition or structural characteristics of these deposits. Further advanced analytical techniques may be needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of coke composition and formation mechanisms in PDH catalytic systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成因催化剂类型和反应条件而异。研究已经识别出多种类型的焦炭：

1. 金属上的焦炭
2. 载体上的焦炭
3. 金属附近的焦炭
4. 载体上的石墨状焦炭

这些焦炭类型的分布取决于具体的反应条件。

温度程序氧化（TPO）是用于阐明PDH系统中焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术。TPO实验揭示了与不同类型焦炭相对应的不同氧化峰，使研究人员能够区分金属位点和载体位点上形成的焦炭。

虽然文献提供了关于焦炭一般类别的见解，但并未提供这些沉积物的分子组成或结构特征的详细信息。可能需要进一步的先进分析技术来全面了解PDH催化系统中焦炭的组成和形成机制。
