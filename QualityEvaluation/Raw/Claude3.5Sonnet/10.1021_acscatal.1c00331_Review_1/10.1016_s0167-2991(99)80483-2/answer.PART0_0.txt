[1] "Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500℃. The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."

[3] "The amounts of these types of coke depended on the conditions, and Larsson et al. [8] proposed a model in which a minor part of the coke deactivated the catalyst."

[4] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has frequently been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have identified multiple types of coke:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The amounts and types of coke depend on the specific reaction conditions. Some researchers have proposed that only a small portion of the coke actually deactivates the catalyst.

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke, allowing researchers to differentiate between coke deposited on various parts of the catalyst.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。研究已经识别出多种类型的焦炭：

1. 金属上的焦炭
2. 载体上的焦炭
3. 金属附近的焦炭
4. 载体上的石墨化焦炭

焦炭的数量和类型取决于具体的反应条件。一些研究人员提出，只有一小部分焦炭实际上会使催化剂失活。

程序升温氧化(TPO)是用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术。TPO实验揭示了与不同类型焦炭相对应的不同氧化峰，使研究人员能够区分沉积在催化剂各个部分的焦炭。
