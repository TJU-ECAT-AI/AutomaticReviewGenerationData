[1] "Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500 °C. The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."

[3] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has frequently been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Research has identified multiple types of coke deposits:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The amounts and types of coke formed depend on the specific reaction conditions. 

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke deposits. For example, peaks at 450°C and 500°C have been attributed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively.

These findings highlight the complexity of coke formation in PDH systems and the importance of using advanced analytical techniques to understand the nature of catalyst deactivation.

催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，会随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。研究已经识别出多种类型的焦炭沉积物：

1. 金属上的焦炭
2. 载体上的焦炭
3. 金属附近的焦炭
4. 载体上的石墨化焦炭

形成的焦炭数量和类型取决于特定的反应条件。

温度程序氧化（TPO）是用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的主要分析技术。TPO实验揭示了与不同类型焦炭沉积物相对应的不同氧化峰。例如，450°C和500°C的峰值分别被归因于金属上的焦炭和载体上的焦炭。

这些发现突出了PDH系统中焦炭形成的复杂性，以及使用先进分析技术来理解催化剂失活性质的重要性。
