[1] "Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500℃. The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."

[3] "The amounts of these types of coke depended on the conditions, and Larsson et al. [8] proposed a model in which a minor part of the coke deactivated the catalyst."

[4] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has frequently been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have identified multiple types of coke:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The amounts and types of coke depend on the specific reaction conditions. Some researchers have proposed that only a small portion of the coke actually deactivates the catalyst.

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke, allowing researchers to differentiate between coke deposited on various parts of the catalyst.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。研究已经识别出多种类型的焦炭：

1. 金属上的焦炭
2. 载体上的焦炭
3. 金属附近的焦炭
4. 载体上的石墨化焦炭

焦炭的数量和类型取决于具体的反应条件。一些研究人员提出，只有一小部分焦炭实际上会使催化剂失活。

程序升温氧化(TPO)是用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术。TPO实验揭示了与不同类型焦炭相对应的不同氧化峰，使研究人员能够区分沉积在催化剂各个部分的焦炭。

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions. Studies have identified multiple types of coke:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The distribution of these coke types depends on the specific reaction conditions. 

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke, allowing researchers to differentiate between coke formed on metal sites versus support sites.

While the literature provides insights into the general categories of coke, it does not offer detailed information on the molecular composition or structural characteristics of these deposits. Further advanced analytical techniques may be needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of coke composition and formation mechanisms in PDH catalytic systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成因催化剂类型和反应条件而异。研究已经识别出多种类型的焦炭：

1. 金属上的焦炭
2. 载体上的焦炭
3. 金属附近的焦炭
4. 载体上的石墨状焦炭

这些焦炭类型的分布取决于具体的反应条件。

温度程序氧化（TPO）是用于阐明PDH系统中焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术。TPO实验揭示了与不同类型焦炭相对应的不同氧化峰，使研究人员能够区分金属位点和载体位点上形成的焦炭。

虽然文献提供了关于焦炭一般类别的见解，但并未提供这些沉积物的分子组成或结构特征的详细信息。可能需要进一步的先进分析技术来全面了解PDH催化系统中焦炭的组成和形成机制。

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke, allowing researchers to distinguish between coke deposits on various parts of the catalyst.

For instance, Lin et al. observed two main TPO peaks at 450°C and 500°C, attributed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively. Larsson et al. expanded on this, identifying a third type of coke (graphitic coke on the support) in addition to the two types mentioned by Lin et al.

These findings highlight the complexity of coke formation in PDH reactions and demonstrate how the nature of coke deposits can vary depending on their location on the catalyst (metal vs. support) and their structural characteristics (e.g., graphitic vs. non-graphitic).

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因催化剂类型和反应条件而异。研究已经确定了多种类型的积碳：

1. 金属上的积碳
2. 载体上的积碳
3. 金属附近的积碳
4. 载体上的石墨化积碳

这些积碳类型的分布和数量取决于特定的反应条件。

程序升温氧化(TPO)是用于阐明PDH系统中积碳成分复杂性和多样性的主要分析技术。TPO实验揭示了与不同类型积碳相对应的不同氧化峰，使研究人员能够区分催化剂各部分的积碳沉积。

例如，Lin等人观察到在450°C和500°C有两个主要的TPO峰，分别归因于金属上的积碳和载体上的积碳。Larsson等人在此基础上进一步研究，除了Lin等人提到的两种类型外，还确定了第三种类型的积碳（载体上的石墨化积碳）。

这些发现突出了PDH反应中积碳形成的复杂性，并展示了积碳沉积物的性质如何随其在催化剂上的位置（金属vs载体）和结构特征（如石墨化vs非石墨化）而变化。
