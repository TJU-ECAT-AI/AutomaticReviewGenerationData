[1] "Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500 °C. The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."

[3] "The amounts of these types of coke depended on the conditions, and Larsson et al. [8] proposed a model in which a minor part of the coke deactivated the catalyst."

[4] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has frequently been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have identified multiple types of coke:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The amounts of these different types of coke depend on the reaction conditions. Some researchers have proposed that only a minor portion of the coke actually deactivates the catalyst.

The primary analytical technique used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO has been frequently employed to characterize coke deposits on catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. This technique allows researchers to distinguish between different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures, providing insights into their location on the catalyst (metal vs. support) and their structural characteristics.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。研究已经识别出多种类型的焦炭：

1. 金属上的焦炭
2. 载体上的焦炭
3. 金属附近的焦炭
4. 载体上的石墨化焦炭

这些不同类型焦炭的数量取决于反应条件。一些研究人员提出，只有一小部分焦炭实际上会使催化剂失活。

用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。TPO经常被用于表征丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂上的焦炭沉积物。这种技术允许研究人员根据焦炭的氧化温度区分不同类型的焦炭，从而提供关于它们在催化剂上的位置（金属vs载体）和结构特征的见解。
