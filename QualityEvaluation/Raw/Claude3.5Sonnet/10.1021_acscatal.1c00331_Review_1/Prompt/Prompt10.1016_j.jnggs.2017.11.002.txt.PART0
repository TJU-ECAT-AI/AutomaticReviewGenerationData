Abstract
The development of shale gas in the United States has made a breakthrough, profoundly changed the pattern of oil and gas supply. It created
the shale gas revolution on a global scale. Based on the practice of shale gas development in China and abroad, this paper aims to: (1)
Summarize 5 basic characteristics, which are shale gas resource distribution, reservoir space, sweet spot area (section), hydrocarbon type and
development mode. (2) Divide China shale development into three stages: scientific exploration, technological breakthrough and mature
development. The United States is divided into three stages: scientific exploration, technological breakthrough and mature development. The
United States is divided into three stages: scientific exploration, technological breakthrough and mature development. (3) Identify 4 challenges in
the future development of China shale gas industry. It includes non-marine shale gas potential, core technology and equipment for resource deep
than 3500 m, complex surface factory mode production, human geography and other non-technical factors. (4) Process economic evaluation
under the conditions of government financial subsidies. China's shale gas project FIRR is about 8.0%e9.0%. Considering the global shale gas
resources, consumer demand and other factors, it global shale gas production is expected to reach 1.1  1012m3 by 2040.

1. Introduction
After the US made a breakthrough in the development of
shale gas, with the aid of core technologies including hori-
zontal well volume fracturing, micro-seismic surveillance and
multi-well pad based exploitation to constantly promote the
development of tight gas and rapid increase in the output of
unconventional oil and gas, a worldwide Shale Gas Revolu-
tion has been brought about in energy sector. Shale is fragile
fine grained sediment layer [1] with shaly or lamellar bedding
composed of clastic grains with grain size smaller than
0.0625 mm and clay together with organic substance. The
shale in conventional oil and gas system has been considered
as an iron plate without pore space and taken as source rock
or cap-rock factor [2]. Since a breakthrough made in shale gas
development in Barnett in 1997, a number of shale gas has
been developed in Haynesville, Marcellus and Utica in suc-
cession [3], it is known as a common knowledge that pore
space of shale contains rich natural gas resource and that more
and more attention has been paid to shale gas as a key natural
gas resource. China is also abundant in shale gas resource
[4,5], having taken shape in production and size and become
the largest shale gas production area in addition to those in
North America after 10 years of development.

Discrepancy between shale gas and conventional natural
gas in terms of forming condition and distribution character-
istic has enriched traditional natural gas reservoir theory and
improved level of technology for exploration and development
to a certain extent, shale gas revolution plays a landmark
role in promotion of development in oil and gas geology and
update and upgrade of oil and gas industry. The paper sum-
maries basic characteristic of shale gas and divides stages of
development and recognition of shale gas field based on
detailed analysis of typical shale gas fields in China and the
US and determines challenge to development of shale gas in
China inspired by shale gas revolution and draws a com-
parison of economical efficiency in shale gas development
between China and the US as well as analyzes and predicts
prospect for development of shale gas.
2. Basic characteristics of shale gas
Oil and gas in black shale bed series contain proximal tight
oil, shale oil and gas as well as coal crevice gas as 3 types of
unconventional oil and gas, the exploitation of tight oil and
shale oil depends mainly on the output of dissociated oil and
the exploitation of tight gas, shale gas and coal crevice gas
depends mainly on continuous output of dissociated and
adsorbed gas (Table 1).
According to the division by United States Geological Sur-
vey [6], gas-bearing shale system is typical unconventional
natural gas system, being continuous natural gas accumulation.
Curtis [7] defined shale gas as biogenic gas, thermogenic gas or
multi-genetic gas continuously distributed in rich organic shale
system characterized by full of gas, continuous distribution in
large area, multi-lithology trap and shorter migration distance.
Zou [8] defines shale gas as natural gas contained in organic-
rich shale in dissociated state and adsorbed state in most
cases, being authigenic reservoir and continuous accumulation
of natural gas in large area. The paper defines shale gas as
natural gas generated from and subjected to continuous accu-
mulation in organic-rich black shale, with numerous and
abundant nanoscale pores in shale reservoir serving as primary
reservoir space. It is necessary to locate sweet spot areafor
development of shale gas field to achieve effective development
by fracturing sweet spot section to ensure artificial perme-
ability. Gas bearing shale beds are characterized by continuous
distribution in large area, lamina and bedding in widespread
development, abundant nanoscale organic pores, sweet spot
area (section)enrichment, thermogenic free gas as decisive
factor to determine output, high output to be achieved by control
of natural fracture density and over pressure development de-
gree and development of artificial shale reservoir as hori-
zontal well fracturing network, which are considered as 7 basic
characteristics.
2.1. Continuous distribution of shale gas in large area
Shale gas reservoir integrating source and storage is subject
to continuous distribution in large area along slope and
depression zone, being large in resource extent. The natural
gas contained in reservoir after hydrocarbon generation and
expulsion by organic substance in shale is to form shale gas
accumulation, shale is not only source rock but also reservoir.
The accumulation in authigenic reservoir makes shale reser-
voir in continuous distribution become one of the main control
factors for distribution of shale gas fields, it is common that
shale gas is in continuous distribution in large area along slope
and depression zone. Barnett shale gas is taken as an example:
it is observed that shale reservoir is in wide distribution along
slope zone in Ouachita mountainous region [9], with trans-
verse continuous distribution up to more than 2000 km2, gas-
bearing area of about 1.55  104 km2, and technical recov-
erable reserves up to 7362  108 m3 [10].
2.2. Widespread development of lamina and bedding
Bedding development has significantly improved the hori-
zontal seepage capability of shale reservoir and enhanced output
of shale gas well. Shale as pulveryte is under the combined
action of physical, chemical and biological processes in sedi-
mentation period to form sedimentation of lamina different in
component, including brittle mineral (calcite and dolomite etc.),
clay mineral (illite and illit/smectite interstratifications) and
organic substance (algae etc.), with bedding (seam) developed
between laminas in continuous or intermittent distribution and
combination of similar laminas to form lamina group and further
form single layer with horizontal bedding (seam) in develop-
ment and continuous distribution in most cases [11]. It is
observed from research that lamina and bedding (seam) are able
to communicate inorganic mineral pores and nanoscale organic
pores in shale reservoir to form high speed channel [12,13] for
horizontal migration of oil and gas. Bedding is in widespread
distribution in gas bearing shale in Wufeng Formation-
Longmaxi Formation in Sichuan Basin, with its horizontal
permeability higher than 0.01  103mm2 (average value is
1.33  103mm2), being much higher than its vertical perme-
ability in similar depth (lower than 0.001  103mm2, average
value is 0.0032  103mm2), the difference between which is
more than three orders of magnitude [14]. Gas bearing shale is
compacted along vertical upward direction, with vertical
permeability on the low side to prevent shale gas from rapid
dissipation and make for preservation, however, horizontal
bedding (seam) development has greatly improved horizontal
seepage capability of shale reservoir [15] and is able to make
horizontal well more likely to form complex fracture network
[16,17] after transformation by hydraulic fracturing to enhance
output of shale gas.
2.3. Abundant nanoscale organic pores
Shale reservoir is compacted, with development of nano-
scale pore throat volume and organic pores in most cases, and
the nanoscale pores are the main volume for gas accumulation.
The shale reservoir is super compacted, with pore diameter
from 50 mm to 100 mm and permeability from 109 to
103  103mm2 (Table 2). A number of analyses and test data
show that nanoscale pore and pore-throat volume are in

development in organic system in shale, accounting for more
than 90% of total pores in shale, having offered a large number
of effective spaces [18] for shale gas reservoir. Basing on
molecular dynamics simulation, pore throat radius which is
movable for methane is 2.4e7.8 nm, with 5.0 nm for average,
considering water film. Loucks [19], based on analysis of
Barnett shale, presented that nanoscale pore is the main space
in shale gas reservoir. Curtis [20] expressed that pore diameter
in shale is from 4 nm to 200 nm. It is observed from argon ion
polishing and scanning electron microscopy that pore diameter
in organic-rich shale in Wufeng Formation-Longmaxi For-
mation in the south of Sichuan Basin is from 150 nm to
400 nm (Fig. 1), with pore throat radius from 10 nm to 30 nm,

from

to

from

2.4. Sweet spot area and sweet spot section
enrichment
There is a certain change of indicators including shale
reservoir TOC, Ro and brittle mineral along horizontal and
upward direction, there is sweet spot area in region and
sweet spot section along longitudinal direction for shale gas;
since many shale gas fields both here and abroad came into
being long time ago, the evaluation of preservation condition
is key factor taken into consideration to determine whether
they are able to subject to accumulation on a large scale.
Barnett shale gas is taken as an example, the gas field is about
1.55  104 km2, in which the sweet spot area for shale gas
development
is
5000
km2,
non-sweet
spot
area
is
1.05  104 km2 [16]. Mineral Wells fault zone in the middle of
core area for Barnett shale gas cuts through shale reservoir
along near north east direction, with shale gas wells near to the
fault zone generating a large amount of water and a small
amount of gas, therefore, it is necessary to avoid the fault zone
[16] in drilling shale gas well. Two sets of organic rich shale
developed in Qiongzhusi Formation in Cambrian system,
Wufeng Formation in Ordovician system-Longmaxi Forma-
tion in Silurian system in middle and upper Yangtze Region in
China. Cambrian shale under the action of tectonic stress de-
velops calcite lamellae in reservoir, with poor gas-bearing
performance and without breakthrough in exploration. Shale
in Wufeng Formation and Longmaxi Formation is from 100 to
200 m in total thickness, in which the reservoir from 10 m to
40 m in thickness with development of graptolite fossil and
TOC >3% is sweet spot section for shale gas development,
there are three sweet spot areas established for shale gas
development in Jiaoshiba, Changning-Zhaotong and Weiyuan.
2.5. Initial output dependent on thermogenic free gas
content
Thermogenic gas is prevailing in shale gas field, with two
modes of occurrence including dissociated state and adsorbed
state and initial output of gas well dependent on the free gas
content. At the present time, there are more than 15 shale gas
fields developed in the world, in which 13 fields are for ther-
mogenic gas, 1 field is for biogenetic gas and 1 field is for multi-
genetic gas [21]. Shale gas in reservoir occurs in dissociated
state and adsorbed state [22]. The shale bed, after volume
transformation, shall generate channel system composed of a
number of highly permeable fracture networks to enlarge the
contact area [22] between shale matrix and highly permeable
fracture network channel to a greater extent. Compared with
free gas, the adsorbed gas shall be desorbed from desorbed state
into dissociated state before migration to highly permeable
fracture network channel within matrix, so the more free gas the
higher intical production. Using the Physical Simulation
Experiment Device of Coupled Seepage, a shale gas simulation
test has been carried out with hermetic coring sample for 1764
days. There was 5970 ml shale gas and the ratio of adsorbed gas
to free gas was 1:2. Almost all produced gas was free gas with
the proportion of 98% till the 1.1 years. At the end of the third
year, 83% produced gas was free gas, and the recovery of free
gas was 47%. Free gas shall be the first to come into play in
shale gas well production, higher free gas content shall bring
higher initial output of gas well. For example, free gas content in
Barnett, Fayetteville and Woodford is 60%, 80% and 40%, with
initial output of single well being 5.3  104 m3/d, 7  104 m3/
d and 5.5  104 m3/d [23] respectively; free gas content in
Haynesville, Muskwa and Eagle Ford is 80%, 80% and 75%,
with initial output of single well being 28  104 m3/d,
14  104 m3/d and 23  104 m3/d [23] respectively.
2.6. High output to be achieved by control of natural
fracture density and over pressure development degree
Fracturing process in shale reservoir is opening process of
natural fracture in most cases, with development degree of
natural fracture exerting an influence on effect of volume
transformation for shale so as to control output of shale gas
well. It is advisable to simulate fracture distribution charac-
teristic in situ stress condition by physical model test for
massive
hydraulic
fracturing
and
shale
sample
of
1 m  1 m  1 m in size to evaluate the mechanism to form
fracture in volume transformation of shale. It is observed from
test result that most fractures in fracturing process are opened
and propagate along natural gas fractures, with mutual

restriction and mutual opening between natural gas fracture
and bedding to form complex volume fracture network in
shale reservoir. There is development of natural gas fracture
[8,16] in organic-rich shale reservoir at the bottom of Wufeng
Formation-Longmaxi Formation in Jiaoshiba Block, with
shale gas well output on the high side, initial output of single
well in excess of 104 m3/d and EUR value of single well being
more than 1.5  108 m3.
Formation overpressure is an important factor to control gas
content in shale and single well output of shale gas well.
Drilling verifies that there is gas breakthrough in shale far and
wide in Sichuan Basin and Longmaxi Formation in the sur-
rounding; there is abnormal high pressure in basin slope and
syncline area, with pressure coefficient from 1.4 to 2.2,
overpressure area in excess of 25000 km2. The average gas
content in Longmaxi Formation in Changning Block in
abnormal high pressure area is 4.1 m3/t, the average gas
content in Longmaxi Formation in Fuling Area is 4.6 m3/t,
with tested output of single horizontal well higher than
5  104 m3/d in most cases; the basin margin is under normal
pressure, with gas content from 2.3 to 2.92 m3/t, tested output
of single horizontal well being about 2.2  104 m3/d [40].
2.7. Effective development based on artificial gas
reservoir by horizontal well fracturing
Artificial gas reservoir is to achieve effective development
of natural gas from shale formation on a large scale by manual
intervention including taking black gas-bearing shale formation
as sweet spot area unit, in which the well groups are deployed
in a scientific and rational way and shale formation is subjected
to transformation by massive hydraulic fracturing to form dense
fracture network and build artificial highly permeable area and
rebuild seepage field to greatly change subsurface fluid
seepage environment and supplement formation energy. Years
of exploration shows that multi-stage fracturing technique for
horizontal well is able to make artificial permeability in shale
reservoir, being an effective technique to establish artificial
shale gas reservoir. PurpleHayes Well 1H in Utica Shale Gas
Field is taken as an example; horizontal section is 5652 m in
length and subjected to fracturing in 124 stages, with fracturing
fluid of 11.3  104 m3 injected to achieve that single well is
14.1  104 m3/d in gas output and 159.6 t/d [24] in oil output.
Free gas is prior product in production process of gas well,
therefore, single well is higher in initial output; with the
decrease of formation pressure, adsorbed gas is subjected to
desorption in organic substance and flows into highly perme-
able fracture network channel, but the highly permeable frac-
ture network channel shows shortage of gas supply, therefore,
its later output is on the low side in long-period gas production.
Horizontal well in Haynesville Shale Gas is taken as an
example, the single well is 28  104 m3/d in initial output, with
output for the first year up to 30% of recoverable reserves and
output for the first three years up to 50% [25,26] of recoverable
reserves. On the premise of taking no account of economical
efficiency in gas well development, production period shall be
up to more than 30 years [13,26].
3. Present situation of shale gas in the US
The US starts shale gas revolution and achieves constant
innovation and development in terms of theoretic knowledge,
key technical equipment and management mode of shale gas to
drive global development in shale gas industry. Data from EIA
(2017) show that the shale gas output in the US in 2016 was
4447  108 m3, having grown by 200  108 m3, namely 4.6%.
3.1. Development process of shale gas in the US
There are 3 stages in development of shale gas in the US by
and large: Scientific exploration stage, technical breakthrough
stage and mature development stage.
3.1.1. Scientific exploration stage (1821e1996)
William A. Hart drilled the first oil gas well onshore in Fre-
donia of New York in the US in 1821, having succeeded in
development of shale gas for the first time. The well is 21 m in
depth and the reservoir is Dunkirk shale in Devonian system with
buried depth of 8.2 m and production period up to 37 years [27].
Some enterprises began to take shale gas as unconventional oil
and gas resource for exploration in a down-to-earth way and
started pilot development of shale gas fields in Antrim, Barnett
and Devonian in succession [28]. 8 production wells were drilled
in Antrim Shale in Michigan Basin in 1940 for shale gas devel-
opment on a small scale [29] in 1940. Ohio Shale and Cleveland
Shale were subjected to small scale fracturing trial to increase
production in 1965, having obtained favorable effect [28].
Under the influence of oil crisis in 1970s, the US govern-
ment issued several policies to promote development of un-
conventional oil and gas such as shale gas, including Eastern
Gas Shales Project started in 1976 with focus on trial devel-
opment [28] of shale gas in Devonian System in Michigan,
Illinois and Appalachian basins; Windfall Profit Act issued in
1977 (Department of Energy Organization Act) to boost
development of unconventional oil and gas [28]. The US
experienced remarkable growth from 18.4  108 m3 in 1978 to
56.6  108 m3 in 1992 in shale gas output in the period.
During this period, the shale gas output took shape and
acquired some key geologic knowledge and carried out a
number of explorative developments as a result of favorable
policy of the US government. The shale gas output was up to
80  108 m3 in shale gas fields in Antrim and Marcellus in
1977 [28] to make certain three types of geneses including
biological genesis, thermal genesis and mixed genesis [29] and
put forward concept [13] of continuous oil and gas accu-
mulation with trial made to increase production by small
scale fracturing, gel fracturing and horizontal well [28,30].
3.1.2. Technical breakthrough stage (1997e2003)
A breakthrough has been made in key engineering technology
for shale gas, the application of technologies for multi-stage
fracturing for horizontal well, large-scale hydraulic fracturing
and multi-well pad based exploitation has made shale gas
resource subject to effective development. Mitchell Energy &
Development Corporation headed by Mitchell has drilled more

than 30 shale gas wells on Barnett Shale in Fort Worth Basin by
17 years of unremitting efforts [31], an engineer named Nick
Steinsberger conducted trial development of three shale gas
wells by large scale slick water fracturing technology in 1997
[31]. The average daily output of the gas well (S.H. Griffin No. 3)
subjected to for the first 120 days was 4.2  104 m3/d in 1998.
Since then, a breakthrough was made in development of Barnett
Shale Gas Field [31]. Devon Energy Corporation acquired
Mitchell Energy & Development Corporation at the cost of USD
3.1 billion in 2001 [28]. Devon Energy Corporation further
developed multi-stage fracturing technology for horizontal well,
with ultimate recoverable reserves available for single horizontal
well (EUR) up to 0.8  108 m3, in which, the ultimate recov-
erable reserves available for wells accounting for 10% of the
total are up to 2.0  108 m3 [26].
A breakthrough made in large scale slick water fracturing
technology in the period enabled shale gas to achieve devel-
opment in an economic and effective way, the favorable test
results in technologies for re-fracturing and multi-stage frac-
turing further improved benefit from shale gas development, in
particular, successful test and widespread application of multi-
stage fracturing technology for horizontal well in 2002 made it
become an effective technology for shale gas development.
Barnett Shale Gas Field, after a breakthrough in development,
achieved rapid growth in output up to 54  108 m3 in 2002,
having become the largest shale gas field in the US, with shale
gas output up to 75  108 m3 in 2003, accounting for 28% of
the total output of shale gas in the US.
3.1.3. Mature development stage (from 2004 to the present
time)
The successful experience in development of Barnett Shale
Gas has been widely applied to shale gas fields in Haynesville,
Marcellus and Utica, shale gas has been soaring in output and
become the main part of natural gas output in the US. In 2007,
the shale gas fields in Fayetteville and Woodford achieved an
effective
development
on
a
scale,
with
output
up
to
24  108 m3 and 22  108 m3 [32,33] respectively; in 2008,
the shale gas field in Haynesville fulfilled effective develop-
ment on a scale, with output up to14  108 m3 [25]; in 2009,
shale gas fields in Marcellus achieved an effective develop-
ment on a scale, with output up to 35  108 m3 [34]; in 2010,
the shale gas fields in Bakken and Eagle Ford realized an
effective
development
on
a
scale,
with
output
up
to
15  108 m328  108 m3 [35] respectively; in 2013, the
shale gas field in Utica carried out effective development on a
scale, with output up to 30  108 m3 [36]. In 2012, multi-stage
fracturing technology for horizontal well was extensively
adopted in development of tight oil under the influence of low
gas price in 2012, a number of reservoirs for tight oil in
Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian subjected to effective
development to achieve rapid growth in tight oil output. The
output of tight oil in the US in 2016 was up to 2.3  108t [35].
During the period, shale gas resource experienced a fine and
effective development, in particular, the low oil and gas price
promoted effective development of shale oil and gas, including
the operation mode of multi-well pad was subjected to
extensive application, with significant improvement in con-
struction and operation efficiency in shale gas well; the extensive
application of high-end technology and equipment for detailed
description of shale reservoir with high accuracy, top drive ro-
tary steerable drilling, reservoir volume transformation theory,
micro-seismic monitoring have reduced the shale gas develop-
ment cost in succession, with oil and gas price on the decrease
but rapid development in shale gas industry since 2014.
3.2. Case analysis of typical shale gas field
3.2.1. First shale gas field to make a breakthroughdBarnett
Shale Gas Field
Barnett Shale Gas Field is located in Fort Worth Basin in
mid-north of Texas (Fig. 2), the principal target stratum is
Barnett Shale in Mississippian System, with burial depth from
1980m to 2591 m, thickness from 30 m to 180 m, TOC from
4% to 5%, Ro value from 0.8% to 1.4%, total porosity from 4%
to 5%, technical recoverable reserves up to 7362  108 m3 [9].
The gas field covers an area of 15500 km2, in which the core
area is 5000 km2, shale thickness is from 100 m to 230 m; the
peripheral area is 10500 km2, the shale thickness is more than
30 m [9]. The typical well is from 2000m to 3000 m in vertical
depth, with horizontal section length from 1000 m to 1500 m
and construction process of large amount of fluid and
displacement and low sand-liquid ratio adopted to carry out
volume fracturing in 10 stages, the single well cost is USD 2
million, with initial output up to 5.3  104 m3/d and ultimate
recoverable reserves up to 7000  104 m3.
In 1981, Mitchell Energy & Development Corporation took
the lead in drilling the first batch of evaluation wells, the first 33
wells fails to be up to economic output, with high energy gas
fracturing, foam fracturing and gel fracturing adopted for reser-
voir transformation in succession and poor effects. In 1997, since
large scale slick water fracturing technology greatly reduced
development cost and improved single well output, making it
possible to carry out commercial development of straight well.
Since 2003, with the application of horizontal well technology
and straight well re-fracturing technology, the single well output
has been further increased. In 2004, maturity and rapid gener-
alization of multi-stage fracturing technology for horizontal well
made shale gas output in peripheral area reach 466  108 m3. In
2008, Operation mode of multi-well pad was subjected to
extensive application, which further reduced development cost
and increased gas field output at a great pace, with output up to
466  108 m3 in 2011, making it become second largest shale gas
field in the US. Its output was 330  108 m3 in 2016, being the
fifth largest shale gas field in the US.
3.2.2. Shale gas field with high pressure and high
outputdHaynesville Shale Gas Field
Haynesville Shale Gas Field is located in Salt Basin
northwest of Louisiana and northeast of Texas (Fig. 2), the
principal target stratum is Haynesville Shale in Jurassic Sys-
tem, with burial depth from 3350 m to 4270 m m, thickness
from 61 m to 107 m, TOC from 0.5% to 4%, total porosity
from 8% to 9%, formation pressure coefficient from 1.5 to 2.0,

gas field covers an area of 2.3  104 km2, with favorable area
up to 1  104 km2, in which the area whose ultimate recov-
erable reserves available for single well are more than
1  108 m3 is 5000 km2 and the area whose ultimate recov-
erable reserves available for single well are more than
2  108 m3 is 1000 km2. The typical well is from 3000 m to
3500 m in vertical depth, with horizontal section length from
1200 m to 1700 m, and subjects to volume fracturing in 15
stages, the single well cost is from USD 6 million to USD 8
million [25], with initial output up to 28  104 m3/d and ul-
timate recoverable reserves up to1.8  108 m3 [26].
The first evaluation well was drilled in April 2004, with
favorable gas show. From 2005 to 2007, many companies
drilled dozens of evaluation wells in the region, having
determined the distribution of overpressure and enrichment
zones by and large. In 2007, the first horizontal well was
drilled; the well went into production in Jan. 2008, with initial
output up to 7.4  104 m3/d. In 2008, the gas well develop-
ment was started, with 300e500 horizontal wells drilled every
year. The shale gas output in 2011 was up to 617  108 m3, it
became the largest shale gas field in the US by 5 years of
construction. In 2016, the output was up to 393  108 m3,
being the fourth largest shale gas field in the US.

4.1. Development process of shale gas in China
China has experienced 3 shale gas development stages in
the period to tackle key problems for more than 10 years:
cooperation and reference stage, exploration and evaluation
stage, construction and production stage on a scale.
4.1.1. Cooperation and reference stage (2003e2009)
China introduced basic concept of shale gas in the stage,
with increasing attention paid to shale gas as a kind of resource.
Some domestic scholars began to use successful experience in
the US for reference and introduce concept of shale gas [38,39]
and also predict prospect of shale gas resource in China. In
2005, China Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and
Development set up shale gas project group to start evaluation
of new progress in shale gas in North America and screening of
favorable area for shale gas in China. In 2007, China Research
Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development and
Newfield Exploration Company signed a foreign cooperation
agreement on joint research of shale gas in Weiyuan Region.
Shale gas team of China Research Institute of Petroleum
Exploration and Development drilled the first geological in-
formation well for shale gas on north flank of geological
structure in Changning in China, namely Well Changxin 1 to
determine the situation for exploration and development of
shale gas in Wufeng Formation-Longmaxi Formation in
Sichuan Basin and the surrounding region [40]. Petro China
gave an official and written reply to Work Program for
Demonstration Zone for Oil and Shale Gas Industrialization in
China to start construction of demonstration zone for shale gas
industrialization in Chingning, Weiyuan and Zhaotong and
present that construction target was up to 15  108 m3/a.
4.1.2. Exploration and evaluation stage (2010e2013)
In the stage, many petroleum companies determined po-
tential and development prospect of shale gas resource by
drilling evaluation and made certain development position of
marine shale gas in Wufang Formation-Longmaxi Formation
in Middle and Upper Yangtze Region and discovered two
major shale gas fields in Shunan and Fuling [41], having laid a
foundation for development of shale gas on a scale.
Petro China targeted the marine shale gas resource in
Shunan Region and discovered Shunan Shale Gas Field. In
2010, it drilled the first evaluation well for straight welldWell
Wei 201 in China, with output in test of shale in Wufang
Formation-Longmaxi Formation from 0.3 to 1.7  104 m3/
d and output in test of shale in Qiongzhusi Formation up to
1.08  104 m3/d [42]. In 2011, it drilled the first horizontal
well for shale gas in ChinadWell Wei 201-H1, with shale in
Wufang Formation-Longmaxi Formation as target stratum,
fracturing in 11 stages, output in test up to 1.3  104 m3/d. In
2011, it drilled Ning 201-H1 horizontal well subjected to
fracturing in 10 stages for gas production test, with output in
test up to 15  104 m3/d. In 2012, it started multi-well pad
test on Changning H2 and H3 platform [43].
Sinopec kept on exploration and targeted marine shale gas
resource in Fuling Region at last, with Fuling Shale Gas Field
discovered. During the period from 2010 to 2012, Sinopec
focused on evaluation of shale gas exploration in Middle and
Lower Yangtze Region. In 2010, it drilled Well Xuanye 1 in
Xuancheng, with shale in Hetang Formation in Cambrian
System as target stratum, quantity of desorbed gas in test from
0.07 to 0.27 m3/t. In 2011, it drilled Well Pengye 1 in Pengshui,
with shale in Wufeng Formation-Longmaxi Formation as target
stratum and gas content up to 2.12 m3/t in 2012, it drilled
Pengye HF-1 horizontal well, with fracturing in 12 stages and
output in test up to 2.1  104 m3/d. In 2011, it drilled Well
Xiangye 1, with shale in Wufeng Formation-Longmaxi For-
mation as target stratum and low-yield gas stream obtained
[44]. In 2012, it drilled Well Huangye 1 in Huangping County
in Guizhou Province, with daily gas output up to 176 m3/d. In
2012, it drilled Jiaoye Well 1HF, with shale in shale in Wufeng
Formation-Longmaxi Formation in Jiaoshiba Block as target
stratum, output in test up to 20.3  104 m3/d and breakthrough
made in exploration in the end. In 2013, Sinopec started
development of test well group and carried out evaluation of
production and construction in Jiaoshiba Block [44].
Yanchang Petroleum, Huadian Group and Shenhua Group
have carried out a large amount of exploration of marine,
continental and transitional shale gas. Yanchang Petroleum
performed a great amount of evaluation of continental shale
gas resource in Erdos Basin, with a number of evaluation wells
including Well Liu 177 drilled in 2011 to evaluate shale gas
resource potential in Chang 7-Chang 9 Section in Yanchang
Formation Triassic System and Benxi Formation and Shanxi
Formation in Carboniferous System-Permian System [45].
Huadian Group and Shenhua Group drilled a number of
evaluation wells for shale gas including Well Laiye 1 and Well
Baoye 1 in Wufeng Formation-Longmaxi Formation in Lai-
feng Block and Baojing Block respectively.
Geological research of shale gas has come a long way, with
a set of key technical systems applicable to geological char-
acteristic in China established in exploration process and
nanopore from 5 nm to 100 nm discovered in shale according
to core analysis based on Well Wei 201 for the first time in
China [8,40] and theory on overpressure shale gas reservoir
presented based on characteristic of marine shale gas reservoir
in Middle and Upper Yangtze Region [46]. Zou [8,40] put
forward the theory on orderly accumulation of conventional-
unconventional oil and gas and set up two forming modes
namely continuous sweet spot area in shale-rich stable zone
and tectonic sweet spot in transformation zone. Guo [47]
presented binary accumulation Rule based on character-
istic of shale gas reservoir in Fuling. In order to solve the
predicament in economic development of low permeable and
unconventional oil and gas, Zou et al. [43] put forward the
concept and development idea of man-made reservoirs
namely the abundant oil and gas reservoir for development is
generated by manual work including selection and fracturing
of sweet spot area to generate artificial highly permeable
area. The successful experience in the development of shale
gas in the US has been introduced based on geological char-
acteristic of marine shale gas in Middle and Upper Yangtze
Region, with multi-stage fracturing technology for horizontal

well applicable to development of shallow shale gas within
3500 m in depth in China.
National policy has geared up the development of shale gas
industry. In 2010, National Energy Administration set up
Development (Experiment) Center of Shale Gas of National
Energy Administration in 2012 to focus on research and
technical service for exploration and development, drilling and
completion, transformation to increase production and exper-
iment and test associated with shale gas. In 2012, National
Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Land and Resources and National Energy
Administration jointly issued Shale Gas Development Pro-
gram (2011e2015) (FGNY [2012] 612) to come up with the
shale gas production target of 65  108 m3 in 2015. In order to
promote development of shale gas industry, Ministry of
Finance and National Energy Administration issued Notifica-
tion on Promulgation of Subsidy Policy for Development and
Utilization (CJ [2012] 847) in 2012 to subsidize development
and utilization of shale gas from 2012 to 2015 according to the
standard of RMB 0.4 yuan/m3. National Development and
Reform Commission and National Energy Administration
approved to establish 3 national demonstration zones for shale
gas industrialization in Peiling, Changning and Weiyuan in
March 2012. Ministry of Land and Resources assigned 4
Blocks in 2011 and 19 Blocks in 2012 by competitive bidding.
4.1.3. Extensive construction and production stage (2014-
the present)
In the stage, many petroleum companies started construc-
tion and production of shale gas on a scale based on the
exploration and evaluation in prior period, with shale gas
output in China having taken shape step by step, keeping on
rapid growth and two shale gas fields in Shunan and Peiling
subjected to effective development on a scale up to now.
Petro China targeted shale gas fields in Shunan and ach-
ieved effective development of 3 blocks in Changning,
Weiyuan and Zhaotong. In 2014, Petro China held special
meeting on development of shale gas operation and estab-
lished on-site coordination and command group and approved
the first shale gas development plan to achieve production
capacity up to 25  108 m3/a. In 2015, Changning H6 platform
operation characterized by dual driller and batch quantity
became the first platform with daily output in excess of million
m3/. In 2006, Petro China approved second shale gas devel-
opment plan (expansion of production capacity). In 2017,
Petro China approved development plan with annual output up
to 120  108 m3/a to speed up shale gas development.
Sinopec targeted Fuling Shale Gas Field and achieved
effective development of shale gas resource. In 2014, Sinopec
started production and construction of first phase of Fuling
Shale Gas Field with output up to 50  108 m3/a and estab-
lished Chongqing Fuling Shale Gas Exploration and Devel-
opment Company affiliated to Sinopec. In Dec.2015, it
declared that the production capacity of the first phase project
was up to 50  108 m3/a. In 2016, it started evaluation of 5
blocks in Jiangdong, Zilichang, Baitao, Pingqiao and Baiman
in second phase project in succession.
Government keeps on supporting to development of shale
gas
industry.
In
2016,
National
Energy
Administration
released Shale Gas Development Program (2016e2020)
(GNYQ [2016] 255), requiring that China shall hit the target
of 300  108 m3 for shale gas output by great effort. Ministry
of Finance and National Energy Administration jointly issued
Notification on Financial Subsidy Policy for Development and
Utilization (CJ [2015] 112), specifying that financial subsidy
for shale gas developed and utilized from 2016 to 2018 should
be RMB 0.3/m3 and that from 2019 to 2020 should be RMB
0.2/m3. In addition, great efforts have been made to tackle
technical problem in shale gas project in major scientific and
technological program for development of large scale oil and
gas field and coal seam gas.
4.2. Typical gas field development case
4.2.1. Shunan Shale Gas Field
Shunan Shale Gas Field is primarily located in Sichuan
Province and composed of 3 blocks in Weiyuan, Changning and
Zhaotong, with organic rich shale in Wufeng Formation-
Longmaxi Formation as target stratum. Weiyuan Block is

28  108 m3, it is estimated that the shale gas output is up to
30  108 m3 in 2017.
Ning 201-H1 horizontal well was drilled Changning Block
in 2012, with test output up to 15  104 m3/d. The multi-well
pad test on H2 and H3 Platforms including 14 (8  6) wells
was started in 2013, with YS108H1-1 horizontal well drilled
in Zhaotong Block and test output up to 20.86  104 m3/d. In
2014, Well Wei 204 was drilled in Weiyuan Block, with test
output up to 16.5  104 m3/d after change from straight well to
horizontal well. In 2016, Sinopec planed to start construction
of production capacity up to 120  108 m3/a of shale gas, it is
estimated that the shale gas output shall be more than
100  108 m3 in 2020; by the end of 2016, there were 93
horizontal wells and 85 put-to-production wells in Weiyuan,
with annual output up to 11.8  108 m3 in 2016; there were 66
horizontal wells and 57 put-to-production wells in Changning

Jiangdong Block, with new production capacity up to
6  108 m3/a, there are 28 wells to be drilled in Pingqiao
Block, with new production capacity up to 2  108 m3/a.
4.2.3. Shale gas in Ordos Basin
Ordos Basin is an important production area for natural gas
in China, being in five provinces including Shaanxi, Gansu,
Ningxia, Inner Mogolia and Shanxi, covering an area of about
20  104 km2, with 4 series of organic rich shales developed
from top to bottom, namely shale in Liangping Formation in
Ordovician System in marine facies in Lower Paleozoic, shale
in Shanxi Formation, Taiyuan Formation, Benxi Formation in
Carboniferous-Permian in transition facies in Upper Paleozoic
and shale in Yanchang Formation in Triassic System in conti-
nental facies in Mesozoic. Shale in Carboniferous System and
Permian System in transition facies in Upper Paleozoic has been
proven to be the main source rock in conventional gas fields in
Jingbian, Sulige, Wushenqi, Yulin and Daniudi. Organic rich
shale in Ordos Basin is from 700 m to 4000 m in burial depth,
from 20 m to 200 m in thickness, 2.6494  104 km2 in favorable
area, from 1.5% to 11.37% (average: 6.95%) in TOC, from 0.5%
to 2.98% (average: 1.29%) in Ro value, from 35.04% to 56.95%
(average: 46.0%) in quartz mineral content, from 1.8% to 7.4%
(average:3.12%) in total porosity, from 1.38 to 4.36 m3/t
(average: 2.45 m3/t) in gas content, from 0.98 to 1.20 in for-
mation pressure coefficient, 7.1537  1012 m3 in geologic re-
sources, 0.9759  1012 m3 in recoverable reserves.
In 2011, Yanchang Petroleum Group drilled Liuping 177
well in southeast of Ordos Basin, with shale in Yanchang
Formation of Triassic subjected to fracturing test to achieve
daily output of shale gas up to 2350 m3, and then it drilled
Liuping 171, Xin 57, Xin 59 and Yanye 1 wells in succession,
with shale in Yanchang Formation of Triassic System sub-
jected to fracturing test to achieve daily output of shale gas up
to 1779e2413 m3. In 2012, Yanchang Yan'an National Shale
Gas Demonstration Zone of was established in Zhiluo-
Xiasiwan in the area of mining right of Yanchang Petro-
leum. In 2017, shale in Carboniferous System and Permian
System in Ji 2e4, Daji 27, Daji 41 wells on east end of Ordos
Basin drilled by Coal Seam Gas Company affiliated to Pet-
roChina were subjected to fracturing, with daily output of
shale gas from 2885  104 m3 to 8254  104 m3, and now,
shale in Carboniferous System and Permian System in almost
10 wells was subjected to gas testing; China Geological Sur-
vey drilled Well Zhong 4 in the west of the Basin, with
Wulalik Formation in Upper Ordovician System as target
stratum and daily output in test on well section from 4050 m to
4056 m up to 4.12  104 m3. According to practice in
exploration and development of shale gas both here and
abroad, it is estimated that Ordos Basin is likely to become the
next basin to make a breakthrough in shale gas development in
China.
5. Similarities and differences in shale gas between China
and the US as well as revelation from exploitation thereof
Q3
Compared with the US, the shale gas in China is charac-
terized by various reservoirs, remarkable tectonism, difference
in thermal evolution degree, distinction in horizontal distri-
bution of reservoir, complex crustal stress condition, fluctua-
tion in surface condition and burial depth of marine shale in
Yangtze Region.
5.1. Comparison of shale gas between China and the US
There is difference in shale gas reservoir between China
and the US in terms of sedimentary structure, thermal evolu-
tion degree, sweet spot size, crustal stress feature and gas
component etc. (Fig. 5).
Including: (1) Shale reservoir in North America is based on
marine deposit, with stable structure. Shale in China shows
marine deposit, continental deposit and transition deposit, having
subjected to multi-stage tectonic transformation in reservoiring
process. (2) Shale reservoir in the US is moderate in maturity,
being in the preferred gas production stage, with Ro from 0.8% to
2.0%, marine shale in China is in high and over maturity stage,
with Ro value from 2.5% to 4%, continental Ro value from 0.8%
to 1.5%. (3)Sweet spot section in shale reservoir in North
America is thick (30e150 m). Sweet spot area reservoir is in
continuous distribution in large area (10000 km2); Sweet spot
section in shale reservoir in China is relatively thin (10e40 m),
big difference in distribution of reservoirs (from 100 km2 to
10000 km2). (4) Shale reservoir in North America is simple in
crustal stress, unobvious in horizontal main stress and likely to

form volume fracture network by fracturing transformation;
Marine shale reservoir in China is relatively complex, with
horizontal main stress difference in excess of 10 MPa in local
area and difficulty in volume transformation. (5) Some shale
reservoirs in North America symbiosis are subject to oil and gas
symbiosis and co-exploitation; Marine shale in China is to
generate gas by and large and continental shale in China is to
generate oil on the whole.
5.2. Revelation from exploitation of shale gas in the US
It is observed from shale gas development and case analysis
of typical gas field in the US that effective development of
shale gas resource necessitates innovative idea, innovative
technology and innovative management mode, with revelation
obtained including 4 points: (1) Shale gas reservoir is in
continuous distribution, in case that a breakthrough is made at
one point, the technology to make a breakthrough shall be
generalized in the whole area, therefore, it is possible to build
the shale gas reservoir into a big gas field in short period. (2)
Effective development of shale gas field is the result of con-
stant progress in geologic theory and engineering technology,
the breakthrough in multi-stage fracturing technology for
horizontal well achieved production revolution in develop-
ment of shale gas for the first time. (3)Multi-well pad
operation based on low oil and gas price greatly improved
operation efficiency and reduce cost and achieved self cost
revolution in beneficial development of shale gas for the
second time.(4) The tax deductions and exemptions and
project support by the US government in the shale gas
exploration and development in prior period have promoted
development of shale gas industry.
5.3. Challenge to development of shale gas in China
5.3.1. Non-marine shale gas potential to be further
confirmed
There is big difference in understanding of shale gas
resource in China among various departments. A breakthrough
has been made in development of marine shale in Wufeng
Formation-Longmaxi Formation in Sichuan Basin, the devel-
opment potential of transitional and continental shale gas is to
be confirmed. It is observed from evaluation by EIA (2015) in
the US that the shale gas in China is 31.6  1012 m3 in
recoverable resources, including 23.3  1012 m3 in marine
facies, 7.4  1012 m3 in transition facies and 0.9  1012 m3in
continental facies [51,52]. It is observed from evaluation by
Ministry of Land and Resource (2015) in the US that the shale
gas in China is 21.8  1012 m3 in recoverable resources,
including 13  1012 m3 in marine facies, 5.1  1012 m3 in
transition facies and 3.7  1012 m3 in continental facies
[52,53]. The evaluation by Research Institute of Petroleum
Exploration and Development (2014) shows that the shale gas
in China is 12.85  1012 m3 in recoverable resources,
including 8.8  1012 m3 in marine facies, 3.5  1012 m3 in
transition facies and 0.5  1012 m3in continental facies
[54e56]. The marine shale in south of China is characterized
by brittle mineral content no smaller than 60%, high brittle-
ness, convenience for fracturing and large reservoir space
(average porosity from 5% to 6.2%), having become the main

field for development of shale gas in China; the transitional
and continental shale is characterized by clay mineral content
from 58% to 65%, low brittleness, difficulty in fracturing and
reservoir space being from 1/4 to 1/2 of that in marine shale.
5.3.2. An overall breakthrough to be made in core
technology and equipment for marine shale at the depth of
more than 3500 m
Marine shale gas resource in Wufeng Formation-Longmaxi
Formation is more than 3500 m in burial depth of main body.
10 areas of mining right of Petro China in Sichuan Basin are
taken as example, the shale gas resources at the depth of no more
than 4500 m in the area of 6.4  104 km2 are 16.3  1012 m3,
including 11.2  1012 m3 at the depth of more than 3500 m,
accounting for 69% of resources. The deep shale reservoir is
characterized by high temperature, high stress and high plas-
ticity, with difficulty in well completion and volume trans-
formation for horizontal well for shale gas to a great extent.
There are many wells drilled down to the depth of more than
3500 m in some blocks, but the test results therein are poor [55].
It is necessary to carry out evaluation of area selected for shale
gas at the depth of more than 3500 m to determine a number of
deep areas for development and construction and tackle key
problems in important engineering technology and equipment
for shale gas in deep area to grasp the applicable technologies
and establish pilot test area for development of deep shale gas
and promote effective development of deep shale gas on a scale.
5.3.3. Production mode of multi-well pad for complex
surface condition to be established
The single well for shale gas is characterized by higher
initial output and quick decrease in output and long stable
production period, therefore, it is necessary to drill a large
number of wells to stabilize and increase production in
development of shale gas field. The shale gas fields developed
are mainly distributed in picturesque and populous regions in
the south, with strict requirement of environmental protection,
in addition, these regions are complex in topography, densely
populated, less per capita cultivated land. In order to reduce
the land for well site, cluster horizontal well group is pre-
vailing to carry out multi-well pad operation, with 6e10
wells drilled per pad in most cases. In multi-stage fracturing
construction, the operation efficiency is greatly improved by
optimization of operation process and the drilling fluid and
flow-back fluid in fracturing are subjected recycling, drilling
cuttings are subjected to harmless disposal to ensure safety
and environmental protection in development of shale gas. It is
also necessary to further optimize multi-well pad operation
mode to increase number of cluster horizontal wells per pad
and further enhance land use rate for well site.
5.3.4. Long well construction period and high cost in
development of shale gas
It is observed from data on shale gas development that the
entire period from investment to gas well production shall be
from 1.5 to 2 years. The non-operation time is in excess of
50% of well construction period. China is complex in surface
and geologic conditions for shale gas, with large workload,
long period and high cost for shale gas well construction.
Shale gas resources are primarily in mountain, desert and loess
tableland, with longer construction period for well site; shale
gas reservoir is under complex crustal stress, with difficulty in
horizontal well completion and volume transformation, at
present, the period for single horizontal well completion in
1500 m of horizontal section is from 60 d to 80 d, it is
advisable to further reduce cost.
6. Economy and prospect of global shale gas development
Low oil and gas prices compel all enterprises engaging in
shale gas business to intensify their cost control, with updating
and upgrading of key technologies to improve development ef-
fect and multi-well pad to greatly operation efficiency and
achieve self cost revolution in development of shale oil and
gas. Henry Hub Data Center in the US shows that since natural
gas price was down to RMB 0.46/m3 [57], it should be on the low
side, and now, the natural gas price is RMB 0.8/m3 (June, 2017).
Marcellus Shale Gas Field is taken as an example, there were
there were 141 drilling machines in operation in peak period in
Jan. 2012, and then, with the increase of gas price, the number of
drilling machines was down to 24 in June, 2016, and then the
number of which bounced back to 45 [58]. Although the number
of drilling machines was on the decrease to a great extent, due to
improvement in the construction level and operation efficiency.
The gas field output was increased from 17764  104 m3/d in
Jan.2012 from 50873  104 m3/d to 50873  104 m3/d in July,
2016. The output was increased to 54701  104 m3/d [59] in June
2017 [60]. At present, the break even point for shale gas fields in
the US is from USD 0.58 to 0.91/m3 [60], therefore, there is
economic benefit in development of shale gas although the
natural gas price is low. Marcellus Shale Gas Field is taken as an
example, in case that the single well is USD 4 million in in-
vestment cost and (EUR) 1.06  108 m3 in ultimate recoverable
reserves, it is estimated that its internal rate of return is 9.1%
[61]. The natural gas price in China has been on the decrease
since 2012 under the influence of international natural gas
market, with further improvement in engineering technology,
market mechanism, management mode, policy support, China
shall gradually highlight economic and social benefits in
development of shale gas industry.
There are abundant shale gas resources in the world, with
output on the rapid growth. In 2016, global shale gas output was
up to 5068  108 m3, including 4447  108 m3 in the US,
510  108 m3 in Canada, 78  108 m3 in China and 18  108 m3
in Argentina. EIA (2016) predicts that global shale gas output
shall be up to 1.7  1012m3, including 8200  108m3in the US,
2200  108 m3 in China, 730  108 m3 in Canada, 730  108 m3
in Mexico, 670  108 m3 in Algeria, 650  108 m3 in Argentina
and 3720  108 m3 [62] in other regions.

widespread development, abundant nanoscale organic
pores, sweet spot area (section)enrichment, thermogenic
free gas as decisive factor to determine output, high output
to be achieved by control of natural fracture density and
over pressure development degree and development of
artificial shale reservoir as horizontal well fracturing
network, which are considered as 7 basic characteristics.
(2) 4 Challenges to development of shale gas in China have
been presented based on division and comparison of
development and understanding in shale gas fields be-
tween China and the US, namely non-marine shale gas
output potential, core technology and equipment appli-
cable to the depth of more than 3500 m, production mode
based on multi-well pad on complex surface and effi-
ciency and benefit in development of shale gas.
(3) Aggregate prediction shows that the global shale gas output
in 2040 is expected to be up to 1.1  1012 m3 and the China
is likely to be the largest shale gas production region next
only to that in North America for a long period of time.
