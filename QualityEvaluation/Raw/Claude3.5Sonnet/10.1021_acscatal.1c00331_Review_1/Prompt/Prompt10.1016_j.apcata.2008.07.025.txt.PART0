1. Introduction
The increasing demand for propylene derivatives such as
polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, cumene, phenol,
isopropylic alcohol and many others has produced a correspond-
ingly heavy increase in propylene demand during the last 20 years.
It is expected that in order to meet future propylene demand, other
processes will be developed (dehydrogenation, oxidative dehy-
drogenation, metathesis or use of membrane reactors) in addition
to traditional petrochemical or refinery processes (steam cracking,
fluid catalytic cracking), since it is forecast that the propylene
market will grow faster than the ethylene market [1].
Propane dehydrogenation is an equilibrium limited and highly
endothermic reaction (DH298 K
R
 120 kJ mol1) that is often carried
out at high temperatures and atmospheric pressure using platinum
or chromium catalysts. The reaction of olefins on platinum is faster
than that of paraffins, given that olefins interact with platinum
more strongly than paraffins. The role of platinum modifiers is to
selectively
weaken
the
platinumolefin
interaction
without
affecting
the
platinumparaffin
interaction.
Arsenic,
tin
or
germanium are among the metals reported as being platinum
activity modifiers. The modifiers also improve stability against
fouling by heavy carbonaceous materials. Platinum is a highly
active catalytic element and is not required in large quantities for
catalyzing the reaction when it is dispersed on a high surface area
support. High dispersion is also necessary for achieving high
selectivity
to
dehydrogenation
relative
to
undesirable
side
reactions, such as cracking. The typical high surface area alumina
supports employed have acidic sites that accelerate skeletal
isomerisation, cracking, and polymerization of olefinic materials,
and enhance coke formation. Furthermore, alkali or alkaline earth
metals assist in the control of the acidity [2,3].
The formation of short chain hydrocarbons (cracking) and coke
(coking) are the main undesired reactions associated with propane
dehydrogenation. Furthermore, coke is rapidly formed at high
temperatures and as a consequence the catalyst is deactivated and
needs to be regenerated. These difficult process features require
dedicated reactor technology.
During the last decade, our group has been researching process
alternatives. The objective is to employ a single vessel that could be
continuously operated. To this end, we have developed different
types of fluidized bed reactors that use separated oxygen and
hydrocarbon feeds. The simplest version is called the two-zone
fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR). It consists of a fluidized bed where
oxygen is fed to the lower part of the reactor, mixed with an inert
gas, and the hydrocarbon is fed at an intermediate point of the bed.
In this way two zones are created in the reactor: in the lower zone
the catalyst is reoxidized by gas phase oxygen, a process that
causes the gas stream to become depleted in oxygen. In the upper
zone, the chemical reaction takes place. Reaction products,

A complete kinetic model of propane dehydrogenation to produce propene over a PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst
was obtained. This has been investigated over the temperature range of 460540 8C at atmospheric
pressure. A LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism provides the best fit for propane dehydrogenation, while
a monolayermultilayer mechanism is proposed for modelling the coke formation. In addition, the
reaction rate of coke formation and its influence on catalyst deactivation and subsequent regeneration
have been studied. Finally, a suitable mathematical model is developed for simulating the process
behaviour in a two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR).

unconverted reactant and inert diluent leave together at the top of
the bed. The good circulation of the solid, characteristic of fluidized
beds, provides transport of solid between both zones and thus a
stationary state is reached. In reactions where the problem is the
fast deactivation of the catalyst by coking, the TZFBR may be
employed to implement continuous catalyst regeneration in the
reactor [4].
In a previous work, our group studied the dehydrogenation of
propane over a commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst [5]. This study
focuses on improving the propene yield reached and on the
development of new models of catalyst deactivation. Furthermore,
we present a
complete mechanistic kinetic model for
the
dehydrogenation, the coke formation and its influence on catalyst
deactivation, and catalyst regeneration using a PtSnK/Al2O3
catalyst, in order to perform this reaction in a two-zone fluidized
bed reactor.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by incipient wet impreg-
nation in accordance with the procedure described in the literature
[6] but with variations in composition. Commercial g-Al2O3
support (Puralox Sasol Germany GmbH) with particle size 160
250 mm, BET surface area 153 m2 g1, and pore volume 0.45 ml g1
was used with distilled water as the solvent. The nominal
composition of the catalyst was 0.05, 0.14 and 0.10 wt.% of Pt,
Sn and K, respectively.
The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation. The
support was first impregnated with 6 wt.% of SnCl22H2O (Sigma
Aldrich, 98% purity) dissolved into HNO3 (SigmaAldrich, 1N). It
was then dried in air at 100 8C during 12 h and calcined in a
fluidized
bed
reactor
as
follows.
The
catalyst
was
heated
(3 8C min1) to 550 8C in air and calcined for 2.5 h at this
temperature in humid air. The wet air was then replaced with
dry air and the catalyst was calcined for a further 2 h at 550 8C. The
purpose of the wet calcination was to reduce the chlorine content
of the catalyst [6]. Pt was subsequently impregnated using
H2PtCl66H2O (SigmaAldrich, 8 wt.% solution in water), and the
drying
and
calcination
were
repeated.
Finally,
the
K
was
impregnated with potassium nitrate solution (SigmaAldrich,
99% purity), and the drying and calcination were again repeated.
The catalyst was ground and sieved to a particle size of 160
250 mm.
Before the kinetic studies, the catalyst was reduced in situ in a
flow of H2:He = 1:2 during 2 h at 550 8C; reacted in C3H8:Ar = 1:1
during 30 min at 500 8C and regenerated in O2:He = 1:20 during
1 h at 500 8C. This reduction-reactionregeneration cycle was
repeated six times to obtain an aged and stable catalyst [7,8] with
BET surface area 138 m2 g1 and pore volume 0.45 ml g1.
2.2. Thermogravimetric systems
Coke formation experiments were performed in a CI Electronics
thermobalance, under several different conditions. The reactor feed
contained propane diluted in nitrogen. All the streams were mass
flow controlled (Brooks). The range of operating conditions was as
follows: temperature, 460540 8C; molar fraction of propane, 0.25
0.70; catalyst mass, 200 mg; particle size of 160250 mm; atmo-
spheric pressure and total flow rates of 300 cm3(STP) min1.
A series of previous experiments was conducted varying the
sample mass, particle size and flow rates in order to assure that no
bed depth effect or diffusional limitations were present during the
kinetic tests.
