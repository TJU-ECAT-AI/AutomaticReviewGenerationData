[1] "Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [2932]."

[2] "These two mechanisms are represented by
C3H8 3C + 4H2
(3)
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2
(4)"

[3] "The deep propane cracking Eq. (3) and the propene polymerization Eq. (4) can be assumed to be first order with respect to propane and propene. As H2 has definite influences on the coking rate, it should be included in the coking rate equation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature indicates that coke can form through multiple routes:

1. Deep cracking of propane, leading to graphitized carbon
2. Polymerization of olefins (mainly propene)
3. Condensation of large molecules, resulting in polyaromatics

The literature presents two main mechanisms for coke formation:

1. C3H8 → 3C + 4H2 (deep propane cracking)
2. nC3H6 → 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2 (propene polymerization)

The composition of coke deposits can be influenced by reaction conditions, particularly the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. The literature notes that hydrogen has a definite influence on the coking rate.

While the literature does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents, it implies that quantitative analysis of reaction products and kinetic modeling are employed to understand coke formation mechanisms and compositions.

The study focuses on developing a kinetic model that integrates coke formation and catalyst deactivation, avoiding the need for in situ measurement of coke content. This approach suggests that the researchers relied on indirect methods to study coke composition and formation, rather than direct analytical techniques for coke characterization.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成会因反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献指出，积碳可通过多种途径形成：

1. 丙烷深度裂解，导致石墨化碳的形成
2. 烯烃（主要是丙烯）的聚合
3. 大分子的缩合，形成多环芳烃

文献提出了两种主要的积碳形成机制：

1. C3H8 → 3C + 4H2（丙烷深度裂解）
2. nC3H6 → 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2（丙烯聚合）

积碳沉积物的组成可能受到反应条件的影响，特别是丙烯和氢气的分压。文献指出，氢气对积碳速率有明显影响。

虽然文献没有明确提到用于阐明积碳成分性质的具体分析技术，但暗示了通过反应产物的定量分析和动力学建模来理解积碳形成机制和组成。

该研究主要集中在开发一个整合了积碳形成和催化剂失活的动力学模型，避免了原位测量积碳含量的需要。这种方法表明，研究者更多地依赖间接方法来研究积碳组成和形成，而非直接的积碳表征分析技术。
