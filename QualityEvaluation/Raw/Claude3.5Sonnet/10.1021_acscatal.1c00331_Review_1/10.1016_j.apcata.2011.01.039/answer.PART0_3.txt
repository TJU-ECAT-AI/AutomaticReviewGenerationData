[1] "Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [2932]."

[2] "As usual, the rate of propane dehydrogenation is written as
r = ar0
(7)
where r0 is the rate on fresh catalyst, and a is the activity of the catalyst."

[3] "The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke formation and thus deactivation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature indicates that coke can form through multiple routes, including deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene), and condensation of large molecules. Two main types of coke are identified: graphitized carbon and polyaromatics.

The study suggests that propene is the main precursor for coke formation, while hydrogen suppresses coke formation and subsequent catalyst deactivation. However, the literature does not provide detailed information on specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

The kinetic model presented in the study integrates coke formation into the deactivation model, considering the effects of propene and hydrogen. This approach allows for prediction of catalyst deactivation without direct measurement of coke content, simplifying the modeling process while maintaining good predictive capability.

While the study provides insights into coke formation mechanisms and their effects on catalyst deactivation, it does not offer a comprehensive analysis of coke composition across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Further research using advanced analytical techniques would be necessary to fully elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成可能会因反应条件和催化剂类型而有所不同。文献指出，积碳可以通过多种途径形成，包括丙烷的深度裂解、烯烃（主要是丙烯）的聚合以及大分子的缩合。研究识别出两种主要类型的积碳：石墨化碳和多环芳烃。

研究表明，丙烯是积碳形成的主要前体，而氢气则抑制积碳形成和随之而来的催化剂失活。然而，文献并未提供具体的分析技术来阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。

研究中提出的动力学模型将积碳形成整合到失活模型中，考虑了丙烯和氢气的影响。这种方法允许在不直接测量积碳含量的情况下预测催化剂失活，简化了建模过程，同时保持了良好的预测能力。

虽然该研究提供了关于积碳形成机制及其对催化剂失活影响的见解，但它并未提供不同反应条件和催化剂类型下积碳组成的全面分析。需要进一步使用先进的分析技术来充分阐明PDH系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。
