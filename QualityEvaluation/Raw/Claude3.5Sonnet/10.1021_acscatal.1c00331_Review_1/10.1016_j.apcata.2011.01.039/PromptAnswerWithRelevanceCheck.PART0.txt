[1] "Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [2932]."

[2] "These two mechanisms are represented by
C3H8 3C + 4H2
(3)
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2
(4)"

[3] "The deep propane cracking Eq. (3) and the propene polymerization Eq. (4) can be assumed to be first order with respect to propane and propene. As H2 has definite influences on the coking rate, it should be included in the coking rate equation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature indicates that coke can form through multiple routes:

1. Deep cracking of propane, leading to graphitized carbon
2. Polymerization of olefins (mainly propene)
3. Condensation of large molecules, resulting in polyaromatics

The literature presents two main mechanisms for coke formation:

1. C3H8 → 3C + 4H2 (deep propane cracking)
2. nC3H6 → 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2 (propene polymerization)

The composition of coke deposits can be influenced by reaction conditions, particularly the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen. The literature notes that hydrogen has a definite influence on the coking rate.

While the literature does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents, it implies that quantitative analysis of reaction products and kinetic modeling are employed to understand coke formation mechanisms and compositions.

The study focuses on developing a kinetic model that integrates coke formation and catalyst deactivation, avoiding the need for in situ measurement of coke content. This approach suggests that the researchers relied on indirect methods to study coke composition and formation, rather than direct analytical techniques for coke characterization.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成会因反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献指出，积碳可通过多种途径形成：

1. 丙烷深度裂解，导致石墨化碳的形成
2. 烯烃（主要是丙烯）的聚合
3. 大分子的缩合，形成多环芳烃

文献提出了两种主要的积碳形成机制：

1. C3H8 → 3C + 4H2（丙烷深度裂解）
2. nC3H6 → 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2（丙烯聚合）

积碳沉积物的组成可能受到反应条件的影响，特别是丙烯和氢气的分压。文献指出，氢气对积碳速率有明显影响。

虽然文献没有明确提到用于阐明积碳成分性质的具体分析技术，但暗示了通过反应产物的定量分析和动力学建模来理解积碳形成机制和组成。

该研究主要集中在开发一个整合了积碳形成和催化剂失活的动力学模型，避免了原位测量积碳含量的需要。这种方法表明，研究者更多地依赖间接方法来研究积碳组成和形成，而非直接的积碳表征分析技术。

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on the reaction conditions and mechanisms. Two main types of coke are identified:

1. Graphitized carbon, formed by deep cracking of propane
2. Polyaromatics, formed by polymerization and condensation reactions

The relative amounts of these coke types likely depend on factors like temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition. Hydrogen appears to inhibit coke formation by promoting propene desorption and reducing surface coverage.

The document does not provide detailed information on analytical techniques used to study coke composition. However, it mentions density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate coke formation mechanisms. Other common techniques for coke analysis, though not explicitly mentioned, may include temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and various spectroscopic methods.

While the literature provides some insights into coke composition and formation mechanisms in PDH reactions, it does not offer a comprehensive overview of how coke varies across different catalysts or reaction conditions. More detailed studies would be needed to fully elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随反应条件和机制的不同而变化。主要识别出两种类型的积碳：

1. 石墨化碳，由丙烷的深度裂解形成
2. 多芳烃，由聚合和缩合反应形成

这些积碳类型的相对含量可能取决于温度、压力和催化剂组成等因素。氢气似乎通过促进丙烯脱附和减少表面覆盖来抑制积碳形成。

文献中并未提供用于研究积碳组成的详细分析技术信息。不过，它提到密度泛函理论(DFT)计算被用于研究积碳形成机制。虽然没有明确提到，但其他常用的积碳分析技术可能包括程序升温氧化(TPO)、热重分析(TGA)和各种光谱方法。

虽然该文献提供了一些关于PDH反应中积碳组成和形成机制的见解，但它并没有全面概述积碳如何在不同催化剂或反应条件下变化。需要进行更详细的研究才能充分阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。

1. Deep cracking of propane, leading to graphitized carbon
2. Polymerization and condensation of olefins (mainly propene), resulting in polyaromatics

The coke composition can be influenced by factors such as:

- Propane concentration: Higher propane concentrations may lead to more graphitized carbon from deep cracking.
- Propene concentration: Higher propene concentrations can increase polyaromatic coke formation through polymerization and condensation.
- Hydrogen concentration: Hydrogen inhibits coke formation by promoting propene desorption and decreasing surface coverage of propene.

The study does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate coke composition. However, given the complex nature of coke constituents, a combination of techniques would likely be necessary for comprehensive analysis, such as:

- Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)
- Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
- Raman spectroscopy
- X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
- Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

These techniques could provide insights into the structure, elemental composition, and morphology of coke deposits formed under different reaction conditions and on various catalyst types.

However, the literature does not provide detailed information on specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

The kinetic model presented in the study integrates coke formation into the deactivation model, considering the effects of propene and hydrogen. This approach allows for prediction of catalyst deactivation without direct measurement of coke content, simplifying the modeling process while maintaining good predictive capability.

While the study provides insights into coke formation mechanisms and their effects on catalyst deactivation, it does not offer a comprehensive analysis of coke composition across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Further research using advanced analytical techniques would be necessary to fully elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems.

研究中提出的动力学模型将积碳形成整合到失活模型中，考虑了丙烯和氢气的影响。这种方法允许在不直接测量积碳含量的情况下预测催化剂失活，简化了建模过程，同时保持了良好的预测能力。

虽然该研究提供了关于积碳形成机制及其对催化剂失活影响的见解，但它并未提供不同反应条件和催化剂类型下积碳组成的全面分析。需要进一步使用先进的分析技术来充分阐明PDH系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。
