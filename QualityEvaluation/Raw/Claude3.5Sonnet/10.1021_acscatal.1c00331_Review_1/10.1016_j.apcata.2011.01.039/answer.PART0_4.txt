[1] "Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [2932]."

[2] "These two mechanisms are represented by

C3H8 3C + 4H2 (3)

nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2 (4)"

[3] "The deep propane cracking Eq. (3) and the propene polymerization Eq. (4) can be assumed to be first order with respect to propane and propene. As H2 has definite influences on the coking rate, it should be included in the coking rate equation."

[4] "Our DFT study showed H2 inhibits coke formation mainly by promoting propene desorption and decreasing the surface coverage of propene, which lowers the rate of deep cracking or polymerization of propene."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions can vary depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature indicates that coke formation occurs through two main mechanisms:

1. Deep cracking of propane, leading to graphitized carbon
2. Polymerization and condensation of olefins (mainly propene), resulting in polyaromatics

The reaction conditions, particularly the presence of hydrogen, can influence the composition and rate of coke formation. Hydrogen has been shown to inhibit coke formation by promoting propene desorption and decreasing its surface coverage, which in turn reduces the rate of deep cracking and polymerization.

While the literature does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to study coke composition in PDH systems, it does reference DFT (Density Functional Theory) studies to investigate the influence of hydrogen on coke formation. Other common analytical techniques that are typically used to study coke deposits in catalytic systems include:

1. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO)
2. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
3. Raman Spectroscopy
4. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
5. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

These techniques can provide insights into the structure, quantity, and nature of coke deposits on catalysts under different reaction conditions.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成可能会因反应条件和催化剂类型而有所不同。文献指出，积碳形成主要通过两种机制：

1. 丙烷的深度裂解，导致石墨化碳的形成
2. 烯烃（主要是丙烯）的聚合和缩合，形成多环芳烃

反应条件，特别是氢气的存在，可以影响积碳的组成和形成速率。氢气已被证明可以抑制积碳形成，通过促进丙烯的脱附和减少其表面覆盖率，从而降低深度裂解和聚合的速率。

虽然文献没有明确提到用于研究PDH系统中积碳组成的具体分析技术，但确实提到了使用DFT（密度泛函理论）研究来调查氢气对积碳形成的影响。其他通常用于研究催化系统中积碳沉积物的常见分析技术包括：

1. 程序升温氧化（TPO）
2. 热重分析（TGA）
3. 拉曼光谱
4. X射线光电子能谱（XPS）
5. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）

这些技术可以在不同反应条件下提供关于催化剂上积碳沉积物的结构、数量和性质的见解。
