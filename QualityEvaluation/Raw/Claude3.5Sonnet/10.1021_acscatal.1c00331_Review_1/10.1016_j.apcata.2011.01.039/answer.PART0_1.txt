[1] "The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [2932]."

[2] "These two mechanisms are represented by
C3H8 3C + 4H2 (3)
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2 (4)"

[3] "Our DFT study showed H2 inhibits coke formation mainly by promoting propene desorption and decreasing the surface coverage of propene, which lowers the rate of deep cracking or polymerization of propene."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on the reaction conditions and mechanisms. Two main types of coke are identified:

1. Graphitized carbon, formed by deep cracking of propane
2. Polyaromatics, formed by polymerization and condensation reactions

The relative amounts of these coke types likely depend on factors like temperature, pressure, and catalyst composition. Hydrogen appears to inhibit coke formation by promoting propene desorption and reducing surface coverage.

The document does not provide detailed information on analytical techniques used to study coke composition. However, it mentions density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to investigate coke formation mechanisms. Other common techniques for coke analysis, though not explicitly mentioned, may include temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and various spectroscopic methods.

While the literature provides some insights into coke composition and formation mechanisms in PDH reactions, it does not offer a comprehensive overview of how coke varies across different catalysts or reaction conditions. More detailed studies would be needed to fully elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随反应条件和机制的不同而变化。主要识别出两种类型的积碳：

1. 石墨化碳，由丙烷的深度裂解形成
2. 多芳烃，由聚合和缩合反应形成

这些积碳类型的相对含量可能取决于温度、压力和催化剂组成等因素。氢气似乎通过促进丙烯脱附和减少表面覆盖来抑制积碳形成。

文献中并未提供用于研究积碳组成的详细分析技术信息。不过，它提到密度泛函理论(DFT)计算被用于研究积碳形成机制。虽然没有明确提到，但其他常用的积碳分析技术可能包括程序升温氧化(TPO)、热重分析(TGA)和各种光谱方法。

虽然该文献提供了一些关于PDH反应中积碳组成和形成机制的见解，但它并没有全面概述积碳如何在不同催化剂或反应条件下变化。需要进行更详细的研究才能充分阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。
