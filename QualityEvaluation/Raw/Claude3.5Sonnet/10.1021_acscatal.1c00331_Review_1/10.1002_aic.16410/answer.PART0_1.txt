The provided literature does not contain specific information about the composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The text focuses on modeling catalyst deactivation by coking at the particle level using a pore network model, but does not discuss the detailed chemical composition of coke or analytical techniques used to characterize it. The document assumes a simplified model of coke formation without exploring its complex constituents. Therefore, this specific question cannot be accurately answered based solely on the given literature.

提供的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭沉积物在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下的组成的具体信息。该文本主要关注使用孔隙网络模型在颗粒层面上模拟催化剂由于结焦而失活的过程,但并未讨论焦炭的详细化学组成或用于表征焦炭的分析技术。该文档假设了一个简化的焦炭形成模型,没有探讨其复杂的成分。因此,仅基于给定的文献无法准确回答这个具体问题。
