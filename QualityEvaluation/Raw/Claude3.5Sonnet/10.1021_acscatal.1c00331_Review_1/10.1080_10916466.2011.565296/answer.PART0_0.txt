The given literature does not provide any specific information about the composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents. The document focuses on modeling coke formation and catalyst deactivation, but does not discuss the chemical makeup or analysis of the coke deposits themselves. To answer this question would require additional sources that examine the chemical nature and diversity of coke formed during PDH reactions.

给定的文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积碳沉积物成分的具体信息,也没有讨论用于研究积碳成分的分析技术。该文档主要关注积碳形成和催化剂失活的建模,但没有讨论积碳沉积物本身的化学组成或分析。要回答这个问题,需要额外的资料来研究PDH反应过程中形成的积碳的化学性质和多样性。
