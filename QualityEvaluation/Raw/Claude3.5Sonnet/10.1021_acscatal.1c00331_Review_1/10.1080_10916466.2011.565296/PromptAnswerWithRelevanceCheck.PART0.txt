Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not provide any specific information about the composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents. The document focuses on modeling coke formation and catalyst deactivation, but does not discuss the chemical makeup or analysis of the coke deposits themselves. To answer this question would require additional sources that examine the chemical nature and diversity of coke formed during PDH reactions.

The given literature does not contain any information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The paper focuses on modeling coke formation and catalyst deactivation, but does not discuss the chemical nature or diversity of the coke deposits themselves. The study measured the total amount of coke deposited on the catalyst using thermogravimetric analysis, but did not characterize the composition of the coke. Therefore, this specific question cannot be answered based on the information provided in the document.
