The given literature does not provide information about the composition of coke deposits or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The paper focuses on modeling coke formation kinetics and catalyst deactivation, but does not discuss the chemical composition or analysis of the coke deposits themselves. To answer this question, additional literature sources specifically addressing coke composition analysis in PDH systems would be needed.
