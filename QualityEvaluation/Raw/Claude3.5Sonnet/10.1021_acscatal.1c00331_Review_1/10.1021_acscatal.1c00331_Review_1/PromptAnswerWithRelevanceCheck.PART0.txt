[1] "The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."

[2] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."

[3] "However, a coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts. It is suggested that the species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."

[4] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

[5] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis (22,41,42) revealed that there are two peaks when coke elimination happens, as shown in Figure 2a. One peak is around 325 C, which is related to the coke on metal, and contains more hydrogens. The other one is at higher temperature around 425 C, which is ascribed to the coke on the support."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. There is no universal definition for coke composition due to its complex formation process.

In PDH reactions using PtSn catalysts, coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. However, the composition can differ on other catalysts. For instance, on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, coke deposits may be composed of atomic carbon or aromatics, while on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, C3 species are more prevalent.

The location of coke deposition also affects its composition. Coke deposited on metal surfaces tends to contain more hydrogen and is eliminated at lower temperatures (around 325°C), while coke on the support is removed at higher temperatures (around 425°C).

Several analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These include:

1. Gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
2. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
3. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis
4. Coke hydrogenation studies

These techniques have helped researchers to identify the various components of coke deposits and understand how they differ across different catalytic systems and reaction conditions.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著差异。由于积碳形成过程的复杂性，目前还没有一个统一的积碳组成定义。

在使用PtSn催化剂的PDH反应中，积碳主要由三种类型的物质组成：脂肪族、芳香族和类石墨。然而，在其他催化剂上，积碳的组成可能会有所不同。例如，在Pt/Al2O3催化剂上，积碳沉积物可能由原子碳或芳香族化合物组成，而在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上，C3物种则更为普遍。

积碳沉积的位置也会影响其组成。沉积在金属表面的积碳通常含有更多的氢，并且在较低的温度（约325°C）下被消除，而沉积在载体上的积碳则需要在较高的温度（约425°C）下才能被去除。

研究人员使用了几种分析技术来阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性和多样性。这些技术包括：

1. 气相色谱-质谱联用（GC-MS）
2. 热重（TG）分析
3. 程序升温氧化（TPO）分析
4. 积碳加氢研究

这些技术帮助研究人员识别了积碳沉积物的各种成分，并了解它们在不同催化系统和反应条件下的差异。
