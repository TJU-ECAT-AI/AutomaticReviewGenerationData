[1] "The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."

[2] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."

[3] "However, a coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts. It is suggested that the species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."

[4] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

[5] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis (22,41,42) revealed that there are two peaks when coke elimination happens, as shown in Figure 2a. One peak is around 325 C, which is related to the coke on metal, and contains more hydrogens. The other one is at higher temperature around 425 C, which is ascribed to the coke on the support."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. There is no universal definition for coke composition due to its complex formation process.

In PDH reactions using PtSn catalysts, coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. However, the composition can differ on other catalysts. For instance, on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, coke deposits may consist of atomic carbon or aromatics, while on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, C3 species are more prevalent.

Several analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems:

1. Gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
2. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
3. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis

TPO analysis, in particular, has revealed that coke deposits can be categorized based on their location on the catalyst. Coke on metal surfaces contains more hydrogen and is eliminated at lower temperatures (around 325°C), while coke on the support is removed at higher temperatures (around 425°C).

These analytical techniques have helped researchers gain insights into the varying compositions of coke deposits, but the complexity of coke formation continues to challenge efforts to develop a comprehensive understanding of its constituents across all catalytic systems and reaction conditions.

催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，随着不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而显著变化。由于焦炭形成过程的复杂性，目前还没有一个统一的焦炭组成定义。

在使用PtSn催化剂的PDH反应中，焦炭主要由三种类型的物质组成：脂肪族化合物、芳香族化合物和类石墨。然而，在其他催化剂上，焦炭的组成可能有所不同。例如，在Pt/Al2O3催化剂上，焦炭沉积物可能由原子碳或芳香族化合物组成，而在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上，C3物种更为普遍。

研究人员采用了几种分析技术来阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性：

1. 气相色谱-质谱联用技术（GC-MS）
2. 热重（TG）分析
3. 程序升温氧化（TPO）分析

特别是TPO分析揭示了焦炭沉积物可以根据其在催化剂上的位置进行分类。金属表面上的焦炭含有更多的氢，在较低的温度（约325°C）下被清除，而载体上的焦炭在较高的温度（约425°C）下被清除。

这些分析技术帮助研究人员深入了解了焦炭沉积物的不同组成，但焦炭形成的复杂性仍然给全面理解所有催化系统和反应条件下的焦炭成分带来了挑战。
