[1] "The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."

[2] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."

[3] "However, a coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts. It is suggested that the species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."

[4] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. There is no universal definition for coke composition due to its complex formation process.

For PDH on PtSn catalysts, studies using gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis have identified three main species of coke: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. However, the composition can differ depending on the catalyst used. For instance, on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, coke deposits may consist of atomic carbon or aromatics, while on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, C3 species have been observed.

Various analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These include:

1. Gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
2. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
3. Coke hydrogenation studies

These techniques have helped researchers to identify and characterize the different species present in coke deposits, providing insights into their composition and formation mechanisms. However, due to the complexity and variability of coke formation, a complete understanding of its composition remains a challenge in the field of catalysis.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著的变化。由于积碳形成过程的复杂性，目前还没有对其组成的统一定义。

对于PtSn催化剂上的PDH反应，使用气相色谱-质谱联用（GC-MS）和热重分析（TG）的研究已经确定了三种主要的积碳类型：脂肪族、芳香族和类石墨。然而，积碳的组成会因使用的催化剂不同而有所不同。例如，在Pt/Al2O3催化剂上，积碳沉积物可能由原子碳或芳香族化合物组成，而在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上，则观察到C3物种。

研究人员采用了多种分析技术来阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。这些技术包括：

1. 气相色谱-质谱联用（GC-MS）
2. 热重（TG）分析
3. 积碳加氢研究

这些技术帮助研究人员识别和表征了积碳沉积物中存在的不同物种，提供了关于其组成和形成机制的见解。然而，由于积碳形成的复杂性和可变性，在催化领域中，对其组成的完整理解仍然是一个挑战。
