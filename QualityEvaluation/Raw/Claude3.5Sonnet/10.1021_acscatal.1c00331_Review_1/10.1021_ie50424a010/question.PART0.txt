IN 
CATALYTIC CRACKING, both fixed-bed and fluid, 
It has been found that there i
s
 an intrinsic uniformity in 
the way the carbon deposlt on the catalyst increases with 
the time elapsed since the oatalyst was last regenerated. 
For all the data examined, the 
amount of carbon deposited 
on the catalyst at given conditions is, within limits, inde- 
pendent of the hydrocarbon feed rate. From this study, 
correlations are derived that define mathematically the 
interdependence between feed stock conversion, feed rate, 
and length of period between catalyst regenerations. 
A 
speculative hypothesls is advanced as a possible sxplana- 
tion of the mechanism of carbon formation.

HEN petroleum hydrocarbons undergo deep-seated reac- 
tions in the presence o
f
 solid catalysts, carbonaceous de- 
posits usually accumulate on the catalyst and decrease its 
W 
activity, so that periodic regeneration is necessary. A 
conspicuous exception is the case of high-pressure catalytic 
hydrogenation where the catalyst retains its activity for pe- 
riods up to a year and longer without any regeneration (2). Ex- 
amples of regenerative processes are (a) catalytic cracking of gas 
oils and (b) catalytic reforming of naphthas. This paper presents 
a discussion o
f
 certain aspects of the formation of carbonaceous 
deposits in catalytic cracking. 
The carbonaceous deposit that is an inevitable by-product o
f
 
catalytic cracking is called coke, and is generally determined 
as the weight per cent of carbon on feed or on catalyst. Some of 
the factors influencing carbon formation in catalytic cracking 
have been discussed (1, 
3
)
.
 This catalytic coke is apparently a 
hydrocarbon of relatively lonr hydrogen content, which may vary 
in accordance with feed stock or operating conditions. A formula 
of (C8HI) has been reported (4). 
The carbonaceous deposit also 
contains sulfur derived from the feed stock. However, the pres- 
ent discussion is concerned not with the hydrogen or sulfur con- 
tent of catalytic coke but solely with the measured amount of car- 
bon in the deposit. 
Although the extent of carbon formation in catalytic cracking 
depends on the type o
f
 catalyst, the feed stock, and the operating 
conditions, it has been found that there is an intrinsic uniformity 
in the way the carbon deposit on the catalyst increases with time. 
Certain generalized correlations of striking simplicity and con- 
siderable utility have resulted from a study of such data. AS 
this paper will show, the usefulness o
f
 the relations developed ex- 
tends beyond the field of carbon yields to include an equation de- 
fining the interdependence among feed stock conversion, feed 
rate, and length of period between catalyst regenerations. The 
generalizations and derived relations apply equally to fluid and 
fixed-bed cracking. The results reported here were obtained in 
equipment ranging from laboratory size to semiplant scale. The 
correlations derived have been applied to the commercial-scale 
units. 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The ordinary feed stock in catalytic cracking is a petroleum gas 
oil, the mwt volatile fractions of which have a higher boiling 
point than the back end of the gasoline produced. Thus, for avi- 
stion gasoline production, the initial boiling point of the feed 
stock will generally be above 300 F.; for motor gasoline, above 
318 
400 F. Although commercial catalytic cracking unit,s today 
are employed for aviation rather t,han motor gasoline production, 
it is still convenient to refer to the feed stock conversion on the 
bssis of production of motor gasoline. For simplicity, the prod- 
ucts of catalytic cracking are often designated as follows: 
Feed Stook 
Per Cent of 
Feed by: 
Gas (CS and lighter)

Total C4 
Volume 
Aviation gasoline 
Volume 
Heavy naphtha 
Volume 
Cycle gas oil 400 F. initial b.p.) 
Volume 
Carbon (or coke) 
Weight 
In this system the feed stock conversion is arbitrarily taken as 
100 minus volume % cycle gas oil (400 F. i.b.p.). It is realized 
that this expression is not an exact measure of feed stock destruc- 
tion. However, it furnishes a convenient means for correlat- 
ing the yields of the various products. This definition of feed 
stock conversion is employed in this paper. 
In catalytic cracking, either fluid or fixed-bed, the 
extent of con- 
version is determined by such factors as 
catalyst, feed stock, tem- 
perature, pressure, feed rate, and length of time between catalyst 
regenerations (here called catalyst residence time) 
 
In fixed- 
bed cracking the conversion measured is the summation of the 
instantaneous conversions throughout the process period, the in- 
stantaneous conyereions decreasing with time on stream as the 
catalyst becomes fouled with coke. Fluid catalytic cracking dif- 
fers from fixed-bed as follows: 
1. Catalyst is currently regenerated in a separate vessel, so 
that feed stock and freshly regenerated catalyst are continuously 
brought together in the reactor. 
2. As a result o
f
 the above, a uniform conversion is main- 
tained, rather than a continuously decreasing conversion as in 
the process cycle of fixed-bed cracking. 
3. The catalyst residence time in fluid cracking is generally 
much shorter than the length of time between regenerations in 
fixed-bed work. 
In either fluid or fixed-bed cracking, conversion increases with 
increasing temperature, decreasing feed rate, and decreasing cata- 
lyst residence time. The effect of increasing pressure, at least up 
to about 50 pounds per square inch gage, is to increase conver- 
sion, However, pressure w
a
s
 
not a variable in the data presented 
here because substantially atmospheric pressure was 
employed. 
In fluid cracking the feed rate is generally expressed as weight 
of feed per hour per weight of catalyst held in the reactor or 
w/hr./w. 
Another term employed in fluid cracking i
s

lyst-to-oil ratio, which is the ratio of the weight rates of flow of 
catalyst and oil. The catalyst residence time in the reactor is 
related to the w/hr./w and catalyst/oil ratio as follows: 
1 
(w/hr./w) (catalyst residence time, min.) - - 
- 
60 
catalyst/oil ratio 
or 
W = 60/Zd 
In fixed-bed cracking the feed rate is usually defined as volumes of 
feed per volume of catalyst per hour, or v/v/hr. 
The re- 
lation between w/hr./w and v/v/hr. is: 
( density of feed 
wv/hr*/w 
= (v/v/hr.) 
density of catalyst 
or 
W = U*D,/D, 
At a given temperature the depth of catalytic cracking, as 
measured by conversion, determines the quality and yields of 
the various products. Thus the yields of gm and carbon invari- 
ably increase with increasing conversion. At a given conversion 
level, the quality and yields of the various products depend 
on the temperature, but are virtually independent of relative feed 
rate and catalyst residence time. Thus whether a given con- 
version is obtained by a high feed rate and a short residence time 
or vice versa, the yields of carbon and other products are sub- 
stantially unaffected. The relation between carbon on feed and 
conversion is especially important. This carbon yield refers 
to catalytic carbon produced in the reaction and does not in- 
clude the so-called strippable carbon, which represents adsorbed 
and interspersed hydrocarbon gas and liquid remaining with 
the spent catalyst after the cracking has been accomplished. 
It is common practice to purge off most of the strippable carbon

Catalytic Cracking Units a t  the Baton Rouge Refinery 
before the catalyst is regenerated. For the cracking operations 
reported here, this increment of carbon yield was negligible com- 
pared to catalytic carbon. 
Although, as mentioned above, the yield of carbon on feed 
stock at a given temperature is a function of conversion, there is 
also a well-defined relation between the weight per cent o
f
 carbon 
on catalyst and the catalyst residence time. Important deduc- 
tions are derivable from the following relations: 
Wt. % carbon based on feed = function of feed conversion 
Wt. % carbon on catalyst = function of catalyst residence time 
Data in fixed-bed and in fluid catalytic cracking are treated sep- 
arately. 
CARBON FORMATION I N  FIXED-BED CRACKING 
A considerable amount of data shows that the weight per cent 
carbon formed on the catalyst is approximately a logarithmic 
function of the length of time elasped since the catalyst was 
freshly regenerated. For a given catalyst, feed stock, and tem- 
perature, the equation takes the form: 
C, = A$" 
Two examples of this relationship are discussed. 
Example 1 
is shown graphically in Figure 1, 
which depicts the 
relation between carbon on catalyst and residence time of cata- 
lyst for a West Texas gas oil and anatural (activated clay) crack- 
ing catalyst at 850' F. The experiments were conducted in a 
small fixed-bed unit. Each point on the plot represents a run, 
either on a fresh batch of catalyst or on one that had very few 
regenerations. In other words, the level of initial catalyst ac- 
tivity represented by the data was substantially constant. 
After the process period had lasted for the time indicated in 
Figure 1, the catalyst was purged to remove strippable carbon. 
Then the catalyst was discharged from the unit, and the carbon 
on it was determined by combustion of a representative sample. 
The cracking period lengths included much shorter residence 
times than are normally employed in fixed-bed cracking, because 
the experiments were designed to furnish fundamental informa- 
tion. The correlating line on the graph is represented by the 
equation : 
C, = 0.86 80."

A second example, also portrayed in Figure 1
,
 shows the rela- 
tion between carbon on catalyst and residence time for an East 
Texas gas oil and R synthetic (silica-alumina) catalyst at 850" F. 
The results were obtained in small fixed-bed units, on which a 
study was being made of the effect of feed rate (v/v/hr.) and 
length of process period (8). The synthetic catalyst was of such . 
inherent stability that its activity was completely restored after 
each successive regeneration. Hence the entire study was made 
on one batch of catalyst. After each process period the catalyst 
was purged and then regenerated in situ by air oxidation. The 
carbon formation was determined by measuring and analyzing 
the regeneration gases. Although the accuracy of these de- 
terminations was not of a particularly high order, a fairly good 
correlation was obtained between carbon on catalyst and 
residence time, represented by the following 
equation: 
c, = 0.65 w
r
 
(2) 
In the example just discussed for East Texas gas oil and syn- 
thetic catalyst, the implicit assumption is made that, within lim- 
its, the feed rate has no effect on the extent of carbon formation 
on catalyst for a given residence time. Although this may appear 
strange at first, there is a large amount of supporting evidence, 
some of which follows. 
A rather extensive series of runs was made on a small-scale 
fixed-bed unit on an East Texas gas oil, both with natural and 
with synthetic catalyst, to determine the effect of feed rate on 
carbon formation at cracking temperatures from 800' to 950" F.

It will be noted that, as the feed rate increases at a given temper- 
ature, the weight per cent carbon on feed decreases as might be 
expected, but the weight per cent carbon on catalyst remains sub- 
stantially constant.

Carbon Formation vs. Cracking 
Temperature for 2-Hour Cracking Periods 
Another example of the constancy of carbon formation on cata- 
lyst for a given residence time, regardless 
of feed 
rate, is furnished 
by data obtained on catalytic cracking of pure compounds. Both 
cetane and Decalin were cracked with natural catalyst in a small 
unit at 850" F. for a process period of 2 hours and at feed rates 
varying from 0.6 to 2.4 v/v/hr. After each period the catalyst 
was removed for carbon determination by combustion and was 
replaced by a fresh charge. The data are presented in Table 11. 
Here again it is evident that the weight per cent carbon on cata- 
lyst is relatively independent of feed 
rate. 
A practical demonstration that per cent carbon on catalyst 
is virtually unaffected by feed rate was furnished some years ago 
in the operation of a semiplant-scale, fixed-bed catalytic cracking 
unit. In each reactor there were four catalyst beds of equal 
height, vertically disposed one above the other. During the 
process period the flow o
f
 oil vapors was through the four beds in 
series. During regeneration, the flow of gases was through the 
four beds in parallel in order to 
minimize 
pressure drop. The indi- 
vidual temperature records for each bed during regeneration indi- 
cated that about the same amount of carbon was burned from 
each bed. This is equivalent to saying that the carbon on catalyst 
was independent of feed rate, because the feed-space-velocity 
(v/v/hr.) in the case of the first bed was four times that for the 
total reactor. 
Much thought and speculation have been directed to answering 
the question as to why carbon on catalyst for a given residence 
time should be relatively independent of feed rate. The charac- 
teristics of the hydrocarbons in contact with the catalyst are 
continually changing as the feed stock progresses through the 
catalyst bed, and also different feed stocks differ in their carbon- 
forming 
tendencies. However, consider 
what happens as the feed 
stock passes through the bed of catalyst. It is converted to an 
increasing extent into (a) gasoline and gas which have less tend- 
ency to carbonize than the original feed and ( b )  cycle gas oil 
which has more tendency to carbonize than the original feed. 
To the degree that these two tendencies balance each other, the 
extent o
f
 carbon formation on catalyst will not differ at any level 
in the catalyst bed at any given time; this means that carbon on 
catalyst is independent of feed rate within limits. This phe- 
nomenon is thus ascribed to a fortuitous balance between the 
carbonizing 
tendencies of the unconverted feed and the total prod- 
ucts of reaction. It is not proved or claimed that this obscrva- 
tion will hold for all feed stocks, all catalysts, or an extreme vari- 
ation in feed rates. In 
fact it seems remarkable that the general- 
ization holds as broadly as indicated by the results presented in 
this paper. 
The data in Table I permit a study of the effect 
of temperature 
on carbon formation. Figure 2 shows how carbon formation on 
catalyst increases with cracking temperature. The correlation 15 
rather good, and indicates that the carbon formation doubl(>>

As indicated earlier, there is generally a good correlatioii be- 
tween feed stock conversion and carbon yield based on feed for a 
given catalyst, feed stock, and temperature. As an examplc, tlrw 
data obtained in a fixed-bed study on East Texas gas oil and iyii- 
thetic catalyst at 850' and at various feed rates and cracking pe- 
riods are portrayed in Figure 3. The runs involved are the same 
as those already discussed in connection with Figure 1. Figure 
3 shows a fairly good linear correlation on log-log paper betn ecn 
conversion and carbon yield on feed. The one point conaidrr-

ably off the line, at about 36% conversion, 
may represent a faulty 
determination of conversion as discussed later. At this juncture 
it may be mentioned that numerous other data are available on 
other feeds, on other catalysts, and at other temperatures, which 
show that the logarithm of the conversion 
is approximately linear 
with the logarithm of the carbon yield (log-log), or that the con- 
version is linear with the logarithm of the carbon yield (semilog). 
The graph in Figure 3 is represented by the equation:

It is interesting to consider simultaneously Equations 2 and 3, 
which refer to the same cracking runs. Since the carbon on cata- 
lyst is a logarithmic function of length of process period inde- 
pendently of feed rate, and since the carbon yield based on feed 
is a logarithmic function of conversion regardless of feed rate or 
cracking period length, certain significant deductions are possible. 
Specifically, an equation is developed below to show the inter- 
relation of conversion, feed rate, and length of cracking period:

A graphical solution of Equation 5 is given in Figure 4

for the point at about 36% conversion, in which case the pre-

 there had been an error in the 
determined conversion for this period, and if the predicted value 
were actually correct, the correlation shown in Figure 3 would 
also be considerably 
improved, as pointed out earlier. 
The significance of the correlation among conversion, feed 
rate, and length of cracking period deserves further mention. 
First, it is possible from a relatively few runs, with accurate car- 
bon determinations, to establish a good mathematical relation

Feed Conversion for

showing the relative effect of feed rate and length of process pe-

able to linear graphical representation or to simple nomographic 
treatment, with a fair amount of extrapolation permissible beyond 
the actual confines of the data. 
CARBON FORMATION IN FLUID CRACKING 
Some of the differences between fluid and fixed-bed catalytic 
cracking have already been mentioned. However, the similarities 
far outweigh the differences; and it has been found that the 
same generalizations with respect to carbon formation] developed 
for fixed-bed cracking, are equally applicable to fluid operation. 
An extensive study was made in fluid catalyst cracking on a 
semiplant scale both on natural catalyst and on synthetic. A 
number of different types of reactors were employed, many feed 
stocks were studied, and a wide range of operating conditions 
was covered. Two particular studies have been chosen to illus- 
trate the relation between carbon formation on catalyst and resi- 
dence time of catalyst. The first case is for an East Texas gas 
oil 
with natural catalyst at a cracking temperature of 900-925' F. 
The second is for a Tinsley gas oil with synthetic catalyst at 
950'. 
In both cases the catalyst was continuously regenerated to a low 
residual carbon content, and good stripping of spent catalyst was 
obtained. The carbon formation thus represents substantially 
catalytic carbon only. The weight per cent carbon formed on 
catalyst is the difference in carbon content between spent and 
regenerated catalyst. Although samples of spent and regenerated 
catalysts are regularly withdrawn from fluid units for carbon 
determination by combustion, the absolute value of the carbon 
content even on spent catalyst is ordinarily so small that erratic 
results sometimes occur. A more reliable determination of the 
weight per cent carbon formed on the catalyst is obtained by di- 
viding the weight of carbon 
burned in the regenerator in unit time 
by the weightrate 
of catalyst flow. This is the procedure regu- 
larly employed. The rate o
f
 carbon burning is determined from 
the quantity and analysis of the regeneration vent gas; and the 
rate of catalyst flow is determined by Venturi or other special 
meters. The catalyst residence time in the fluid cracking reactors 
is determined from the average catalyst concentration and the 
catalyst flow rate. The catalyst concentration is calculated by 
pressure drop measurements across 
various levels 
in the reactor. 
The relation between carbon formation on catalyst and red- 
dence time of catalyst is illustrated in Figure 5, which also in- 
cludes the previous correlations from ked-bed cracking given in

Figure 5. Carbon Formation VJ. Cracking Time in Fluid 
Catalytic Cracklng Compared to Fixed-Bed Cracking 
lyst at 900-930" F. (Figure 5) was conducted in three reactors of 
different shape factors, employed in a special investigation of re- 
actor type. The various points represent data at approximately 
the same level of catalyst activity. No difference is indicated for 
the various reactors. The equation for the correlating line is: 
C, = 0.52 
(6) 
In the case of the Tinslcy gas oil with synthetic catalyst at 
950" F., 
the points in 
Figure 5 were corrected to a common activity 
level, The 
correlating line is represented by the equation: 
C, = 0.24 O0.G3 
(7) 
In fluid catalyst cracking, as in fixed-bed, the carbon yield 
based on feed is a function of feed stock conversion. Hence it is 
possible to derive the same kind of equations relating conversion 
with feed rate (w/hr./w) and catalyst residence time or catalyst 
to oil ratio. Such equations have been used to construct graphi- 
cal correlations that predict with satisfactory accuracy the con- 
versions obtained at various feed rates (w/hr./w) and catalyst 
residence times or catalyst to oil ratios. These correlations have 
been particularly valuable in the analysis of data from the com- 
mercial units. 
RELATION BETWEEN 
CARBON FORMATION 
AND RESIDENCETIME 
The very small temperature coefficient of carbon formation 
(Figure 2) is indicative of a'diffusion control, and since the rate 
of carbonization drops off as the percentage of carbon on the 
cata- 
lyst increases, it is reasonable to postulate that the coke itself is 
the diffusion barrier. Indeed, if it is assumed that the rate of dif- 
fusion is inversely proportional to the weight per cent of carbon, 
then 
dC, 
K

C, 
or 
C, = A@6

- = -  
It is of interest to compare Equation 8 with the four correlation 
equations depicted in Figure 5, two for fixed-bed cracking and 
two for fluid: 
c, = 0.86: 00.41 
(I) 
C, = 0.65 
(2) 
C, = 0.52 
(6) 
C, = 0.24 
e o 6 3  (7) 
The exponents of % are all close enough to 0.5 to suggest a good 
concordance with the theory advanced above. 
Just how the coke constitutes a diffusion barrier is not entirely 
olrar, since the large specific surfacps of cracking catalysts require 
a large coke deposition to form even a monomolecular layer. 
Possibly the coke accumulates about active centers on the surface 
causing an effective diffusion choke while most of the surface is 
still bare.
