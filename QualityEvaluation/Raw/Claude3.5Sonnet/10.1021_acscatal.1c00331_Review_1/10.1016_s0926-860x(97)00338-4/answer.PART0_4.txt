[1] "TPO results show that the addition of Sn improves the resistance of the K-L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts to the formation of coke during reaction at 873 K"

[2] "It has been shown that the lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support"

[3] "The presence of Sn decreases the size of the surface Pt ensembles so that the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds. Because the adsorbed species is attached less strongly to the metal surface, it is more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

[4] "Barbier [28] has shown that the addition of K to alumina catalysts decreases the peak temperature in the TPO spectrum by 100 K, indicating that the carbon formed on the K-modied surface is more weakly bound."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH:

1. The addition of Sn to K-L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts improves resistance to coke formation at high temperatures (873 K).

2. The location of coke deposits differs: carbon on Pt corresponds to lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra, while carbon on the support corresponds to higher temperature peaks.

3. Sn addition decreases Pt surface ensemble size, leading to weaker hydrocarbon adsorption and easier migration of carbonaceous species to the support.

4. K addition to catalysts results in more weakly bound carbon, as evidenced by lower TPO peak temperatures.

The main analytical technique mentioned for studying coke deposits is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). This method can differentiate between types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures. Other techniques mentioned in the study include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and chemisorption measurements, which provide information about particle size and metal surface area, respectively.

While the document doesn't specifically address the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, it does highlight how different catalyst compositions affect coke formation and distribution, suggesting that coke composition can vary significantly based on catalyst type and reaction conditions.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献讨论了异丁烷脱氢，这与PDH相似：

1. 在K-L沸石负载的Pt催化剂中添加Sn可以提高其在高温(873 K)下抗积碳形成的能力。

2. 积碳沉积的位置不同：Pt上的碳对应于TPO谱图中的低温峰，而载体上的碳对应于高温峰。

3. 添加Sn减小了Pt表面集合体的尺寸，导致碳氢化合物吸附更弱，碳质物种更容易迁移到载体上。

4. 向催化剂中添加K会导致碳结合更弱，这从TPO峰温度降低可以看出。

文中提到的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。这种方法可以根据氧化温度区分不同类型的积碳。研究中还提到了其他技术，如透射电子显微镜(TEM)和化学吸附测量，它们分别提供了有关粒子大小和金属表面积的信息。

虽然文档没有具体讨论积碳组分的复杂性和多样性，但它确实强调了不同的催化剂组成如何影响积碳的形成和分布，这表明积碳组成可能会根据催化剂类型和反应条件而显著变化。
