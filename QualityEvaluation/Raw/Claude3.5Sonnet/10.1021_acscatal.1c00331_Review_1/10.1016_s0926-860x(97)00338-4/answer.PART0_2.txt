[1] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy, and chemisorption measurements were used to study silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation"

[2] "The TPO spectrum of the Pt/silica catalyst has peaks at 710 and 790 K, while the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/silica catalyst displays broad peaks at 690, 760 and 820 K. The spectra of Pt/K-L and 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L have peaks near 680 and 780 K"

[3] "It has been shown that the lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support"

[4] "Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n-butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in dehydrogenation reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study primarily focused on isobutane dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, but the principles can be applied to similar systems.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). This technique revealed different peak temperatures for coke oxidation, indicating varying types of carbonaceous deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally corresponded to carbon on the metal (Pt), while higher temperature peaks were associated with carbon on the support.

The composition of coke deposits was influenced by catalyst composition. For example, the addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. This suggests that Sn alters the nature and location of coke formation.

Different catalyst supports also affected coke composition. Silica-supported and L-zeolite-supported catalysts showed different TPO peak patterns, indicating variations in coke types and locations.

Other techniques used to study the catalysts and potentially provide insights into coke formation included transmission electron microscopy and chemisorption measurements. These techniques could provide information on particle size and dispersion, which may indirectly influence coke formation and composition.

While the study doesn't provide a detailed molecular characterization of coke constituents, it demonstrates that coke composition and location vary significantly with catalyst composition and support type. This variation is likely due to differences in how different catalyst formulations interact with hydrocarbon species during the dehydrogenation reaction.

催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成，特别是在脱氢反应中，随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。这项研究主要集中在异丁烷脱氢而非丙烷脱氢，但其原理可以应用于类似的系统。

用于阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。这种技术揭示了焦炭氧化的不同峰值温度，表明存在不同类型的碳质沉积物。较低温度的峰值通常对应于金属（Pt）上的碳，而较高温度的峰值则与载体上的碳有关。

焦炭沉积物的组成受催化剂组成的影响。例如，向Pt催化剂中添加Sn降低了沉积在金属上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。这表明Sn改变了焦炭形成的性质和位置。

不同的催化剂载体也影响焦炭组成。硅胶负载和L型分子筛负载的催化剂显示出不同的TPO峰型，表明焦炭类型和位置存在差异。

用于研究催化剂并可能提供焦炭形成洞察的其他技术包括透射电子显微镜和化学吸附测量。这些技术可以提供关于粒子大小和分散度的信息，这可能间接影响焦炭的形成和组成。

虽然该研究没有提供焦炭成分的详细分子表征，但它表明焦炭的组成和位置随催化剂组成和载体类型的不同而显著变化。这种变化可能是由于不同的催化剂配方在脱氢反应过程中与烃类物质的相互作用方式不同造成的。
