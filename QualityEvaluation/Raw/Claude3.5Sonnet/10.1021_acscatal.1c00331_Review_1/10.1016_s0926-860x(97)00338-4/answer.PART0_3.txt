[1] "Fig. 9 shows the TPO spectra for the catalysts after 4 h reaction at 798 K in isobutane. The TPO spectrum of the Pt/silica catalyst has peaks at 710 and 790 K, while the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/silica catalyst displays broad peaks at 690, 760 and 820 K. The spectra of Pt/K-L and 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L have peaks near 680 and 780 K, while 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/silica has a peak around 680 K."

[2] "It has been shown that the lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support [14,16,2325]."

[3] "Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n-butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited."

[4] "It has been suggested that Sn transports coke from the active sites to the support on Pt/Sn/alumina catalysts [14,26,27]."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH.

The coke composition differs between catalysts with and without additives like Sn and K. For Pt/silica catalysts, coke forms both on Pt sites and the support. Adding Sn decreases the ratio of carbon on metal sites to total carbon deposited. 

The location of coke (on metal or support) can be determined by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). Lower temperature TPO peaks correspond to carbon on Pt, while higher temperature peaks indicate carbon on the support. Different catalysts show distinct TPO peak patterns, reflecting variations in coke composition and location.

Reaction conditions also affect coke composition. The presence of hydrogen during reaction can impact coke formation and distribution.

Analytical techniques employed to study coke include TPO, which provides information about coke quantity and location. Other mentioned techniques are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for observing particle sizes, and chemisorption measurements for determining the number of active sites before and after coking.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献讨论了异丁烷脱氢，这与PDH类似。

有无添加剂(如Sn和K)的催化剂之间，积碳组成存在差异。对于Pt/二氧化硅催化剂，积碳既形成在Pt位点上，也形成在载体上。添加Sn会降低金属位点上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。

通过程序升温氧化(TPO)可以确定积碳的位置(在金属上或载体上)。较低温度的TPO峰对应于Pt上的碳，而较高温度的峰表示载体上的碳。不同的催化剂显示出不同的TPO峰模式，反映了积碳组成和位置的变化。

反应条件也会影响积碳组成。反应过程中氢气的存在会影响积碳的形成和分布。

用于研究积碳的分析技术包括TPO，它提供了关于积碳数量和位置的信息。其他提到的技术包括透射电子显微镜(TEM)用于观察颗粒大小，以及化学吸附测量用于确定积碳前后的活性位点数量。
