The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH.

Reaction conditions affect coke formation. Higher levels of coke were observed after reaction without hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction with hydrogen at 873 K. This suggests that the presence of hydrogen and higher temperatures can influence coke composition and quantity.

Catalyst composition also impacts coke deposits. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. This indicates that catalyst additives can alter the distribution and possibly the composition of coke.

The main analytical technique discussed for elucidating coke composition is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO spectra reveal information about the location and nature of carbon deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while higher temperature peaks indicate carbon on the support. 

Different catalyst types show varied TPO profiles, suggesting differences in coke composition and location. For example, Pt/silica showed peaks at 710 and 790 K, while Pt/Sn/silica had broader peaks at 690, 760, and 820 K. Zeolite-supported catalysts (Pt/K-L and Pt/Sn/K-L) exhibited peaks near 680 and 780 K.

While the document doesn't provide detailed information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, it demonstrates that TPO is a valuable technique for characterizing coke deposits across different catalytic systems and reaction conditions.

催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中会因反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献讨论了异丁烷脱氢，这与PDH类似。

反应条件影响焦炭形成。在798 K下无氢反应后观察到的焦炭水平高于873 K下有氢反应。这表明氢的存在和较高的温度可以影响焦炭的组成和数量。

催化剂组成也影响焦炭沉积。向Pt催化剂中添加Sn降低了沉积在金属上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。这表明催化剂添加剂可以改变焦炭的分布，可能还会改变其组成。

文中讨论的主要分析焦炭组成的技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。TPO谱图揭示了有关碳沉积位置和性质的信息。较低温度的峰通常对应于Pt上的碳，而较高温度的峰表示载体上的碳。

不同类型的催化剂显示不同的TPO谱图，表明焦炭组成和位置存在差异。例如，Pt/二氧化硅在710和790 K处显示峰值，而Pt/Sn/二氧化硅在690、760和820 K处有更宽的峰。沸石载体的催化剂(Pt/K-L和Pt/Sn/K-L)在680和780 K附近出现峰值。

虽然文档没有提供关于焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的详细信息，但它表明TPO是一种有价值的技术，可用于表征不同催化系统和反应条件下的焦炭沉积物。
