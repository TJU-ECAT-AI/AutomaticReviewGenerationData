The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH.

Reaction conditions affect coke formation. Higher levels of coke were observed after reaction without hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction with hydrogen at 873 K. This suggests that the presence of hydrogen and higher temperatures can influence coke composition and quantity.

Catalyst composition also impacts coke deposits. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. This indicates that catalyst additives can alter the distribution and possibly the composition of coke.

The main analytical technique discussed for elucidating coke composition is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO spectra reveal information about the location and nature of carbon deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while higher temperature peaks indicate carbon on the support. 

Different catalyst types show varied TPO profiles, suggesting differences in coke composition and location. For example, Pt/silica showed peaks at 710 and 790 K, while Pt/Sn/silica had broader peaks at 690, 760, and 820 K. Zeolite-supported catalysts (Pt/K-L and Pt/Sn/K-L) exhibited peaks near 680 and 780 K.

While the document doesn't provide detailed information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, it demonstrates that TPO is a valuable technique for characterizing coke deposits across different catalytic systems and reaction conditions.

催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中会因反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献讨论了异丁烷脱氢，这与PDH类似。

反应条件影响焦炭形成。在798 K下无氢反应后观察到的焦炭水平高于873 K下有氢反应。这表明氢的存在和较高的温度可以影响焦炭的组成和数量。

催化剂组成也影响焦炭沉积。向Pt催化剂中添加Sn降低了沉积在金属上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。这表明催化剂添加剂可以改变焦炭的分布，可能还会改变其组成。

文中讨论的主要分析焦炭组成的技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。TPO谱图揭示了有关碳沉积位置和性质的信息。较低温度的峰通常对应于Pt上的碳，而较高温度的峰表示载体上的碳。

不同类型的催化剂显示不同的TPO谱图，表明焦炭组成和位置存在差异。例如，Pt/二氧化硅在710和790 K处显示峰值，而Pt/Sn/二氧化硅在690、760和820 K处有更宽的峰。沸石载体的催化剂(Pt/K-L和Pt/Sn/K-L)在680和780 K附近出现峰值。

虽然文档没有提供关于焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的详细信息，但它表明TPO是一种有价值的技术，可用于表征不同催化系统和反应条件下的焦炭沉积物。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in dehydrogenation reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study primarily focused on isobutane dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, but the principles can be applied to similar systems.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). This technique revealed different peak temperatures for coke oxidation, indicating varying types of carbonaceous deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally corresponded to carbon on the metal (Pt), while higher temperature peaks were associated with carbon on the support.

The composition of coke deposits was influenced by catalyst composition. For example, the addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. This suggests that Sn alters the nature and location of coke formation.

Different catalyst supports also affected coke composition. Silica-supported and L-zeolite-supported catalysts showed different TPO peak patterns, indicating variations in coke types and locations.

Other techniques used to study the catalysts and potentially provide insights into coke formation included transmission electron microscopy and chemisorption measurements. These techniques could provide information on particle size and dispersion, which may indirectly influence coke formation and composition.

While the study doesn't provide a detailed molecular characterization of coke constituents, it demonstrates that coke composition and location vary significantly with catalyst composition and support type. This variation is likely due to differences in how different catalyst formulations interact with hydrocarbon species during the dehydrogenation reaction.

用于阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。这种技术揭示了焦炭氧化的不同峰值温度，表明存在不同类型的碳质沉积物。较低温度的峰值通常对应于金属（Pt）上的碳，而较高温度的峰值则与载体上的碳有关。

焦炭沉积物的组成受催化剂组成的影响。例如，向Pt催化剂中添加Sn降低了沉积在金属上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。这表明Sn改变了焦炭形成的性质和位置。

不同的催化剂载体也影响焦炭组成。硅胶负载和L型分子筛负载的催化剂显示出不同的TPO峰型，表明焦炭类型和位置存在差异。

用于研究催化剂并可能提供焦炭形成洞察的其他技术包括透射电子显微镜和化学吸附测量。这些技术可以提供关于粒子大小和分散度的信息，这可能间接影响焦炭的形成和组成。

虽然该研究没有提供焦炭成分的详细分子表征，但它表明焦炭的组成和位置随催化剂组成和载体类型的不同而显著变化。这种变化可能是由于不同的催化剂配方在脱氢反应过程中与烃类物质的相互作用方式不同造成的。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH.

The coke composition differs between catalysts with and without additives like Sn and K. For Pt/silica catalysts, coke forms both on Pt sites and the support. Adding Sn decreases the ratio of carbon on metal sites to total carbon deposited. 

The location of coke (on metal or support) can be determined by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). Lower temperature TPO peaks correspond to carbon on Pt, while higher temperature peaks indicate carbon on the support. Different catalysts show distinct TPO peak patterns, reflecting variations in coke composition and location.

Reaction conditions also affect coke composition. The presence of hydrogen during reaction can impact coke formation and distribution.

Analytical techniques employed to study coke include TPO, which provides information about coke quantity and location. Other mentioned techniques are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for observing particle sizes, and chemisorption measurements for determining the number of active sites before and after coking.

有无添加剂(如Sn和K)的催化剂之间，积碳组成存在差异。对于Pt/二氧化硅催化剂，积碳既形成在Pt位点上，也形成在载体上。添加Sn会降低金属位点上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。

通过程序升温氧化(TPO)可以确定积碳的位置(在金属上或载体上)。较低温度的TPO峰对应于Pt上的碳，而较高温度的峰表示载体上的碳。不同的催化剂显示出不同的TPO峰模式，反映了积碳组成和位置的变化。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH:

1. The addition of Sn to K-L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts improves resistance to coke formation at high temperatures (873 K).

2. The location of coke deposits differs: carbon on Pt corresponds to lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra, while carbon on the support corresponds to higher temperature peaks.

3. Sn addition decreases Pt surface ensemble size, leading to weaker hydrocarbon adsorption and easier migration of carbonaceous species to the support.

4. K addition to catalysts results in more weakly bound carbon, as evidenced by lower TPO peak temperatures.

The main analytical technique mentioned for studying coke deposits is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). This method can differentiate between types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures. Other techniques mentioned in the study include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and chemisorption measurements, which provide information about particle size and metal surface area, respectively.

While the document doesn't specifically address the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, it does highlight how different catalyst compositions affect coke formation and distribution, suggesting that coke composition can vary significantly based on catalyst type and reaction conditions.
