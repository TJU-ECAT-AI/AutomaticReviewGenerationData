[1] "The TPO spectrum of the Pt/silica catalyst has peaks at 710 and 790 K, while the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/silica catalyst displays broad peaks at 690, 760 and 820 K. The spectra of Pt/K-L and 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L have peaks near 680 and 780 K, while 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/silica has a peak around 680 K."

[2] "It has been shown that the lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support"

[3] "Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n-butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited."

[4] "TPO results shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4 indicate higher levels of coke after reaction in the absence of hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in dehydrogenation reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation rather than propane dehydrogenation, but the principles are similar.

The main analytical technique used to elucidate the nature of coke deposits is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO spectra reveal different peaks corresponding to different types of coke deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally correspond to carbon on the metal (e.g., Pt), while higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support.

The composition of coke deposits varies depending on:

1. Catalyst type: Different catalysts (e.g., Pt/silica, Pt/Sn/silica, Pt/K-L, Pt/Sn/K-L) show different TPO peak patterns, indicating variations in coke composition and location.

2. Presence of additives: Addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreases the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited.

3. Reaction conditions: Higher levels of coke are observed after reaction in the absence of hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K.

While the document doesn't provide detailed information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, it demonstrates that coke composition and location can be influenced by catalyst composition and reaction conditions.

在催化体系中，特别是在脱氢反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因不同的反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献讨论的是异丁烷脱氢而非丙烷脱氢，但原理类似。

用于阐明积碳沉积物性质的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。TPO谱图显示了不同的峰，对应于不同类型的积碳沉积物。较低温度的峰通常对应于金属（如Pt）上的碳，而较高温度的峰对应于载体上的碳。

积碳沉积物的组成因以下因素而变化：

1. 催化剂类型：不同的催化剂（如Pt/二氧化硅、Pt/Sn/二氧化硅、Pt/K-L、Pt/Sn/K-L）显示不同的TPO峰模式，表明积碳组成和位置的变化。

2. 添加剂的存在：向Pt催化剂中添加Sn会降低沉积在金属上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。

3. 反应条件：在798 K下无氢气条件下反应后观察到的积碳水平高于在873 K下有氢气存在的条件下反应。

虽然文档没有提供关于积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性的详细信息，但它表明积碳的组成和位置可以受到催化剂组成和反应条件的影响。
