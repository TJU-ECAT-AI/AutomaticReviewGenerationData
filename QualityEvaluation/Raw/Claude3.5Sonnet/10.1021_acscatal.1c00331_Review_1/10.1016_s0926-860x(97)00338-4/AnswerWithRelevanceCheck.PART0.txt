          [1] "TPO results shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4 indicate higher levels of coke after reaction in the absence of hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K."

[2] "It has been shown that the lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support"

[3] "Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n-butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited."

[4] "The TPO spectrum of the Pt/silica catalyst has peaks at 710 and 790 K, while the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/silica catalyst displays broad peaks at 690, 760 and 820 K. The spectra of Pt/K-L and 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L have peaks near 680 and 780 K, while 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/silica has a peak around 680 K."

[5] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy, and chemisorption measurements were used to study silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation"

[6] "It has been suggested that Sn transports coke from the active sites to the support on Pt/Sn/alumina catalysts [14,26,27]."

[7] "TPO results show that the addition of Sn improves the resistance of the K-L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts to the formation of coke during reaction at 873 K"

[8] "The presence of Sn decreases the size of the surface Pt ensembles so that the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds. Because the adsorbed species is attached less strongly to the metal surface, it is more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

[9] "Barbier [28] has shown that the addition of K to alumina catalysts decreases the peak temperature in the TPO spectrum by 100 K, indicating that the carbon formed on the K-modied surface is more weakly bound."

          The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH.

Reaction conditions affect coke formation. Higher levels of coke were observed after reaction without hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction with hydrogen at 873 K. This suggests that the presence of hydrogen and higher temperatures can influence coke composition and quantity.

Catalyst composition significantly impacts coke deposits. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. Sn is thought to transport coke from active sites to the support. The presence of Sn also decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, leading to weaker hydrocarbon adsorption and easier migration of carbonaceous species to the support. Similarly, the addition of K to alumina catalysts results in more weakly bound carbon.

Different catalyst supports also affect coke composition. Silica-supported and L-zeolite-supported catalysts showed different TPO peak patterns, indicating variations in coke types and locations.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate coke composition is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO spectra reveal information about the location and nature of carbon deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while higher temperature peaks indicate carbon on the support. Different catalyst types show varied TPO profiles, suggesting differences in coke composition and location.

Other techniques used include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for observing particle sizes, and chemisorption measurements for determining the number of active sites before and after coking.

While the studies don't provide detailed molecular characterization of coke constituents, they demonstrate that coke composition and location vary significantly with catalyst composition, support type, and reaction conditions. This variation is likely due to differences in how different catalyst formulations interact with hydrocarbon species during the dehydrogenation reaction.

          在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。文献讨论了异丁烷脱氢，这与PDH类似。

反应条件影响积碳形成。在798 K下无氢反应后观察到的积碳水平高于873 K下有氢反应。这表明氢的存在和较高的温度可以影响积碳的组成和数量。

催化剂组成显著影响积碳沉积。向Pt催化剂中添加Sn降低了沉积在金属上的碳与总沉积碳的比例。Sn被认为可以将积碳从活性位点转移到载体上。Sn的存在还降低了表面Pt集合体的尺寸，导致碳氢化合物吸附更弱，碳质物种更容易迁移到载体上。同样，向氧化铝催化剂中添加K会导致碳结合更弱。

不同的催化剂载体也影响积碳组成。硅胶负载和L型分子筛负载的催化剂显示出不同的TPO峰型，表明积碳类型和位置存在差异。

用于阐明积碳组成的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。TPO谱图揭示了有关碳沉积位置和性质的信息。较低温度的峰通常对应于Pt上的碳，而较高温度的峰表示载体上的碳。不同类型的催化剂显示不同的TPO谱图，表明积碳组成和位置存在差异。

其他使用的技术包括透射电子显微镜（TEM）用于观察粒子大小，以及化学吸附测量用于确定积碳前后的活性位点数量。

虽然这些研究没有提供积碳成分的详细分子表征，但它们表明积碳的组成和位置随催化剂组成、载体类型和反应条件的不同而显著变化。这种变化可能是由于不同的催化剂配方在脱氢反应过程中与烃类物质的相互作用方式不同造成的。
