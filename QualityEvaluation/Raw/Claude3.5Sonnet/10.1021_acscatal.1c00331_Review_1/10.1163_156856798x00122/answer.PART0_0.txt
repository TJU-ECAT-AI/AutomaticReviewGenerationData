[1] "It was found that both the case of Pt/y Al20 and the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of 02 and/or NO."

[2] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition."

[3] "This TPO profiles showed a TPO peak at a temperature of around 325 for the reaction with propane as a reactant and two peaks at the temperature around 325 and 425 for that with propene as a reactant."

[4] "Barbier et al. [3] suggested that the first peak is the coke on metal and the second peak is the coke on the support."

[5] "The temperature program oxidation (TPO) results were shown in Figure 4. It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study primarily focused on Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts under various reaction conditions.

For both catalyst types, propene generally produced more coke deposits than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO. This suggests that the type of hydrocarbon reactant significantly influences coke formation.

The nature of coke deposits was analyzed using Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). For Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, TPO profiles typically showed a peak around 425°C, except for the reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen. In this case, propane reactions showed a peak at 325°C, while propene reactions exhibited two peaks at 325°C and 425°C. These different peaks are believed to represent coke on the metal (325°C) and coke on the support (425°C).

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts, TPO results also indicated that propene reactions produced more coke than propane reactions across all tested conditions.

The study employed Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) as the primary analytical technique to elucidate the nature and quantity of coke deposits. This method allows for the differentiation between types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures, providing insights into the location and potentially the structure of the coke deposits.

While the study provides valuable information on coke formation trends and some insights into coke types (metal vs. support), it does not delve deeply into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to fully characterize the molecular structure and composition of the coke deposits.

在催化系统中，包括丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。这项研究主要集中在Pt/γ-Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂在各种反应条件下的表现。

对于这两种类型的催化剂，丙烯通常比丙烷产生更多的焦炭沉积物，无论是否存在O2和/或NO。这表明烃类反应物的类型显著影响焦炭的形成。

焦炭沉积物的性质是通过程序升温氧化(TPO)进行分析的。对于Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂，TPO谱图通常在425°C左右显示一个峰，除了在有氧条件下NOx还原的情况。在这种情况下，丙烷反应在325°C显示一个峰，而丙烯反应在325°C和425°C显示两个峰。这些不同的峰被认为分别代表金属上的焦炭(325°C)和载体上的焦炭(425°C)。

对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂，TPO结果也表明，在所有测试条件下，丙烯反应产生的焦炭比丙烷反应多。

该研究主要采用程序升温氧化(TPO)作为主要的分析技术来阐明焦炭沉积物的性质和数量。这种方法允许根据焦炭的氧化温度来区分不同类型的焦炭，从而提供关于焦炭沉积物位置和可能结构的见解。

虽然这项研究提供了关于焦炭形成趋势和一些焦炭类型（金属上vs载体上）的有价值信息，但它并没有深入研究焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。需要更先进的分析技术来全面表征焦炭沉积物的分子结构和组成。
