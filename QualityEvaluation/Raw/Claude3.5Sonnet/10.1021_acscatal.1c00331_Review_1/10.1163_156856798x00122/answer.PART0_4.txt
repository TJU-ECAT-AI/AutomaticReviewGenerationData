[1] "The experimental results were shown in Table 1, Figure 1 and Figure 2. In all four reactions, it was observed that the reactions with propene as a reactant gave a larger percent of hydrocarbon conversion in the initial interval of time on stream and also had a larger amount of coke than the reactions with propane as a reactant."

[2] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition. This TPO profiles showed a TPO peak at a temperature of around 325 for the reaction with propane as a reactant and two peaks at the temperature around 325 and 425 for that with propene as a reactant."

[3] "It was found that propene had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the absence of oxygen, but propane had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the presence of oxygen."

[4] "The temperature program oxidation (TPO) results were shown in Figure 4. It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study compared coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts under various conditions.

For Pt/Al2O3 catalysts:
- Propene reactions generally produced more coke than propane reactions.
- In oxygen-free conditions, propene had higher coke selectivity.
- In oxygen-present conditions, propane had higher coke selectivity.

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts:
- Propene reactions consistently produced more coke than propane reactions across all conditions tested.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke composition and location:

- On Pt/Al2O3, most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C.
- In NOx reduction with oxygen, propane reactions showed a peak at 325°C, while propene reactions showed two peaks at 325°C and 425°C.

These differences in TPO profiles suggest variations in coke composition and location (e.g., on metal vs. support) depending on the reactant and reaction conditions. The study demonstrates that the nature of coke deposits is complex and diverse, influenced by factors such as the hydrocarbon reactant, presence of oxygen or NOx, and the type of catalyst used.

在催化系统中，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。该研究比较了在各种条件下Pt/Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂上的焦炭形成。

对于Pt/Al2O3催化剂：
- 丙烯反应通常产生的焦炭比丙烷反应多。
- 在无氧条件下，丙烯具有更高的焦炭选择性。
- 在有氧条件下，丙烷具有更高的焦炭选择性。

对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂：
- 在所有测试条件下，丙烯反应始终比丙烷反应产生更多的焦炭。

用于阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。TPO曲线揭示了焦炭组成和位置的差异：

- 在Pt/Al2O3上，大多数样品在425°C左右显示TPO峰。
- 在含氧的NOx还原反应中，丙烷反应在325°C显示峰值，而丙烯反应在325°C和425°C显示两个峰值。

这些TPO曲线的差异表明，根据反应物和反应条件，焦炭组成和位置（例如，在金属上与载体上）存在变化。该研究表明，焦炭沉积物的性质是复杂和多样的，受到诸如碳氢化合物反应物、氧气或NOx的存在以及所使用的催化剂类型等因素的影响。
