[1] "It was found that both the case of Pt/y Al20 and the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of 02 and/or NO."

[2] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition."

[3] "Barbier et al. [3] suggested that the first peak is the coke on metal and the second peak is the coke on the support."

[4] "The temperature program oxidation (TPO) results were shown in Figure 4. It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study compared coke formation on Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts under various conditions.

For both catalyst types, propene generally produced more coke than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO. This suggests that the hydrocarbon structure influences coke formation, with unsaturated hydrocarbons like propene being more prone to coking.

The reaction conditions, such as the presence or absence of oxygen and NOx, also affected coke formation and composition. For instance, on Pt/γ-Al2O3, propene had higher coke selectivity in oxygen-free conditions, while propane had higher coke selectivity in the presence of oxygen.

The location of coke deposits also varied. On Pt/γ-Al2O3, coke was found both on the metal and the support, as indicated by different TPO peaks.

The main analytical technique employed to study coke composition and quantity was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke characteristics based on reaction conditions and catalyst type. For example, most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C, except for catalysts used in NOx reduction with oxygen present.

While the study provides insights into coke formation under different conditions, it does not provide detailed information on the molecular composition or structure of the coke deposits. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

催化系统中积碳沉积物的组成，包括在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。该研究比较了在各种条件下Pt/γ-Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂上的积碳形成。

对于这两种类型的催化剂，无论是否存在O2和/或NO，丙烯通常比丙烷产生更多的积碳。这表明碳氢化合物的结构影响积碳形成，不饱和碳氢化合物如丙烯更容易生成积碳。

反应条件，如是否存在氧气和NOx，也影响积碳的形成和组成。例如，在Pt/γ-Al2O3上，丙烯在无氧条件下具有更高的积碳选择性，而丙烷在有氧条件下具有更高的积碳选择性。

积碳沉积的位置也有所不同。在Pt/γ-Al2O3上，通过不同的TPO峰可以看出，积碳同时存在于金属和载体上。

研究积碳组成和数量的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。TPO曲线揭示了基于反应条件和催化剂类型的积碳特征差异。例如，大多数样品在425°C左右显示TPO峰，除了在有氧条件下用于NOx还原的催化剂。

虽然该研究提供了在不同条件下积碳形成的见解，但它没有提供积碳沉积物的分子组成或结构的详细信息。需要更先进的分析技术来阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。
