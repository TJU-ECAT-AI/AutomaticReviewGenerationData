[1] "The catalytic reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a fixed bed reactor. A 0.5 g of catalyst was packed in a quartz tube reactor."

[2] "Coke deposited on the catalysts was characterized by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)."

[3] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition."

[4] "It was found that propene had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the absence of oxygen, but propane had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the presence of oxygen."

[5] "For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, in the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % of coke selectivity."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study investigated coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts under different conditions.

For Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, the presence or absence of oxygen affected coke selectivity differently for propane and propene. In oxygen-free conditions, propene showed higher coke selectivity, while propane had higher coke selectivity when oxygen was present.

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts, the addition of oxygen significantly changed coke selectivity. The presence of NOx also affected coke formation, with propane showing decreased coke selectivity and propene showing increased coke selectivity when NOx was added.

The main analytical technique used to elucidate the nature of coke deposits was temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke composition and location on the catalysts. For Pt/Al2O3, most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C, indicating similar types of coke. However, in the presence of oxygen and NOx, different TPO profiles were observed, suggesting variations in coke composition or location on the catalyst surface.

While the study provides insights into coke formation under different conditions, it does not offer detailed information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to fully characterize the molecular composition of the coke deposits.

在催化系统中，包括丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，积碳沉积物的组成随反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。该研究在不同条件下考察了Pt/Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂上的积碳形成。

对于Pt/Al2O3催化剂，氧气的存在或缺失对丙烷和丙烯的积碳选择性产生不同影响。在无氧条件下，丙烯表现出更高的积碳选择性，而在有氧条件下，丙烷表现出更高的积碳选择性。

对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂，添加氧气显著改变了积碳选择性。NOx的存在也影响了积碳形成，当添加NOx时，丙烷的积碳选择性降低，而丙烯的积碳选择性增加。

用于阐明积碳沉积物性质的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。TPO曲线揭示了催化剂上积碳组成和位置的差异。对于Pt/Al2O3，大多数样品在425°C左右显示TPO峰值，表明积碳类型相似。然而，在存在氧气和NOx的情况下，观察到不同的TPO曲线，表明催化剂表面上积碳组成或位置存在变化。

虽然该研究提供了不同条件下积碳形成的见解，但并未提供关于积碳成分复杂性和多样性的详细信息。要全面表征积碳沉积物的分子组成，需要更先进的分析技术。
