[1] "It was found that both the case of Pt/y Al20 and the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of 02 and/or NO."

[2] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition."

[3] "This TPO profiles showed a TPO peak at a temperature of around 325 for the reaction with propane as a reactant and two peaks at the temperature around 325 and 425 for that with propene as a reactant."

[4] "Barbier et al. [3] suggested that the first peak is the coke on metal and the second peak is the coke on the support."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study primarily focused on Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts under various reaction conditions.

For both catalyst types, propene generally produced more coke deposits than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO. This suggests that the type of hydrocarbon reactant significantly influences coke formation.

The nature of coke deposits was analyzed using Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). For Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, TPO profiles typically showed a peak around 425°C, except for the reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen. In this case, propane reactions showed a peak at 325°C, while propene reactions exhibited two peaks at 325°C and 425°C. These different peaks are believed to represent coke on the metal (325°C) and coke on the support (425°C).

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts, TPO results also indicated that propene reactions produced more coke than propane reactions across all tested conditions.

The study employed Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) as the primary analytical technique to elucidate the nature and quantity of coke deposits. This method allows for the differentiation between types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures, providing insights into the location and potentially the structure of the coke deposits.

While the study provides valuable information on coke formation trends and some insights into coke types (metal vs. support), it does not delve deeply into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to fully characterize the molecular structure and composition of the coke deposits.

在催化系统中，包括丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。这项研究主要集中在Pt/γ-Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂在各种反应条件下的表现。

对于这两种类型的催化剂，丙烯通常比丙烷产生更多的焦炭沉积物，无论是否存在O2和/或NO。这表明烃类反应物的类型显著影响焦炭的形成。

焦炭沉积物的性质是通过程序升温氧化(TPO)进行分析的。对于Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂，TPO谱图通常在425°C左右显示一个峰，除了在有氧条件下NOx还原的情况。在这种情况下，丙烷反应在325°C显示一个峰，而丙烯反应在325°C和425°C显示两个峰。这些不同的峰被认为分别代表金属上的焦炭(325°C)和载体上的焦炭(425°C)。

对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂，TPO结果也表明，在所有测试条件下，丙烯反应产生的焦炭比丙烷反应多。

该研究主要采用程序升温氧化(TPO)作为主要的分析技术来阐明焦炭沉积物的性质和数量。这种方法允许根据焦炭的氧化温度来区分不同类型的焦炭，从而提供关于焦炭沉积物位置和可能结构的见解。

虽然这项研究提供了关于焦炭形成趋势和一些焦炭类型（金属上vs载体上）的有价值信息，但它并没有深入研究焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性。需要更先进的分析技术来全面表征焦炭沉积物的分子结构和组成。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study examined two catalyst types: Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5.

For both catalysts, propene generally produced more coke deposits than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO. This suggests that the type of hydrocarbon reactant significantly influences coke formation.

The nature of coke deposits also varied depending on reaction conditions. For Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) profiles showed different peak patterns depending on the reaction conditions. Most samples exhibited a single TPO peak around 425°C, except for the NOx reduction reaction in the presence of oxygen. In this case, propane as a reactant showed a peak at 325°C, while propene showed two peaks at 325°C and 425°C. These different peaks are attributed to coke on metal (325°C) and coke on support (425°C), indicating that reaction conditions affect not only the amount but also the location of coke formation on the catalyst.

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts, TPO results also showed that propene reactions produced more coke than propane reactions across four different reaction conditions.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). This technique allowed researchers to quantify the amount of coke and differentiate between different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures. While the study doesn't provide detailed information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, the use of TPO demonstrates its effectiveness in characterizing coke deposits in catalytic systems.

在催化系统中，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在变化。该研究考察了两种催化剂类型：Pt/γ-Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5。

对于这两种催化剂，丙烯通常比丙烷产生更多的积碳沉积物，无论是否存在O2和/或NO。这表明烃类反应物的类型对积碳形成有显著影响。

积碳沉积物的性质也随反应条件而变化。对于Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂，温度程序氧化（TPO）曲线根据反应条件显示出不同的峰型模式。大多数样品在425°C左右出现单一TPO峰，除了在有氧条件下的NOx还原反应。在这种情况下，以丙烷为反应物时在325°C出现峰，而以丙烯为反应物时在325°C和425°C出现两个峰。这些不同的峰被归因于金属上的积碳（325°C）和载体上的积碳（425°C），表明反应条件不仅影响积碳的数量，还影响催化剂上积碳形成的位置。

对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂，TPO结果也显示在四种不同的反应条件下，丙烯反应产生的积碳比丙烷反应多。

用于阐明这些系统中积碳组分的复杂性质和多样性的主要分析技术是温度程序氧化（TPO）。这种技术使研究人员能够量化积碳的数量，并根据它们的氧化温度区分不同类型的积碳。虽然该研究没有提供关于积碳组分复杂性质和多样性的详细信息，但TPO的使用证明了其在表征催化系统中积碳沉积物方面的有效性。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study compared coke formation on Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts under various conditions.

For both catalyst types, propene generally produced more coke than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO. This suggests that the hydrocarbon structure influences coke formation, with unsaturated hydrocarbons like propene being more prone to coking.

The reaction conditions, such as the presence or absence of oxygen and NOx, also affected coke formation and composition. For instance, on Pt/γ-Al2O3, propene had higher coke selectivity in oxygen-free conditions, while propane had higher coke selectivity in the presence of oxygen.

The location of coke deposits also varied. On Pt/γ-Al2O3, coke was found both on the metal and the support, as indicated by different TPO peaks.

The main analytical technique employed to study coke composition and quantity was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke characteristics based on reaction conditions and catalyst type. For example, most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C, except for catalysts used in NOx reduction with oxygen present.

While the study provides insights into coke formation under different conditions, it does not provide detailed information on the molecular composition or structure of the coke deposits. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

对于这两种类型的催化剂，无论是否存在O2和/或NO，丙烯通常比丙烷产生更多的积碳。这表明碳氢化合物的结构影响积碳形成，不饱和碳氢化合物如丙烯更容易生成积碳。

反应条件，如是否存在氧气和NOx，也影响积碳的形成和组成。例如，在Pt/γ-Al2O3上，丙烯在无氧条件下具有更高的积碳选择性，而丙烷在有氧条件下具有更高的积碳选择性。

积碳沉积的位置也有所不同。在Pt/γ-Al2O3上，通过不同的TPO峰可以看出，积碳同时存在于金属和载体上。

研究积碳组成和数量的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。TPO曲线揭示了基于反应条件和催化剂类型的积碳特征差异。例如，大多数样品在425°C左右显示TPO峰，除了在有氧条件下用于NOx还原的催化剂。

虽然该研究提供了在不同条件下积碳形成的见解，但它没有提供积碳沉积物的分子组成或结构的详细信息。需要更先进的分析技术来阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study investigated coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts under different conditions.

For Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, the presence or absence of oxygen affected coke selectivity differently for propane and propene. In oxygen-free conditions, propene showed higher coke selectivity, while propane had higher coke selectivity when oxygen was present.

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts, the addition of oxygen significantly changed coke selectivity. The presence of NOx also affected coke formation, with propane showing decreased coke selectivity and propene showing increased coke selectivity when NOx was added.

The main analytical technique used to elucidate the nature of coke deposits was temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke composition and location on the catalysts. For Pt/Al2O3, most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C, indicating similar types of coke. However, in the presence of oxygen and NOx, different TPO profiles were observed, suggesting variations in coke composition or location on the catalyst surface.

While the study provides insights into coke formation under different conditions, it does not offer detailed information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to fully characterize the molecular composition of the coke deposits.

For Pt/Al2O3 catalysts:
- Propene reactions generally produced more coke than propane reactions.
- In oxygen-free conditions, propene had higher coke selectivity.
- In oxygen-present conditions, propane had higher coke selectivity.

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts:
- Propene reactions consistently produced more coke than propane reactions across all conditions tested.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke composition and location:

- On Pt/Al2O3, most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C.
- In NOx reduction with oxygen, propane reactions showed a peak at 325°C, while propene reactions showed two peaks at 325°C and 425°C.

These differences in TPO profiles suggest variations in coke composition and location (e.g., on metal vs. support) depending on the reactant and reaction conditions. The study demonstrates that the nature of coke deposits is complex and diverse, influenced by factors such as the hydrocarbon reactant, presence of oxygen or NOx, and the type of catalyst used.
