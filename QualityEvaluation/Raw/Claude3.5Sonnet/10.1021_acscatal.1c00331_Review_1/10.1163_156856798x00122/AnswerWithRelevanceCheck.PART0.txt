          [1] "It was found that both the case of Pt/y Al20 and the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of 02 and/or NO."

[2] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition."

[3] "This TPO profiles showed a TPO peak at a temperature of around 325 for the reaction with propane as a reactant and two peaks at the temperature around 325 and 425 for that with propene as a reactant."

[4] "Barbier et al. [3] suggested that the first peak is the coke on metal and the second peak is the coke on the support."

[5] "The temperature program oxidation (TPO) results were shown in Figure 4. It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."

[6] "It was found that propene had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the absence of oxygen, but propane had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the presence of oxygen."

[7] "For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, in the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % of coke selectivity."

          The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study examined two catalyst types: Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5.

Variation across reaction conditions and catalyst types:
1. For both catalysts, propene generally produced more coke deposits than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO.
2. The presence or absence of oxygen affected coke selectivity differently for propane and propene. For Pt/Al2O3, propene had higher coke selectivity in oxygen-free conditions, while propane had higher coke selectivity in the presence of oxygen.
3. For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, the addition of oxygen significantly changed coke selectivity.

Location of coke deposits:
1. On Pt/γ-Al2O3, coke was found both on the metal and the support, as indicated by different TPO peaks.

Analytical techniques employed:
The main analytical technique used was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke characteristics based on reaction conditions and catalyst type:
1. Most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C, except for catalysts used in NOx reduction with oxygen present.
2. For Pt/Al2O3 in NOx reduction with oxygen, propane reactions showed a peak at 325°C, while propene reactions showed two peaks at 325°C and 425°C.
3. These different peaks are attributed to coke on metal (325°C) and coke on support (425°C).

While the study provides insights into coke formation under different conditions, it does not offer detailed information on the molecular composition or structure of the coke deposits. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to fully elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

          在催化系统中，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在变化。该研究考察了两种催化剂类型：Pt/γ-Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5。

反应条件和催化剂类型的变化：
1. 对于这两种催化剂，无论是否存在O2和/或NO，丙烯通常比丙烷产生更多的积碳沉积物。
2. 氧气的存在或缺失对丙烷和丙烯的积碳选择性产生不同影响。对于Pt/Al2O3，丙烯在无氧条件下具有更高的积碳选择性，而丙烷在有氧条件下具有更高的积碳选择性。
3. 对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5，添加氧气显著改变了积碳选择性。

积碳沉积的位置：
1. 在Pt/γ-Al2O3上，通过不同的TPO峰可以看出，积碳同时存在于金属和载体上。

使用的分析技术：
主要使用的分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。TPO曲线揭示了基于反应条件和催化剂类型的积碳特征差异：
1. 大多数样品在425°C左右显示TPO峰，除了在有氧条件下用于NOx还原的催化剂。
2. 对于Pt/Al2O3在有氧条件下的NOx还原，丙烷反应在325°C显示峰值，而丙烯反应在325°C和425°C显示两个峰值。
3. 这些不同的峰被归因于金属上的积碳（325°C）和载体上的积碳（425°C）。

虽然该研究提供了在不同条件下积碳形成的见解，但它没有提供积碳沉积物的分子组成或结构的详细信息。需要更先进的分析技术来全面阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性。
