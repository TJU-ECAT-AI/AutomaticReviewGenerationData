[1] "It was found that both the case of Pt/y Al20 and the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of 02 and/or NO."

[2] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition. This TPO profiles showed a TPO peak at a temperature of around 325 for the reaction with propane as a reactant and two peaks at the temperature around 325 and 425 for that with propene as a reactant."

[3] "Barbier et al. [3] suggested that the first peak is the coke on metal and the second peak is the coke on the support."

[4] "The temperature program oxidation (TPO) results were shown in Figure 4. It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study examined two catalyst types: Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5.

For both catalysts, propene generally produced more coke deposits than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO. This suggests that the type of hydrocarbon reactant significantly influences coke formation.

The nature of coke deposits also varied depending on reaction conditions. For Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) profiles showed different peak patterns depending on the reaction conditions. Most samples exhibited a single TPO peak around 425°C, except for the NOx reduction reaction in the presence of oxygen. In this case, propane as a reactant showed a peak at 325°C, while propene showed two peaks at 325°C and 425°C. These different peaks are attributed to coke on metal (325°C) and coke on support (425°C), indicating that reaction conditions affect not only the amount but also the location of coke formation on the catalyst.

For Cu/Na-ZSM-5 catalysts, TPO results also showed that propene reactions produced more coke than propane reactions across four different reaction conditions.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). This technique allowed researchers to quantify the amount of coke and differentiate between different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures. While the study doesn't provide detailed information on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, the use of TPO demonstrates its effectiveness in characterizing coke deposits in catalytic systems.

在催化系统中，包括丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在变化。该研究考察了两种催化剂类型：Pt/γ-Al2O3和Cu/Na-ZSM-5。

对于这两种催化剂，丙烯通常比丙烷产生更多的积碳沉积物，无论是否存在O2和/或NO。这表明烃类反应物的类型对积碳形成有显著影响。

积碳沉积物的性质也随反应条件而变化。对于Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂，温度程序氧化（TPO）曲线根据反应条件显示出不同的峰型模式。大多数样品在425°C左右出现单一TPO峰，除了在有氧条件下的NOx还原反应。在这种情况下，以丙烷为反应物时在325°C出现峰，而以丙烯为反应物时在325°C和425°C出现两个峰。这些不同的峰被归因于金属上的积碳（325°C）和载体上的积碳（425°C），表明反应条件不仅影响积碳的数量，还影响催化剂上积碳形成的位置。

对于Cu/Na-ZSM-5催化剂，TPO结果也显示在四种不同的反应条件下，丙烯反应产生的积碳比丙烷反应多。

用于阐明这些系统中积碳组分的复杂性质和多样性的主要分析技术是温度程序氧化（TPO）。这种技术使研究人员能够量化积碳的数量，并根据它们的氧化温度区分不同类型的积碳。虽然该研究没有提供关于积碳组分复杂性质和多样性的详细信息，但TPO的使用证明了其在表征催化系统中积碳沉积物方面的有效性。
