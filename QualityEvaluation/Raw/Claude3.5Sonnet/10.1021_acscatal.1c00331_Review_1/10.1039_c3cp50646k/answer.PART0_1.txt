[1] "The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

[2] "For the analysis of coke Raman bands we use the nomenclature, as proposed by Sadezky et al. for the analysis of soot-based samples. In this interpretation, the most intense Raman band is the so-called G band ( 1587 cm-1), which is the doubly degenerate phonon mode with a E2g symmetry at the Brillouin zone for a perfect graphite lattice."

[3] "As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

[4] "When considering the ratio between the D1 and G Raman bands, the addition of H2 to the feed increases the D1/G ratio in all experiments performed, as shown in Table 2."

[5] "Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The main analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents in these systems are:

1. Operando Raman spectroscopy: This technique provides real-time information on coke formation during the reaction. The Raman spectra of coke deposits typically show four main bands related to carbonaceous deposits, with the most prominent being the G band (associated with graphitic structures) and the D1 band (associated with disordered graphitic lattices).

2. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA): This method is used to quantify the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst and determine the temperature at which it combusts, providing information on the nature of the coke.

The study found that increasing the hydrogen content in the feed affects the coke deposits in several ways:

1. The D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G band shifts to higher wavenumbers.
2. The D1/G ratio increases, suggesting the formation of smaller graphitic crystallites or an increase in defects.
3. The Raman bands become narrower, indicating a more ordered carbon structure with fewer defects.
4. Less coke is formed overall, as confirmed by TGA measurements.

These changes were observed for both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, with some variations between the two. The addition of hydrogen to the feed generally led to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, primarily covering the catalyst support rather than the active metal sites. This resulted in improved catalyst performance in terms of conversion and selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下会发生变化。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分性质的主要分析技术有：

1. 原位拉曼光谱：这种技术提供了反应过程中焦炭形成的实时信息。焦炭沉积物的拉曼光谱通常显示四个与碳质沉积物相关的主要带，其中最显著的是G带（与石墨结构相关）和D1带（与无序石墨晶格相关）。

2. 热重分析(TGA)：这种方法用于量化沉积在催化剂上的焦炭量，并确定其燃烧温度，从而提供焦炭性质的信息。

研究发现，增加进料中的氢含量会以几种方式影响焦炭沉积：

1. D1拉曼带向低波数方向移动，而G带向高波数方向移动。
2. D1/G比率增加，表明形成了更小的石墨晶体或缺陷增加。
3. 拉曼带变窄，表明碳结构更有序，缺陷更少。
4. 总体形成的焦炭更少，这一点通过TGA测量得到确认。

这些变化在Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上都被观察到，两者之间存在一些差异。向进料中添加氢通常会导致形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体，主要覆盖在催化剂载体上，而不是活性金属位点上。这导致了催化剂在转化率和选择性方面的性能改善。
