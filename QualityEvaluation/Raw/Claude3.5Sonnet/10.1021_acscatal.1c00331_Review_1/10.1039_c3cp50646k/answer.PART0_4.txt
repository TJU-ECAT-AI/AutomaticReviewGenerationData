[1] "Four bands can be distinguished: the bands at around 1040 and 1166 cm-1 originate from the quartz window of the reactor, while other two bands, the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1, are typical for coke deposits and have been reported for a wide array of carbon materials."

[2] "The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "Summarizing, three trends can be observed in the operando Raman spectra, as the H2 concentration in the feed is increased. First of all, the Raman bands become narrower, which suggest a more ordered system with less defects. Secondly, the shift in the position of the G Raman band implies that the size of the graphitic crystallites is decreased. Finally, the D1/G ratio increases as the H2 concentration in the feed increases."

[4] "Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy. The amount of coke combusted decreases as H2 is added in the feed."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study employed several analytical techniques to elucidate the nature of coke constituents:

1. Operando Raman spectroscopy: This technique revealed two main bands typical for coke deposits - the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1. As hydrogen concentration in the feed increased, three trends were observed: the Raman bands became narrower (suggesting a more ordered system with fewer defects), the G band shifted (implying decreased size of graphitic crystallites), and the D1/G ratio increased.

2. Deconvolution analysis: The Raman spectra were fitted with a combination of 6 bands - 2 from the quartz reactor window and 4 from carbonaceous deposits. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of the coke structure.

3. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA): This technique supported the findings from Raman spectroscopy, showing that the amount of coke combusted decreased as hydrogen was added to the feed.

These techniques revealed that the addition of hydrogen to the feed led to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, and less overall coke formation. The study also compared coke formation on different catalyst types (Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3), showing variations in coke composition and amount depending on the catalyst used.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中,焦炭沉积物的组成随不同反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。该研究采用了几种分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的性质:

1. 原位拉曼光谱:这种技术揭示了两个典型的焦炭沉积带 - 1320 cm-1处的D带和1584 cm-1处的G带。随着进料中氢气浓度的增加,观察到三个趋势:拉曼带变窄(表明系统更有序,缺陷更少),G带位移(暗示石墨晶体尺寸减小),以及D1/G比值增加。

2. 解卷积分析:拉曼光谱被拟合为6个带的组合 - 2个来自石英反应器窗口,4个来自碳质沉积物。这允许对焦炭结构进行更详细的分析。

3. 热重分析(TGA):这种技术支持了拉曼光谱的发现,显示随着氢气加入进料,燃烧的焦炭量减少。

这些技术揭示,向进料中添加氢气导致形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体,并且总体焦炭形成减少。该研究还比较了不同催化剂类型(Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3)上的焦炭形成,显示根据所使用的催化剂,焦炭组成和数量有所不同。
