[1] "The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

[2] "As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

[3] "The general trend visible is that both bands become narrower as the H2 content in the feed is increased. This effect is visible for all operando Raman spectra measured. The narrowing of these bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst."

[4] "When considering the ratio between the D1 and G Raman bands, the addition of H2 to the feed increases the D1/G ratio in all experiments performed, as shown in Table 2. The addition of H2 to the feed therefore either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites."

[5] "Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy. The amount of coke combusted decreases as H2 is added in the feed."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The main analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents in these systems are operando Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA).

Operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that the coke deposits consist of four main bands associated with carbonaceous deposits. As the hydrogen content in the feed increases, several changes occur in the Raman spectra:

1. The D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts to higher wavenumbers.
2. Both D1 and G bands become narrower, indicating a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects.
3. The D1/G ratio increases, suggesting either an increase in defects in the graphitic lattice or a decrease in the size of graphitic crystallites.

TGA experiments supported the Raman spectroscopy findings, showing that the amount of coke combusted decreases as hydrogen is added to the feed. This indicates that the presence of hydrogen in the feed affects both the quantity and quality of coke deposits.

The study compared Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, demonstrating that catalyst composition also influences coke formation. The addition of Sn to the catalyst was found to affect coke deposition, although the specific differences were not detailed in the given excerpts.

These analytical techniques have provided valuable insights into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems, revealing how reaction conditions (particularly hydrogen concentration) and catalyst composition influence the structure and amount of coke deposits.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分性质的主要分析技术是原位拉曼光谱和热重分析(TGA)。

原位拉曼光谱显示，焦炭沉积物由四个与碳质沉积物相关的主要峰组成。随着进料中氢含量的增加，拉曼光谱出现以下几个变化：

1. D1拉曼峰向低波数方向移动，而G拉曼峰向高波数方向移动。
2. D1和G峰都变窄，表明碳结构更有序，缺陷更少。
3. D1/G比率增加，表明石墨晶格中的缺陷增加或石墨晶粒尺寸减小。

TGA实验支持了拉曼光谱的发现，显示随着氢气加入进料，燃烧的焦炭量减少。这表明进料中氢的存在影响焦炭沉积物的数量和质量。

研究比较了Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂，证明催化剂组成也影响焦炭形成。研究发现，向催化剂中添加Sn会影响焦炭沉积，尽管在给出的摘录中没有详细说明具体差异。

这些分析技术为PDH系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性提供了宝贵的见解，揭示了反应条件（特别是氢浓度）和催化剂组成如何影响焦炭沉积物的结构和数量。
