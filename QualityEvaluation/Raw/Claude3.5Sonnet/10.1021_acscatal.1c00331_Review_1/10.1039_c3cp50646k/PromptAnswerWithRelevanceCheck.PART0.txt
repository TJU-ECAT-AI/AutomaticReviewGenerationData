[1] "The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

[2] "As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

[3] "The general trend visible is that both bands become narrower as the H2 content in the feed is increased. This effect is visible for all operando Raman spectra measured. The narrowing of these bands indicates a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects on the catalyst."

[4] "When considering the ratio between the D1 and G Raman bands, the addition of H2 to the feed increases the D1/G ratio in all experiments performed, as shown in Table 2. The addition of H2 to the feed therefore either increases the amount of defects in the graphitic lattice or decreases the size of the graphitic crystallites."

[5] "Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy. The amount of coke combusted decreases as H2 is added in the feed."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The main analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents in these systems are operando Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA).

Operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that the coke deposits consist of four main bands associated with carbonaceous deposits. As the hydrogen content in the feed increases, several changes occur in the Raman spectra:

1. The D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts to higher wavenumbers.
2. Both D1 and G bands become narrower, indicating a higher ordered carbon structure with fewer defects.
3. The D1/G ratio increases, suggesting either an increase in defects in the graphitic lattice or a decrease in the size of graphitic crystallites.

TGA experiments supported the Raman spectroscopy findings, showing that the amount of coke combusted decreases as hydrogen is added to the feed. This indicates that the presence of hydrogen in the feed affects both the quantity and quality of coke deposits.

The study compared Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, demonstrating that catalyst composition also influences coke formation. The addition of Sn to the catalyst was found to affect coke deposition, although the specific differences were not detailed in the given excerpts.

These analytical techniques have provided valuable insights into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems, revealing how reaction conditions (particularly hydrogen concentration) and catalyst composition influence the structure and amount of coke deposits.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成随不同反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分性质的主要分析技术是原位拉曼光谱和热重分析(TGA)。

原位拉曼光谱显示，焦炭沉积物由四个与碳质沉积物相关的主要峰组成。随着进料中氢含量的增加，拉曼光谱出现以下几个变化：

1. D1拉曼峰向低波数方向移动，而G拉曼峰向高波数方向移动。
2. D1和G峰都变窄，表明碳结构更有序，缺陷更少。
3. D1/G比率增加，表明石墨晶格中的缺陷增加或石墨晶粒尺寸减小。

TGA实验支持了拉曼光谱的发现，显示随着氢气加入进料，燃烧的焦炭量减少。这表明进料中氢的存在影响焦炭沉积物的数量和质量。

研究比较了Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂，证明催化剂组成也影响焦炭形成。研究发现，向催化剂中添加Sn会影响焦炭沉积，尽管在给出的摘录中没有详细说明具体差异。

这些分析技术为PDH系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性提供了宝贵的见解，揭示了反应条件（特别是氢浓度）和催化剂组成如何影响焦炭沉积物的结构和数量。

[2] "For the analysis of coke Raman bands we use the nomenclature, as proposed by Sadezky et al. for the analysis of soot-based samples. In this interpretation, the most intense Raman band is the so-called G band ( 1587 cm-1), which is the doubly degenerate phonon mode with a E2g symmetry at the Brillouin zone for a perfect graphite lattice."

[3] "As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

[4] "When considering the ratio between the D1 and G Raman bands, the addition of H2 to the feed increases the D1/G ratio in all experiments performed, as shown in Table 2."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The main analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents in these systems are:

1. Operando Raman spectroscopy: This technique provides real-time information on coke formation during the reaction. The Raman spectra of coke deposits typically show four main bands related to carbonaceous deposits, with the most prominent being the G band (associated with graphitic structures) and the D1 band (associated with disordered graphitic lattices).

2. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA): This method is used to quantify the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst and determine the temperature at which it combusts, providing information on the nature of the coke.

The study found that increasing the hydrogen content in the feed affects the coke deposits in several ways:

1. The D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G band shifts to higher wavenumbers.
2. The D1/G ratio increases, suggesting the formation of smaller graphitic crystallites or an increase in defects.
3. The Raman bands become narrower, indicating a more ordered carbon structure with fewer defects.
4. Less coke is formed overall, as confirmed by TGA measurements.

These changes were observed for both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, with some variations between the two. The addition of hydrogen to the feed generally led to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, primarily covering the catalyst support rather than the active metal sites. This resulted in improved catalyst performance in terms of conversion and selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下会发生变化。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分性质的主要分析技术有：

1. 原位拉曼光谱：这种技术提供了反应过程中焦炭形成的实时信息。焦炭沉积物的拉曼光谱通常显示四个与碳质沉积物相关的主要带，其中最显著的是G带（与石墨结构相关）和D1带（与无序石墨晶格相关）。

2. 热重分析(TGA)：这种方法用于量化沉积在催化剂上的焦炭量，并确定其燃烧温度，从而提供焦炭性质的信息。

研究发现，增加进料中的氢含量会以几种方式影响焦炭沉积：

1. D1拉曼带向低波数方向移动，而G带向高波数方向移动。
2. D1/G比率增加，表明形成了更小的石墨晶体或缺陷增加。
3. 拉曼带变窄，表明碳结构更有序，缺陷更少。
4. 总体形成的焦炭更少，这一点通过TGA测量得到确认。

这些变化在Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂上都被观察到，两者之间存在一些差异。向进料中添加氢通常会导致形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体，主要覆盖在催化剂载体上，而不是活性金属位点上。这导致了催化剂在转化率和选择性方面的性能改善。

[1] "Four bands can be distinguished: the bands at around 1040 and 1166 cm-1 originate from the quartz window of the reactor, while other two bands, the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1, are typical for coke deposits and have been reported for a wide array of carbon materials."

[2] "Careful analysis of coke related compounds, such as soot, graphene, graphite and carbon nanofibers have shown that the Raman spectra of these carbon materials consist of an overlapping set of 4 or 5 bands in the 1200-1650 cm-1 region."

The study employed several analytical techniques to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Operando Raman Spectroscopy: This technique was the primary method used to analyze coke deposits in real-time during the PDH reaction. It revealed that coke deposits typically show two main bands: the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1. The relative intensities, positions, and widths of these bands provide information about the nature of the coke.

2. Deconvolution of Raman Spectra: The researchers performed a detailed analysis by deconvoluting the Raman spectra into six bands - two from the quartz reactor window and four from the carbonaceous deposits. This allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the coke structure.

3. Thermogravimetrical Analysis (TGA): This technique was used to support the findings from Raman spectroscopy. It provided information on the amount of coke deposited and the temperature at which it combusts, giving insights into the coke's structure and stability.

4. On-line Gas Chromatography: While not directly analyzing coke, this method was used to monitor catalyst activity and product distribution, which indirectly relates to coke formation.

The study found that the composition of coke deposits varies with:

- Hydrogen concentration in the feed: Higher H2 content led to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites.
- Catalyst type: Differences were observed between Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.
- Reaction cycles: The nature of coke deposits changed over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The combination of these techniques allowed for a comprehensive analysis of coke deposits, revealing their complex nature and how they change under different conditions in PDH reactions.

- 催化剂类型：在Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂之间观察到差异。
- 反应循环：焦炭沉积物的性质在多个脱氢-再生循环中发生变化。

这些技术的结合允许对焦炭沉积物进行全面分析，揭示了它们的复杂性以及在PDH反应中如何在不同条件下变化。

1. Operando Raman spectroscopy was the primary technique used to analyze coke deposits in real-time during the PDH reaction. It revealed characteristic D and G bands typical for coke deposits.

2. The researchers developed a deconvolution procedure to fit the Raman spectra with 6 bands, including 4 bands representing different carbonaceous deposits.

3. The addition of hydrogen to the feed was found to alter the nature of coke deposits. As hydrogen content increased, the D1 Raman band shifted to lower wavenumbers while the G band shifted to higher wavenumbers, indicating changes in the coke structure.

4. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the amount of coke deposited and determine the temperature at which it combusts, providing insights into the ordered or disordered nature of the coke.

5. On-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements were correlated with the spectroscopic data to understand the relationship between coke composition and catalyst performance.

These techniques collectively demonstrated that the coke composition varies with reaction conditions, particularly the hydrogen concentration in the feed, and differs between Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. The study revealed that higher hydrogen concentrations led to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while lower hydrogen concentrations resulted in more disordered coke deposits.
