          "Four bands can be distinguished: the bands at around 1040 and 1166 cm-1 originate from the quartz window of the reactor, while other two bands, the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1, are typical for coke deposits and have been reported for a wide array of carbon materials."

"The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

"As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

"When considering the ratio between the D1 and G Raman bands, the addition of H2 to the feed increases the D1/G ratio in all experiments performed, as shown in Table 2."

"Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy."

"Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."

"TGA, operando Raman spectroscopy and on-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements all show that H2 addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material."

          The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The main analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems are:

1. Operando Raman Spectroscopy: This was the primary technique used to analyze coke deposits in real-time during the PDH reaction. It revealed two main bands typical for coke deposits: the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1. The spectra were fitted with a combination of 6 bands - 2 from the quartz reactor window and 4 from carbonaceous deposits.

2. Thermogravimetrical Analysis (TGA): This method was used to quantify the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst and determine the temperature at which it combusts, providing information on the nature of the coke.

3. On-line Gas Chromatography: While not directly analyzing coke, this method was used to monitor catalyst activity and product distribution, which indirectly relates to coke formation.

The study found that the composition of coke deposits varies with:

- Hydrogen concentration in the feed: As H2 content increased, the D1 Raman band shifted to lower wavenumbers, while the G band shifted to higher wavenumbers. The D1/G ratio also increased, suggesting the formation of smaller graphitic crystallites or an increase in defects.

- Catalyst type: Differences were observed between Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.

- Reaction conditions: The addition of H2 to the feed altered the nature of coke deposits, generally leading to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, and less overall coke formation.

These analytical techniques provided comprehensive insights into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems, revealing how reaction conditions and catalyst composition influence the structure and amount of coke deposits.

          在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下会发生变化。用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分性质和多样性的主要分析技术有：

1. 原位拉曼光谱：这是在PDH反应过程中实时分析焦炭沉积物的主要技术。它揭示了两个典型的焦炭沉积带：位于1320 cm-1的D带和位于1584 cm-1的G带。光谱被拟合为6个带的组合 - 2个来自石英反应器窗口，4个来自碳质沉积物。

2. 热重分析(TGA)：这种方法用于量化沉积在催化剂上的焦炭量，并确定其燃烧温度，从而提供焦炭性质的信息。

3. 在线气相色谱：虽然不直接分析焦炭，但这种方法用于监测催化剂活性和产品分布，间接与焦炭形成相关。

研究发现焦炭沉积物的组成随以下因素而变化：

- 进料中的氢气浓度：随着H2含量增加，D1拉曼带向低波数方向移动，而G带向高波数方向移动。D1/G比率也增加，表明形成了更小的石墨晶体或缺陷增加。

- 催化剂类型：在Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂之间观察到差异。

- 反应条件：向进料中添加H2改变了焦炭沉积物的性质，通常导致形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体，并且总体焦炭形成减少。

这些分析技术为PDH系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性提供了全面的见解，揭示了反应条件和催化剂组成如何影响焦炭沉积物的结构和数量。
