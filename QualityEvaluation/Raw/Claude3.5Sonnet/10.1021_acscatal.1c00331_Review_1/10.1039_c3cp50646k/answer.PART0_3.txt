[1] "Four bands can be distinguished: the bands at around 1040 and 1166 cm-1 originate from the quartz window of the reactor, while other two bands, the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1, are typical for coke deposits and have been reported for a wide array of carbon materials."

[2] "The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

[3] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."

[4] "As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

[5] "TGA, operando Raman spectroscopy and on-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements all show that H2 addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study employed several analytical techniques to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Operando Raman spectroscopy was the primary technique used to analyze coke deposits in real-time during the PDH reaction. It revealed characteristic D and G bands typical for coke deposits.

2. The researchers developed a deconvolution procedure to fit the Raman spectra with 6 bands, including 4 bands representing different carbonaceous deposits.

3. The addition of hydrogen to the feed was found to alter the nature of coke deposits. As hydrogen content increased, the D1 Raman band shifted to lower wavenumbers while the G band shifted to higher wavenumbers, indicating changes in the coke structure.

4. Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) was used to quantify the amount of coke deposited and determine the temperature at which it combusts, providing insights into the ordered or disordered nature of the coke.

5. On-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements were correlated with the spectroscopic data to understand the relationship between coke composition and catalyst performance.

These techniques collectively demonstrated that the coke composition varies with reaction conditions, particularly the hydrogen concentration in the feed, and differs between Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. The study revealed that higher hydrogen concentrations led to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, while lower hydrogen concentrations resulted in more disordered coke deposits.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下会有所不同。该研究采用了几种分析技术来阐明积碳成分的性质和多样性：

1. 原位拉曼光谱是在PDH反应过程中实时分析积碳沉积物的主要技术。它揭示了积碳沉积物典型的D和G谱带。

2. 研究人员开发了一种解卷积程序，用6个谱带拟合拉曼光谱，其中包括4个代表不同碳质沉积物的谱带。

3. 发现向进料中添加氢气会改变积碳沉积物的性质。随着氢含量的增加，D1拉曼谱带向低波数移动，而G谱带向高波数移动，表明积碳结构发生了变化。

4. 热重分析(TGA)用于量化沉积的积碳量并确定其燃烧温度，从而洞察积碳的有序或无序性质。

5. 在线丙烷脱氢活性测量与光谱数据相关，以了解积碳组成与催化剂性能之间的关系。

这些技术共同证明，积碳组成随反应条件（特别是进料中的氢气浓度）而变化，并且在Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂之间存在差异。研究表明，较高的氢气浓度导致形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体，而较低的氢气浓度则导致形成更无序的积碳沉积物。
