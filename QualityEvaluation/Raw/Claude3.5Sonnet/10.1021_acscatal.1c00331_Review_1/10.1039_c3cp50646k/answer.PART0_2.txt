[1] "Four bands can be distinguished: the bands at around 1040 and 1166 cm-1 originate from the quartz window of the reactor, while other two bands, the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1, are typical for coke deposits and have been reported for a wide array of carbon materials."

[2] "Careful analysis of coke related compounds, such as soot, graphene, graphite and carbon nanofibers have shown that the Raman spectra of these carbon materials consist of an overlapping set of 4 or 5 bands in the 1200-1650 cm-1 region."

[3] "The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

[4] "Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."

[5] "As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

[6] "Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study employed several analytical techniques to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Operando Raman Spectroscopy: This technique was the primary method used to analyze coke deposits in real-time during the PDH reaction. It revealed that coke deposits typically show two main bands: the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1. The relative intensities, positions, and widths of these bands provide information about the nature of the coke.

2. Deconvolution of Raman Spectra: The researchers performed a detailed analysis by deconvoluting the Raman spectra into six bands - two from the quartz reactor window and four from the carbonaceous deposits. This allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the coke structure.

3. Thermogravimetrical Analysis (TGA): This technique was used to support the findings from Raman spectroscopy. It provided information on the amount of coke deposited and the temperature at which it combusts, giving insights into the coke's structure and stability.

4. On-line Gas Chromatography: While not directly analyzing coke, this method was used to monitor catalyst activity and product distribution, which indirectly relates to coke formation.

The study found that the composition of coke deposits varies with:

- Hydrogen concentration in the feed: Higher H2 content led to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites.
- Catalyst type: Differences were observed between Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.
- Reaction cycles: The nature of coke deposits changed over multiple dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.

The combination of these techniques allowed for a comprehensive analysis of coke deposits, revealing their complex nature and how they change under different conditions in PDH reactions.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著变化。该研究采用了几种分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性：

1. 原位拉曼光谱：这是在PDH反应过程中实时分析焦炭沉积物的主要方法。它揭示了焦炭沉积物通常显示两个主要峰：位于1320 cm-1的D带和位于1584 cm-1的G带。这些峰的相对强度、位置和宽度提供了关于焦炭性质的信息。

2. 拉曼光谱的解卷积：研究人员通过将拉曼光谱解卷积为六个峰进行了详细分析 - 两个来自石英反应器窗口，四个来自碳质沉积物。这允许对焦炭结构有更细致的理解。

3. 热重分析(TGA)：这种技术用于支持拉曼光谱的发现。它提供了关于沉积焦炭量和燃烧温度的信息，从而洞察焦炭的结构和稳定性。

4. 在线气相色谱：虽然不直接分析焦炭，但这种方法用于监测催化剂活性和产品分布，间接与焦炭形成相关。

研究发现焦炭沉积物的组成随以下因素而变化：

- 进料中的氢气浓度：较高的H2含量导致形成更小、更有序的石墨晶体。
- 催化剂类型：在Pt/Al2O3和Pt-Sn/Al2O3催化剂之间观察到差异。
- 反应循环：焦炭沉积物的性质在多个脱氢-再生循环中发生变化。

这些技术的结合允许对焦炭沉积物进行全面分析，揭示了它们的复杂性以及在PDH反应中如何在不同条件下变化。
