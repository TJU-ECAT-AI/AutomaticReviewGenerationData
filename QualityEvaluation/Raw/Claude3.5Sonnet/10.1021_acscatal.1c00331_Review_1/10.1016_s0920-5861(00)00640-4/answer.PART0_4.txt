The given literature does not provide specific information about the composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study focuses on the kinetics of coke formation on a platinum-alumina monolithic catalyst during propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the detailed composition of the coke deposits or analytical techniques used to characterize them. The paper primarily deals with the rate of coke formation and its dependence on reaction conditions, rather than the chemical nature of the coke itself.

给定的文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭沉积物在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下的组成的具体信息。该研究主要关注丙烷脱氢过程中铂-氧化铝整体催化剂上焦炭形成的动力学,但并未讨论焦炭沉积物的详细组成或用于表征它们的分析技术。这篇论文主要研究焦炭形成速率及其对反应条件的依赖性,而不是焦炭本身的化学性质。
