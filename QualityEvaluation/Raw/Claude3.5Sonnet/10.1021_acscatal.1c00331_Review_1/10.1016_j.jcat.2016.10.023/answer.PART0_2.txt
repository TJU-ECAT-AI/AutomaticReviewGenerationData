[1] "Deposition of graphene-like coke during non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation was investigated on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst."

[2] "Like pristine MgO, collapsed LDHs (Mg(Al)Ox) are slightly alkaline support materials that do not form significant amounts of coke in the absence of catalytically-active metal nanoparticles."

[3] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

[4] "On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."

[5] "Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers"

[6] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene"

[7] "The assignment of coke to disordered graphene is consistent with Raman spectra (see Fig. 3). Namely, the ratio of D and G band intensities for the coked sample is 1.5, which is suggestive of the significant disorder in graphene"

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on the catalyst type and reaction conditions. For the 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst studied in this paper, the coke deposits are primarily composed of graphene-like structures. The morphology and location of these deposits depend on the size of the Pt nanoparticles:

1. On small Pt nanoparticles (1.5-2 nm), graphene sheets form and shift onto the support, where they undergo deformation and form disordered layers and entangled structures.

2. On larger Pt nanoparticles (5-10 nm), graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers that do not shift onto the support.

The coke deposits are chemically homogeneous, consisting primarily of graphene, but with significant disorder. This disorder is evidenced by the ratio of D and G band intensities (1.5) in Raman spectroscopy.

The analytical techniques employed to elucidate the nature of coke deposits include:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for morphological analysis
2. Raman spectroscopy for structural characterization
3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) for studying oxidation behavior
4. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) for time-resolved analysis of coke formation and oxidation

These techniques provide complementary information about the structure, composition, and behavior of coke deposits in PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成因催化剂类型和反应条件而异。对于本文研究的0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂，焦炭沉积物主要由类石墨烯结构组成。这些沉积物的形态和位置取决于Pt纳米颗粒的大小：

1. 在小的Pt纳米颗粒（1.5-2 nm）上，石墨烯片形成并转移到载体上，在那里它们发生变形并形成无序层和缠结结构。

2. 在较大的Pt纳米颗粒（5-10 nm）上，石墨烯形成包覆的石墨层，不会转移到载体上。

焦炭沉积物在化学上是均匀的，主要由石墨烯组成，但具有显著的无序性。这种无序性通过拉曼光谱中D带和G带强度的比率（1.5）得到证实。

用于阐明焦炭沉积物性质的分析技术包括：

1. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）用于形态分析
2. 拉曼光谱用于结构表征
3. 程序升温氧化（TPO）用于研究氧化行为
4. 瞬态分析产物（TAP）用于焦炭形成和氧化的时间分辨分析

这些技术为了解PDH反应中焦炭沉积物的结构、组成和行为提供了互补的信息。
