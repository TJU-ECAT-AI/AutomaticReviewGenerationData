[1] "The investigated catalyst was selected as a model material for a number of reasons. It belongs to a family of catalysts derived from Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) which have recently attracted considerable academic and industrial interest."

[2] "We hypothesized that the 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst should produce exclusively graphene-like carbonaceous deposits, as observed by Peng et al. [27], which can be characterized in isolation from other types of coke."

[3] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support. On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."

[4] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."

[5] "The assignment of coke to disordered graphene is consistent with Raman spectra (see Fig. 3). Namely, the ratio of D and G band intensities for the coked sample is 1.5, which is suggestive of the significant disorder in graphene [63]."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on the catalyst type and reaction conditions. In the case of Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts, the coke deposits are primarily composed of graphene-like structures. These deposits form extended graphene sheets on small Pt nanoparticles, which then shift onto the support surface. On the support, the graphene sheets undergo deformation, forming disordered layers and entangled structures that may also include carbon nanotubes.

The nature of coke deposits is influenced by the catalyst's composition and structure. For instance, the mildly basic nature of the Mg(Al)Ox support precludes the formation of coke via propylene oligomerization, resulting in exclusively graphene-like deposits.

Several analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature of coke constituents in these systems:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): Used to visualize the morphology of coke deposits, revealing their graphene-like structure and distribution on the catalyst surface.

2. Raman Spectroscopy: Employed to confirm the disordered graphene nature of the coke deposits. The ratio of D and G band intensities provides information about the degree of disorder in the graphene structure.

3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO): Used to study the oxidation behavior of coke deposits, providing insights into their reactivity and accessibility.

4. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP): Applied to investigate the early stages of coke formation and the dynamics of carbon species on the catalyst surface.

These techniques, used in combination, provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH catalyst systems.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因催化剂类型和反应条件而异。对于Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂，积碳沉积物主要由类石墨烯结构组成。这些沉积物在小的Pt纳米粒子上形成延伸的石墨烯片，然后转移到载体表面。在载体上，石墨烯片发生变形，形成无序层和缠结结构，可能还包括碳纳米管。

积碳沉积物的性质受催化剂成分和结构的影响。例如，Mg(Al)Ox载体的温和碱性阻止了通过丙烯寡聚反应形成积碳，导致形成单一的类石墨烯沉积物。

几种分析技术被用来阐明这些系统中积碳成分的复杂性质：

1. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）：用于观察积碳沉积物的形态，揭示其类石墨烯结构和在催化剂表面的分布。

2. 拉曼光谱：用于确认积碳沉积物的无序石墨烯性质。D带和G带强度的比率提供了石墨烯结构无序程度的信息。

3. 程序升温氧化（TPO）：用于研究积碳沉积物的氧化行为，提供关于其反应性和可接近性的见解。

4. 瞬态分析产物（TAP）：应用于研究积碳形成的早期阶段和碳物种在催化剂表面的动态行为。

这些技术的组合使用，为全面理解PDH催化剂系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性提供了深入的认识。
