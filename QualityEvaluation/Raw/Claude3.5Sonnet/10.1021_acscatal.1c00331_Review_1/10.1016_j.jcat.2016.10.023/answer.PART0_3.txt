[1] "Deposition of graphene-like coke during non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation was investigated on a 0.5%Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst."

[2] "Coke deposits on these catalysts consist exclusively of graphene sheets that form on the stepped Pt surfaces."

[3] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

[4] "On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."

[5] "Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers"

[6] "The assignment of coke to disordered graphene is consistent with Raman spectra (see Fig. 3). Namely, the ratio of D and G band intensities for the coked sample is 1.5, which is suggestive of the significant disorder in graphene"

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts primarily consists of graphene-like structures. The nature and morphology of these deposits vary depending on the size of Pt nanoparticles and their location on the catalyst surface:

1. On small Pt nanoparticles (1.5-2 nm), graphene sheets form and then shift onto the support surface.

2. On the support surface, these graphene sheets undergo deformation, forming disordered layers and entangled bundles.

3. On larger Pt nanoparticles (5-10 nm), graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers without shifting onto the support.

The coke deposits are described as "graphene-like" due to their disordered nature, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy showing a D to G band intensity ratio of 1.5.

Analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke deposits include:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for morphological characterization
2. Raman spectroscopy for structural analysis
3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) for differentiation of carbon deposits
4. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) for time-resolved studies of coke formation and oxidation

These techniques collectively provide insights into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems.

在Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应时，积碳沉积物的组成主要由类石墨烯结构组成。这些沉积物的性质和形态根据Pt纳米颗粒的大小和在催化剂表面的位置而有所不同：

1. 在小型Pt纳米颗粒（1.5-2 nm）上，石墨烯片形成后会转移到载体表面。

2. 在载体表面，这些石墨烯片发生变形，形成无序层和纠缠的束状结构。

3. 在较大的Pt纳米颗粒（5-10 nm）上，石墨烯形成包覆的石墨层，不会转移到载体上。

这些积碳沉积物被描述为"类石墨烯"，是因为它们的无序性质，这一点通过拉曼光谱显示的D带与G带强度比为1.5得到证实。

用于阐明积碳沉积物性质的分析技术包括：

1. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）用于形态表征
2. 拉曼光谱用于结构分析
3. 程序升温氧化（TPO）用于区分碳沉积物
4. 瞬态分析产物（TAP）用于积碳形成和氧化的时间分辨研究

这些技术共同为理解PDH系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性提供了深入的见解。
