[1] "The present results complement the studies by Peng et al. [27] and Wu et al. [28] by examining coking behavior at very early as well as more mature stages of the dehydrogenation process."

[2] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

[3] "On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes. Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, also in agreement with Peng et al. [27]."

[4] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."

[5] "Raman analysis of the fresh, coked, and partially regenerated samples was performed on a RXN1 Raman spectrometer (Kaiser Optical Systems) fitted with a 532 nm laser operating at 40 mW and a 5 m optical probe."

[6] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used for structural analysis of (i) coked catalytic samples after propane dehydrogenation and (ii) coked samples that subsequently underwent partial oxidative regeneration (one-peak burn-off)."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. For the Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst studied in this paper, the coke deposits consist primarily of graphene-like structures. At early stages of the dehydrogenation process, thin graphene sheets form on small Pt nanoparticles and shift onto the support. As the reaction progresses, these sheets undergo deformations on the support surface, forming disordered layers and entangled structures. On larger Pt nanoparticles, graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers without shifting to the support.

Various analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems:

1. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to analyze the structural characteristics of coked catalytic samples both after propane dehydrogenation and after partial oxidative regeneration.

2. Raman spectroscopy was performed on fresh, coked, and partially regenerated samples to provide information on the graphitic nature of the coke deposits.

3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) was used to characterize coke on supported metal catalysts, providing insights into the oxidation behavior of different types of coke deposits.

These techniques, combined with time-resolved kinetic characterization methods like Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP), offer a comprehensive approach to understanding the complex nature of coke formation and composition in PDH systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成会因反应条件和催化剂类型而有所不同。对于本文研究的Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂，积碳沉积物主要由类石墨烯结构组成。在脱氢过程的早期阶段，薄石墨烯片在小的Pt纳米颗粒上形成并转移到载体上。随着反应的进行，这些片层在载体表面发生变形，形成无序层和缠结结构。在较大的Pt纳米颗粒上，石墨烯形成包覆的石墨层，而不会转移到载体上。

为了阐明这些系统中积碳成分的性质和多样性，采用了多种分析技术：

1. 高分辨透射电子显微镜(HRTEM)用于分析丙烷脱氢后和部分氧化再生后的积碳催化剂样品的结构特征。

2. 对新鲜、积碳和部分再生的样品进行拉曼光谱分析，以提供关于积碳沉积物石墨性质的信息。

3. 程序升温氧化(TPO)用于表征负载金属催化剂上的积碳，提供不同类型积碳沉积物氧化行为的见解。

这些技术，结合时间分辨动力学表征方法（如瞬态分析产物(TAP)），为理解PDH系统中积碳形成和组成的复杂性提供了全面的方法。
