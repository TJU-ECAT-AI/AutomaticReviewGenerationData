[1] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

[2] "On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."

[3] "Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, also in agreement with Peng et al. [27]."

[4] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."

[5] "Ex situ TEM characterization of incompletely burned samples and isothermal pulsed oxidation provided evidence that transport phenomena on the surface determine the accessibility of graphene-like coke for oxidation at a given temperature."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on the catalyst particle size and reaction conditions. On small Pt nanoparticles (1.5-2 nm), extended graphene sheets form and shift onto the support, where they undergo deformation and form disordered layers and entangled bundles. On larger Pt nanoparticles (5-10 nm), graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers that do not shift onto the support.

Despite the morphological differences, the coke deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous, consisting primarily of graphene. However, their oxidation behavior is complex due to transport processes on the support surface.

Several analytical techniques were employed to elucidate the nature of coke deposits:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): Used to visualize the morphology and distribution of coke deposits on different catalyst particle sizes.

2. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO): Applied to study the oxidation behavior of coke deposits.

3. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP): Utilized for time-resolved studies of coke formation and oxidation.

4. Raman spectroscopy: Used to confirm the graphene-like nature of the coke deposits.

5. DFT calculations: Employed to investigate the mechanisms of coke formation and mobility on the catalyst surface.

These techniques collectively provided insights into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems, revealing that while the coke is primarily graphene-like, its morphology and oxidation behavior are influenced by catalyst particle size and surface transport phenomena.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随催化剂粒径和反应条件而变化。在小型铂纳米粒子（1.5-2 nm）上，形成延伸的石墨烯片并转移到载体上，在那里它们发生变形并形成无序层和缠结的束状结构。在较大的铂纳米粒子（5-10 nm）上，石墨烯形成包覆的石墨层，不会转移到载体上。

尽管形态上有差异，但Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上的积碳沉积物在化学上是均匀的，主要由石墨烯组成。然而，由于载体表面的传输过程，它们的氧化行为是复杂的。

为了阐明积碳沉积物的性质，采用了几种分析技术：

1. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）：用于观察不同催化剂粒径上积碳沉积物的形态和分布。

2. 程序升温氧化（TPO）：用于研究积碳沉积物的氧化行为。

3. 产物时间分析（TAP）：用于积碳形成和氧化的时间分辨研究。

4. 拉曼光谱：用于确认积碳沉积物的类石墨烯性质。

5. DFT计算：用于研究催化剂表面积碳形成和迁移的机制。

这些技术共同为PDH系统中积碳组分的复杂性质和多样性提供了洞察，揭示了虽然积碳主要是类石墨烯的，但其形态和氧化行为受到催化剂粒径和表面传输现象的影响。
