[1] "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

[2] "On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."

[3] "Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, also in agreement with Peng et al. [27]."

[4] "Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."

[5] "Ex situ TEM characterization of incompletely burned samples and isothermal pulsed oxidation provided evidence that transport phenomena on the surface determine the accessibility of graphene-like coke for oxidation at a given temperature."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on the catalyst particle size and reaction conditions. On small Pt nanoparticles (1.5-2 nm), extended graphene sheets form and shift onto the support, where they undergo deformation and form disordered layers and entangled bundles. On larger Pt nanoparticles (5-10 nm), graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers that do not shift onto the support.

Despite the morphological differences, the coke deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous, consisting primarily of graphene. However, their oxidation behavior is complex due to transport processes on the support surface.

Several analytical techniques were employed to elucidate the nature of coke deposits:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): Used to visualize the morphology and distribution of coke deposits on different catalyst particle sizes.

2. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO): Applied to study the oxidation behavior of coke deposits.

3. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP): Utilized for time-resolved studies of coke formation and oxidation.

4. Raman spectroscopy: Used to confirm the graphene-like nature of the coke deposits.

5. DFT calculations: Employed to investigate the mechanisms of coke formation and mobility on the catalyst surface.

These techniques collectively provided insights into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems, revealing that while the coke is primarily graphene-like, its morphology and oxidation behavior are influenced by catalyst particle size and surface transport phenomena.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随催化剂粒径和反应条件而变化。在小型铂纳米粒子（1.5-2 nm）上，形成延伸的石墨烯片并转移到载体上，在那里它们发生变形并形成无序层和缠结的束状结构。在较大的铂纳米粒子（5-10 nm）上，石墨烯形成包覆的石墨层，不会转移到载体上。

尽管形态上有差异，但Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上的积碳沉积物在化学上是均匀的，主要由石墨烯组成。然而，由于载体表面的传输过程，它们的氧化行为是复杂的。

为了阐明积碳沉积物的性质，采用了几种分析技术：

1. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）：用于观察不同催化剂粒径上积碳沉积物的形态和分布。

2. 程序升温氧化（TPO）：用于研究积碳沉积物的氧化行为。

3. 产物时间分析（TAP）：用于积碳形成和氧化的时间分辨研究。

4. 拉曼光谱：用于确认积碳沉积物的类石墨烯性质。

5. DFT计算：用于研究催化剂表面积碳形成和迁移的机制。

这些技术共同为PDH系统中积碳组分的复杂性质和多样性提供了洞察，揭示了虽然积碳主要是类石墨烯的，但其形态和氧化行为受到催化剂粒径和表面传输现象的影响。

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. For the Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalyst studied in this paper, the coke deposits consist primarily of graphene-like structures. At early stages of the dehydrogenation process, thin graphene sheets form on small Pt nanoparticles and shift onto the support. As the reaction progresses, these sheets undergo deformations on the support surface, forming disordered layers and entangled structures. On larger Pt nanoparticles, graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers without shifting to the support.

Various analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems:

1. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to analyze the structural characteristics of coked catalytic samples both after propane dehydrogenation and after partial oxidative regeneration.

2. Raman spectroscopy was performed on fresh, coked, and partially regenerated samples to provide information on the graphitic nature of the coke deposits.

3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) was used to characterize coke on supported metal catalysts, providing insights into the oxidation behavior of different types of coke deposits.

These techniques, combined with time-resolved kinetic characterization methods like Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP), offer a comprehensive approach to understanding the complex nature of coke formation and composition in PDH systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成会因反应条件和催化剂类型而有所不同。对于本文研究的Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂，积碳沉积物主要由类石墨烯结构组成。在脱氢过程的早期阶段，薄石墨烯片在小的Pt纳米颗粒上形成并转移到载体上。随着反应的进行，这些片层在载体表面发生变形，形成无序层和缠结结构。在较大的Pt纳米颗粒上，石墨烯形成包覆的石墨层，而不会转移到载体上。

为了阐明这些系统中积碳成分的性质和多样性，采用了多种分析技术：

1. 高分辨透射电子显微镜(HRTEM)用于分析丙烷脱氢后和部分氧化再生后的积碳催化剂样品的结构特征。

2. 对新鲜、积碳和部分再生的样品进行拉曼光谱分析，以提供关于积碳沉积物石墨性质的信息。

3. 程序升温氧化(TPO)用于表征负载金属催化剂上的积碳，提供不同类型积碳沉积物氧化行为的见解。

这些技术，结合时间分辨动力学表征方法（如瞬态分析产物(TAP)），为理解PDH系统中积碳形成和组成的复杂性提供了全面的方法。

These deposits form extended graphene sheets on small Pt nanoparticles, which then shift onto the support surface. On the support, the graphene sheets undergo deformation, forming disordered layers and entangled structures that may also include carbon nanotubes.

The nature of coke deposits is influenced by the catalyst's composition and structure. For instance, the mildly basic nature of the Mg(Al)Ox support precludes the formation of coke via propylene oligomerization, resulting in exclusively graphene-like deposits.

Several analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature of coke constituents in these systems:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): Used to visualize the morphology of coke deposits, revealing their graphene-like structure and distribution on the catalyst surface.

2. Raman Spectroscopy: Employed to confirm the disordered graphene nature of the coke deposits. The ratio of D and G band intensities provides information about the degree of disorder in the graphene structure.

3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO): Used to study the oxidation behavior of coke deposits, providing insights into their reactivity and accessibility.

4. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP): Applied to investigate the early stages of coke formation and the dynamics of carbon species on the catalyst surface.

These techniques, used in combination, provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH catalyst systems.
