[1] "It was found that both the case of Pt/y Al20 and the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of 02 and/or NO."

[2] "The TPO profiles of 0.3% Pt/AI203 catalysts are indicated in Figure 2. Each sample showed a TPO peak around 425 except the TPO profiles of spent catalyst from reduction of NOx in the presence of oxygen condition."

[3] "This TPO profiles showed a TPO peak at a temperature of around 325 for the reaction with propane as a reactant and two peaks at the temperature around 325 and 425 for that with propene as a reactant."

[4] "Barbier et al. [3] suggested that the first peak is the coke on metal and the second peak is the coke on the support."

[5] "The temperature program oxidation (TPO) results were shown in Figure 4. It was found that the amount of coke from the four reactions of propene was greater than propane over Cu/Na-ZSM-5 zeolite."

[6] "It was found that propene had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the absence of oxygen, but propane had a higher percent of selectivity of coke formation for the reaction with the presence of oxygen."

[7] "For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, in the system with absence and presence of oxygen, the addition of oxygen caused a significant change in % of coke selectivity."

[1] "The exact constituents of coke are not well resolved because of the complex process of the coke formation. Most studies broadly attributed coke as the deposition of undesirable organic compounds."

[2] "A recent study with gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis pin down the detailed components of coke under PDH on PtSn catalysts. It was suggested that the coke mainly consists of three kind of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite."

[3] "However, a coke hydrogenation study indicated that the species of coke deposition vary on different catalysts. It is suggested that the species could be atomic carbon or aromatics on Pt/Al2O3 and C3 species on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively."

[4] "Overall, the composition of cokes varies with reaction condition and catalytic system without a universal definition."

[5] "The temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis (22,41,42) revealed that there are two peaks when coke elimination happens, as shown in Figure 2a. One peak is around 325 C, which is related to the coke on metal, and contains more hydrogens. The other one is at higher temperature around 425 C, which is ascribed to the coke on the support."

"Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [2932]."

"These two mechanisms are represented by
C3H8 3C + 4H2
(3)
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2
(4)"

"The deep propane cracking Eq. (3) and the propene polymerization Eq. (4) can be assumed to be first order with respect to propane and propene. As H2 has definite influences on the coking rate, it should be included in the coking rate equation."

"Our DFT study showed H2 inhibits coke formation mainly by promoting propene desorption and decreasing the surface coverage of propene, which lowers the rate of deep cracking or polymerization of propene."

"The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke formation and thus deactivation."

[1] "Formation of coke deposits during propane dehydrogenation originates almost solely from propylene [25]."

[2] "The model used in this work to describe coke formation is a simple mechanistic model called the monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM)."

[3] "The presence of steam in the reaction mixture leads to a continuous gasification of the deposited coke so that the experimentally measured rate of coke formation is a net rate resulting from both deposition and gasification [28]."

[1] "The presence of Ga compared to Sn reduced the deactivation and the amount of coke deposited during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne"

[4] "Thus, we hypothesize that less mobile coke species derived from propane are responsible for a larger coke buildup on the active metal particles, and hence a larger deactivation."

[5] "The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation between loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation. Moreover, the ratios of deposited carbon to surface Pt atoms are much greater than unity in all cases. This suggests that the most of the accumulated coke is present on the support and that only a small fraction remains on the surface of the metal particles."

[6] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

[7] "the adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

[1] "According to the previous studies, coke could be produced on the metal site and surface of catalyst support, respectively."

[2] "Furthermore, only a small part of coke was located on the metal, which was usually believed to be responsible for deactivation."

[3] "Herein, we reported a distinct nature of coke on the alloyed Pt sites. Several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits on surface of PtSn alloy."

[4] "In addition, several pathways for their production were investigated by DFT calculation as well."

[5] "Further, these coke could be hydrogenated to propylene in PDH process."

"Four bands can be distinguished: the bands at around 1040 and 1166 cm-1 originate from the quartz window of the reactor, while other two bands, the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1, are typical for coke deposits and have been reported for a wide array of carbon materials."

"The Raman spectra were fitted by a combination of 6 bands, of which two originated from the quartz of the reaction window (Q1 and Q2) and four bands from the carbonaceous deposits."

"As the H2 content in the feed increases, the D1 Raman band shifts to lower wavenumbers, while the G Raman band shifts towards higher wavenumbers."

"When considering the ratio between the D1 and G Raman bands, the addition of H2 to the feed increases the D1/G ratio in all experiments performed, as shown in Table 2."

"Thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) experiments, shown in the supplementary information Fig. S4, on deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts support the findings found by operando Raman spectroscopy."

"Operando Raman spectroscopy showed that hydrogen altered the nature of the coke deposits formed during propane dehydrogenation."

"TGA, operando Raman spectroscopy and on-line propane dehydrogenation activity measurements all show that H2 addition affects the coke deposited on the catalyst material."

"Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles. The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal. The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."

"The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."

"Two peaks were observed after the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst had deactivated for at least 5 h. For the bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, a shoulder was seen on the larger peak."

"The TPO experiments performed in the microbalance were deconvoluted using a model with a combination of power-law kinetic expressions, proposed and discussed in detail by Querini and Fung (28)."

"The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%. Examples of typical TPO profiles can be found in Fig. 4a, and two or three different peaks can be identified in the curves."

"We agree with a model, earlier proposed by others (10, 22, 24, 25), that only a small part of the coke is located on the metal, while a larger part is placed close to the metal and is assisted by the platinum in the combustion. We believe that the last part of the coke is deposited on the carrier and is combusted without any influence by the metal."

"The TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian curves assuming two or three different types of coke."

"Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Time on stream, temperature, and reaction gas composition have been varied."

"For both catalysts the peak temperatures shifted upwards when the deactivation increased. Also, more severe coking caused the beginning of the gasification to shift to higher temperature."

"The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."

"The bimetallic PtSn catalyst is more resistant to deactivation by coke formation, than the monometallic Pt."

"We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel. The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."

"The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."

"Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

"According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

"On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."

"Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, also in agreement with Peng et al. [27]."

"Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."

"The assignment of coke to disordered graphene is consistent with Raman spectra (see Fig. 3). Namely, the ratio of D and G band intensities for the coked sample is 1.5, which is suggestive of the significant disorder in graphene"

[1] "Lin et al. [7] found two main TPO peaks at 450 and 500℃. The peaks were ascribed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "Larsson et al. [8] identified three different types of coke in propane dehydrogenation, their conclusions were also based on TPO experiments. The three types were coke on the support, coke on and in the vicinity of the metal and graphitic coke on the support."

[3] "The amounts of these types of coke depended on the conditions, and Larsson et al. [8] proposed a model in which a minor part of the coke deactivated the catalyst."

[4] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) has frequently been used to characterize the coke deposited on the catalyst during propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)1 ks1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively, on the basis of the amount of coke measured by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)."

          [2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

"Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively."

"The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support."

"The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

"The coked alumina (S9) has the lowest while the coked Pt/MgO (S10) has the highest H/C ratio, which indicates that the coke formed on the alumina is relatively deficient in hydrogen while the coke formed on the Pt surfaces is rich in hydrogen."

"Increasing the propylene concentration will increase the degree of polymerization of the polymers, which will be further dehydrogenated to aromatics. The degree of the aromatization of the coke is enhanced as a result of the increased propylene concentration and weakened as a result of the increased hydrogen concentration"

"The amounts of coke formed on the spent catalysts (or coked alumina) were determined by TG (thermal gravimetric) analysis (SDT Q600, TA Company, USA) in air."

"Elemental analysis was carried out on a Vario EL III Elementar analyzer."

"FTIR analysis was carried out on a Bruker Equinox-55 with a resolution of 4.0 cm1 and the scanned wave number was ranged from 4000 to 400 cm1."

"Raman analysis was performed at room temperature under ambient conditions on a Renishaw inVia + Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser beam."

[1] "The formation of short chain hydrocarbons (cracking) and coke (coking) are the main undesired reactions associated with propane dehydrogenation. Furthermore, coke is rapidly formed at high temperatures and as a consequence the catalyst is deactivated and needs to be regenerated."

[2] "A LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism provides the best fit for propane dehydrogenation, while a monolayermultilayer mechanism is proposed for modelling the coke formation."

[3] "Coke formation experiments were performed in a CI Electronics thermobalance, under several different conditions. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in nitrogen."

[4] "The range of operating conditions was as follows: temperature, 460540 8C; molar fraction of propane, 0.250.70; catalyst mass, 200 mg; particle size of 160250 mm; atmospheric pressure and total flow rates of 300 cm3(STP) min1."

[1] "TPO results shown in Fig. 9 and Table 4 indicate higher levels of coke after reaction in the absence of hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction in the presence of hydrogen at 873 K."

[2] "It has been shown that the lower temperature peaks in TPO spectra generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while the higher temperature peaks correspond to carbon on the support"

[3] "Liwu et al. [14] studied carbon deposition on Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Sn/Al2O3 after the dehydrogenation of n-butane. They observed that Sn decreased the ratio of the carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited."

[4] "The TPO spectrum of the Pt/silica catalyst has peaks at 710 and 790 K, while the 1 : 1 Pt/Sn/silica catalyst displays broad peaks at 690, 760 and 820 K. The spectra of Pt/K-L and 1 : 2.5 Pt/Sn/K-L have peaks near 680 and 780 K, while 1 : 1 : 3 Pt/Sn/K/silica has a peak around 680 K."

[5] "Temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), transmission electron microscopy, and chemisorption measurements were used to study silica- and L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation"

[6] "It has been suggested that Sn transports coke from the active sites to the support on Pt/Sn/alumina catalysts [14,26,27]."

[7] "TPO results show that the addition of Sn improves the resistance of the K-L-zeolite-supported Pt catalysts to the formation of coke during reaction at 873 K"

[8] "The presence of Sn decreases the size of the surface Pt ensembles so that the hydrocarbon cannot readily form multiple carbon-metal bonds. Because the adsorbed species is attached less strongly to the metal surface, it is more mobile and can more easily migrate to the support."

[9] "Barbier [28] has shown that the addition of K to alumina catalysts decreases the peak temperature in the TPO spectrum by 100 K, indicating that the carbon formed on the K-modied surface is more weakly bound."

[1] "It was found that both the case of Pt/y Al20 and the case of Cu/Na-ZSM-5, propene provided higher conversion and coke deposition than propane in the presence or the absence of 02 and/or NO."
