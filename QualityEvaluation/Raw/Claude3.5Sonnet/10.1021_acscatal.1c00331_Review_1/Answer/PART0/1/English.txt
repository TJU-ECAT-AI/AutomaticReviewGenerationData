The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study examined two catalyst types: Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5.

Variation across reaction conditions and catalyst types:
1. For both catalysts, propene generally produced more coke deposits than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO.
2. The presence or absence of oxygen affected coke selectivity differently for propane and propene. For Pt/Al2O3, propene had higher coke selectivity in oxygen-free conditions, while propane had higher coke selectivity in the presence of oxygen.
3. For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, the addition of oxygen significantly changed coke selectivity.

Location of coke deposits:
1. On Pt/γ-Al2O3, coke was found both on the metal and the support, as indicated by different TPO peaks.

Analytical techniques employed:
The main analytical technique used was Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles revealed differences in coke characteristics based on reaction conditions and catalyst type:
1. Most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C, except for catalysts used in NOx reduction with oxygen present.
2. For Pt/Al2O3 in NOx reduction with oxygen, propane reactions showed a peak at 325°C, while propene reactions showed two peaks at 325°C and 425°C.
3. These different peaks are attributed to coke on metal (325°C) and coke on support (425°C).

While the study provides insights into coke formation under different conditions, it does not offer detailed information on the molecular composition or structure of the coke deposits. More advanced analytical techniques would be needed to fully elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. There is no universal definition for coke composition due to its complex formation process.

In PDH reactions using PtSn catalysts, coke mainly consists of three types of species: aliphatics, aromatics, and pregraphite. However, the composition can differ on other catalysts. For instance, on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, coke deposits may consist of atomic carbon or aromatics, while on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, C3 species are more prevalent.

The location of coke formation also influences its composition. Coke formed on metal surfaces tends to contain more hydrogen and is eliminated at lower temperatures (around 325°C), while coke on the support is removed at higher temperatures (around 425°C).

Several analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. These include:

1. Gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
2. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis
3. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis
4. Coke hydrogenation studies

These techniques have helped researchers identify the various components of coke deposits and understand how they differ based on reaction conditions and catalyst types. However, due to the complexity of coke formation, its exact constituents remain challenging to fully resolve.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Two main mechanisms of coke formation are identified:

1. Deep cracking of propane, leading to graphitized carbon
2. Polymerization and condensation of olefins (mainly propene), resulting in polyaromatics

The coke composition can be influenced by factors such as:

- Propane concentration: Higher propane concentrations may lead to more graphitized carbon from deep cracking.
- Propene concentration: Higher propene concentrations can increase polyaromatic coke formation through polymerization and condensation. Propene is identified as the main precursor for coke formation.
- Hydrogen concentration: Hydrogen inhibits coke formation by promoting propene desorption and decreasing surface coverage of propene, thus suppressing catalyst deactivation.

The study does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate coke composition. However, it references DFT (Density Functional Theory) studies to investigate the influence of hydrogen on coke formation. Given the complex nature of coke constituents, a combination of techniques would likely be necessary for comprehensive analysis, such as:

- Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)
- Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
- Raman spectroscopy
- X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
- Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

These techniques could provide insights into the structure, elemental composition, and morphology of coke deposits formed under different reaction conditions and on various catalyst types. The study focuses on developing a kinetic model that integrates coke formation and catalyst deactivation, avoiding the need for in situ measurement of coke content. This approach suggests that the researchers relied on indirect methods to study coke composition and formation, rather than direct analytical techniques for coke characterization.

The literature provides limited information on the composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It states that coke formation originates mainly from propylene and describes coke formation using a monolayer-multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM). The presence of steam leads to gasification of deposited coke, affecting the net rate of coke formation. However, the document does not provide comprehensive information on coke composition variations across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, nor does it discuss specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents. More detailed studies would be needed to fully address the question about coke composition variations and analytical methods.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions:

1. Catalyst composition: Ga-containing catalysts show reduced coke deposition compared to Sn-containing catalysts. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O.

2. Reactant type: Propane dehydrogenation generally results in lower coke formation compared to ethane dehydrogenation. This is attributed to the easier hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne.

3. Coke distribution: Most of the accumulated coke is present on the catalyst support, with only a small fraction on the metal particles' surface. However, coke species derived from propane are hypothesized to be less mobile, leading to larger coke buildup on active metal particles.

4. Hydrogen's role: Addition of H2 to the feed reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species.

5. Deactivation mechanism: There is no direct correlation between coke accumulation and loss of dehydrogenation activity. In propane dehydrogenation, increased deactivation despite lower overall coke formation is attributed to greater coverage of the active metal particle surface by coke.

The study does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, the findings suggest that techniques capable of distinguishing between coke on the support and on the metal particles were employed, as well as methods to quantify the amount of coke relative to exposed metal atoms. To fully characterize the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, additional analytical techniques would likely be necessary, but these are not discussed in the given literature.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. Coke can be produced on both the metal site and the surface of the catalyst support. While only a small part of coke is typically located on the metal, it is believed to be primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation.

In the case of PtSn alloy catalysts, a distinct nature of coke was observed. Several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the PtSn alloy. These coke deposits could be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process.

The analytical techniques mentioned in the literature for elucidating the nature of coke constituents include DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, which were used to investigate the pathways for coke production. However, the text does not provide comprehensive information about other analytical techniques employed to study coke composition across various reaction conditions.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The main analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems are:

1. Operando Raman Spectroscopy: This was the primary technique used to analyze coke deposits in real-time during the PDH reaction. It revealed two main bands typical for coke deposits: the D band at 1320 cm-1 and the G band at 1584 cm-1. The spectra were fitted with a combination of 6 bands - 2 from the quartz reactor window and 4 from carbonaceous deposits.

2. Thermogravimetrical Analysis (TGA): This method was used to quantify the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst and determine the temperature at which it combusts, providing information on the nature of the coke.

3. On-line Gas Chromatography: While not directly analyzing coke, this method was used to monitor catalyst activity and product distribution, which indirectly relates to coke formation.

The study found that the composition of coke deposits varies with:

- Hydrogen concentration in the feed: As H2 content increased, the D1 Raman band shifted to lower wavenumbers, while the G band shifted to higher wavenumbers. The D1/G ratio also increased, suggesting the formation of smaller graphitic crystallites or an increase in defects.

- Catalyst type: Differences were observed between Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts.

- Reaction conditions: The addition of H2 to the feed altered the nature of coke deposits, generally leading to the formation of smaller, more ordered graphite crystallites, and less overall coke formation.

These analytical techniques provided comprehensive insights into the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems, revealing how reaction conditions and catalyst composition influence the structure and amount of coke deposits.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three main types of coke were identified:

1. Coke on and near the metal surface
2. Coke on the catalyst carrier
3. Graphitic coke on the carrier

The formation of these coke types is influenced by several factors:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures increase coke formation and shift TPO peak temperatures upwards.
2. Partial pressures: Higher propene partial pressure increases coke formation.
3. Hydrogen presence: Hydrogen suppresses coke formation but cannot remove already formed coke.
4. Catalyst type: Bimetallic PtSn catalysts show more resistance to deactivation by coke formation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.
5. Time on stream: The first type of coke (on/near metal) reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type (on carrier) continued to increase.

The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%. The distribution and formation of coke types differ between Pt and PtSn catalysts, with PtSn catalysts generally accumulating more coke overall but showing better resistance to deactivation.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). This method allowed researchers to distinguish between different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures and profiles. TPO profiles were analyzed and deconvoluted using various models:

1. Power-law kinetic expressions
2. Gaussian curve fitting

These techniques allowed researchers to identify and quantify different coke types formed under various reaction conditions. Additionally, the study used microbalance reactors to monitor coke formation in real-time and employed gas chromatography to analyze reaction products and correlate them with coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

The research also proposed a model suggesting that the majority of observed coke is not directly responsible for catalyst deactivation. Instead, a small fraction of "deactivating coke" forms in parallel with the main coke deposits. This model helps explain the complex relationship between coke formation, reaction conditions, and catalyst performance in PDH systems.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types, particularly the size of Pt nanoparticles:

1. On small Pt nanoparticles (1.5-2 nm): Extended graphene sheets form and shift onto the support, where they undergo deformation, forming disordered layers and entangled structures.

2. On larger Pt nanoparticles (5-10 nm): Graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers without shifting to the support.

The coke deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous, consisting primarily of graphene-like structures. However, these structures show significant disorder, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy (D to G band intensity ratio of 1.5).

Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents include:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): For morphological analysis and visualization of coke deposits.
2. Raman spectroscopy: For structural characterization and determination of graphene disorder.
3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO): For studying oxidation behavior and characterizing coke on supported metal catalysts.
4. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP): For time-resolved analysis of coke formation and oxidation.
5. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM): For structural analysis of coked samples before and after partial oxidative regeneration.

These techniques provide complementary information about the structure, composition, and behavior of coke deposits in PDH systems, revealing the complex nature of coke formation and its dependence on catalyst properties and reaction conditions.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Studies have identified multiple types of coke:

1. Coke on the metal
2. Coke on the support
3. Coke in the vicinity of the metal
4. Graphitic coke on the support

The amounts and types of coke formed depend on the specific reaction conditions. Some researchers have proposed that only a small portion of the coke actually deactivates the catalyst.

Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) has been the primary analytical technique used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems. TPO experiments have revealed distinct oxidation peaks corresponding to different types of coke, allowing researchers to differentiate between coke deposited on various parts of the catalyst. For instance, Lin et al. observed two main TPO peaks at 450°C and 500°C, attributed to coke on the metal and coke on the support, respectively. Larsson et al. expanded on this, identifying a third type of coke (graphitic coke on the support) in addition to the two types mentioned by Lin et al.

These findings highlight the complexity of coke formation in PDH reactions and demonstrate how the nature of coke deposits can vary depending on their location on the catalyst (metal vs. support) and their structural characteristics (e.g., graphitic vs. non-graphitic).

The literature provides limited information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It does not explore how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or catalyst types. The only analytical technique mentioned for studying coke is temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), which was used to measure the amount of coke formed on cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles. The study focuses more on comparing coke formation rates and deactivation effects between these two types of Pt nanoparticles rather than analyzing the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)^-1 ks^-1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively. As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 hours, respectively. More detailed research would be needed to fully answer the question about the composition of coke deposits and the diversity of analytical techniques used to study them in PDH reactions.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. Location: Two types of coke are identified - coke on the metal and coke on the support.

2. Composition: 
   - Coke on metal: Softer, contains more hydrogen (higher H/C ratio)
   - Coke on support: Harder, contains less hydrogen (lower H/C ratio)

3. Effect of reaction conditions:
   - On metal: Coke formation increases with propane pressure, weakly dependent on propylene and hydrogen pressures
   - On support: Coke formation increases with propane and propylene pressures, decreases with hydrogen pressure
   - Higher propylene concentration leads to increased polymerization and aromatization
   - Higher hydrogen concentration reduces aromatization

4. Catalyst type: The nature of coke varies between different catalysts (e.g., PtSn/Al2O3 vs Pt/MgO)

Several analytical techniques were employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) profiles: Used to identify and distinguish between coke on metal and support
2. Thermal Gravimetric (TG) Analysis: Determined the amounts of coke formed on spent catalysts
3. Elemental Analysis: Used to determine the H/C ratio of the coke
4. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy: Identified different functional groups in the coke
5. Raman Spectroscopy: Studied the degree of graphitization and the nature of carbon species in the coke

These techniques collectively provided a comprehensive understanding of the coke composition, structure, and formation mechanisms under various reaction conditions and catalyst types in PDH systems.

The literature provides limited information on the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Coke formation is identified as one of the main undesired reactions in propane dehydrogenation, occurring rapidly at high temperatures and leading to catalyst deactivation.

A monolayer-multilayer mechanism is proposed for modeling coke formation, suggesting that coke deposits may have a layered structure. This implies that the composition and nature of coke may vary depending on the extent of deposition.

Regarding analytical techniques, the literature mentions the use of a CI Electronics thermobalance for coke formation experiments. This technique allows for the measurement of coke accumulation over time under various reaction conditions.

The study investigated coke formation under different operating conditions, including temperatures ranging from 460°C to 540°C, propane molar fractions of 0.25-0.70, and using a PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the specific composition of coke deposits and how it varies across these conditions is not detailed in the given text.

The literature does not provide information on other analytical techniques that might have been used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH.

Reaction conditions affect coke formation. Higher levels of coke were observed after reaction without hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction with hydrogen at 873 K. This suggests that the presence of hydrogen and higher temperatures can influence coke composition and quantity.

Catalyst composition significantly impacts coke deposits. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. Sn is thought to transport coke from active sites to the support. The presence of Sn also decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, leading to weaker hydrocarbon adsorption and easier migration of carbonaceous species to the support. Similarly, the addition of K to alumina catalysts results in more weakly bound carbon.

Different catalyst supports also affect coke composition. Silica-supported and L-zeolite-supported catalysts showed different TPO peak patterns, indicating variations in coke types and locations.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate coke composition is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO spectra reveal information about the location and nature of carbon deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while higher temperature peaks indicate carbon on the support. Different catalyst types show varied TPO profiles, suggesting differences in coke composition and location.

Other techniques used include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for observing particle sizes, and chemisorption measurements for determining the number of active sites before and after coking.

While the studies don't provide detailed molecular characterization of coke constituents, they demonstrate that coke composition and location vary significantly with catalyst composition, support type, and reaction conditions. This variation is likely due to differences in how different catalyst formulations interact with hydrocarbon species during the dehydrogenation reaction.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, including propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study examined two catalyst types: Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Cu/Na-ZSM-5.

Variation across reaction conditions and catalyst types:
1. For both catalysts, propene generally produced more coke deposits than propane, regardless of the presence or absence of O2 and/or NO.
2. The presence or absence of oxygen affected coke selectivity differently for propane and propene. For Pt/Al2O3, propene had higher coke selectivity in oxygen-free conditions, while propane had higher coke selectivity in the presence of oxygen.
3. For Cu/Na-ZSM-5, the addition of oxygen significantly changed coke selectivity.

1. Most samples showed a TPO peak around 425°C, except for catalysts used in NOx reduction with oxygen present.
2. For Pt/Al2O3 in NOx reduction with oxygen, propane reactions showed a peak at 325°C, while propene reactions showed two peaks at 325°C and 425°C.
3. These different peaks are attributed to coke on metal (325°C) and coke on support (425°C).

While the study provides insights into coke formation under different conditions, it does not offer detailed information on the molecular composition or structure of the coke deposits.

2. Composition: 
   - Coke on metal: Softer, contains more hydrogen (higher H/C ratio)
   - Coke on support: Harder, contains less hydrogen (lower H/C ratio)

3. Effect of reaction conditions:
   - On metal: Coke formation increases with propane pressure, weakly dependent on propylene and hydrogen pressures
   - On support: Coke formation increases with propane and propylene pressures, decreases with hydrogen pressure
   - Higher propylene concentration leads to increased polymerization and aromatization
   - Higher hydrogen concentration reduces aromatization

4. Catalyst type: The nature of coke varies between different catalysts (e.g., PtSn/Al2O3 vs Pt/MgO)

Several analytical techniques were employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) profiles: Used to identify and distinguish between coke on metal and support
2. Thermal Gravimetric (TG) Analysis: Determined the amounts of coke formed on spent catalysts
3. Elemental Analysis: Used to determine the H/C ratio of the coke
4. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy: Identified different functional groups in the coke
5. Raman Spectroscopy: Studied the degree of graphitization and the nature of carbon species in the coke

These techniques collectively provided a comprehensive understanding of the coke composition, structure, and formation mechanisms under various reaction conditions and catalyst types in PDH systems.

The literature provides limited information on the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Coke formation is identified as one of the main undesired reactions in propane dehydrogenation, occurring rapidly at high temperatures and leading to catalyst deactivation.

A monolayer-multilayer mechanism is proposed for modeling coke formation, suggesting that coke deposits may have a layered structure. This implies that the composition and nature of coke may vary depending on the extent of deposition.

Regarding analytical techniques, the literature mentions the use of a CI Electronics thermobalance for coke formation experiments. This technique allows for the measurement of coke accumulation over time under various reaction conditions.

The study investigated coke formation under different operating conditions, including temperatures ranging from 460°C to 540°C, propane molar fractions of 0.25-0.70, and using a PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the specific composition of coke deposits and how it varies across these conditions is not detailed in the given text.

The literature does not provide information on other analytical techniques that might have been used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The literature discusses isobutane dehydrogenation, which is similar to PDH.

Reaction conditions affect coke formation. Higher levels of coke were observed after reaction without hydrogen at 798 K compared to reaction with hydrogen at 873 K. This suggests that the presence of hydrogen and higher temperatures can influence coke composition and quantity.

Catalyst composition significantly impacts coke deposits. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreased the ratio of carbon deposited on the metal to the total carbon deposited. Sn is thought to transport coke from active sites to the support. The presence of Sn also decreases the size of surface Pt ensembles, leading to weaker hydrocarbon adsorption and easier migration of carbonaceous species to the support. Similarly, the addition of K to alumina catalysts results in more weakly bound carbon.

Different catalyst supports also affect coke composition. Silica-supported and L-zeolite-supported catalysts showed different TPO peak patterns, indicating variations in coke types and locations.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate coke composition is Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO spectra reveal information about the location and nature of carbon deposits. Lower temperature peaks generally correspond to carbon on Pt, while higher temperature peaks indicate carbon on the support. Different catalyst types show varied TPO profiles, suggesting differences in coke composition and location.

Other techniques used include transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for observing particle sizes, and chemisorption measurements for determining the number of active sites before and after coking.

While the studies don't provide detailed molecular characterization of coke constituents, they demonstrate that coke composition and location vary significantly with catalyst composition, support type, and reaction conditions. This variation is likely due to differences in how different catalyst formulations interact with hydrocarbon species during the dehydrogenation reaction.
