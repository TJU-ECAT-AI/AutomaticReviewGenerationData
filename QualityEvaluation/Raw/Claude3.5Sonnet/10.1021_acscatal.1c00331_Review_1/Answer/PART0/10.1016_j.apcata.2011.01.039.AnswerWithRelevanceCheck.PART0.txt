          "Coke on the catalyst could form from several routes, such as deep cracking of propane, polymerization of olefins (mainly propene) and condensation of large molecules. The coke is mainly formed by two mechanisms, i.e., deep cracking of propane that leads to graphitized carbon, and polymerization, condensation etc., that lead to polyaromatics [2932]."

"These two mechanisms are represented by
C3H8 3C + 4H2
(3)
nC3H6 3nCH0.5 + 2.25nH2
(4)"

"The deep propane cracking Eq. (3) and the propene polymerization Eq. (4) can be assumed to be first order with respect to propane and propene. As H2 has definite influences on the coking rate, it should be included in the coking rate equation."

"Our DFT study showed H2 inhibits coke formation mainly by promoting propene desorption and decreasing the surface coverage of propene, which lowers the rate of deep cracking or polymerization of propene."

"The propene is identified as the main precursor for the coke formation and hydrogen suppressed coke formation and thus deactivation."

          The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types. Two main mechanisms of coke formation are identified:

1. Deep cracking of propane, leading to graphitized carbon
2. Polymerization and condensation of olefins (mainly propene), resulting in polyaromatics

The coke composition can be influenced by factors such as:

- Propane concentration: Higher propane concentrations may lead to more graphitized carbon from deep cracking.
- Propene concentration: Higher propene concentrations can increase polyaromatic coke formation through polymerization and condensation. Propene is identified as the main precursor for coke formation.
- Hydrogen concentration: Hydrogen inhibits coke formation by promoting propene desorption and decreasing surface coverage of propene, thus suppressing catalyst deactivation.

The study does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate coke composition. However, it references DFT (Density Functional Theory) studies to investigate the influence of hydrogen on coke formation. Given the complex nature of coke constituents, a combination of techniques would likely be necessary for comprehensive analysis, such as:

- Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO)
- Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
- Raman spectroscopy
- X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
- Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

These techniques could provide insights into the structure, elemental composition, and morphology of coke deposits formed under different reaction conditions and on various catalyst types. The study focuses on developing a kinetic model that integrates coke formation and catalyst deactivation, avoiding the need for in situ measurement of coke content. This approach suggests that the researchers relied on indirect methods to study coke composition and formation, rather than direct analytical techniques for coke characterization.

          在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成会因反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。主要识别出两种积碳形成机制：

1. 丙烷深度裂解，导致石墨化碳的形成
2. 烯烃（主要是丙烯）的聚合和缩合，形成多环芳烃

积碳组成可受以下因素影响：

- 丙烷浓度：较高的丙烷浓度可能导致更多来自深度裂解的石墨化碳。
- 丙烯浓度：较高的丙烯浓度可能通过聚合和缩合反应增加多环芳烃积碳的形成。丙烯被确定为积碳形成的主要前体。
- 氢气浓度：氢气通过促进丙烯脱附和减少丙烯表面覆盖率来抑制积碳形成，从而抑制催化剂失活。

该研究没有明确提到用于阐明积碳组成的具体分析技术。然而，它提到了使用DFT（密度泛函理论）研究来调查氢气对积碳形成的影响。考虑到积碳成分的复杂性，可能需要结合使用多种技术进行全面分析，如：

- 程序升温氧化(TPO)
- 热重分析(TGA)
- 拉曼光谱
- X射线光电子能谱(XPS)
- 透射电子显微镜(TEM)

这些技术可以提供在不同反应条件下和不同催化剂类型上形成的积碳沉积物的结构、元素组成和形态等方面的信息。该研究主要集中在开发一个整合了积碳形成和催化剂失活的动力学模型，避免了原位测量积碳含量的需要。这种方法表明，研究者更多地依赖间接方法来研究积碳组成和形成，而非直接的积碳表征分析技术。
