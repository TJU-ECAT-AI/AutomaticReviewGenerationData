          "Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively."

"The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support."

"The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

"The coked alumina (S9) has the lowest while the coked Pt/MgO (S10) has the highest H/C ratio, which indicates that the coke formed on the alumina is relatively deficient in hydrogen while the coke formed on the Pt surfaces is rich in hydrogen."

"Increasing the propylene concentration will increase the degree of polymerization of the polymers, which will be further dehydrogenated to aromatics. The degree of the aromatization of the coke is enhanced as a result of the increased propylene concentration and weakened as a result of the increased hydrogen concentration"

"The amounts of coke formed on the spent catalysts (or coked alumina) were determined by TG (thermal gravimetric) analysis (SDT Q600, TA Company, USA) in air."

"Elemental analysis was carried out on a Vario EL III Elementar analyzer."

"FTIR analysis was carried out on a Bruker Equinox-55 with a resolution of 4.0 cm1 and the scanned wave number was ranged from 4000 to 400 cm1."

"Raman analysis was performed at room temperature under ambient conditions on a Renishaw inVia + Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser beam."

          The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. Location: Two types of coke are identified - coke on the metal and coke on the support.

2. Composition: 
   - Coke on metal: Softer, contains more hydrogen (higher H/C ratio)
   - Coke on support: Harder, contains less hydrogen (lower H/C ratio)

3. Effect of reaction conditions:
   - On metal: Coke formation increases with propane pressure, weakly dependent on propylene and hydrogen pressures
   - On support: Coke formation increases with propane and propylene pressures, decreases with hydrogen pressure
   - Higher propylene concentration leads to increased polymerization and aromatization
   - Higher hydrogen concentration reduces aromatization

4. Catalyst type: The nature of coke varies between different catalysts (e.g., PtSn/Al2O3 vs Pt/MgO)

Several analytical techniques were employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) profiles: Used to identify and distinguish between coke on metal and support
2. Thermal Gravimetric (TG) Analysis: Determined the amounts of coke formed on spent catalysts
3. Elemental Analysis: Used to determine the H/C ratio of the coke
4. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy: Identified different functional groups in the coke
5. Raman Spectroscopy: Studied the degree of graphitization and the nature of carbon species in the coke

These techniques collectively provided a comprehensive understanding of the coke composition, structure, and formation mechanisms under various reaction conditions and catalyst types in PDH systems.

          在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著变化：

1. 位置：识别出两种类型的焦炭 - 金属上的焦炭和载体上的焦炭。

2. 组成：
   - 金属上的焦炭：较软，含氢量更高（更高的H/C比）
   - 载体上的焦炭：较硬，含氢量较低（较低的H/C比）

3. 反应条件的影响：
   - 在金属上：焦炭形成随丙烷压力增加而增加，对丙烯和氢气压力的依赖性较弱
   - 在载体上：焦炭形成随丙烷和丙烯压力增加而增加，随氢气压力增加而减少
   - 较高的丙烯浓度导致聚合和芳构化程度增加
   - 较高的氢气浓度减少芳构化程度

4. 催化剂类型：不同催化剂（如PtSn/Al2O3和Pt/MgO）上焦炭的性质有所不同

采用了几种分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性：

1. 程序升温氧化(TPO)谱：用于识别和区分金属和载体上的焦炭
2. 热重(TG)分析：确定已使用催化剂上形成的焦炭量
3. 元素分析：用于测定焦炭的H/C比
4. 傅里叶变换红外(FTIR)光谱：识别焦炭中的不同官能团
5. 拉曼光谱：研究焦炭中石墨化程度和碳物种的性质

这些技术共同为理解PDH系统中在各种反应条件和催化剂类型下的焦炭组成、结构和形成机理提供了全面的认识。
