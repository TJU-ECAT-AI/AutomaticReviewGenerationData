          "According to TEM, the morphology of mature carbonaceous deposits obtained in atmospheric-pressure flow experiments corresponds to extended graphene sheets which originate on small (1.52 nm) Pt nanoparticles and continuously shift onto the support."

"On the support surface, thin graphene sheets undergo severe deformations and form disordered layers and entangled spaghetti-like bundles, possibly also containing carbon nanotubes."

"Graphene formed on larger (510 nm) Pt nanoparticles does not shift onto the support, but forms encapsulating graphitic layers, also in agreement with Peng et al. [27]."

"Carbon deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous and consist primarily of graphene, yet their oxidation is a complicated process involving both chemical reactions and transport processes on the support surface."

"The assignment of coke to disordered graphene is consistent with Raman spectra (see Fig. 3). Namely, the ratio of D and G band intensities for the coked sample is 1.5, which is suggestive of the significant disorder in graphene"

          The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies depending on reaction conditions and catalyst types, particularly the size of Pt nanoparticles:

1. On small Pt nanoparticles (1.5-2 nm): Extended graphene sheets form and shift onto the support, where they undergo deformation, forming disordered layers and entangled structures.

2. On larger Pt nanoparticles (5-10 nm): Graphene forms encapsulating graphitic layers without shifting to the support.

The coke deposits on Pt/Mg(Al)Ox catalysts are chemically homogeneous, consisting primarily of graphene-like structures. However, these structures show significant disorder, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy (D to G band intensity ratio of 1.5).

Analytical techniques employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents include:

1. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM): For morphological analysis and visualization of coke deposits.
2. Raman spectroscopy: For structural characterization and determination of graphene disorder.
3. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO): For studying oxidation behavior and characterizing coke on supported metal catalysts.
4. Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP): For time-resolved analysis of coke formation and oxidation.
5. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM): For structural analysis of coked samples before and after partial oxidative regeneration.

These techniques provide complementary information about the structure, composition, and behavior of coke deposits in PDH systems, revealing the complex nature of coke formation and its dependence on catalyst properties and reaction conditions.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因反应条件和催化剂类型而异，特别是Pt纳米颗粒的大小：

1. 在小的Pt纳米颗粒（1.5-2 nm）上：形成延伸的石墨烯片并转移到载体上，在那里它们发生变形，形成无序层和缠结结构。

2. 在较大的Pt纳米颗粒（5-10 nm）上：石墨烯形成包覆的石墨层，不会转移到载体上。

Pt/Mg(Al)Ox催化剂上的积碳沉积物在化学上是均匀的，主要由类石墨烯结构组成。然而，这些结构显示出显著的无序性，这一点通过拉曼光谱（D带与G带强度比为1.5）得到证实。

用于阐明积碳成分性质和多样性的分析技术包括：

1. 透射电子显微镜（TEM）：用于形态分析和积碳沉积物的可视化。
2. 拉曼光谱：用于结构表征和确定石墨烯的无序程度。
3. 程序升温氧化（TPO）：用于研究氧化行为和表征负载金属催化剂上的积碳。
4. 瞬态分析产物（TAP）：用于积碳形成和氧化的时间分辨分析。
5. 高分辨透射电子显微镜（HRTEM）：用于分析部分氧化再生前后积碳样品的结构。

这些技术为PDH系统中积碳沉积物的结构、组成和行为提供了互补信息，揭示了积碳形成的复杂性及其对催化剂性质和反应条件的依赖性。
