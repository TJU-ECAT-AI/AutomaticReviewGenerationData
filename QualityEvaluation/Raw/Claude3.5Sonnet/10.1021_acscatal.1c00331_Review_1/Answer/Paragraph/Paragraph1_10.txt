Coke formation in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that significantly impacts catalyst performance and longevity. The composition and structure of coke deposits can vary widely, depending on factors such as reaction temperature, pressure, and feed composition. Different catalyst types, including supported platinum and chromium-based catalysts, exhibit distinct coking behaviors and susceptibilities. Advanced analytical techniques, such as temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and various spectroscopic methods, have been instrumental in elucidating the nature of these deposits. These tools reveal that coke can range from highly ordered graphitic structures to amorphous carbon, with varying degrees of hydrogen content and metal incorporation. The variability in coke characteristics necessitates tailored approaches to catalyst design and regeneration strategies. Understanding the intricate relationship between reaction conditions, catalyst properties, and coke formation mechanisms is crucial for optimizing PDH processes and developing more coke-resistant catalytic systems.
