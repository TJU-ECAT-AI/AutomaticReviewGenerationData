[1] "This review presents available material on the formation, nature and properties of coke in high silica zeolite catalysts, and on the resulting deactivation and regeneration of the catalysts."

[2] "Techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, the role of acid sites in coke formation and the chemistry of coke formation are discussed, with particular emphasis on the methanol to gasoline process."

[3] "The formation of coke during hydrocarbon transformations over acid zeolite catalysts has important practical consequences for a growing number of industrial processes."

The literature provided does not contain specific information about coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or a detailed comparison of coke composition across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The review focuses on coke formation in high-silica zeolites, particularly in the methanol-to-gasoline process, rather than PDH reactions.

However, the document does mention that coke formation is an important issue in various hydrocarbon transformations over acid zeolite catalysts. It also indicates that the review covers techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, as well as discussing the formation, nature, and properties of coke in high-silica zeolite catalysts. While not specific to PDH reactions, these general concepts and analytical techniques may be applicable to studying coke deposits in various catalytic systems, including PDH.

The review does not provide details on the specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. To get a comprehensive answer to the question, additional literature specifically focused on coke formation in PDH reactions and analytical techniques for coke characterization would be needed.

所提供的文献并不包含关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积碳沉积物的具体信息，也没有详细比较不同反应条件和催化剂类型下积碳组成的变化。这篇综述主要关注高硅沸石中的积碳形成，特别是在甲醇制汽油过程中，而不是PDH反应。

然而，文档确实提到积碳形成是酸性沸石催化剂上各种烃类转化反应中的一个重要问题。它还指出，这篇综述涵盖了分析和表征积碳的技术，并讨论了高硅沸石催化剂中积碳的形成、性质和特性。虽然这些内容并不特定于PDH反应，但这些一般概念和分析技术可能适用于研究各种催化系统中的积碳沉积物，包括PDH。

这篇综述并未提供用于阐明积碳成分复杂性和多样性的具体分析技术的详细信息。要获得对这个问题的全面回答，需要额外查阅专门针对PDH反应中积碳形成和积碳表征分析技术的文献。
