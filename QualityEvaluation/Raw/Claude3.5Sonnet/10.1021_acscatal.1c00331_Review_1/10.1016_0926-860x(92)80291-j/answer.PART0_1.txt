[1] "The formation of coke during hydrocarbon transformations over acid zeolite catalysts has important practical consequences for a growing number of industrial processes."

[2] "This review presents available material on the formation, nature and properties of coke in high silica zeolite catalysts, and on the resulting deactivation and regeneration of the catalysts."

[3] "Techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, the role of acid sites in coke formation and the chemistry of coke formation are discussed, with particular emphasis on the methanol to gasoline process."

The literature provided does not contain specific information about coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or how the composition varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The review focuses primarily on coke formation in high-silica zeolite catalysts, with emphasis on the methanol-to-gasoline process. While it mentions techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, it does not provide details on the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems. The document discusses coke formation in general terms for acid zeolite catalysts but does not address the specific questions about PDH reactions.

提供的文献中没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积碳沉积物的具体信息，也没有说明其组成如何随不同反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。这篇综述主要关注高硅沸石催化剂中的积碳形成，重点是甲醇制汽油过程。虽然提到了分析和表征积碳的技术，但没有提供PDH系统中积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性的详细信息。文档以一般术语讨论了酸性沸石催化剂中的积碳形成，但没有涉及有关PDH反应的具体问题。
