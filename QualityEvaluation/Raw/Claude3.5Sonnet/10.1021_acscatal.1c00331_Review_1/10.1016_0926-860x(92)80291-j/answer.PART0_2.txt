The literature does not provide specific information about coke composition in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or how it varies across different conditions and catalyst types. The review focuses primarily on coke formation in high-silica zeolite catalysts, particularly in the methanol-to-gasoline process. While it mentions that coke formation occurs during hydrocarbon transformations over acid zeolite catalysts in various industrial processes, it does not delve into the specifics of PDH reactions.

The document indicates that there are techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, but it does not provide details on these methods or their application to elucidate the complex nature of coke constituents. The review appears to cover the formation, nature, and properties of coke in a general sense, as well as its impact on catalyst deactivation and regeneration, but lacks the specific information requested about PDH reactions and detailed analytical techniques for coke characterization.

这篇文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭组成的具体信息,也没有说明它如何随不同条件和催化剂类型而变化。这篇综述主要集中在高硅沸石催化剂中的焦炭形成,特别是甲醇制汽油过程。虽然它提到焦炭形成发生在各种工业过程中酸性沸石催化剂上的烃类转化过程中,但并没有深入探讨PDH反应的具体情况。

文献指出有分析和表征焦炭的技术,但没有提供这些方法的详细信息,也没有说明如何应用这些方法来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性质。这篇综述似乎从总体上涵盖了焦炭的形成、性质和特性,以及它对催化剂失活和再生的影响,但缺乏关于PDH反应的具体信息和焦炭表征的详细分析技术。
