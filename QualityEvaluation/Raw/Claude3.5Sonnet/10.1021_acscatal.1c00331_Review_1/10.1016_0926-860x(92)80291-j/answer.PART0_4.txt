[1] "The formation of coke during hydrocarbon transformations over acid zeolite catalysts has important practical consequences for a growing number of industrial processes."

[2] "This review presents available material on the formation, nature and properties of coke in high silica zeolite catalysts, and on the resulting deactivation and regeneration of the catalysts."

[3] "Techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, the role of acid sites in coke formation and the chemistry of coke formation are discussed, with particular emphasis on the methanol to gasoline process."

The literature provided does not contain specific information about coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or their variation across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The review focuses primarily on coke formation in high-silica zeolites, particularly in the methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) process. While it mentions techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, it does not provide details on the composition of coke deposits in PDH systems or the analytical techniques used specifically for those systems. The review does discuss coke formation in various processes such as cracking, hydrocracking, alkene oligomerization, and alkylation, but does not specifically address PDH reactions. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based on the given literature.

所提供的文献中并没有关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭沉积物的具体信息，也没有涉及它们在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下的变化。这篇综述主要关注高硅沸石中的焦炭形成，特别是在甲醇制汽油(MTG)过程中。虽然文中提到了分析和表征焦炭的技术，但并未提供PDH系统中焦炭沉积物成分的详细信息，也没有具体说明用于这些系统的分析技术。综述确实讨论了在各种过程中的焦炭形成，如裂解、加氢裂解、烯烃低聚和烷基化，但并未特别提及PDH反应。因此，基于给定的文献无法完整回答这个问题。
