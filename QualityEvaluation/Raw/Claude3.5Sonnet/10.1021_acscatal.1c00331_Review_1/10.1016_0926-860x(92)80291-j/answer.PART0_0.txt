[1] "The formation of coke during hydrocarbon transformations over acid zeolite catalysts has important practical consequences for a growing number of industrial processes."

[2] "This review presents available material on the formation, nature and properties of coke in high silica zeolite catalysts, and on the resulting deactivation and regeneration of the catalysts."

[3] "Techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke, the role of acid sites in coke formation and the chemistry of coke formation are discussed, with particular emphasis on the methanol to gasoline process."

The literature does not provide specific information about coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or how the composition varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The review focuses primarily on coke formation in high-silica zeolite catalysts, particularly in the methanol-to-gasoline process. While it mentions that coke formation occurs during hydrocarbon transformations over acid zeolite catalysts, it does not go into detail about PDH reactions.

The document indicates that techniques for analyzing and characterizing coke are discussed, but it does not specify which analytical techniques are used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. The review appears to cover the formation, nature, and properties of coke in high-silica zeolite catalysts, as well as the resulting deactivation and regeneration of these catalysts, but does not provide specific details about the composition of coke deposits or how they vary across different systems.

该文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中焦炭沉积物的具体信息，也没有说明其组成如何随不同反应条件和催化剂类型而变化。这篇综述主要集中在高硅沸石催化剂中的焦炭形成，特别是在甲醇制汽油过程中。虽然它提到焦炭形成发生在酸性沸石催化剂上的碳氢化合物转化过程中，但并没有详细讨论PDH反应。

文档指出讨论了分析和表征焦炭的技术，但没有具体说明使用哪些分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性。该综述似乎涵盖了高硅沸石催化剂中焦炭的形成、性质和特性，以及由此导致的催化剂失活和再生，但没有提供关于焦炭沉积物组成的具体细节，也没有说明它们在不同系统中如何变化。
