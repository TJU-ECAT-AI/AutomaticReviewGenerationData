The given literature does not contain specific information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents. The document focuses mainly on the catalytic performance of differently shaped Pt nanoparticles in propane dehydrogenation, discussing their activity, selectivity, and stability. While coke formation is briefly mentioned as a factor in catalyst deactivation, the detailed composition of coke deposits and analytical techniques for their characterization are not addressed in this particular text.
