          [1] "The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)1 ks1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively, on the basis of the amount of coke measured by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)."

          [2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

          The literature provides limited information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It does not explore how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or catalyst types. The only analytical technique mentioned for studying coke is temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), which was used to measure the amount of coke formed on cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles. The study focuses more on comparing coke formation rates and deactivation effects between these two types of Pt nanoparticles rather than analyzing the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)^-1 ks^-1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively. As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 hours, respectively. More detailed research would be needed to fully answer the question about the composition of coke deposits and the diversity of analytical techniques used to study them in PDH reactions.

          该文献对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成提供了有限的信息。它没有探讨焦炭组成如何随不同反应条件或催化剂类型而变化。唯一提到的用于研究焦炭的分析技术是程序升温氧化法(TPO)，用于测量立方体和八面体Pt纳米颗粒上形成的焦炭量。该研究更多地集中在比较这两种类型的Pt纳米颗粒之间的焦炭形成速率和失活效应，而不是分析焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性。在立方体和八面体Pt纳米颗粒上，焦炭形成速率分别估计为4.3和2.8 mg (g表面Pt)^-1 ks^-1。由于焦炭形成，立方体和八面体颗粒上丙烯形成的活性在不到3小时内分别下降了33%和22%。要全面回答关于PDH反应中焦炭沉积物组成和用于研究它们的分析技术多样性的问题，需要进行更详细的研究。
