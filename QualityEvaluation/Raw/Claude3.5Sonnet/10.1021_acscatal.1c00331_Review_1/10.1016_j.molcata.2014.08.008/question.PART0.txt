Shaped
 metal  particles  are  known
 to possess
 distinct  catalytic
 properties,
 which
 is often
 attributed
 to
the
 catalytic  activities
 of  different
 particle  facets.
 In this  contribution,
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 on
 Pt
particles
 of  different
 shapes
 is  investigated
 by  a combination
 of  experiments
 and  DFT  calculations.
 The
selectivity
 toward
 propylene
 and  catalyst
 stability  in  propane
 dehydrogenation
 can  be  enhanced
 by shap-
ing
 Pt  nanoparticles
 under
 industrially
 relevant
 conditions.
 Octahedral
 particles  (12.0  nm)  dominated
 by
the
 Pt(1  1 1)  surface
 have  higher
 selectivity
 toward  propylene
 production
 and  better  stability
 than
 cubic
particles
 (11.5  nm)
 that  are  dominated
 by  the  Pt(1  0  0)  surface.
 Combined
 experiments
 and  DFT
 calcula-
tions
 suggest
 that  the  weakened
 binding
 strength
 of propylene
 and  increased
 energy  barrier  for  the  CH
bond
 cleavage
 in  propylene
 dehydrogenation
 on  Pt(1  1 1)  compared
 to  Pt(1  0 0)  and
 Pt(2  1  1)  contribute
to
 the  higher
 selectivity
 toward
 propylene
 by  lowering
 the formation
 possibility
 of
 the  deeply
 dehy-
drogenated
 intermediates.
 When
 coke  is formed
 on  the  Pt  surface,
 the  d-band
 of  surrounding
 Pt  atoms
is
 shifted  farther
 below
 the  Fermi  level,  leading  to  the  deactivation
 of  Pt  catalyst.
 Our  DFT
 calculations
provide
 a rational
 interpretation
 of  the  experimental
 observations
 regarding
 the  shape
 effects
 on  propane
dehydrogenation.

 Introduction
With
 the
 ever-increasing
 worldwide
 demand
 for
 light
 olefins,
extensive
 efforts
 have
 been
 devoted
 to
 developing
 alternative
routes
 for
 light
 olefin
 production
 [15].
 As
 alkanes
 are
 relatively
inexpensive,
 dehydrogenation
 of
 alkanes
 to
 olefins
 has
 remained
a
 focus
 of
 fundamental
 research
 and
 technical
 development
 for
 a
long
 time
 [4,5].
 The
 dehydrogenation
 process
 has
 the
 advantages
of
 high
 activity,
 simple
 down-stream
 separation,
 and
 high
 atom
efficiency,
 and
 the
 byproducts,
 such
 as
 C2H4 and
 H2,
 are
 also
 very
useful
 raw
 materials
 and
 energy
 fuels
 [6].
 The
 main
 challenge
 of
alkane
 dehydrogenation
 is
 to
 achieve
 a
 very
 high
 catalyst
 selectiv-
ity
 and
 stability.
 A
 low
 selectivity
 results
 in
 not
 only
 a
 lower
 yield
 of
target
 products
 but
 also
 a
 rapid
 catalyst
 deactivation
 arising
 from
the
 encapsulation
 of
 active
 metal
 particles
 by
 side
 products
 such
 as
coke.

Pt
 has
 a
 high
 catalytic
 activity
 for
 alkane
 dehydrogenation
 and
has
 been
 commercially
 used
 in
 Oleflex
 for
 propane
 dehydrogena-
tion
 (PDH)
 [3,7].
 However,
 Pt
 is
 also
 active
 for
 CC
 bond
 cleavage,
which
 gives
 rise
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 undesired
 byproducts,
 such
as
 CH4 and
 C2H4 [4,5]. To
 improve
 the
 catalyst
 performance,
 recent
studies
 have
 been
 focused
 mainly
 on
 the
 modification
 of
 Pt
 catalyst
via
 three
 possible
 means.
 The
 most
 popular
 way
 is
 to
 alloy
 Pt
 with
 a
second
 metal
 or
 even
 a
 third
 metal.
 Sn
 is
 often
 used
 as
 the
 additive
 in
Pt
 catalyst
 because
 it
 can
 reduce
 the
 size
 of
 Pt
 surface
 ensembles.
 It
also
 helps
 to
 hinder
 the
 formation
 of
 highly
 dehydrogenated
 hydro-
carbons
 which
 finally
 leads
 to
 coke
 and
 other
 undesired
 byproducts
[8,9].
 Compared
 with
 pure
 Pt
 catalyst,
 PtSn
 alloy
 has
 a
 greater
 sta-
bility
 and
 higher
 selectivity
 but
 lower
 activity.[3,4,9,10]
 The
 second
method
 is
 to
 make
 use
 of
 different
 supports,
 such
 as
 -Al2O3 [11],
-Al2O3 [11,12],
 -Al2O3 [3],
 SAPO-34
 [13],
 SBA-15
 [6], ZSM-5
 [14],
etc.,
 to
 vary
 the
 interaction
 between
 active
 metals
 and
 supports
 and
thus
 the
 catalytic
 performance.
 For
 instance,
 on
 the
 Pt-Sn
 catalyst
Sn
 interacts
 with
 the
 -Al2O3 support
 and
 is
 stablized
 in
 an
 oxi-
dized
 form,
 which
 results
 in
 an
 increase
 in
 Pt
 dispersion
 and
 in
 an
improvement
 of
 the
 stability
 of
 the
 catalytic
 activity,
 while
 on
 SiO2
Sn
 is
 reduced
 and
 is
 stablized
 in
 an
 alloyed
 Pt-Sn
 form,
 which

to
 a
 strong
 reduction
 in
 the
 specific
 activity
 [3].
 As
 another
 exam-
ple,
 ZSM-5
 supported
 Pt-based
 catalyst
 showed
 unprecedented
 site
activity,
 selectivity,
 and
 stability
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 com-
pared
 to
 classical
 PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst
 [15,16].
 Moreover,
 Kumar
et
 al.
 reported
 that
 the
 activity,
 selectivity
 to
 propylene,
 and
 sta-
bility
 of
 the
 Pt-based
 catalyst
 could
 be
 tuned
 by
 modifying
 the
pore
 geometry
 of
 the
 supports
 [17].
 The
 last
 strategy
 is
 to
 engi-
neer
 the
 surface
 electronic
 structure
 by
 controlling
 the
 Pt
 surface
geometry.
Recent
 progress
 in
 nanocatalysis
 by
 sizing
 and
 shaping
 nanopar-
ticles
 provides
 new
 approaches
 to
 tune
 the
 catalyst
 activity,
selectivity,
 and
 stability
 [1822].
 For
 a
 nanocrystal
 of
 different
 sizes,
the
 ratios
 of
 surface
 atoms
 of
 different
 types
 (e.g.,
 corner,
 step,
and
 terrace)
 are
 different.
 The
 fraction
 of
 the
 atoms
 located
 on
terraces
 increases
 with
 particle
 size
 while
 the
 coordinatively
 unsat-
urated
 atoms
 become
 less.
 This
 change
 leads
 to
 the
 variations
 in
activity
 and
 selectivity
 for
 structure-sensitive
 reactions
 [23].
 For
propane
 dehydrogenation,
 small
 Pt
 particles
 containing
 more
 step
sites
 were
 found
 to
 be
 more
 active
 but
 less
 selective
 than
 large
particles
 [5].
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 shape
 variation
 can
 result
 in
important
 morphological
 differences.
 For
 instance,
 cubic
 particles
are
 dominated
 by
 the
 (1
 0
 0)
 surface
 while
 tetrahedral
 particles
are
 surrounded
 by
 the
 (1
 1
 1)
 surface,
 and
 cuboctahedra
 have
 both
the
 two
 planes
 exposed
 [24].
 This
 difference
 in
 superficial
 struc-
ture
 leads
 to
 a
 shape
 effect,
 especially
 when
 each
 type
 of
 surface
atoms
 possesses
 distinct
 reactivity
 [22,2527].
 Studies
 using
 sin-
gle
 crystals
 and
 density
 functional
 theory
 (DFT)
 calculations
 have
shown
 that
 different
 Pt
 surfaces
 exhibit
 different
 catalytic
 activ-
ity
 and
 selectivity
 for
 certain
 reactions,
 such
 as
 ammonia
 synthesis
[28,29],
 isomerization
 between
 2-butene
 isomers
 [22,30],
 ethanol
oxidation
 [31],
 etc.
 For
 the
 moderate
 structure-sensitive
 reactions,
such
 as
 ammonia
 decomposition,
 the
 difference
 in
 catalytic
 activity
between
 Pt(1
 1
 1),
 Pt(1
 0
 0),
 and
 Pt(2
 1
 1)
 is
 very
 small,
 as
 evidenced
by
 recent
 theoretical
 calculations
 [32,33].
The
 present
 work
 focuses
 on
 experimental
 and
 theoretical
investigations
 of
 the
 relationship
 between
 the
 Pt
 surface
 properties
and
 catalytic
 performance
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation,
 aiming
 to
provide
 a
 way
 to
 tune
 the
 catalytic
 performance
 of
 Pt
 catalyst
 by
controlling
 the
 shape
 of
 metal
 particles.
 The
 dominating
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
and
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 surfaces
 are
 prepared
 by
 selective
 synthesis
 of
 octa-
hedral
 and
 cubic
 Pt
 nanoparticles.
 The
 effects
 of
 Pt
 facets
 on
 the
activity
 and
 selectivity
 for
 propane
 dehydrogenation
 are
 studied
 on
resultant
 differently
 shaped
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 in
 a
 fixed
 bed
 reactor.
To
 gain
 deeper
 insight
 into
 the
 reaction
 mechanism
 on
 different
Pt
 surface,
 we
 perform
 detailed
 DFT
 calculations
 on
 different
 Pt
facets,
 namely,
 Pt(1
 1
 1),
 Pt(1
 0
 0),
 and
 Pt(2
 1
 1),
 which
 provides
 an
atomic-level
 understanding
 of
 the
 effects
 of
 surface
 Pt
 properties
such
 as
 the
 coordination
 number
 on
 the
 selective
 CH
 and
 CC
 bond
activation
 in
 propane
 dehydrogenation.
 Finally,
 the
 theoretical
insights
 of
 the
 H
 and
 C
 co-adsorption
 effects
 on
 different
 Pt
 sur-
faces
 help
 to
 explain
 the
 deactivation
 of
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 due
 to
 coke
formation.

 Experimental
 and
 computational
 details
2.1.
 Experimental
 method
Cubic
 and
 octahedral
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 were
 prepared
 by
 a
 mod-
ified
 polyol
 process.
 First,
 fast
 reduction
 of
 H2PtCl6 by
 NaBH4 in
the
 presence
 of
 a
 large
 amount
 of
 poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
 PVP,
which
 acted
 as
 the
 capping
 agent,
 was
 conducted,
 thus
 producing
a
 homogeneous
 solution
 of
 thermodynamically
 favorable
 small
 Pt
seeds
 of
 spherical
 shape.
 A
 subsequent
 slow
 addition
 of
 H2PtCl6-
EG
 solution
 to
 the
 Pt
 seed
 sol
 led
 to
 larger
 nanoparticles
 (>10
 nm
in
 particle
 size).
 Addition
 of
 Ag+
 changed
 the
 reduction
 rate
 of
the
 Pt
 precursor
 and
 thus
 the
 growth
 rate
 of
 nanoparticles
 toward
different
 directions
 [34].
 The
 excess
 of
 capping
 agent
 was
 washed
away
 by
 large
 volumes
 (up
 to
 20
 times
 than
 the
 volume
 of
 product
solution)
 of
 acetone
 and
 ethanol.
 Cubic
 (11.5
 nm)
 and
 octahedral
(12.0
 nm)
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 were
 then
 prepared.
 Fig.
 1
 shows
 the
high-resolution
 transmission
 electron
 microscope
 (HRTEM)
 images
of
 the
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 with
 a
 narrow
 size
 distribution.
 About
 200
particles
 were
 measured
 to
 get
 the
 average
 particle
 size.
 The
 cubic
particles
 are
 surrounded
 by
 six
 (1
 0
 0)
 facets
 while
 the
 octahedral
ones
 are
 surrounded
 by
 eight
 (1
 1
 1)
 facets,
 which
 have
 been
 con-
firmed
 by
 both
 HRTEM
 and
 XRD.
 The
 dispersions
 of
 8.6%
 and
 8.0%
corresponding
 to
 13
 and
 14
 nm
 of
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 were
 obtained
by
 hydrogen
 chemisorption
 with
 a
 Micromeritics
 ASAP2010,
 which
are
 comparable
 to
 the
 TEM
 results.
 These
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 are
 sup-
ported
 on
 hydrotalcite
 derived
 mixed
 oxides
 Mg(Al)O,
 without
obvious
 change
 in
 morphology.
Apart
 from
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 and
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 on
 the
 cubic
 and
 octahedral
particles,
 respectively,
 a
 certain
 number
 of
 steps
 are
 involved
 in
both
 the
 particles.
 Because
 the
 population
 of
 steps
 is
 inversely
 pro-
portional
 to
 the
 size
 of
 Pt
 particles,
 the
 effect
 of
 steps
 on
 the
 catalytic
behavior
 depends
 significantly
 on
 Pt
 particle
 size.
 On
 small
 parti-
cles,
 it
 has
 been
 shown
 that
 the
 activity
 of
 Pt
 catalyst
 is
 dominated
by
 steps.
 For
 instance,
 tetrahedral
 particles
 which
 contain
 more
steps
 exhibit
 higher
 activity
 than
 cubic
 ones
 [25].
 In
 the
 present
work,
 we  successfully
 prepared
 large
 cubic
 and
 octahedral
 Pt
 par-
ticles,
 with
 a
 narrow
 size
 distribution
 and
 an
 average
 size
 of
 about
12
 nm.
 The
 amount
 of
 steps
 is
 estimated
 to
 be
 very
 small
 accord-
ing
 to
 the
 model
 proposed
 by
 Hardeveld
 and
 Hartog
 [23].
 For
 the
cubic
 particles
 the
 atoms
 located
 on
 the
 steps
 are
 only
 2.9%
 of
 the
surface
 atoms
 and
 0.2%
 of
 the
 overall
 atoms,
 and
 for
 the
 octahe-
dral
 particles
 (12.0
 nm)
 the
 fractions
 are
 calculated
 to
 be
 6.6%
 and
0.8%,
 respectively.
 Therefore,
 the
 activity
 contribution
 from
 steps
is
 probably
 overridden
 by
 that
 from
 flat
 surfaces
 on
 large
 metal
 par-
ticles.
 As
 a
 result,
 cubic
 and
 octahedral
 Pt
 particles
 can
 be
 used
 as
model
 systems
 to
 study
 the
 selective
 CC
 and
 CH
 bond
 cleavage
on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 and
 Pt(1
 1
 1),
 respectively.

 Computational
 method
All
 total
 energy
 density
 functional
 theory
 calculations
 were
 car-
ried
 out
 with
 the
 VASP
 package
 using
 plane
 wave
 basis
 sets
 [3537].
The
 exchange-correlation
 functional
 utilized
 was
 the
 generalized
gradient
 approximation
 proposed
 by
 Perdew
 et
 al.
 [38].
 A
 plane
wave
 energy
 cut
 off
 of
 400
 eV
 was
 used
 in
 these
 calculations
 to
achieve
 a
 tight
 convergence.
 The
 interactions
 between
 valence
 elec-
trons
 and
 ion
 cores
 were
 represented
 by
 Blchls
 all-electron-like
projector
 augmented
 wave
 method
 (PAW)
 [39],
 which
 regarded
the
 6s
 5d
 states
 as
 the
 valence
 configuration
 for
 Pt,
 2s
 2p
 states
for
 C
 and
 1s
 state
 for
 H.
 Brillouin
 zone
 sampling
 was
 performed
 by
using
 a
 Monkhorst-Pack
 grid
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 symmetry
 of
 the
system
 and
 the
 electronic
 occupancies
 were
 determined
 according
to
 a
 Methfessel-Paxton
 scheme
 [40]
 with
 an
 energy
 smearing
 of
0.2
 eV.
 The
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 and
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 surfaces
 were
 modeled
 by
 p(3
 ×
 3)
supercells
 with
 four-layer
 slabs,
 achieving
 an
 adsorbate
 coverage
of
 1/9
 ML.
 The
 equilibrium
 PtPt
 interatomic
 distance
 was
 calcu-
lated
 to
 be
 2.82 
A.
 The
 successive
 slabs
 were
 separated
 by
 a
 vacuum
region
 as
 thick
 as
 12 
A
 in
 order
 to
 avoid
 periodic
 interactions.
 In
our
 calculations,
 the
 bottom
 two
 atomic
 layers
 were
 fixed
 at
 equi-
librium
 bulk
 positions,
 while
 all
 the
 other
 atoms
 were
 allowed
 to
relax.
 Monkhorst-Pack
 meshes
 of
 7
 ×
 7
 ×
 1
 k-point
 samplings
 in
the
 surface
 Brillouin
 zone
 were
 used
 on
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 and
 Pt(1
 0
 0).
 The
ground-state
 atomic
 geometries
 of
 bulk
 and
 surfaces
 were
 obtained
by
 minimizing
 the
 HellmanFeynman
 forces
 with
 the
 conjugate-
gradient
 algorithm
 until
 the
 total
 force
 on
 each
 ion
 was
 below
0.03
 eV/Å.

 The

 are

The
 adsorption
 energies,
 Eads,
 of
 the
 adsorbates
 on
 surfaces
were
 calculated
 by
 the
 following
 equation:
Eads =
 Eadsorbate+surface 
 (Eadsorbate +
 Esurface)
 
(1)
where
 Eadsorbate+surface was
 the
 total
 energy
 of
 the
 interacting
 sys-
tem
 of
 Pt
 surfaces
 and
 adsorbates,
 Eadsorbate the
 total
 energy
 of
 the
adsorbates
 in
 vacuum,
 and
 Esurface is
 the
 total
 energy
 of
 the
 Pt
 sur-
faces.
 A
 more
 negative
 Eads indicates
 adsorption
 is
 energetically
more
 favorable.
 As
 the
 PBE
 functional
 shows
 poor
 description
 of
 the
van
 der
 Waals
 interaction,
 the
 vdW-DF
 correlation
 functional
 pro-
posed
 by
 Dion
 et
 al.
 [41]
 and
 implemented
 by
 Klime
s  et
 al.
 [42,43]
was
 adopted
 to
 include
 the
 dispersion
 interaction
 in
 the
 calculation
on
 propane
 adsorption.
Transition
 states
 (TS)
 were
 searched
 with
 the
 minimum-mode
following
 dimer
 method
 [4446].
 The
 most
 stable
 configurations
of
 the
 reactant,
 intermediates,
 and
 products
 on
 the
 surface
 were
determined
 by
 the
 standard
 DFT
 minimization.
 Then
 these
 con-
figurations
 were
 used
 as
 the
 initial
 state,
 from
 which
 the
 dimer
method
 was
 used
 to
 find
 the
 lowest
 curvature
 mode
 and
 to
 climb
up
 the
 potential
 energy
 surface
 from
 the
 minimum
 to
 the
 saddle
point.
 All
 the
 saddle
 points
 identified
 in
 this
 work
 were
 confirmed
by
 frequency
 calculations,
 and
 only
 one
 imaginary
 frequency
 was
obtained
 at
 each
 saddle
 point.
 To
 obtain
 accurate
 forces,
 the
 total
energies
 and
 band
 structure
 energies
 were
 converged
 to
 an
 accu-
racy
 of
 1
 ×
 107 eV/atom
 during
 the
 electronic
 optimization.
 The
transition
 states
 were
 identified
 once
 the
 force
 on
 each
 atom
 was
less
 than
 0.03
 eV/Å.

3.1.
 Experimental
 results
Propane
 dehydrogenation
 was
 carried
 out
 under
 atmospheric
pressure
 at
 813
 K
 in
 a
 flow
 reactor.
 The
 feed
 consisted
 of
 3
 kPa
C3H8,
 3
 kPa
 H2,
 and
 balance
 He.
 All
 the
 experiments
 were
 per-
formed
 in
 kinetic
 regime
 and
 relatively
 low
 propane
 conversions.
The
 surface-specific
 activities,
 turnover
 frequency
 (TOF)
 for
 pro-
pylene
 was
 calculated
 by
 normalizing
 the
 mass
 activity
 to
 the
number
 of
 surface
 Pt
 atoms
 (Pts)
 determined
 by
 H2 chemisorp-
tion,
 which
 is
 a
 measure
 of
 the
 activity
 for
 selective
 CH
 bond
cleavage
 in
 the
 dehydrogenation
 reaction.
 As
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 2,
 the
activity
 for
 dehydrogenation
 and
 cracking
 on
 the
 cubic
 particles
 is
remarkably
 higher
 than
 that
 on
 the
 octahedral
 ones.
 In
 contrast,
the
 selectivity
 toward
 propylene
 is
 lower
 on
 the
 cubic
 particles
than
 that
 on
 the
 octahedral
 ones.
 At
 a
 different
 reaction
 temper-
ature
 (753
 K),
 this
 shape
 effect
 is
 found
 to
 be
 the
 same
 (S-Fig.
1
 in
 Supporting
 Information).
 The
 rates
 for
 coke
 formation
 were
estimated
 to
 be
 4.3
 and
 2.8
 mg  (g
 surface
 Pt)1 ks1 on
 the
 cubic
and
 octahedral
 Pt
 nanoparticles,
 respectively,
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 the
amount
 of
 coke
 measured
 by
 temperature
 programmed
 oxidation
(TPO).
 As
 a
 result
 of
 coke
 formation,
 the
 activities
 for
 propylene
formation
 on
 the
 cubic
 and
 octahedral
 particles
 dropped
 by
 33%
and
 22%
 in
 less
 than
 3
 h,
 respectively.
 It
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 the
TOFs
 were
 estimated
 based
 on
 Pt
 surface
 area
 of
 fresh
 catalysts,
which
 is
 measured
 by
 H2 chemisorption.
 Pt
 nanoparticles
 were
characterized
 after
 the
 deposition
 on
 supports
 and
 after
 the
 reac-
tion.
 It
 was
 found
 that
 the
 Pt
 particles
 kept
 their
 original
 sizes
 and
shapes.

3.2.1.
 Adsorption
 of
 propylene
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 and
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
Among
 all
 the
 C3
 species
 in
 PDH
 process,
 adsorption
 of
 propyl-
ene
 is
 of
 great
 significance
 because
 its
 binding
 strength
 is
 related
to
 the
 catalyst
 selectivity
 [5].
 In
 this
 work,
 the
 adsorption
 of
 pro-
pylene
 is
 investigated
 in
 their
 two
 possible
 binding
 modes,
 namely,
the
 di-
 and
 
 modes,
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 3.
 On
 Pt(1
 0
 0),
 the
 adsorp-
tion
 energy
 of
 propylene
 in
 the
 di-
 mode
 is
 1.22
 eV,
 0.15
 eV
 more
negative
 than
 that
 in
 the
 
 mode.
 This
 finding
 is
 in
 accordance
 with
the
 observations
 of
 previous
 LEED
 analysis
 and
 DFT
 investigations
[4749].
 The
 length
 of
 the
 C
 C
 bond
 in
 the
 di-
 adsorption
 mode
 is
elongated
 to
 1.49 
A,
 which
 is
 close
 to
 the
 CC
 interatomic
 distance
in
 molecular
 propane
 (1.54 
A).
 This
 provides
 evidence
 that
 the
 C
 C
bond
 is
 weakened
 by
 forming
 covalent
 bonds
 with
 Pt
 atoms.
 As
compared
 to
 our
 previous
 calculations
 [5],
 the
 adsorption
 configu-
ration
 of
 propylene
 in
 the
 di-
 mode
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 resembles
 that
 on
Pt(1
 1
 1),
 though
 the
 adsorption
 energy
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 is
 0.25
 eV
 more
negative.
 It
 is
 therefore
 reasonable
 to
 expect
 that
 the
 coverage
 of
propylene
 on
 the
 cubic
 Pt
 particles
 enclosed
 by
 the
 (1
 0
 0)
 surfaces
is
 higher
 than
 that
 on
 the
 octahedral
 particles
 surrounded
 by
 the
(1
 1
 1)
 surfaces.
To
 gain
 deeper
 insights
 into
 the
 adsorption
 behaviour
 of
 pro-
pylene
 in
 these
 two
 modes,
 we
 decomposed
 the
 adsorption
 energy
into
 three
 terms
 according
 to
 the
 scheme
 suggested
 by
 Morokuma

 and

 and

 surfaces
 (Eint)
 (see
the
 details
 in
 Supporting
 Information).
 Table
 1
 lists
 the
 calculated
results
 for
 the
 decomposition.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 di-
 bonding
 on
both
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 and
 Pt(1
 0
 0),
 propylene
 undergoes
 a
 significant
 dis-
tortion
 upon
 adsorption.
 The
 C
 C
 bond
 is
 elongated
 by
 0.14
 and
0.13 
A
 on
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 and
 Pt(1
 0
 0),
 respectively,
 which
 gives
 rise
 to
the
 high
 adsorbate
 deformation
 energies.
 Earlier
 theoretical
 studies
have
 reported
 close
 deformation
 energies
 for
 propylene
 adsorp-
tion
 on
 the
 PtSn
 surfaces
 [52,53].
 Meanwhile,
 the
 adsorption
 also
induces
 small
 surface
 reconstruction,
 and
 the
 deformation
 ener-
gies
 are
 lower
 than
 0.20
 eV
 on
 both
 surfaces,
 which
 are
 only
 515%
of
 the
 adsorbate
 deformation
 energies
 and
 interaction
 energies.
 In
the
 
 adsorption
 mode,
 the
 magnitudes
 of
 Edef,mol are
 much
 lower
than
 those
 of
 the
 di-
 bonding
 on
 both
 surfaces,
 which
 is
 consis-
tent
 with
 the
 findings
 by
 Delbecq
 and
 Zaera
 [30].
 In
 contrast,
 the
surface
 deformation
 energy
 is
 slightly
 increased
 but
 is
 still
 lower
than
 Edef,mol.
 The
 absolute
 value
 of
 Eint is
 much
 higher
 than
 those
of
 the
 other
 two
 terms,
 indicating
 that
 the
 adsorption
 energy
 of
propylene
 is
 determined
 largely
 by
 the
 direct
 interaction
 between
propylene
 and
 Pt.
 With
 the
 adsorption
 mode
 varying
 from
 di-
to
 ,
 the
 absolute
 value
 of
 Eint is
 reduced
 by
 1.07
 and
 1.43
 eV
 on
Pt(1
 0
 0)
 and
 Pt(1
 1
 1),
 respectively,
 which
 are
 higher
 than
 the
 vari-
ations
 in
 the
 other
 two
 terms.
 This
 indicates
 that
 the
 variation
 in
the
 adsorption
 energy
 of
 propylene
 caused
 by
 the
 shift
 in
 propyl-
ene
 adsorption
 mode
 is
 dominated
 by
 the
 change
 in
 the
 interaction
energy.
The
 adsorption
 energies
 for
 the
 other
 species,
 such
 as
 1-propyl
and
 2-propyl,
 are
 given
 in
 Supporting
 Information
 (S-Table
 1),
which
 also
 follows
 the
 similar
 trend
 that
 the
 chemisorption
 on
Pt(1
 0
 0)
 is
 stronger
 than
 those
 on
 Pt(1
 1
 1).

 shows
 the
 elementary
 steps
 involved
 in
 propane
 dehy-
drogenation,
 which
 includes
 both
 the
 CH
 and
 CC
 bond
 cleavage.
These
 elementary
 steps
 can
 be
 classified
 into
 three
 categories.
 The
first
 group
 consists
 of
 the
 dehydrogenation
 steps
 from
 propane
 to
propylene
 (Steps
 14
 in
 Fig.
 4),
 and
 the
 energy
 barriers
 for
 these
four
 steps
 are
 good
 descriptors
 for
 the
 catalytic
 activity
 of
 Pt
 sur-
faces
 for
 propylene
 production.
 The
 second
 group
 contains
 the
 deep
dehydrogenation
 steps
 of
 propylene
 to
 1-propenyl
 and
 2-propenyl,
namely,
 Steps
 5
 and
 6
 in
 Fig.
 4,
 and
 the
 activation
 energy
 difference
between
 propylene
 desorption
 and
 these
 two
 steps
 is
 traditionally
used
 to
 evaluate
 the
 selectivity
 toward
 propylene
 [5].
 The
 third
one
 includes
 the
 CC
 bond
 cleavage
 reactions,
 namely,
 propane,
1-propyl,
 2-propyl,
 and
 propylene
 cracking
 (Steps
 710
 in
 Fig.
 4).
The
 energy
 barriers
 for
 these
 reactions
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 are
 listed
 in
Table
 2,
 where
 the
 corresponding
 data
 on
 Pt(1

 are
 also
 given
for
 comparison.

 states
 for

 it
 is
 known
 that

 for

 [5].
 The
 activation
 energies,
however,
 can
 be
 dramatically
 lowered
 with
 the
 introduction
 of
 Pt
catalyst.
 On
 Pt(1
 0
 0),
 the
 energy
 barriers
 for
 the
 initial
 activation
 of
the
 CH
 bonds
 at
 the
 methyl
 (Step
 1)
 and
 methylene
 groups
 (Step

 are
 calculated
 to
 be
 0.43
 and
 0.42
 eV,
 respectively.
 As
 shown
 in
Fig.
 5,
 propane
 is
 dissociated
 over
 the
 top
 of
 a
 Pt
 atom
 with
 the
detached
 H
 atom
 adsorbed
 at
 the
 Bridge
 site.
 The
 activated
 CH
bonds
 are
 stretched
 by
 0.360.41 
A.
 The
 geometries
 of
 the
 transition
states
 are
 almost
 identical
 to
 our
 previous
 results
 on
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 and
Pt(2
 1
 1)
 [5].
 However,
 the
 activation
 energies
 of
 the
 first
 and
 sec-
ond
 dehydrogenation
 steps
 (Steps
 14)
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 are
 lower
 than
those
 on
 Pt(1
 1
 1).
 Although
 the
 activation
 energy
 for
 the
 first
 dehy-
drogenation
 step
 (Step
 1
 and
 Step
 2)
 and
 the
 second
 one
 (Step
 3
 and
Step
 4
 in
 Table
 2)
 are
 very
 close,
 as
 shown
 in
 Fig.
 5,
 which
 is
 similar
to
 the
 situation
 on
 Pt(2
 1
 1)
 [2].
 The
 subsequent
 dehydrogenation
to
 the
 formation
 of
 propylene
 is
 thermodynamically
 downhill,
 and
the
 reaction
 heat
 is
 as
 negative
 as
 0.52
 eV.
 The
 energy
 barriers
for
 propyl
 dehydrogenation
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 are
 about
 0.30
 eV
 lower
than
 those
 on
 the
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 surface.
 The
 lower
 activation
 energies
 for
propane
 and
 propyl
 dehydrogenation
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 provide
 a
 ratio-
nal
 interpretation
 of
 the
 experimental
 observation
 that
 the
 cubic
particles
 dominated
 by
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 shows
 higher
 catalytic
 dehydro-
genation
 activity
 than
 the
 octahedral
 particles
 that
 are
 dominated
by
 Pt(1

 1).
3.2.3.
 Selectivity
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 and
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
In
 propane
 dehydrogenation,
 the
 cracking
 of
 C3
 derivatives,
which
 gives
 rise
 to
 the
 formation
 of
 undesired
 side
 products,
 sig-
nificantly
 lowers
 the
 selectivity
 toward
 propylene.
 As
 shown
 in
Table
 2,
 the
 CC
 bond
 cleavage

 the
 C3
 intermediates
 involved

 The
 detached
H
 atoms
 are
 not
 included
 for
 clarity.
 The
 numbers
 signify
 the
 sequence
 numbers
 of
the
 elementary
 steps.
Steps
 710
 has
 lower
 activation
 energies
 on
 Pt(1
 0
 0)
 than
 those
 on
Pt(1
 1
 1).
 Nevertheless,
 it
 should
 be
 noted
 that
 the
 activation
 ener-
gies
 for
 the
 cracking
 of
 the
 intermediates
 remain
 higher
 than
 those
for
 the
 dehydrogenation,
 which
 indicates
 that
 the
 CC
 bond
 cleav-
age
 is
 not
 preferred
 from
 propane
 to
 propylene.
 Our
 previous
 work
on
 Pt(1
 1
 1)
 indicated
 that
 the
 activation
 energy
 for
 CC
 bond
 cleav-
age
 would
 be
 lower
 than
 that
 for
 CH
 bond
 cleavage
 until
 the
 deeply
dehydrogenated
 propyne
 was
 produced
 [5].
 Therefore,
 the
 selectiv-
ity
 toward
 propylene
 depends
 strongly
 on
 the
 relative
 rate
 between
propylene
 deep
 dehydrogenation
 and
 propylene
 desorption.
According
 to
 the
 Arrhenius
 equation,
 activation
 energy
 plays
a
 key
 role
 in
 determining
 the
 reaction
 rate
 constant.
 Hence,
 we
take
 the
 difference
 in
 the
 activation
 energy
 (Ediff =
 Edehy 
 Edes)
between
 propylene
 dehydrogenation
 and
 propylene
 desorption
 as
a
 descriptor
 to
 represent
 the
 catalyst
 selectivity
 toward
 propyl-
ene.
 A
 negative
 value
 indicates
 dehydrogenation
 is
 preferred
 and
