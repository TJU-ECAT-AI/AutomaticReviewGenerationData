[1] "The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)1 ks1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively, on the basis of the amount of coke measured by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)."

[2] "As a result of coke formation, the activities for propylene formation on the cubic and octahedral particles dropped by 33% and 22% in less than 3 h, respectively."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the composition of coke deposits or analytical techniques used to study them in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It only mentions that the amount of coke was measured using temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). The study focused on comparing coke formation rates and deactivation effects between cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, rather than analyzing the complex nature of coke constituents. More specific research on coke composition and advanced analytical techniques would be needed to fully answer this question.

该文献没有提供关于焦炭沉积物成分或用于研究它们在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的分析技术的详细信息。它只提到使用程序升温氧化法(TPO)测量焦炭量。这项研究主要集中在比较立方体和八面体Pt纳米颗粒之间的焦炭形成速率和失活效应,而不是分析焦炭成分的复杂性质。要全面回答这个问题,需要对焦炭成分和先进的分析技术进行更具体的研究。
