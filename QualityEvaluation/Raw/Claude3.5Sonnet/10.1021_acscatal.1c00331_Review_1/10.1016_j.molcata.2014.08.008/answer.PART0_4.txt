[1] "The rates for coke formation were estimated to be 4.3 and 2.8 mg (g surface Pt)1 ks1 on the cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles, respectively, on the basis of the amount of coke measured by temperature programmed oxidation (TPO)."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information about the composition of coke deposits or the diversity of analytical techniques used to study them in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. It only mentions that temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) was used to measure the amount of coke formed on cubic and octahedral Pt nanoparticles. The study does not explore how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or catalyst types. More detailed research would be needed to fully answer this question.

文献没有提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积碳沉积物成分或用于研究它们的分析技术多样性的全面信息。它只提到使用程序升温氧化(TPO)来测量立方体和八面体铂纳米颗粒上形成的积碳量。该研究没有探讨积碳组成如何随不同反应条件或催化剂类型而变化。需要更详细的研究才能全面回答这个问题。
