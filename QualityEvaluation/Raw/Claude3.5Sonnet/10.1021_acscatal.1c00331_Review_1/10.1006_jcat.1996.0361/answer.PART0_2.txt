[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles. The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal. The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."

[2] "We agree with a model, earlier proposed by others (10, 22, 24, 25), that only a small part of the coke is located on the metal, while a larger part is placed close to the metal and is assisted by the platinum in the combustion. We believe that the last part of the coke is deposited on the carrier and is combusted without any influence by the metal."

[3] "The TPO experiments performed in the microbalance were deconvoluted using a model with a combination of power-law kinetic expressions, proposed and discussed in detail by Querini and Fung (28)."

[4] "The TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian curves assuming two or three different types of coke."

[5] "Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Time on stream, temperature, and reaction gas composition have been varied."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types in several ways:

1. Three distinct types of coke were identified through temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles:
   a) Coke on and near the metal catalyst
   b) Coke on the carrier
   c) Graphitic coke on the carrier

2. The distribution of these coke types depends on factors such as:
   - Reaction temperature
   - Gas composition (e.g., partial pressures of propane, propene, and hydrogen)
   - Catalyst type (e.g., Pt/Al2O3 vs. PtSn/Al2O3)
   - Time on stream

3. The addition of tin to platinum catalysts affects coke formation and distribution, generally leading to more coke overall but with a different distribution among the types.

4. Hydrogen plays a role in suppressing coke formation but does not significantly remove coke once formed.

5. Graphitic coke formation is influenced by severe reaction conditions and is formed through a separate mechanism.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). This method was used to identify different types of coke based on their combustion temperatures. The TPO profiles were analyzed and deconvoluted using various models:

1. Power-law kinetic expressions
2. Gaussian curve fitting

These techniques allowed researchers to distinguish between different coke types and quantify their relative amounts under various reaction conditions. Additionally, the study used microbalance reactors to monitor coke formation in real-time and employed gas chromatography to analyze reaction products and correlate them with coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下有以下几种变化：

1. 通过程序升温氧化（TPO）曲线识别出三种不同类型的焦炭：
   a) 金属催化剂上及其附近的焦炭
   b) 载体上的焦炭
   c) 载体上的石墨化焦炭

2. 这些焦炭类型的分布取决于以下因素：
   - 反应温度
   - 气体组成（如丙烷、丙烯和氢气的分压）
   - 催化剂类型（如Pt/Al2O3与PtSn/Al2O3）
   - 反应时间

3. 向铂催化剂中添加锡会影响焦炭的形成和分布，通常会导致总体焦炭量增加，但各类型焦炭的分布会发生变化。

4. 氢气在抑制焦炭形成方面起作用，但一旦形成焦炭后，氢气不能显著去除焦炭。

5. 石墨化焦炭的形成受严苛反应条件的影响，并通过独立的机制形成。

用于阐明焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。该方法用于根据焦炭的燃烧温度识别不同类型的焦炭。TPO曲线通过各种模型进行分析和解卷积：

1. 幂律动力学表达式
2. 高斯曲线拟合

这些技术使研究人员能够区分不同类型的焦炭，并在各种反应条件下量化它们的相对含量。此外，该研究还使用微天平反应器实时监测焦炭形成，并采用气相色谱法分析反应产物，将其与焦炭形成和催化剂失活相关联。
