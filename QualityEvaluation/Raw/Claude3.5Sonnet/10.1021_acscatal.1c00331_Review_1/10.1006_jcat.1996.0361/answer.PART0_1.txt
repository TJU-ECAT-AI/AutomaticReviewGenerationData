[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles. The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal. The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."

[2] "Two peaks were observed after the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst had deactivated for at least 5 h. For the bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, a shoulder was seen on the larger peak."

[3] "The TPO experimental results are shown in Fig. 2. Two peaks were observed after the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst had deactivated for at least 5 h. For the bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, a shoulder was seen on the larger peak."

[4] "The TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian curves assuming two or three different types of coke. An example of the latter case is found in Fig. 4b."

[5] "Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was used to study the coke deposits."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. For monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, two distinct peaks were observed in the TPO profiles after at least 5 hours of deactivation. In contrast, bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed a larger peak with a shoulder.

Three different types of coke were identified:
1. Coke on and in the vicinity of the metal
2. Coke on the carrier
3. Graphitic coke on the carrier

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian curves, assuming two or three different types of coke, to further analyze the composition and characteristics of the coke deposits.

The study revealed that the composition and distribution of coke deposits are influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst type (monometallic vs. bimetallic), and time on stream. The use of TPO combined with deconvolution techniques allowed researchers to distinguish between different types of coke and their locations on the catalyst surface, providing valuable insights into the complex nature of coke formation during PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同。对于单金属Pt/Al2O3催化剂，在至少5小时的失活后，TPO谱图中观察到两个明显的峰。相比之下，双金属PtSn/Al2O3催化剂显示出一个较大的峰和一个肩峰。

研究识别出三种不同类型的积碳：
1. 金属上及其附近的积碳
2. 载体上的积碳
3. 载体上的石墨化积碳

主要使用的分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）来阐明积碳组分的复杂性质和多样性。TPO谱图使用高斯曲线进行解卷积，假设有两到三种不同类型的积碳，以进一步分析积碳沉积物的组成和特征。

研究表明，积碳沉积物的组成和分布受到反应条件、催化剂类型（单金属vs双金属）和反应时间等因素的影响。TPO结合解卷积技术的使用使研究人员能够区分不同类型的积碳及其在催化剂表面的位置，为了解PDH反应过程中积碳形成的复杂性质提供了宝贵的见解。
