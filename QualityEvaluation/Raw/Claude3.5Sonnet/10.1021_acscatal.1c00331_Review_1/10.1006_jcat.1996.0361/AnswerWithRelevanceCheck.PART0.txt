          "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles. The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal. The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."

"The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."

"Two peaks were observed after the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst had deactivated for at least 5 h. For the bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, a shoulder was seen on the larger peak."

"The TPO experiments performed in the microbalance were deconvoluted using a model with a combination of power-law kinetic expressions, proposed and discussed in detail by Querini and Fung (28)."

"The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%. Examples of typical TPO profiles can be found in Fig. 4a, and two or three different peaks can be identified in the curves."

"We agree with a model, earlier proposed by others (10, 22, 24, 25), that only a small part of the coke is located on the metal, while a larger part is placed close to the metal and is assisted by the platinum in the combustion. We believe that the last part of the coke is deposited on the carrier and is combusted without any influence by the metal."

"The TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian curves assuming two or three different types of coke."

"Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Time on stream, temperature, and reaction gas composition have been varied."

"For both catalysts the peak temperatures shifted upwards when the deactivation increased. Also, more severe coking caused the beginning of the gasification to shift to higher temperature."

"The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."

"The bimetallic PtSn catalyst is more resistant to deactivation by coke formation, than the monometallic Pt."

"We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel. The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."

"The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."

"Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

          The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three main types of coke were identified:

1. Coke on and near the metal surface
2. Coke on the catalyst carrier
3. Graphitic coke on the carrier

The formation of these coke types is influenced by several factors:

1. Temperature: Higher temperatures increase coke formation and shift TPO peak temperatures upwards.
2. Partial pressures: Higher propene partial pressure increases coke formation.
3. Hydrogen presence: Hydrogen suppresses coke formation but cannot remove already formed coke.
4. Catalyst type: Bimetallic PtSn catalysts show more resistance to deactivation by coke formation compared to monometallic Pt catalysts.
5. Time on stream: The first type of coke (on/near metal) reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type (on carrier) continued to increase.

The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%. The distribution and formation of coke types differ between Pt and PtSn catalysts, with PtSn catalysts generally accumulating more coke overall but showing better resistance to deactivation.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). This method allowed researchers to distinguish between different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures and profiles. TPO profiles were analyzed and deconvoluted using various models:

1. Power-law kinetic expressions
2. Gaussian curve fitting

These techniques allowed researchers to identify and quantify different coke types formed under various reaction conditions. Additionally, the study used microbalance reactors to monitor coke formation in real-time and employed gas chromatography to analyze reaction products and correlate them with coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

The research also proposed a model suggesting that the majority of observed coke is not directly responsible for catalyst deactivation. Instead, a small fraction of "deactivating coke" forms in parallel with the main coke deposits. This model helps explain the complex relationship between coke formation, reaction conditions, and catalyst performance in PDH systems.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著差异。研究识别出三种主要类型的焦炭：

1. 金属表面及其附近的焦炭
2. 催化剂载体上的焦炭
3. 载体上的石墨化焦炭

这些焦炭类型的形成受到几个因素的影响：

1. 温度：较高的温度会增加焦炭形成并使TPO峰温度上移。
2. 分压：较高的丙烯分压会增加焦炭形成。
3. 氢气存在：氢气抑制焦炭形成，但无法去除已形成的焦炭。
4. 催化剂类型：与单金属Pt催化剂相比，双金属PtSn催化剂对焦炭形成导致的失活表现出更强的抵抗力。
5. 反应时间：第一类焦炭（金属表面/附近）在约15小时后达到恒定水平，而第二类焦炭（载体上）继续增加。

催化剂上的焦炭量从约1到8重量%不等。Pt和PtSn催化剂之间焦炭类型的分布和形成不同，PtSn催化剂通常积累更多的总体焦炭，但表现出更好的抗失活能力。

用于阐明焦炭成分复杂性质和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。该方法允许研究人员根据焦炭的氧化温度和曲线区分不同类型的焦炭。TPO曲线通过各种模型进行分析和解卷积：

1. 幂律动力学表达式
2. 高斯曲线拟合

这些技术使研究人员能够识别和量化在各种反应条件下形成的不同类型的焦炭。此外，该研究还使用微天平反应器实时监测焦炭形成，并采用气相色谱法分析反应产物，将其与焦炭形成和催化剂失活相关联。

研究还提出了一个模型，指出观察到的大部分焦炭并不直接导致催化剂失活。相反，少量的"失活焦炭"与主要焦炭沉积物平行形成。这个模型有助于解释PDH系统中焦炭形成、反应条件和催化剂性能之间的复杂关系。
