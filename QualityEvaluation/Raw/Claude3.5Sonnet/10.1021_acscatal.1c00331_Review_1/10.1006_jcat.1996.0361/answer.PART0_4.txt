[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles. The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal. The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."

[2] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel. The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."

[3] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."

[4] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[5] "The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three main types of coke were identified:

1. Coke on and near the metal surface
2. Coke on the catalyst carrier
3. Graphitic coke on the carrier

The formation of these coke types is influenced by factors such as temperature, partial pressures of reactants and products, and the presence of hydrogen. Higher temperatures and propene partial pressures increase coke formation, while hydrogen suppresses it.

The study compared Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, finding that the bimetallic catalyst accumulated more coke overall but showed better resistance to deactivation. This suggests that the relationship between coke formation and catalyst deactivation is complex and not directly proportional.

The primary analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). This method allowed researchers to distinguish between different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures and profiles. Additionally, the study used a microbalance reactor to monitor coke accumulation in real-time and employed gas chromatography to analyze reaction products.

The research also proposed a model suggesting that the majority of observed coke is not directly responsible for catalyst deactivation. Instead, a small fraction of "deactivating coke" forms in parallel with the main coke deposits. This model helps explain the complex relationship between coke formation, reaction conditions, and catalyst performance in PDH systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在显著差异。研究识别出了三种主要类型的焦炭：

1. 金属表面及其附近的焦炭
2. 催化剂载体上的焦炭
3. 载体上的石墨化焦炭

这些焦炭类型的形成受到温度、反应物和产物的分压以及氢气存在等因素的影响。较高的温度和丙烯分压会增加焦炭形成，而氢气则抑制焦炭形成。

研究比较了Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，发现双金属催化剂总体上积累了更多的焦炭，但对失活的抵抗力更强。这表明焦炭形成和催化剂失活之间的关系是复杂的，不是简单的直接比例关系。

用于阐明焦炭成分性质和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。这种方法允许研究人员根据焦炭的氧化温度和曲线区分不同类型的焦炭。此外，研究还使用了微天平反应器来实时监测焦炭积累，并采用气相色谱法分析反应产物。

研究还提出了一个模型，指出观察到的大部分焦炭并不直接导致催化剂失活。相反，少量的"失活焦炭"与主要焦炭沉积物平行形成。这个模型有助于解释PDH系统中焦炭形成、反应条件和催化剂性能之间的复杂关系。
