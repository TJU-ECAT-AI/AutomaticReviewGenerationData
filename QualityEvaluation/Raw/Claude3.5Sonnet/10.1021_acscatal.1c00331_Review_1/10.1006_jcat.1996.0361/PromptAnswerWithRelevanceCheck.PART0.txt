[1] "Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier."

[2] "The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."

[3] "Two peaks were observed after the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst had deactivated for at least 5 h. For the bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, a shoulder was seen on the larger peak."

[4] "The TPO experiments performed in the microbalance were deconvoluted using a model with a combination of power-law kinetic expressions, proposed and discussed in detail by Querini and Fung (28)."

[5] "The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%. Examples of typical TPO profiles can be found in Fig. 4a, and two or three different peaks can be identified in the curves."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. For PtSn catalysts, three types of coke were identified: coke on and near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.

2. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and propene partial pressure, while hydrogen suppresses their formation.

3. Monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts showed two peaks in TPO profiles after at least 5 hours of deactivation, while bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts displayed a shoulder on the larger peak.

4. The amount of coke on the catalyst ranged from 1 to 8 wt%, with two or three different peaks identifiable in TPO profiles.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles were deconvoluted using a model with power-law kinetic expressions to distinguish between different types of coke. This technique allowed researchers to identify and quantify various coke types formed under different reaction conditions and on different catalyst types.

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. For monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, two distinct peaks were observed in the TPO profiles after at least 5 hours of deactivation. In contrast, bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed a larger peak with a shoulder.

Three different types of coke were identified:
1. Coke on and in the vicinity of the metal
2. Coke on the carrier
3. Graphitic coke on the carrier

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles were deconvoluted using Gaussian curves, assuming two or three different types of coke, to further analyze the composition and characteristics of the coke deposits.

The study revealed that the composition and distribution of coke deposits are influenced by factors such as reaction conditions, catalyst type (monometallic vs. bimetallic), and time on stream. The use of TPO combined with deconvolution techniques allowed researchers to distinguish between different types of coke and their locations on the catalyst surface, providing valuable insights into the complex nature of coke formation during PDH reactions.

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types in several ways:

1. Three distinct types of coke were identified through temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles:
   a) Coke on and near the metal catalyst
   b) Coke on the carrier
   c) Graphitic coke on the carrier

2. The distribution of these coke types depends on factors such as:
   - Reaction temperature
   - Gas composition (e.g., partial pressures of propane, propene, and hydrogen)
   - Catalyst type (e.g., Pt/Al2O3 vs. PtSn/Al2O3)
   - Time on stream

3. The addition of tin to platinum catalysts affects coke formation and distribution, generally leading to more coke overall but with a different distribution among the types.

4. Hydrogen plays a role in suppressing coke formation but does not significantly remove coke once formed.

5. Graphitic coke formation is influenced by severe reaction conditions and is formed through a separate mechanism.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). This method was used to identify different types of coke based on their combustion temperatures. The TPO profiles were analyzed and deconvoluted using various models:

1. Power-law kinetic expressions
2. Gaussian curve fitting

These techniques allowed researchers to distinguish between different coke types and quantify their relative amounts under various reaction conditions. Additionally, the study used microbalance reactors to monitor coke formation in real-time and employed gas chromatography to analyze reaction products and correlate them with coke formation and catalyst deactivation.

   - 反应时间

3. 向铂催化剂中添加锡会影响焦炭的形成和分布，通常会导致总体焦炭量增加，但各类型焦炭的分布会发生变化。

4. 氢气在抑制焦炭形成方面起作用，但一旦形成焦炭后，氢气不能显著去除焦炭。

5. 石墨化焦炭的形成受严苛反应条件的影响，并通过独立的机制形成。

用于阐明焦炭成分复杂性和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。该方法用于根据焦炭的燃烧温度识别不同类型的焦炭。TPO曲线通过各种模型进行分析和解卷积：

1. 幂律动力学表达式
2. 高斯曲线拟合

这些技术使研究人员能够区分不同类型的焦炭，并在各种反应条件下量化它们的相对含量。此外，该研究还使用微天平反应器实时监测焦炭形成，并采用气相色谱法分析反应产物，将其与焦炭形成和催化剂失活相关联。

[2] "For both catalysts the peak temperatures shifted upwards when the deactivation increased. Also, more severe coking caused the beginning of the gasification to shift to higher temperature."

[3] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. Three distinct types of coke were identified using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO):
   - Coke on and near the metal surface
   - Coke on the catalyst carrier
   - Graphitic coke on the carrier

2. The coke composition changes with reaction conditions:
   - Higher deactivation and more severe coking led to shifts in TPO peak temperatures
   - The first type of coke (on/near metal) reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type (on carrier) continued to increase

3. Differences between catalyst types:
   - The bimetallic PtSn catalyst showed more resistance to coke formation and deactivation compared to monometallic Pt
   - The distribution of coke types differed between Pt and PtSn catalysts

4. Analytical techniques:
   - Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was the primary technique used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents
   - TPO profiles were analyzed and deconvoluted to identify different coke types
   - The microbalance reactor was used to monitor coke formation over time

5. Coke location and formation:
   - Only a small part of the coke is located on the metal surface
   - A larger portion is near the metal and assisted by platinum during combustion
   - The remainder is on the catalyst carrier

This study demonstrates the complex nature of coke deposits in PDH systems and how they are influenced by reaction conditions, catalyst type, and time on stream. The use of TPO analysis provided valuable insights into the diversity and evolution of coke constituents under various conditions.

[2] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel. The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."

[3] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."

[4] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

[5] "The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. Three main types of coke were identified:

1. Coke on and near the metal surface
2. Coke on the catalyst carrier
3. Graphitic coke on the carrier

The formation of these coke types is influenced by factors such as temperature, partial pressures of reactants and products, and the presence of hydrogen. Higher temperatures and propene partial pressures increase coke formation, while hydrogen suppresses it.

The study compared Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, finding that the bimetallic catalyst accumulated more coke overall but showed better resistance to deactivation. This suggests that the relationship between coke formation and catalyst deactivation is complex and not directly proportional.

The primary analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). This method allowed researchers to distinguish between different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures and profiles. Additionally, the study used a microbalance reactor to monitor coke accumulation in real-time and employed gas chromatography to analyze reaction products.

The research also proposed a model suggesting that the majority of observed coke is not directly responsible for catalyst deactivation. Instead, a small fraction of "deactivating coke" forms in parallel with the main coke deposits. This model helps explain the complex relationship between coke formation, reaction conditions, and catalyst performance in PDH systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下存在显著差异。研究识别出了三种主要类型的焦炭：

1. 金属表面及其附近的焦炭
2. 催化剂载体上的焦炭
3. 载体上的石墨化焦炭

这些焦炭类型的形成受到温度、反应物和产物的分压以及氢气存在等因素的影响。较高的温度和丙烯分压会增加焦炭形成，而氢气则抑制焦炭形成。

研究比较了Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂，发现双金属催化剂总体上积累了更多的焦炭，但对失活的抵抗力更强。这表明焦炭形成和催化剂失活之间的关系是复杂的，不是简单的直接比例关系。

用于阐明焦炭成分性质和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化(TPO)。这种方法允许研究人员根据焦炭的氧化温度和曲线区分不同类型的焦炭。此外，研究还使用了微天平反应器来实时监测焦炭积累，并采用气相色谱法分析反应产物。

研究还提出了一个模型，指出观察到的大部分焦炭并不直接导致催化剂失活。相反，少量的"失活焦炭"与主要焦炭沉积物平行形成。这个模型有助于解释PDH系统中焦炭形成、反应条件和催化剂性能之间的复杂关系。
