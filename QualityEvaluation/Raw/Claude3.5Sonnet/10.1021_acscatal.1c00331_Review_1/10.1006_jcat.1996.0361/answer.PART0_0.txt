[1] "Three different peaks were identified from the TPO profiles on the PtSn catalyst and attributed to different types of coke; coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier."

[2] "The amounts of these types were related to reaction conditions. The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene. Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."

[3] "Two peaks were observed after the monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst had deactivated for at least 5 h. For the bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst, a shoulder was seen on the larger peak."

[4] "The TPO experiments performed in the microbalance were deconvoluted using a model with a combination of power-law kinetic expressions, proposed and discussed in detail by Querini and Fung (28)."

[5] "The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%. Examples of typical TPO profiles can be found in Fig. 4a, and two or three different peaks can be identified in the curves."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. For PtSn catalysts, three types of coke were identified: coke on and near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier.

2. The formation of the first two types of coke increases with temperature and propene partial pressure, while hydrogen suppresses their formation.

3. Monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts showed two peaks in TPO profiles after at least 5 hours of deactivation, while bimetallic PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts displayed a shoulder on the larger peak.

4. The amount of coke on the catalyst ranged from 1 to 8 wt%, with two or three different peaks identifiable in TPO profiles.

The main analytical technique employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents was Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO). TPO profiles were deconvoluted using a model with power-law kinetic expressions to distinguish between different types of coke. This technique allowed researchers to identify and quantify various coke types formed under different reaction conditions and on different catalyst types.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所不同：

1. 对于PtSn催化剂，识别出三种类型的焦炭：金属上及其附近的焦炭、载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨化焦炭。

2. 前两种类型的焦炭形成随温度和丙烯分压的增加而增加，而氢气则抑制其形成。

3. 单金属Pt/Al2O3催化剂在至少5小时的失活后在TPO曲线中显示出两个峰，而双金属PtSn/Al2O3催化剂在较大的峰上显示出一个肩峰。

4. 催化剂上的焦炭量从1到8重量%不等，在TPO曲线中可以识别出两到三个不同的峰。

用于阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要分析技术是程序升温氧化（TPO）。TPO曲线使用具有幂律动力学表达式的模型进行解卷积，以区分不同类型的焦炭。这种技术使研究人员能够识别和量化在不同反应条件下和不同类型催化剂上形成的各种焦炭类型。
