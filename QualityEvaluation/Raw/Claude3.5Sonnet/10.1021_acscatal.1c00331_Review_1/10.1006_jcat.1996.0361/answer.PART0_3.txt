[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles. The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal. The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."

[2] "For both catalysts the peak temperatures shifted upwards when the deactivation increased. Also, more severe coking caused the beginning of the gasification to shift to higher temperature."

[3] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."

[4] "We agree with a model, earlier proposed by others (10, 22, 24, 25), that only a small part of the coke is located on the metal, while a larger part is placed close to the metal and is assisted by the platinum in the combustion."

[5] "The bimetallic PtSn catalyst is more resistant to deactivation by coke formation, than the monometallic Pt."

[6] "Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) after different times on stream on the platinum and the platinum–tin catalysts"

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. Three distinct types of coke were identified using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO):
   - Coke on and near the metal surface
   - Coke on the catalyst carrier
   - Graphitic coke on the carrier

2. The coke composition changes with reaction conditions:
   - Higher deactivation and more severe coking led to shifts in TPO peak temperatures
   - The first type of coke (on/near metal) reached a constant level after about 15 hours, while the second type (on carrier) continued to increase

3. Differences between catalyst types:
   - The bimetallic PtSn catalyst showed more resistance to coke formation and deactivation compared to monometallic Pt
   - The distribution of coke types differed between Pt and PtSn catalysts

4. Analytical techniques:
   - Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was the primary technique used to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents
   - TPO profiles were analyzed and deconvoluted to identify different coke types
   - The microbalance reactor was used to monitor coke formation over time

5. Coke location and formation:
   - Only a small part of the coke is located on the metal surface
   - A larger portion is near the metal and assisted by platinum during combustion
   - The remainder is on the catalyst carrier

This study demonstrates the complex nature of coke deposits in PDH systems and how they are influenced by reaction conditions, catalyst type, and time on stream. The use of TPO analysis provided valuable insights into the diversity and evolution of coke constituents under various conditions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，不同反应条件和催化剂类型下焦炭沉积物的组成变化如下：

1. 通过程序升温氧化（TPO）鉴定出三种不同类型的焦炭：
   - 金属表面及其附近的焦炭
   - 催化剂载体上的焦炭
   - 载体上的石墨化焦炭

2. 焦炭组成随反应条件变化：
   - 较高的失活程度和更严重的结焦导致TPO峰温度发生偏移
   - 第一类焦炭（金属表面/附近）在约15小时后达到恒定水平，而第二类焦炭（载体上）继续增加

3. 不同催化剂类型之间的差异：
   - 与单金属Pt相比，双金属PtSn催化剂对焦炭形成和失活表现出更强的抵抗力
   - Pt和PtSn催化剂之间焦炭类型的分布不同

4. 分析技术：
   - 程序升温氧化（TPO）是用于阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性的主要技术
   - 对TPO谱图进行分析和解卷积以识别不同类型的焦炭
   - 使用微天平反应器监测焦炭随时间的形成

5. 焦炭位置和形成：
   - 只有少量焦炭位于金属表面
   - 较大部分位于金属附近，在燃烧过程中受到铂的辅助
   - 其余部分位于催化剂载体上

这项研究展示了PDH系统中焦炭沉积物的复杂性，以及它们如何受到反应条件、催化剂类型和反应时间的影响。TPO分析的使用为在各种条件下焦炭成分的多样性和演变提供了宝贵的见解。
