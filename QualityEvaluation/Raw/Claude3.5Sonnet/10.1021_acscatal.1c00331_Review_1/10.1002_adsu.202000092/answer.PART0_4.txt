The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. The literature mentions that coke can be produced on both the metal site and the surface of the catalyst support. Only a small part of the coke is located on the metal, which is believed to be responsible for catalyst deactivation. 

For PtSn alloy catalysts specifically, several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits on the surface. The study employed DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations to investigate the pathways for the production of these coke species. However, the literature does not provide detailed information about how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or a comprehensive list of analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的催化剂类型上有所不同。文献提到，积碳可以在金属位点和催化剂载体表面上产生。只有少量的积碳位于金属上，这被认为是导致催化剂失活的原因。

具体对于PtSn合金催化剂，在其表面上发现了几种C3物种作为碳质沉积物。该研究使用DFT（密度泛函理论）计算来研究这些积碳物种的生成途径。然而，文献并未提供关于积碳组成如何随不同反应条件变化的详细信息，也没有提供用于阐明积碳成分性质的分析技术的全面列表。
