The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. Coke can be produced on both the metal site and the surface of the catalyst support. While only a small part of coke is typically located on the metal, it is believed to be primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation. 

In the case of PtSn alloy catalysts, a distinct nature of coke was observed. Several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of the PtSn alloy. These coke deposits could be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process.

The analytical techniques mentioned in the literature for elucidating the nature of coke constituents include DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, which were used to investigate the pathways for coke production. However, the text does not provide comprehensive information about other analytical techniques employed to study coke composition across various reaction conditions.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的催化剂类型中有所不同。积碳可以在金属位点和催化剂载体表面上产生。虽然通常只有一小部分积碳位于金属上，但据信它主要负责催化剂的失活。

在PtSn合金催化剂的情况下，观察到了一种独特性质的积碳。在PtSn合金表面上识别出几种C3物种作为碳质沉积物。这些积碳沉积物可以在PDH过程中被加氢成丙烯。

文献中提到的用于阐明积碳成分性质的分析技术包括DFT（密度泛函理论）计算，用于研究积碳生成的途径。然而，文本并未提供关于在各种反应条件下研究积碳组成所使用的其他分析技术的全面信息。
