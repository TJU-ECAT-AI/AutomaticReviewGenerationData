[1] "According to the previous studies, coke could be produced on the metal site and surface of catalyst support, respectively."

[2] "Furthermore, only a small part of coke was located on the metal, which was usually believed to be responsible for deactivation."

[3] "Herein, we reported a distinct nature of coke on the alloyed Pt sites. Several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits on surface of PtSn alloy."

[4] "This finding can provide a theoretical guidance for enhancing propylene yield and catalyst stability in PDH process."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. Coke can be produced on both the metal site and the surface of the catalyst support. While only a small part of coke is typically located on the metal, it is believed to be primarily responsible for deactivation. The study reported a distinct nature of coke on alloyed Pt sites, identifying several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of PtSn alloy. This finding suggests that the composition of coke can differ depending on the catalyst type, with alloyed catalysts potentially exhibiting different coke structures compared to single-metal catalysts.

The literature does not provide detailed information about how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or about specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, it implies that the study employed some form of analysis to identify the C3 species on the PtSn alloy surface, though the exact method is not specified in the given excerpt.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积炭沉积物的组成在不同的催化剂类型中有所不同。积炭可以在金属位点和催化剂载体表面上产生。虽然通常只有少量的积炭位于金属上，但它被认为是主要负责失活的原因。该研究报告了合金Pt位点上积炭的独特性质，在PtSn合金表面上识别出几种C3物种作为碳质沉积物。这一发现表明，积炭的组成可能因催化剂类型而异，合金催化剂可能会表现出与单金属催化剂不同的积炭结构。

文献没有提供关于积炭组成如何随不同反应条件变化的详细信息，也没有提供用于阐明积炭成分性质的具体分析技术。然而，它暗示该研究采用了某种形式的分析来识别PtSn合金表面上的C3物种，尽管在给定的摘录中没有具体说明确切的方法。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. Coke can be produced on both the metal site and the surface of the catalyst support. While only a small part of coke is typically found on the metal, it is believed to be primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation. The study specifically reports on the nature of coke on alloyed Pt sites, identifying several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of PtSn alloy. 

The analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include DFT calculations to investigate the pathways for coke production. Additionally, the study suggests that these coke deposits can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process, providing insights into their composition and reactivity.

However, the given literature excerpt does not provide comprehensive information on how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or a full list of analytical techniques used. More detailed information from the full study would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的催化剂类型中有所不同。焦炭可以在金属位点和催化剂支撑体表面上产生。虽然通常只有少量焦炭位于金属上，但它被认为是导致催化剂失活的主要原因。该研究特别报道了合金Pt位点上焦炭的性质，识别出几种C3物种作为PtSn合金表面的碳质沉积物。

用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性的分析技术包括使用DFT计算来研究焦炭生成的途径。此外，研究表明这些焦炭沉积物可以在PDH过程中被氢化成丙烯，这提供了关于它们组成和反应性的洞见。

然而，给定的文献摘录并未提供关于焦炭组成如何在不同反应条件下变化的全面信息，也没有提供使用的分析技术的完整列表。需要从完整研究中获取更详细的信息才能全面回答这些问题的方面。

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. In the case of PtSn alloy catalysts, coke forms on both the metal sites and the catalyst support surface. A small portion of coke on the metal sites is believed to be primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation. Specifically for PtSn alloy, several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits. The study employed DFT calculations to investigate the pathways for coke production. Interestingly, these coke deposits on PtSn alloy could be hydrogenated back to propylene during the PDH process. While the literature doesn't explicitly mention analytical techniques used, it implies the use of surface characterization methods and computational modeling (DFT) to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents.

催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，随着不同的催化剂类型而变化。在PtSn合金催化剂的情况下，焦炭在金属位点和催化剂支持表面上都形成。少量位于金属位点上的焦炭被认为主要负责催化剂失活。具体到PtSn合金，几种C3物种被确定为碳质沉积物。该研究采用DFT计算来研究焦炭产生的途径。有趣的是，PtSn合金上的这些焦炭沉积物在PDH过程中可以被加氢还原回丙烯。虽然文献没有明确提到使用的分析技术，但它暗示了使用表面表征方法和计算建模（DFT）来阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性。
