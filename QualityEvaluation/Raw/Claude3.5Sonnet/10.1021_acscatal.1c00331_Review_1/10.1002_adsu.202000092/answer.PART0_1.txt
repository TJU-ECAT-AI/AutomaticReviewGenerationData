The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. Coke can be produced on both the metal site and the surface of the catalyst support. While only a small part of coke is typically found on the metal, it is believed to be primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation. The study specifically reports on the nature of coke on alloyed Pt sites, identifying several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of PtSn alloy. 

The analytical techniques employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems include DFT calculations to investigate the pathways for coke production. Additionally, the study suggests that these coke deposits can be hydrogenated to propylene in the PDH process, providing insights into their composition and reactivity.

However, the given literature excerpt does not provide comprehensive information on how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or a full list of analytical techniques used. More detailed information from the full study would be needed to fully address these aspects of the question.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的催化剂类型中有所不同。焦炭可以在金属位点和催化剂支撑体表面上产生。虽然通常只有少量焦炭位于金属上，但它被认为是导致催化剂失活的主要原因。该研究特别报道了合金Pt位点上焦炭的性质，识别出几种C3物种作为PtSn合金表面的碳质沉积物。

用于阐明这些系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性的分析技术包括使用DFT计算来研究焦炭生成的途径。此外，研究表明这些焦炭沉积物可以在PDH过程中被氢化成丙烯，这提供了关于它们组成和反应性的洞见。

然而，给定的文献摘录并未提供关于焦炭组成如何在不同反应条件下变化的全面信息，也没有提供使用的分析技术的完整列表。需要从完整研究中获取更详细的信息才能全面回答这些问题的方面。
