The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. Coke can be produced on both the metal site and the surface of the catalyst support. While only a small part of coke is typically located on the metal, it is believed to be primarily responsible for deactivation. The study reported a distinct nature of coke on alloyed Pt sites, identifying several C3 species as carbonaceous deposits on the surface of PtSn alloy. This finding suggests that the composition of coke can differ depending on the catalyst type, with alloyed catalysts potentially exhibiting different coke structures compared to single-metal catalysts.

The literature does not provide detailed information about how coke composition varies across different reaction conditions or about specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, it implies that the study employed some form of analysis to identify the C3 species on the PtSn alloy surface, though the exact method is not specified in the given excerpt.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积炭沉积物的组成在不同的催化剂类型中有所不同。积炭可以在金属位点和催化剂载体表面上产生。虽然通常只有少量的积炭位于金属上，但它被认为是主要负责失活的原因。该研究报告了合金Pt位点上积炭的独特性质，在PtSn合金表面上识别出几种C3物种作为碳质沉积物。这一发现表明，积炭的组成可能因催化剂类型而异，合金催化剂可能会表现出与单金属催化剂不同的积炭结构。

文献没有提供关于积炭组成如何随不同反应条件变化的详细信息，也没有提供用于阐明积炭成分性质的具体分析技术。然而，它暗示该研究采用了某种形式的分析来识别PtSn合金表面上的C3物种，尽管在给定的摘录中没有具体说明确切的方法。
