The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies across different catalyst types. In the case of PtSn alloy catalysts, coke forms on both the metal sites and the catalyst support surface. A small portion of coke on the metal sites is believed to be primarily responsible for catalyst deactivation. Specifically for PtSn alloy, several C3 species were identified as carbonaceous deposits. The study employed DFT calculations to investigate the pathways for coke production. Interestingly, these coke deposits on PtSn alloy could be hydrogenated back to propylene during the PDH process. While the literature doesn't explicitly mention analytical techniques used, it implies the use of surface characterization methods and computational modeling (DFT) to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents.

催化系统中焦炭沉积物的组成，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，随着不同的催化剂类型而变化。在PtSn合金催化剂的情况下，焦炭在金属位点和催化剂支持表面上都形成。少量位于金属位点上的焦炭被认为主要负责催化剂失活。具体到PtSn合金，几种C3物种被确定为碳质沉积物。该研究采用DFT计算来研究焦炭产生的途径。有趣的是，PtSn合金上的这些焦炭沉积物在PDH过程中可以被加氢还原回丙烯。虽然文献没有明确提到使用的分析技术，但它暗示了使用表面表征方法和计算建模（DFT）来阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性。
