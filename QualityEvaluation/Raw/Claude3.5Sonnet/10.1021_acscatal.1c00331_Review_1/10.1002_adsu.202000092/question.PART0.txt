I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

deactivation with time on stream, which 
requires the periodic regeneration of the 
catalyst by coke combustion at oxidative 
atmosphere and high temperature. This 
regeneration process can accelerate the 
sintering of Pt nanoparticles, which need 
to be redispersed using a corrosive process 
called oxychlorination.[6] From above all, 
characterizing the structure of coke and 
their formation pathway was significant 
for tackling this problem.
According to the previous studies, coke 
could be produced on the metal site and 
surface of catalyst support, respectively.[7] 
Furthermore, only a small part of coke was 
located on the metal, which was usually 
believed to be responsible for deactivation. 
However, qualification on this kind of coke was rather difficult 
because large amounts of coke were present on the surface of 
catalyst support, disturbing the analysis. Herein, we reported a 
distinct nature of coke on the alloyed Pt sites. Several C3 spe-
cies were identified as carbonaceous deposits on surface of 
PtSn alloy. In addition, several pathways for their production 
were investigated by DFT calculation as well. Further, these 
coke could be hydrogenated to propylene in PDH process. This 
finding can provide a theoretical guidance for enhancing pro-
pylene yield and catalyst stability in PDH process.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Catalyst Characterization
Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 were both prepared by wetness 
impregnation. BET surface areas of Al2O3 support, Pt/Al2O3, 
and PtSn/Al2O3 were 103.74, 92.38, and 84.96 m2 g-1 (Table S1,

How does the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, vary across different reaction conditions and catalyst types, and what analytical techniques have been employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in these systems?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
