          [1] "The presence of Ga compared to Sn reduced the deactivation and the amount of coke deposited during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne"

[4] "Thus, we hypothesize that less mobile coke species derived from propane are responsible for a larger coke buildup on the active metal particles, and hence a larger deactivation."

[5] "The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation between loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation. Moreover, the ratios of deposited carbon to surface Pt atoms are much greater than unity in all cases. This suggests that the most of the accumulated coke is present on the support and that only a small fraction remains on the surface of the metal particles."

[6] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

[7] "the adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

          The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions:

1. Catalyst composition: Ga-containing catalysts show reduced coke deposition compared to Sn-containing catalysts. Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O.

2. Reactant type: Propane dehydrogenation generally results in lower coke formation compared to ethane dehydrogenation. This is attributed to the easier hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne.

3. Coke distribution: Most of the accumulated coke is present on the catalyst support, with only a small fraction on the metal particles' surface. However, coke species derived from propane are hypothesized to be less mobile, leading to larger coke buildup on active metal particles.

4. Hydrogen's role: Addition of H2 to the feed reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursor species.

5. Deactivation mechanism: There is no direct correlation between coke accumulation and loss of dehydrogenation activity. In propane dehydrogenation, increased deactivation despite lower overall coke formation is attributed to greater coverage of the active metal particle surface by coke.

The study does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, the findings suggest that techniques capable of distinguishing between coke on the support and on the metal particles were employed, as well as methods to quantify the amount of coke relative to exposed metal atoms. To fully characterize the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, additional analytical techniques would likely be necessary, but these are not discussed in the given literature.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因不同的催化剂类型和反应条件而异：

1. 催化剂组成：与含Sn催化剂相比，含Ga催化剂显示出减少的积碳沉积。Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂比传统的双金属催化剂（如PtSn/Mg(Al)O和PtGa/Mg(Al)O）表现出较低的积碳形成。

2. 反应物类型：与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢通常导致较低的积碳形成。这归因于丙烯基比乙烯基更容易氢化。

3. 积碳分布：大部分积累的积碳存在于催化剂载体上，只有一小部分在金属颗粒表面。然而，据推测，由丙烷衍生的积碳物种流动性较差，导致在活性金属颗粒上积碳堆积更多。

4. 氢气的作用：向进料中添加H2可以通过氢化积碳前体物种来减少积碳形成。

5. 失活机制：积碳积累与脱氢活性损失之间没有直接相关性。在丙烷脱氢中，尽管总体积碳形成较少，但失活增加，这归因于活性金属颗粒表面被积碳覆盖程度更高。

该研究没有明确提到用于阐明积碳成分性质的具体分析技术。然而，研究结果表明，使用了能够区分载体上和金属颗粒上积碳的技术，以及能够量化积碳相对于暴露金属原子量的方法。为了充分表征积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性，可能需要额外的分析技术，但这些在给定的文献中并未讨论。
