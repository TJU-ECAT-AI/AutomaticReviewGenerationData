[1] "The observation of a maximum in catalyst activity with increasing Ga/Pt ratio very likely reflects the influence of a monotonic decrease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused by the presence of Ga atoms at the catalyst surface."

[2] "The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation between loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation. Moreover, the ratios of deposited carbon to surface Pt atoms are much greater than unity in all cases. This suggests that the most of the accumulated coke is present on the support and that only a small fraction remains on the surface of the metal particles."

[3] "The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that the bulk accumulates on the support."

[4] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne, whereas the disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of the surface of the active metal particle by coke."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the composition of coke deposits or analytical techniques used to study them in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does offer some insights into coke formation and its effects:

1. Coke accumulation does not directly correlate with loss of dehydrogenation activity.

2. Most of the coke accumulates on the catalyst support rather than on the metal particles.

3. The amount of coke formed is greater for ethane dehydrogenation than for propane dehydrogenation.

4. In propane dehydrogenation, there is less overall coke formation but greater deactivation compared to ethane dehydrogenation. This is attributed to greater coverage of the active metal particle surface by coke in propane dehydrogenation.

5. The ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne contributes to lower coke formation in propane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not mention specific analytical techniques used to study the composition of coke deposits. To fully answer the question, more research focusing on coke characterization methods and detailed compositional analysis would be needed.

该文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积炭沉积物成分的详细信息或用于研究它们的分析技术。但是，它确实提供了一些关于积炭形成及其影响的见解：

1. 积炭的积累与脱氢活性的损失没有直接关联。

2. 大部分积炭积累在催化剂载体上，而不是金属颗粒上。

3. 乙烷脱氢形成的积炭量大于丙烷脱氢。

4. 在丙烷脱氢中，虽然总体积炭形成较少，但失活程度更大，这归因于丙烷脱氢中活性金属颗粒表面被积炭覆盖程度更高。

5. 相比于乙烯基，丙烯基更容易加氢，这有助于丙烷脱氢过程中形成较少的积炭。

文献中没有提到用于研究积炭沉积物成分的具体分析技术。要全面回答这个问题，需要更多关于积炭表征方法和详细成分分析的研究。
