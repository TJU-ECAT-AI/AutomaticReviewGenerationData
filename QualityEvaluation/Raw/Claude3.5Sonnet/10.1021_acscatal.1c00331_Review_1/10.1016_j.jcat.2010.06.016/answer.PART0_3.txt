[1] "The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation between loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation. Moreover, the ratios of deposited carbon to surface Pt atoms are much greater than unity in all cases. This suggests that the most of the accumulated coke is present on the support and that only a small fraction remains on the surface of the metal particles."

[2] "the overall amount of coke formed is greater during ethane dehydrogenation than during propane, but the deactivation is greater during propane dehydrogenation than during ethane; therefore, the total amount of coke formed cannot be responsible for the increased deactivation."

[3] "the adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide detailed information on the composition of coke deposits or analytical techniques used to study them. However, it does offer some insights into coke formation patterns:

1. Coke accumulation is not directly correlated with loss of catalyst activity.

2. Most coke accumulates on the catalyst support rather than the metal particles.

3. More coke forms during ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

4. Adding hydrogen to the feed reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursors.

5. The nature of coke species may differ between ethane and propane dehydrogenation, with propane-derived coke potentially being less mobile and covering more of the metal surface.

The study does not mention specific analytical techniques used to characterize coke composition. To fully answer the question, additional research focused on coke characterization methods in PDH systems would be needed.

该文献并未提供关于焦炭沉积物成分的详细信息或用于研究它们的分析技术。但是，它确实提供了一些关于焦炭形成模式的见解：

1. 焦炭积累与催化剂活性损失没有直接相关性。

2. 大部分焦炭积累在催化剂载体上，而不是金属颗粒上。

3. 与丙烷脱氢相比，乙烷脱氢过程中形成更多焦炭。

4. 向进料中添加氢气可以通过氢化焦炭前体来减少焦炭形成。

5. 乙烷和丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭物种的性质可能不同，丙烷衍生的焦炭可能流动性较差，覆盖金属表面的面积更大。

该研究没有提及用于表征焦炭成分的具体分析技术。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行额外的研究，重点关注PDH系统中的焦炭表征方法。
