[1] "The presence of Ga compared to Sn reduced the deactivation and the amount of coke deposited during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne"

[4] "Thus, we hypothesize that less mobile coke species derived from propane are responsible for a larger coke buildup on the active metal particles, and hence a larger deactivation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions. While the document does not provide extensive details on the specific composition of coke deposits, it does offer some insights:

1. Coke formation is generally lower for propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

2. The presence of Ga in catalysts reduces coke deposition compared to Sn-modified catalysts.

3. Despite lower overall coke formation, propane dehydrogenation leads to a larger coke buildup on active metal particles, suggesting differences in coke mobility and composition.

4. The coke species derived from propane are thought to be less mobile than those from ethane.

The document does not mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, it does reference CO chemisorption measurements to indirectly assess the impact of coke on catalyst surface sites. To fully characterize the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, additional analytical techniques would likely be necessary, but these are not discussed in the given literature.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随着不同的催化剂类型和反应条件而变化。虽然文献没有提供积碳沉积物具体组成的详细信息，但它确实提供了一些见解：

1. 与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢的积碳形成通常较少。

2. 与Sn改性催化剂相比，Ga在催化剂中的存在减少了积碳沉积。

3. 尽管总体积碳形成较少，但丙烷脱氢导致活性金属颗粒上的积碳堆积更多，这表明积碳的移动性和组成存在差异。

4. 认为由丙烷衍生的积碳物种比乙烷衍生的积碳物种移动性更低。

文献没有提到用于阐明积碳成分性质的具体分析技术。然而，它确实提到了使用CO化学吸附测量来间接评估积碳对催化剂表面位点的影响。为了充分表征积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性，可能需要额外的分析技术，但这些在给定的文献中并未讨论。
