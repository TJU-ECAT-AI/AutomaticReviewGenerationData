[1] "The presence of Ga compared to Sn reduced the deactivation and the amount of coke deposited during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "Coke accumulation with time on stream is greater for ethane than propane dehydrogenation, and the moles of carbon deposited on the catalyst are many times higher than the moles of exposed Pt atoms."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne"

[4] "Thus, we hypothesize that less mobile coke species derived from propane are responsible for a larger coke buildup on the active metal particles, and hence a larger deactivation."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions. While the document does not provide extensive details on the specific composition of coke deposits, it does offer some insights:

1. Coke formation is generally lower for propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation.

2. The presence of Ga in catalysts reduces coke deposition compared to Sn-modified catalysts.

3. Despite lower overall coke formation, propane dehydrogenation leads to a larger coke buildup on active metal particles, suggesting differences in coke mobility and composition.

4. The coke species derived from propane are thought to be less mobile than those from ethane.

The document does not mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, it does reference CO chemisorption measurements to indirectly assess the impact of coke on catalyst surface sites. To fully characterize the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, additional analytical techniques would likely be necessary, but these are not discussed in the given literature.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成随着不同的催化剂类型和反应条件而变化。虽然文献没有提供积碳沉积物具体组成的详细信息，但它确实提供了一些见解：

1. 与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢的积碳形成通常较少。

2. 与Sn改性催化剂相比，Ga在催化剂中的存在减少了积碳沉积。

3. 尽管总体积碳形成较少，但丙烷脱氢导致活性金属颗粒上的积碳堆积更多，这表明积碳的移动性和组成存在差异。

4. 认为由丙烷衍生的积碳物种比乙烷衍生的积碳物种移动性更低。

文献没有提到用于阐明积碳成分性质的具体分析技术。然而，它确实提到了使用CO化学吸附测量来间接评估积碳对催化剂表面位点的影响。为了充分表征积碳成分的复杂性质和多样性，可能需要额外的分析技术，但这些在给定的文献中并未讨论。

[1] "The observation of a maximum in catalyst activity with increasing Ga/Pt ratio very likely reflects the influence of a monotonic decrease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused by the presence of Ga atoms at the catalyst surface."

[2] "The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation between loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation. Moreover, the ratios of deposited carbon to surface Pt atoms are much greater than unity in all cases. This suggests that the most of the accumulated coke is present on the support and that only a small fraction remains on the surface of the metal particles."

[3] "The lack of correlation between extent of deactivation and carbon formation suggests that only a small fraction of the accumulated coke resides on the surface of the Pt particles and that the bulk accumulates on the support."

[4] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne, whereas the disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of the surface of the active metal particle by coke."

The literature does not provide detailed information about the composition of coke deposits or analytical techniques used to study them in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does offer some insights into coke formation and its effects:

1. Coke accumulation does not directly correlate with loss of dehydrogenation activity.

2. Most of the coke accumulates on the catalyst support rather than on the metal particles.

3. The amount of coke formed is greater for ethane dehydrogenation than for propane dehydrogenation.

4. In propane dehydrogenation, there is less overall coke formation but greater deactivation compared to ethane dehydrogenation. This is attributed to greater coverage of the active metal particle surface by coke in propane dehydrogenation.

5. The ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne contributes to lower coke formation in propane dehydrogenation.

The literature does not mention specific analytical techniques used to study the composition of coke deposits. To fully answer the question, more research focusing on coke characterization methods and detailed compositional analysis would be needed.

该文献并未提供关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中积炭沉积物成分的详细信息或用于研究它们的分析技术。但是，它确实提供了一些关于积炭形成及其影响的见解：

1. 积炭的积累与脱氢活性的损失没有直接关联。

2. 大部分积炭积累在催化剂载体上，而不是金属颗粒上。

3. 乙烷脱氢形成的积炭量大于丙烷脱氢。

4. 在丙烷脱氢中，虽然总体积炭形成较少，但失活程度更大，这归因于丙烷脱氢中活性金属颗粒表面被积炭覆盖程度更高。

5. 相比于乙烯基，丙烯基更容易加氢，这有助于丙烷脱氢过程中形成较少的积炭。

文献中没有提到用于研究积炭沉积物成分的具体分析技术。要全面回答这个问题，需要更多关于积炭表征方法和详细成分分析的研究。

[1] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne, whereas the disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of the surface of the active metal particle by coke."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study found that less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation. Most of the coke was found to reside on the catalyst support rather than on the active metal particles. 

The lower coke formation in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to the easier hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne. However, despite lower overall coke formation, propane dehydrogenation showed increased catalyst deactivation due to greater coke coverage on the active metal particles.

The study does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, the findings suggest that techniques capable of distinguishing between coke on the support and on the metal particles were employed, as well as methods to quantify the amount of coke relative to exposed metal atoms.

丙烷脱氢中积碳形成较少的原因被归因于丙烯基比乙烯基更容易加氢。然而，尽管整体积碳形成较少，丙烷脱氢表现出更严重的催化剂失活，这是由于活性金属颗粒表面被积碳覆盖程度更高。

[2] "the overall amount of coke formed is greater during ethane dehydrogenation than during propane, but the deactivation is greater during propane dehydrogenation than during ethane; therefore, the total amount of coke formed cannot be responsible for the increased deactivation."

[3] "the adsorption of H2 is not only crucial to reducing the amount of coke formed on the catalysts, via the hydrogenation of coke precursor species, but also accounts for the lower coke formation noted during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide detailed information on the composition of coke deposits or analytical techniques used to study them. However, it does offer some insights into coke formation patterns:

1. Coke accumulation is not directly correlated with loss of catalyst activity.

2. Most coke accumulates on the catalyst support rather than the metal particles.

3. More coke forms during ethane dehydrogenation compared to propane dehydrogenation.

4. Adding hydrogen to the feed reduces coke formation by hydrogenating coke precursors.

5. The nature of coke species may differ between ethane and propane dehydrogenation, with propane-derived coke potentially being less mobile and covering more of the metal surface.

The study does not mention specific analytical techniques used to characterize coke composition. To fully answer the question, additional research focused on coke characterization methods in PDH systems would be needed.

The research mainly focuses on comparing coke formation between different catalysts and reaction conditions, rather than analyzing the detailed composition of the coke deposits.

The study suggests that the relationship between coke formation and catalyst deactivation is not straightforward. For propane dehydrogenation, there is a disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation, which is attributed to a greater coverage of the active metal particle surface by coke. This indicates that the distribution and location of coke deposits, rather than just the total amount, play a crucial role in catalyst performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因不同的催化剂类型和反应条件而异。研究表明，与传统的双金属催化剂（如PtSn/Mg(Al)O和PtGa/Mg(Al)O）相比，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂表现出较低的积碳形成。

研究表明，大部分积累的积碳存在于催化剂载体上，只有一小部分残留在金属颗粒表面。有趣的是，与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢显示出较低的积碳形成，这归因于丙烯基的氢化比乙烯基更容易。

然而，该研究并未提供关于用于阐明积碳成分复杂性和多样性的具体分析技术的详细信息。研究主要集中在比较不同催化剂和反应条件下的积碳形成，而不是分析积碳沉积物的详细组成。

研究表明，积碳形成与催化剂失活之间的关系并不简单。对于丙烷脱氢，积碳形成减少与失活增加之间存在差异，这归因于活性金属颗粒表面被积碳覆盖程度更高。这表明积碳沉积物的分布和位置，而不仅仅是总量，在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。
