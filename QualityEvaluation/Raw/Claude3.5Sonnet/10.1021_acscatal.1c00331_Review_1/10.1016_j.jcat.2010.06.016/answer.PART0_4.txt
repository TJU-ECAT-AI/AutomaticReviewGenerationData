[1] "The results presented in Figs. 1, 4, 6 and 9 demonstrate that there is no correlation between loss in dehydrogenation activity and coke accumulation. Moreover, the ratios of deposited carbon to surface Pt atoms are much greater than unity in all cases. This suggests that the most of the accumulated coke is present on the support and that only a small fraction remains on the surface of the metal particles."

[2] "We have also shown that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower deactivation and coke formation than conventional bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne, whereas the disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of the surface of the active metal particle by coke."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different catalyst types and reaction conditions. The study shows that Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O catalysts exhibit lower coke formation compared to conventional bimetallic catalysts like PtSn/Mg(Al)O and PtGa/Mg(Al)O. 

The research indicates that most of the accumulated coke is present on the catalyst support, with only a small fraction remaining on the surface of the metal particles. Interestingly, propane dehydrogenation showed lower coke formation compared to ethane dehydrogenation, which is attributed to the easier hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne.

However, the study does not provide detailed information about the specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents. The research mainly focuses on comparing coke formation between different catalysts and reaction conditions, rather than analyzing the detailed composition of the coke deposits.

The study suggests that the relationship between coke formation and catalyst deactivation is not straightforward. For propane dehydrogenation, there is a disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation, which is attributed to a greater coverage of the active metal particle surface by coke. This indicates that the distribution and location of coke deposits, rather than just the total amount, play a crucial role in catalyst performance.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，积碳沉积物的组成因不同的催化剂类型和反应条件而异。研究表明，与传统的双金属催化剂（如PtSn/Mg(Al)O和PtGa/Mg(Al)O）相比，Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O催化剂表现出较低的积碳形成。

研究表明，大部分积累的积碳存在于催化剂载体上，只有一小部分残留在金属颗粒表面。有趣的是，与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢显示出较低的积碳形成，这归因于丙烯基的氢化比乙烯基更容易。

然而，该研究并未提供关于用于阐明积碳成分复杂性和多样性的具体分析技术的详细信息。研究主要集中在比较不同催化剂和反应条件下的积碳形成，而不是分析积碳沉积物的详细组成。

研究表明，积碳形成与催化剂失活之间的关系并不简单。对于丙烷脱氢，积碳形成减少与失活增加之间存在差异，这归因于活性金属颗粒表面被积碳覆盖程度更高。这表明积碳沉积物的分布和位置，而不仅仅是总量，在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。
