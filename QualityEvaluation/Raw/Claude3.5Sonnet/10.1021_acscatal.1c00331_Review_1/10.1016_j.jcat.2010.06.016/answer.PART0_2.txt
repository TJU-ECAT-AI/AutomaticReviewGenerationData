[1] "Interestingly, less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation than ethane dehydrogenation, and no correlation was found between coke formation and catalyst deactivation."

[2] "Since the amount of carbon deposited as coke is higher than the amount of exposed Pt, it is concluded that most of the coke resides on the support, and that only a small amount resides on the Pt particles."

[3] "The lower coke formation during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater ease of hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne, whereas the disparity between decreased coke formation and increased deactivation observed during propane dehydrogenation is attributed to a greater coverage of the surface of the active metal particle by coke."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study found that less coke was formed during propane dehydrogenation compared to ethane dehydrogenation. Most of the coke was found to reside on the catalyst support rather than on the active metal particles. 

The lower coke formation in propane dehydrogenation is attributed to the easier hydrogenation of propylidyne compared to ethylidyne. However, despite lower overall coke formation, propane dehydrogenation showed increased catalyst deactivation due to greater coke coverage on the active metal particles.

The study does not explicitly mention specific analytical techniques used to elucidate the nature of coke constituents. However, the findings suggest that techniques capable of distinguishing between coke on the support and on the metal particles were employed, as well as methods to quantify the amount of coke relative to exposed metal atoms.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有所变化。研究发现，与乙烷脱氢相比，丙烷脱氢过程中形成的积碳更少。大部分积碳沉积在催化剂载体上，而不是在活性金属颗粒上。

丙烷脱氢中积碳形成较少的原因被归因于丙烯基比乙烯基更容易加氢。然而，尽管整体积碳形成较少，丙烷脱氢表现出更严重的催化剂失活，这是由于活性金属颗粒表面被积碳覆盖程度更高。

该研究没有明确提到用于阐明积碳成分性质的具体分析技术。然而，研究结果表明，使用了能够区分载体上和金属颗粒上积碳的技术，以及能够量化积碳相对于暴露金属原子量的方法。
