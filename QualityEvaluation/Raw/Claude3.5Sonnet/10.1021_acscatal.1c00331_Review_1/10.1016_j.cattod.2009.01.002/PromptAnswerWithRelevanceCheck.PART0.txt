<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses on comparing the catalytic performance and coking behavior of Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide details on the chemical nature or diversity of the coke deposits formed. The study uses a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) to measure overall coke formation, but does not employ analytical techniques to elucidate the composition of the coke.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any specific information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents. The document focuses more on catalyst preparation, characterization, and overall performance in propane dehydrogenation, but does not go into detail about the nature of coke deposits or methods to analyze them. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有包含关于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中催化系统中焦炭沉积物组成的具体信息,也没有提到用于研究焦炭成分的分析技术。该文档更多地关注催化剂的制备、表征和丙烷脱氢的整体性能,但没有详细讨论焦炭沉积物的性质或分析方法。因此,无法根据提供的文本直接回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain any specific information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions or analytical techniques used to study coke constituents. The document focuses on comparing the performance of Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, including their activity, selectivity, and coke formation, but does not provide details on the chemical nature or analysis methods of the coke deposits. To answer this question, additional literature specifically focused on coke characterization in PDH catalysts would be needed.

The provided literature does not contain specific information about the composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems or propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions across different conditions and catalyst types. The document does not discuss analytical techniques used to study coke constituents in detail. While the text mentions coke formation during propane dehydrogenation over Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalysts, it does not provide information about the composition or diversity of coke deposits. The study focuses more on the amount of coke formed rather than its composition or the analytical techniques used to characterize it.
