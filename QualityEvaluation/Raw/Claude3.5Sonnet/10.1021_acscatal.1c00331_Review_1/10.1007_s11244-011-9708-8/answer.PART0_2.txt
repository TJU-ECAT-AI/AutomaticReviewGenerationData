[1] "Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support."

[3] "Figures 4 and 5 show the IR spectra of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts coked with different gas compositions."

[4] "Figure 6 shows the Raman spectra of the coked catalysts (Samples S6, S7, S8, S9, and S10)."

[5] "The influences of gas compositions on the rates of coke formation over a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst are studied."

[6] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. Location: Two types of coke are identified - coke on the metal and coke on the support.

2. Composition: Coke formed on the metal contains more hydrogen and is softer than coke formed on the support.

3. Effect of gas composition: 
   - On metal: Coke formation is weakly dependent on propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases with propane pressure.
   - On support: Coke formation increases with propane and propylene pressures but decreases with hydrogen pressure.

4. Catalyst type: The nature of coke varies between PtSn/Al2O3 and Pt/MgO catalysts.

Several analytical techniques were employed to elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) profiles: Used to identify and distinguish between coke on metal and support.

2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy: Employed to analyze the structural characteristics of coke formed under different gas compositions.

3. Raman Spectroscopy: Used to study the degree of graphitization and the nature of carbon species in the coke.

4. Elemental Analysis: Employed to determine the H/C ratio of the coke, providing insights into its hydrogen content.

These techniques collectively provided a comprehensive understanding of the coke composition, structure, and formation mechanisms under various reaction conditions and catalyst types in PDH systems.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著差异：

1. 位置：识别出两种类型的焦炭 - 金属上的焦炭和载体上的焦炭。

2. 组成：金属上形成的焦炭含氢量更高，比载体上形成的焦炭更软。

3. 气体组成的影响：
   - 在金属上：焦炭形成对丙烯和氢气压力的依赖性较弱，但随丙烷压力增加而增加。
   - 在载体上：焦炭形成随丙烷和丙烯压力增加而增加，但随氢气压力增加而减少。

4. 催化剂类型：PtSn/Al2O3和Pt/MgO催化剂上焦炭的性质有所不同。

采用了几种分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性：

1. 程序升温氧化(TPO)谱：用于识别和区分金属和载体上的焦炭。

2. 红外(IR)光谱：用于分析在不同气体组成下形成的焦炭的结构特征。

3. 拉曼光谱：用于研究焦炭中石墨化程度和碳物种的性质。

4. 元素分析：用于测定焦炭的H/C比，提供其氢含量的信息。

这些技术共同为理解PDH系统中在各种反应条件和催化剂类型下的焦炭组成、结构和形成机理提供了全面的认识。
