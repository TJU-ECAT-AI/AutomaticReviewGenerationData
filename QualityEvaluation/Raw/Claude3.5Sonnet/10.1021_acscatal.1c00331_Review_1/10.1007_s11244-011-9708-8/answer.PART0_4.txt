[1] "Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support."

[3] "Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation."

[4] "The coked alumina (S9) has the lowest while the coked Pt/MgO (S10) has the highest H/C ratio, which indicates that the coke formed on the alumina is relatively deficient in hydrogen while the coke formed on the Pt surfaces is rich in hydrogen."

[5] "Thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and elemental analysis" were used to characterize the coke.

[6] "The H/C ratios of the cokes are very high (Table 1), especially on the metal surfaces, indicating that the coke contains mainly aliphatic hydrocarbons."

[7] "Increasing the propylene concentration will increase the degree of polymerization of the polymers, which will be further dehydrogenated to aromatics. The degree of the aromatization of the coke is enhanced as a result of the increased propylene concentration and weakened as a result of the increased hydrogen concentration"

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types:

1. Location of coke formation: Coke can form on both the metal catalyst and the support material, with distinct characteristics for each.

2. Hydrogen content: Coke formed on metal surfaces typically has a higher hydrogen content compared to coke on the support. This is indicated by higher H/C ratios.

3. Structure: Coke on metal surfaces tends to be softer and more aliphatic in nature, while coke on the support is harder and more aromatic.

4. Influence of reaction conditions: 
   - Increased propylene concentration leads to higher polymerization and aromatization of coke.
   - Higher hydrogen concentration reduces the degree of aromatization.

5. Catalyst type impact: Different catalysts (e.g., PtSn/Al2O3 vs Pt/MgO) show varying coke compositions and structures.

To elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents, several analytical techniques were employed:

1. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)
2. IR Spectroscopy
3. Raman Spectroscopy
4. Elemental Analysis

These techniques provided complementary information on coke composition, structure, and thermal properties, allowing for a comprehensive characterization of the complex coke deposits formed under different conditions and on various catalyst types.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著变化：

1. 焦炭形成位置：焦炭可以在金属催化剂和载体材料上形成，每种位置的焦炭具有不同的特征。

2. 氢含量：在金属表面形成的焦炭通常比载体上形成的焦炭具有更高的氢含量。这通过更高的H/C比率表示。

3. 结构：金属表面上的焦炭倾向于更软且更具脂肪族性质，而载体上的焦炭更硬且更具芳香族性质。

4. 反应条件的影响：
   - 丙烯浓度增加导致焦炭的聚合和芳构化程度更高。
   - 更高的氢气浓度降低了芳构化程度。

5. 催化剂类型的影响：不同的催化剂（如PtSn/Al2O3与Pt/MgO）显示出不同的焦炭组成和结构。

为了阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性，采用了几种分析技术：

1. 热重分析(TGA)
2. 红外光谱
3. 拉曼光谱
4. 元素分析

这些技术提供了关于焦炭组成、结构和热性质的互补信息，允许对在不同条件下和各种催化剂类型上形成的复杂焦炭沉积物进行全面表征。
