The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study reveals two distinct types of coke:

1. Coke deposited on the metal: This type of coke is softer and contains more hydrogen. It is characterized by a lower combustion temperature (150-280°C).

2. Coke deposited on the support: This type of coke is harder and contains less hydrogen. It has a higher combustion temperature (380-430°C).

The composition of coke is influenced by various factors, including the partial pressures of propane, propylene, and hydrogen. Higher propylene concentrations lead to increased polymerization and aromatization of coke, while higher hydrogen concentrations reduce the molecular weight of the polymer during propylene polymerization.

To elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, several analytical techniques were employed:

1. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA): Used to determine the amounts of coke formed on spent catalysts and to obtain temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles.

2. Elemental Analysis: Employed to determine the hydrogen-to-carbon (H/C) ratio of the coke.

3. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR): Used to identify different characteristics of the cokes, such as aliphatic and aromatic nature.

4. Raman Spectroscopy: Utilized to assess the degree of graphitization of the coke and to identify different carbon species.

These techniques provided complementary information about the coke composition, structure, and location on the catalyst, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of coke formation and its impact on catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，积碳沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著变化。研究揭示了两种不同类型的积碳：

1. 沉积在金属上的积碳：这种类型的积碳较软，含氢量更高。它的燃烧温度较低（150-280°C）。

2. 沉积在载体上的积碳：这种类型的积碳较硬，含氢量较低。它的燃烧温度较高（380-430°C）。

积碳的组成受到多种因素的影响，包括丙烷、丙烯和氢气的分压。较高的丙烯浓度会导致积碳的聚合和芳构化程度增加，而较高的氢气浓度会在丙烯聚合过程中降低聚合物的分子量。

为了阐明积碳成分的复杂性和多样性，研究采用了几种分析技术：

1. 热重分析（TGA）：用于确定spent催化剂上形成的积碳量，并获得程序升温氧化（TPO）曲线。

2. 元素分析：用于确定积碳的氢碳（H/C）比。

3. 傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）：用于识别积碳的不同特征，如脂肪族和芳香族性质。

4. 拉曼光谱：用于评估积碳的石墨化程度和识别不同的碳物种。

这些技术提供了关于积碳组成、结构和在催化剂上位置的互补信息，使我们能够全面理解PDH反应中积碳的形成及其对催化剂性能的影响。
