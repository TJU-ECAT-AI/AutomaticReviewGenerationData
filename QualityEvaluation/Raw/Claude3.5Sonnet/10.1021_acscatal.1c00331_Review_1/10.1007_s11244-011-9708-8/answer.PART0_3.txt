[1] "Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively."

[2] "The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support."

[3] "The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure."

[4] "The amounts of coke formed on the spent catalysts (or coked alumina) were determined by TG (thermal gravimetric) analysis (SDT Q600, TA Company, USA) in air."

[5] "Elemental analysis was carried out on a Vario EL III Elementar analyzer."

[6] "FTIR analysis was carried out on a Bruker Equinox-55 with a resolution of 4.0 cm1 and the scanned wave number was ranged from 4000 to 400 cm1."

[7] "Raman analysis was performed at room temperature under ambient conditions on a Renishaw inVia + Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser beam."

The composition of coke deposits in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study identifies two main types of coke: one formed on the metal and another on the support. The coke on the metal is softer and contains more hydrogen compared to the coke on the support.

The composition and formation rate of coke are influenced by reaction conditions:

1. On the metal: Coke formation is weakly dependent on propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases with propane pressure.
2. On the support: Coke formation increases with propane and propylene pressures but decreases with hydrogen pressure.

Various analytical techniques were employed to elucidate the nature and diversity of coke constituents:

1. Thermal Gravimetric (TG) Analysis: Used to determine the amounts of coke formed on spent catalysts.
2. Elemental Analysis: Conducted using a Vario EL III Elementar analyzer to determine the elemental composition of coke.
3. FTIR Analysis: Performed on a Bruker Equinox-55 to identify different functional groups in the coke.
4. Raman Spectroscopy: Carried out on a Renishaw inVia + Reflex Raman spectrometer to study the structural characteristics of coke.

These techniques collectively provided a comprehensive understanding of the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents in PDH systems under various conditions and catalyst types.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下有显著变化。研究识别出两种主要类型的焦炭：一种形成在金属上，另一种形成在载体上。金属上的焦炭较软，含氢量较高，而载体上的焦炭则相对较硬。

焦炭的组成和形成速率受反应条件的影响：

1. 在金属上：焦炭形成对丙烯和氢气压力的依赖性较弱，但随丙烷压力的增加而增加。
2. 在载体上：焦炭形成随丙烷和丙烯压力的增加而增加，但随氢气压力的增加而减少。

研究采用了多种分析技术来阐明焦炭成分的性质和多样性：

1. 热重（TG）分析：用于确定已使用催化剂上形成的焦炭量。
2. 元素分析：使用Vario EL III元素分析仪进行，以确定焦炭的元素组成。
3. FTIR分析：在Bruker Equinox-55上进行，用于识别焦炭中的不同官能团。
4. 拉曼光谱：在Renishaw inVia + Reflex拉曼光谱仪上进行，用于研究焦炭的结构特征。

这些技术综合起来，为在各种条件和催化剂类型下PDH系统中焦炭成分的复杂性质和多样性提供了全面的理解。
