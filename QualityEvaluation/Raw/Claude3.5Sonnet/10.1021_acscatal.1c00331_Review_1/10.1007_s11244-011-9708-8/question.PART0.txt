Abstract
The influences of gas compositions on the rates of coke formation over a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst are studied. The coke formed on the catalyst is characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Two kinds of coke are identified from the TPO profiles and assigned to the coke on the metal and the coke on the support, respectively. The coke formed on the metal is softer (containing more hydrogen) than that formed on the support. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increasing with the propane pressure, while the rate of coke formation on the support is increasing with the propane and propylene pressures and decreasing with the hydrogen pressure. Based on the kinetic analysis, a mechanism for the coke formation on the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is proposed, and the dimerization of adsorbed C3H6 is identified to be the kinetic relevant step for coke formation on the metal.

1 Introduction
Recently the rapidly rising needs for propylene [13] have driven searching for new propylene production techniques. Propane dehydrogenation, developed commercially in 1980s, is an on-purpose technique for propylene production and is now making big contributions to the world propylene supply in recent years [4].
Pt based catalyst is the most popular catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and is used in commercial Oleflex process. This catalyst, as well as other catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, is quickly deactivated, mainly by coke formation, and the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt catalyst is still not clear. Understanding the mechanism of coke formation is of great significance. On one hand, based on the mechanism of coke formation, one can optimize the reaction conditions to reduce the frequency of dehydrogenation and regeneration cycle by controlling the rate of coke formation so as to increase the propylene productivity. On the other hand, it can help the rational design of the catalyst to reduce the rate of coke formation while maintaining the activity and selectivity in dehydrogenation.
Coke formation on Pt or modified Pt catalysts during propane dehydrogenation has been studied by a number of researchers. Most of the studies were targeted to reduce the coking rate by modifying Pt, for example, with Sn or alkali metals, and/or using different catalyst supports. Praserthdam et al. [5] showed that alkali metals (such as Li, Na, and K) would help to reduce the coking rate by providing excess mobile electrons to the Pt catalyst. Another straightforward method to reduce the amount of coke formed is to use supports with weak acidity, e.g. SBA-15 [6], which is effected by weakening propylene adsorption and suppressing propylene dehydrogenation or polymerization.
The rate of coke formation depends highly on the operating conditions. Larsson et al. [7] studied the coke formation on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, and suggested that only a small part of the formed coke was responsible for catalyst deactivation, and that a major part of the coke was formed regardless of the gas composition but dependent on the temperature. They also concluded that hydrogen could reduce the rate of coke formation and correspondingly the rate of catalyst deactivation by suppressing coke precursor formation, but hydrogen could not remove the coke that had already been formed on the catalyst. Rebo et al. [8] studied the coke formation on PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst using an oscillating microbalance reactor and concluded that coke formation was a structure sensitive reaction and hydrogen could decrease the rate of coke formation as well as the deactivating effect of the coke formed.
Coke could be formed either on the support or on the metal, and the coke deposited on different sites is supposed to have different effects on catalyst deactivation. Studies on the influences of reaction conditions on the rate of coke formation and the nature of the coke deposited on different sites are essential for the understanding of the mechanism of coke formation as well as the mechanism of catalyst deactivation. However, studies on the influences of reaction conditions, especially gas compositions, during propane dehydrogenation are seldom reported.
In this work, we study the influences of gas compositions on coke formation on the metal and support of a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst during propane dehydrogenation. Based on these results, the kinetic relevant step in coke formation on the metal is identified and a mechanism of coke formation is then proposed.
2 Experimental
2.1 Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
The PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst used for this study was prepared by incipient impregnation of alumina (Pural 200) with H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 solutions, followed by calcination at 530 C and treatment in steam to remove chlorine. A Pt/MgO catalyst was also prepared by impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by N2 physisorption on ASAP 2010 (Micromeritics, USA) at 196 C after outgassing the samples for at least 5 h at 190 C and 1 mm Hg vacuum. The specific surface areas were calculated with BET equation, and the pore volumes and pore size distributions were determined from the N2 desorption isotherms by using the BJH method. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the catalysts.

Besides, alumina (Pural 200), which was the support for the PtSn catalyst, was also used as a blank catalyst for comparison.
2.2 Coking Experiments
The catalysts were evaluated in a tubular stainless steel reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm, the temperature of which was maintained by an electrical furnace jacketing outside of the reactor. Inserted inside the catalyst packing (100 mg) was a thermocouple to indicate the real temperature of reaction. Silica particles as inert packing were used for uniform flow distribution. An online gas chromatography (Agilent 4890D) was used to measure the outlet gas concentrations. The catalyst (or the alumina), which had particle sizes between 0.1 and 0.15 mm, was firstly reduced at 500 C in flowing hydrogen (10 ml/min) for 100 min and the temperature was then ramped to 575 C in argon (40 ml/min). The feed gas was then introduced into the reactor for coking experiment. In all the experiments, argon was used as a balance gas and the total flow rate was maintained at 80 ml/min. After 80 min of reaction, the reactor was switched to pure argon flow and then cooled down to room temperature. Table 2 shows the feed compositions and averaged gas compositions in the reactor during the experiments.

2.3 Coke Characterization
The amounts of coke formed on the spent catalysts (or coked alumina) were determined by TG (thermal gravimetric) analysis (SDT Q600, TA Company, USA) in air. During the TG analysis, the temperature was increased from ambient temperature to 600 C (sometimes higher) at a rate of 10 C/min, during which the temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles and heat flow curves were recorded. Elemental analysis was carried out on a Vario EL III Elementar analyzer. The coked samples were firstly dissolved in a hydrofluoric acid solution (40%) at room temperature to liberate the coke from the support. Then the coke was dried at 50 C and collected for testing. FTIR analysis was carried out on a Bruker Equinox-55 with a resolution of 4.0 cm1 and the scanned wave number was ranged from 4000 to 400 cm1. Raman analysis was performed at room temperature under ambient conditions on a Renishaw inVia + Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 514.5 nm Ar-ion laser beam.
3 Results
3.1 Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
Figures 13 show the TPO profiles of the spent PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts coked with different gas compositions at 575 C for 80 min. Two peaks, locating in the interval of 150280 C (Peak I) and in the interval of 380430 C (Peak II), respectively, are present in each profile. However, for coked alumina (Sample S9) and Pt/MgO catalyst (Sample S10), only one peak, at around 470 and 310 C, respectively, is present in the TPO profiles (not shown here). To determine the amount of coke losses, the TPO profiles are deconvoluted by multiple Gaussian functions using a non-linear least-squared optimization procedure based on LevenbergMarquardt algorithm. This method fits the TPO profiles quite well and the results are summarized in Table 3.

Figure 1 shows that the area of Peak II increases while that of Peak I is almost unchanged when the partial pressure of propylene is increased (Samples S1S3). Consequently the total amount of coke increases with the partial pressure of propylene. Figure 2 indicates that the addition of hydrogen in the feed has greatly suppressed coke formation: if there is only 1.9% hydrogen (Sample S4) in the gas, the total amount of coke is as high as 3.80 wt%, while if the hydrogen content in the gas is increased to 13.6 wt% (Sample S5), the total coke amount is decreased to 1.44 wt%. It is also noted that for sample S4 or S5, the decrease in the total amount of coke, denoted by the areas of Peak I and Peak II, is mainly due to the decrease of the area of Peak II, as seen from Table 3. Figure 3 shows that the areas of both Peak I and Peak II increase with the partial pressure of propane.

Moreover, Peak II shifts to higher temperature, from 385.3 to 389.6 and then to 398.0 C, as the partial pressure of propylene increases (Fig. 1) and shifts to lower temperature as the partial pressure of hydrogen increases (Fig. 2). Peak I also shifts to higher temperature as the partial pressure of propane increases (Fig. 3).
The released heats by oxidation of the cokes on Samples S2, S3, and S5 at the two peak temperatures are calculated from the integration of the heat flow curve and have already been listed in Table 3 in terms of the heat ratios. It is observed that the heat ratio is always larger than the area ratio.
3.2 Elemental Analysis
The results of elemental analysis of the coke are listed in Table 3 in terms of H/C ratio. For most samples (except for Samples S4, S9, and S10), the H/C ratios are in the range of 1.72.0, which is an indication of the relatively high hydrogen content of the coke formed on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts. However, the H/C ratio of S4 is much lower than those of other coked PtSn samples, which is because of the very low hydrogen concentration in the feed flow. The coked alumina (S9) has the lowest while the coked Pt/MgO (S10) has the highest H/C ratio, which indicates that the coke formed on the alumina is relatively deficient in hydrogen while the coke formed on the Pt surfaces is rich in hydrogen.
3.3 IR Characterization
Figures 4 and 5 show the IR spectra of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts coked with different gas compositions. Several absorption bands appear between 600 and 3000 cm1, from which different characteristics of the cokes can be identified. Generally, the bands at 13501470 cm1 reflect the bending vibrations of CH in CH2 and CH3 groups [9], while the stronger absorption at 28502960 cm1 reflects the stretching vibrations of CH in CH, CH2 and CH3 groups [912]. The vibration bands of CH in alkenes (between 675 and 1000 cm1) [13] overlap the deformation vibration bands of CH in aromatics (between 680 and 880 cm1) [14], while the bands between 1640 and 1680 cm1 (representing the stretching vibrations of C=C in alkenes [13]) overlap the bands 16602000 cm1 (representing the external-plane-bending vibration of CH in aromatic rings [15]). The bands between 1450 and 1600 cm1 are originated from the skeleton vibration of C=C in aromatic rings [12, 16]. The absorption at 30003020 cm1 is the characteristic of C=C bonds in aliphatic hydrocarbon, while the absorption at 30203200 cm1 is the characteristic of C=C bonds in aromatics [9, 17]. Based on this information, the strongest absorption at about 2920 cm1 is chosen to represent the aliphatic nature of the coke and the absorption at around 3060 cm1 is chosen as the sign of the aromatic nature of the coke. The involved bands are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, in which, the absorption intensities at 2920 cm1 are scaled to the same magnitude for convenience of comparison.

As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the intensity at 3060 cm1 increases with the partial pressure of propylene but decreases with the partial pressure of hydrogen. Propylene promotes while hydrogen inhibits the formation of aromatic coke. These results are in good agreement with the shift of Peak II in Figs. 1 and 2.
3.4 Raman Spectral Analysis
Figure 6 shows the Raman spectra of the coked catalysts (Samples S6, S7, S8, S9, and S10). Five peaks are identified at 1336, 1602, 2700, 2920, and 3200 cm1, respectively. The bands at 1336 and 1602 cm1 are generally considered as the D band and G band [18, 19] and attributed to the ring stretching in polyaromatic compounds, which are considered to be the graphite-like carbon species [20, 21]. The region of 27003000 cm1 is supposed to be the CH stretching in alkyl hydrocarbon [19, 21, 22] while the band at 3200 cm1 is regarded as the CH stretching in aromatics [21, 22]. The intensity ratio of D band to G band is always used as an important measure of the degree of graphitization of carbon materials [23, 24]. A high ratio indicates a low degree of graphitization. Table 3 lists the ID/IG ratios of the coked catalysts.
Fig. 6

Full size image
As shown in Table 3, the ID/IG ratios of Samples S6S9 are very close to each other. However, the ID/IG ratio of the coked Pt/MgO catalyst (Sample S10) is large indicating the coke on the Pt/MgO catalyst has a low degree of graphitization. This is consistent with the results of elemental analysis and indicates that the coke on the alumina and PtSn catalysts has a H/C ratio lower than that on the Pt/MgO catalyst. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 6, the lower intensity of CH vibration in the aromatics (3200 cm1) on coked Pt/MgO catalyst were observed comparing to other samples. It indicates that the degree of graphitization of the coke on the Pt surfaces is lower, and coke molecules are more like olefin/paraffin.
3.5 Reaction Orders to Propane, Propylene and Hydrogen
Kinetic experiments were carried out under different gas compositions as summarized in Table 2, where the averaged compositions of gas between inlet and outlet of the reactor are also listed. During the course of reaction for 80 min, we observed that the amounts of the two types of coke were both increasing approximately linearly with time on stream (not shown here). The linear build-up of coke with time was also reported by Kumar et al. [25]. Therefore, the average coking rates were estimated in the present work based on the measured coke contents in 80 min of time on stream by assuming a constant coking rate.
The coking rates r1 and r2 were determined based on Peak I and II from the TPO spectra. The logarithms of the rates were then plotted against the logarithms of the partial pressures of propane, propylene and hydrogen, respectively, as shown in Figs. 7, 8 and 9.

Figure 7 shows that r1 is independent of the propylene pressure. As a result, Samples S1S5 and Sample S7 are all used to find the influences of the hydrogen pressure on r1, because these samples were obtained under similar partial pressures of propane. Figure 8 shows that r1 is also independent of the partial pressure of hydrogen. Samples S1S8 are then used to find the influences of the propane pressure on r1. Figure 9 shows that r1 is dependent on the partial pressure of propane with an apparent reaction order of 1.7. Summarizing Figs. 7, 8 and 9 we see that r2 is dependent on the partial pressures of propane, propylene and hydrogen and the reaction orders are 1.4, 1.0 and -0.7, respectively.
4 Discussions
4.1 Assignment of Peaks in the TPO Profiles
TG is a very useful method to identify and quantify the coke on the catalysts [2628]. The peaks in the TPO profiles can be attributed to the loss of carbonaceous deposits with different compositions and structures and/or the carbonaceous deposits located at different sites on the catalyst. The two peaks identified in the TPO profiles of coked catalysts shown above indicate that two types of coke are formed.
The two types of coke are usually considered to be formed on the metal and support, respectively [29, 30]. To confirm the locations of the coke, comparative experiments were carried out on pure alumina, which was used as the support for the PtSn catalyst, and the Pt/MgO catalyst, which had no acid sites on the support (Table 1). For coked alumina, a single peak emerges at around 470 C in the TPO profile, while for coked Pt/MgO catalyst the peak appears at around 310 C. This information confirms that Peak I and Peak II in the TPO profiles of Samples S1S8 are corresponding to the coke formed on the metal and support, respectively. As a result, in this study, we assign Peak I to the coke deposited on the metal and Peak II to the coke deposited on the support.
4.2 The Nature of Coke
It is interesting to note from Table 3 that the ratios of the combustion heats of the two types of coke are much higher than the ratios of the masses determined by TPO. This fact clearly indicates that the coke on the metal has a higher H/C ratio than that on the support, which is consistent with the results of elemental analysis (Samples S9 and S10). Based on the results of TPO, TG, and DTA of the Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts coked in n-butane dehydrogenation, Zhang et al. [31] also suggested that the coke formed on the metal had a higher hydrogen content. The same conclusion was obtained by Srihiranpullop et al. [32] when studying the coke formation on Pt, PtSn, and PtSnK catalysts during n-hexane dehydrogenation. In addition, we note that Peak I shifts to higher temperature when the propane pressure is increased. This is because the coke covers the metal surface and reduces the rate of coke combustion by increasing the resistance of oxygen diffusion [29].
The Raman spectral analysis of Samples S9 and S10 shows that the ID/IG ratio of Sample S9 is much lower than that of Sample S10, which indicates that the coke formed on the support is more graphitized. The very weak intensity of the band at 3200 cm1 in the Raman spectrum of coked Pt/MgO catalyst also confirms that the coke on the metal is less dehydrogenated.
Based on this analysis, the catalyst samples containing more coke on the support should have lower ID/IG ratios. Hence the ID/IG ratios of Samples S6, S7, S8, S9, and S10 should have been in the decreasing order of S10 > S7 > S8 > S6 > S9. However, the ID/IG ratio of Sample S8 is the lowest, and the coke is hard to burn, as indicated by the rightward shift of the position of peak II of Sample S8. This is because the high propane concentration greatly increases the concentration of coke precursor on the support, which leads to an increased degree of polymerization and aromatization of the coke.
Increasing the propylene concentration will increase the degree of polymerization of the polymers [33], which will be further dehydrogenated to aromatics. The degree of the aromatization of the coke is enhanced as a result of the increased propylene concentration and weakened as a result of the increased hydrogen concentration, as hydrogen will reduce the molecular weight of the polymer during propylene polymerization [34]. This fact also explains the shift of Peak II in Figs. 1 and 2.
In general, the H/C ratios of the cokes are very high (Table 1), especially on the metal surfaces, indicating that the coke contains mainly aliphatic hydrocarbons. The high H/C ratios on metal surfaces are consistent with the relatively large peak of 2920 cm1 in IR spectra and the relatively large peak of 27003000 cm1 in Raman spectra.
4.3 Dependence of Coking Rate on Gas Concentration
The rate of coke formation on the metal is found dependent on the propane pressure (Fig. 9). The apparent reaction order is about 1.7 with respect to propane and zero reaction order with respect to hydrogen and propylene. Figures 7 and 9 also show that the rate of coke formation on the support increases with the propylene or propane pressures, while Fig. 8 shows that it decreases with the hydrogen pressure. The apparent reaction orders of coking on the support are about first order with respect to propylene (Fig. 7), 0.7 order with respect to hydrogen (Fig. 8) and 1.4 order with respect to propane (Fig. 9). It suggests that coke can be formed both from propane and propylene, but with different reaction mechanisms. An apparent reaction order of 1.4 with respect to propane can not explain that propylene is the main precursor for coke formation, since the reaction order to propane is about one for propylene formation, and the reaction order to propylene is about one for coke formation.
4.4 Coke Formation Mechanism
4.4.1 Coke Formation on the Metal
Many reaction mechanisms have been tested, and only the following mechanism of coke formation on the metal can describe the experimental observation:
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} ( {\text{g)}} + 2* \Rightarrow {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7}* + {\text{H}}* $$ (1)
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7} * + * \Rightarrow {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} * + {\text{H}}* $$ (2)
$$ {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} * \Rightarrow {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} ( {\text{g)}} + * $$ (3)
$$ 2 {\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} * \Rightarrow {\text{C}}_{ 6} {\text{H}}_{ 1 2} * + * $$ (4)
$$ {\text{H}}* + {\text{H}}* \Leftrightarrow {\text{H}}_{ 2} + 2* $$ (5)
The apparent reaction order of propane of about 1.7 indicates that two C3 intermediates are involved in the carbon formation. Furthermore, the H/C ratios of the coked PtSn catalysts of 1.72.0 indicate a high hydrogen content of the coke. Therefore, the formation of C6H12* from two C3H6* intermediates is proposed as the kinetic relevant step for coke formation (Step 4).
It is assumed that the dehydrogenation steps (Steps 1 and 2) are both irreversible and far from equilibrium [3537], and the desorption of propylene (Step 3) is also considered irreversible. Step 4 is assumed to be the kinetic relevant step and the rate of Step 4 is considered to be much slower than those of Steps 2 and 3.
By assuming the steady-state of the intermediates, C3H7* and C3H6*, we obtain,
$$ \frac{{d\theta_{C3H7} }}{dt} = k_{1} P_{C3H8} \theta_{*}{2} - k_{2} \theta_{C3H7} \theta_{*} = 0 $$ (6)
$$ \frac{{{\text{d}}\theta_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} }} }}{{{\text{d}}t}} = k_{ 2} \theta_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7} }} \theta_{ *} - k_{ 3} \theta_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} }} = 0 $$ (7)
Then the site coverages of C3H7* and C3H6* are determined by,
$$ \theta_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 7} }} = \frac{{k_{ 1} P_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} }} \theta_{*}{{}} }}{{k_{ 2} }} $$ (8)
$$ \theta_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} }} = \frac{{k_{ 1} P_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} }} \theta_{ *}{ 2} }}{{k_{ 3} }} $$ (9)
The coke formation rate on the metal is given by Eq. (10) by assuming C3H7* as the most abundant surface specie:
$$ r_{\text{c}} = k_{ 4} \theta_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 6} }}{ 2} = \frac{{k_{\text{c}} P_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} }}{ 2} }}{{( 1+ K_{\text{I}} P_{{{\text{C}}_{ 3} {\text{H}}_{ 8} }} ){ 4} }} $$ (10)
where,
$$ k_{\text{c}} { = }k_{ 4} \left( {\frac{{k_{ 1} }}{{k_{ 3} }}} \right){ 2} $$ (11)
$$ K_{\text{I}} = \frac{{k_{ 1} }}{{k_{ 2} }} $$ (12)
Increasing propane concentration in the gas phase concurrently increases the concentration of adsorbed propylene (C3H6*) and hence the amount of coke on the metal. A relatively low value of K I in Eq. (10) can lead to the apparent order of 1.7 with respect to propane. The irreversible desorption of propylene subsequently leads to the zero order to propylene. The irreversible reaction of steps in propane dehydrogenation and relatively weak adsorption of hydrogen comparing to the C3 surface intermediate result in the weak effect of hydrogen. By fitting the rates of coking on the metal at different gas compositions, k c and K I are estimated to be 4.15 × 105 mg coke/(mg cat.s) and 7.18 × 101, respectively. Moreover, one can see that the model fits the experimental data quite well (Fig. 10), which implies the proposed kinetic model for coking on the metal is reasonable.

It is noted here that although the hydrogen pressure has little effect on the rate of coking on the metal, it changes significantly the hydrogen content in the coke. At higher hydrogen partial pressure, the coke is less dense and compact. In addition, the coke formed on the metal can be further softened through hydrogenation [38].
4.4.2 Coke Formation on the Support
Coke formation on the support mainly involves polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, hydride transfer, etc. Referring to the mechanism proposed by Caeiro et al. [39], coke formation on the support can be divided into two stages, i.e., the conversion of propane to olefins (propylene and ethylene) by protolysis and transformation of these olefins to aromatic hydrocarbons. The second stage involved a number of reactions, such as oligomerizationcracking reactions (producing C4C10 olefins), hydrogen transfer (producing dienes), cyclization (generating cycloalkenes), and further hydrogen transfer (producing cyclic diolefins and finally aromatics). Based on this mechanism, increasing the propylene partial pressures will certainly increase the amount of coke on the support.
The coke precursor formed on the metal may migrate to the support [32] and then undergoes subsequent polymerization/oligomerization, condensation and so on. Thus, increasing the partial pressure of propane would increase the rate of coke formation on the support. Sn in the Pt catalyst will weaken the binding of hydrocarbon to the metal [30, 40], and promote the migration of the coke precursor from the metal to the support. The presence of hydrogen will weaken the acidity of the support by converting Brnsted acid sites to Lewis acid sites and thus reduce the coke formation rate. Based on the above discussions, a coke formation mechanism is proposed as in Fig. 11. Propane is firstly dissociated on the metal and the coke precursor is formed through dehydrogenation; then the soft coke is generated on the metal from the coke precursor. The coke precursor generated on the metal will also migrate to the acid sites. On these acid sites, the coke precursor and the adsorbed propylene undergo polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization and hydride transfer, etc., resulting in the formation of hard coke.

5 Conclusion
Two types of coke are identified on coked PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and assigned to coke on the metal and the support, respectively. Coke formed on the metal has aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristic, containing more hydrogen than that formed on the support. Coke formed on the support has an aromatic characteristic. The rate of coke formation on the metal is weakly dependent on the propylene and hydrogen pressures but increases concurrently with the propane pressure while the rate of coke formation on the support increases concurrently with the propane and propylene pressures and decreases with the hydrogen pressure. A mechanism for coke formation has been proposed based on the kinetic analysis. The reaction between the two strong adsorbed C3H6*, which was formed by dehydrogenation of propane, was identified as the kinetic relevant step for the coke formation on the Pt surfaces. A portion of the precursor migrates to the acid site and is involved in the coke formation on the support. In addition, the propylene in the gas phase can also adsorb on the support and form coke through reactions such as polymerization/oligomerization, condensation and so on.
