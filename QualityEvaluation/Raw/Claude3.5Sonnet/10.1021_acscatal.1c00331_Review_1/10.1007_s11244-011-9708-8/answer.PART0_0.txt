[1] "Two peaks, locating in the interval of 150280 C (Peak I) and in the interval of 380430 C (Peak II), respectively, are present in each profile."

[2] "For coked alumina (Sample S9) and Pt/MgO catalyst (Sample S10), only one peak, at around 470 and 310 C, respectively, is present in the TPO profiles"

[3] "The H/C ratio of S4 is much lower than those of other coked PtSn samples, which is because of the very low hydrogen concentration in the feed flow. The coked alumina (S9) has the lowest while the coked Pt/MgO (S10) has the highest H/C ratio"

[4] "Generally, the bands at 13501470 cm1 reflect the bending vibrations of CH in CH2 and CH3 groups [9], while the stronger absorption at 28502960 cm1 reflects the stretching vibrations of CH in CH, CH2 and CH3 groups [912]."

[5] "Five peaks are identified at 1336, 1602, 2700, 2920, and 3200 cm1, respectively. The bands at 1336 and 1602 cm1 are generally considered as the D band and G band [18, 19] and attributed to the ring stretching in polyaromatic compounds"

[6] "TG is a very useful method to identify and quantify the coke on the catalysts [2628]. The peaks in the TPO profiles can be attributed to the loss of carbonaceous deposits with different compositions and structures and/or the carbonaceous deposits located at different sites on the catalyst."

The composition of coke deposits in catalytic systems, particularly in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, varies significantly across different reaction conditions and catalyst types. The study reveals that:

1. On PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, two types of coke are identified, corresponding to coke on the metal and coke on the support.

2. The coke formed on the metal generally has a higher H/C ratio, indicating more aliphatic hydrocarbon characteristics, while the coke on the support tends to be more aromatic.

3. Reaction conditions, such as the partial pressures of propane, propylene, and hydrogen, influence the composition and amount of coke formed. Higher propylene concentrations lead to increased polymerization and aromatization, while higher hydrogen concentrations reduce the molecular weight of coke polymers.

4. Different catalysts show varying coke compositions. For instance, coke on Pt/MgO has a higher H/C ratio compared to coke on alumina support.

To elucidate the complex nature and diversity of coke constituents, several analytical techniques were employed:

1. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) with Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO): Used to identify and quantify different types of coke based on their oxidation temperatures.

2. Elemental Analysis: Determined the H/C ratios of coke deposits.

3. FTIR Spectroscopy: Identified various functional groups in the coke, such as CH2, CH3, and aromatic structures.

4. Raman Spectroscopy: Analyzed the degree of graphitization and the presence of different carbon structures (D and G bands).

5. TG-DTA (Differential Thermal Analysis): Provided information on the heat of combustion for different types of coke.

These techniques collectively provided a comprehensive understanding of the coke composition, structure, and location on the catalyst surface, demonstrating the complex and diverse nature of coke deposits in PDH systems.

在催化系统中，特别是在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，焦炭沉积物的组成在不同的反应条件和催化剂类型下表现出显著的差异。研究表明：

1. 在PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上，可以识别出两种类型的焦炭，分别对应于金属上的焦炭和载体上的焦炭。

2. 金属上形成的焦炭通常具有较高的H/C比，表明其具有更多的脂肪族烃特性，而载体上的焦炭则倾向于更多芳香族特性。

3. 反应条件，如丙烷、丙烯和氢气的分压，影响焦炭的组成和形成量。较高的丙烯浓度导致聚合和芳构化增加，而较高的氢气浓度则降低焦炭聚合物的分子量。

4. 不同的催化剂表现出不同的焦炭组成。例如，Pt/MgO上的焦炭比氧化铝载体上的焦炭具有更高的H/C比。

为了阐明焦炭成分的复杂性和多样性，研究采用了几种分析技术：

1. 热重分析（TGA）结合程序升温氧化（TPO）：用于根据焦炭的氧化温度识别和量化不同类型的焦炭。

2. 元素分析：确定焦炭沉积物的H/C比。

3. FTIR光谱：识别焦炭中的各种官能团，如CH2、CH3和芳香结构。

4. 拉曼光谱：分析石墨化程度和不同碳结构（D带和G带）的存在。

5. TG-DTA（差热分析）：提供不同类型焦炭燃烧热的信息。

这些技术共同提供了对焦炭组成、结构和在催化剂表面位置的全面理解，展示了PDH系统中焦炭沉积物的复杂性和多样性。
