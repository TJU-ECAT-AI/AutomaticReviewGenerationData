[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1), with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath."

[3] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It undergoes disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) at low temperatures, allowing researchers to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of different catalysts.

2. Its disproportionation pathway is sensitive to the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, particularly whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni in Pt/Ni systems.

3. It can provide insights into how the preparation method (e.g., impregnation sequence) affects the formation and surface structure of bimetallic catalysts.

The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene (disproportionation, hydrogenation) can provide insights about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity by:

1. Revealing differences in catalytic behavior between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.

2. Showing how the surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts affect reaction rates and product distributions.

3. Demonstrating the impact of preparation methods on the catalytic properties of bimetallic systems.

These insights can be valuable for understanding and optimizing industrial hydrogenation processes, as they help elucidate the relationship between catalyst structure and performance in hydrogenation reactions.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它在低温下进行歧化（自氢化）反应，使研究者能够比较不同催化剂的独特低温氢化活性。

2. 其歧化反应途径对双金属催化剂的表面组成敏感，特别是在Pt/Ni系统中，对表面是由Pt还是Ni终止很敏感。

3. 它可以提供关于制备方法（如浸渍顺序）如何影响双金属催化剂的形成和表面结构的见解。

环己烯的多重反应途径（歧化、氢化）可以通过以下方式提供关于双金属催化剂对氢化活性和选择性影响的见解：

1. 揭示单金属和双金属催化剂之间的催化行为差异。

2. 显示双金属催化剂的表面组成和结构如何影响反应速率和产物分布。

3. 展示制备方法对双金属系统催化性能的影响。

这些见解对于理解和优化工业氢化过程很有价值，因为它们有助于阐明催化剂结构与氢化反应性能之间的关系。
