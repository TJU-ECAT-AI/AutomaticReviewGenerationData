[1] "The disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

[2] "For the disproportionation of cyclohexene, the gas-phase reaction products were monitored by recording gas-phase spectra every 30 s during the reaction."

[3] "The concentrations of the three main gas-phase species during the disproportionation reaction, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were estimated using the intensities of their vibrational modes"

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It is sensitive to the surface termination of bimetallic catalysts (Pt vs Ni), allowing researchers to determine how catalyst preparation methods affect surface composition.

2. Its disproportionation reaction produces multiple products (cyclohexane and benzene) that can be easily monitored using spectroscopic techniques.

3. The relative rates of cyclohexene consumption and product formation provide insights into the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation activities of the catalyst.

4. As a model compound, cyclohexene's behavior can offer insights into industrial hydrogenation processes involving similar cyclic or unsaturated hydrocarbons.

5. The disproportionation reaction allows for studying both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive view of catalyst performance.

By using cyclohexene as a probe molecule, researchers can gain valuable information about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity, which can be applied to optimize industrial processes involving similar reactions.
