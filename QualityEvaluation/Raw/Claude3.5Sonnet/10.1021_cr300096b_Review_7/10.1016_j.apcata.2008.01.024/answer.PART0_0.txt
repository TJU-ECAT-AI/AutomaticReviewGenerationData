[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1), with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath."

[3] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It undergoes disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) reactions, which can be used to compare the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of different catalysts.

2. The disproportionation pathway of cyclohexene is sensitive to the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, particularly whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni atoms.

3. It allows researchers to determine how the catalyst preparation method (such as impregnation sequence) affects the disproportionation activity on supported Pt/Ni catalysts.

The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide insights into:

1. The unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. The effect of subsurface composition on catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the different behaviors observed on PtNiPt(1 1 1) and PtNi(1 1 1) structures.

3. The influence of catalyst preparation methods on the formation of active sites and their subsequent impact on hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

These insights can be applied to understand and optimize industrial hydrogenation processes, particularly those involving bimetallic catalysts, by providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between catalyst structure and performance.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它可以进行歧化（自氢化）反应，这可用于比较不同催化剂的低温氢化活性。

2. 环己烯的歧化途径对双金属催化剂的表面组成敏感，特别是表面是由Pt原子还是Ni原子终止。

3. 它允许研究人员确定催化剂制备方法（如浸渍顺序）如何影响负载型Pt/Ni催化剂上的歧化活性。

环己烯的多重反应途径提供了以下见解：

1. Pt/Ni双金属表面相比单金属催化剂的独特低温氢化活性。

2. 亚表面组成对催化活性的影响，这从PtNiPt(1 1 1)和PtNi(1 1 1)结构上观察到的不同行为中得到了证明。

3. 催化剂制备方法对活性位点形成的影响，以及这些活性位点对氢化活性和选择性的后续影响。

这些见解可以应用于理解和优化工业氢化过程，特别是那些涉及双金属催化剂的过程，通过提供对催化剂结构和性能之间关系的深入理解。
