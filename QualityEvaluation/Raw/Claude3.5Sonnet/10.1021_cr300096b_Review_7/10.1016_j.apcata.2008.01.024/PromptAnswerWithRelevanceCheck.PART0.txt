[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1), with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath."

[3] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It undergoes disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) reactions, which can be used to compare the low-temperature hydrogenation activity of different catalysts.

2. The disproportionation pathway of cyclohexene is sensitive to the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, particularly whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni atoms.

3. It allows researchers to determine how the catalyst preparation method (such as impregnation sequence) affects the disproportionation activity on supported Pt/Ni catalysts.

The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide insights into:

1. The unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces compared to monometallic catalysts.

2. The effect of subsurface composition on catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the different behaviors observed on PtNiPt(1 1 1) and PtNi(1 1 1) structures.

3. The influence of catalyst preparation methods on the formation of active sites and their subsequent impact on hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

These insights can be applied to understand and optimize industrial hydrogenation processes, particularly those involving bimetallic catalysts, by providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between catalyst structure and performance.
