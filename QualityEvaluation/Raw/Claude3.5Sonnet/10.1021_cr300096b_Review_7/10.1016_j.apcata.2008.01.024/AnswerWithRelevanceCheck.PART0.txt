          [1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

          [2] "A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1), with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath."

          [3] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

          [4] "For the disproportionation of cyclohexene, the gas-phase reaction products were monitored by recording gas-phase spectra every 30 s during the reaction."

          [5] "The concentrations of the three main gas-phase species during the disproportionation reaction, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were estimated using the intensities of their vibrational modes"

          Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

          1. It undergoes disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) at low temperatures, allowing researchers to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of different catalysts, particularly Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts.

          2. Its disproportionation pathway is sensitive to the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, specifically whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni in Pt/Ni systems.

          3. It provides insights into how the preparation method (e.g., impregnation sequence) affects the catalytic activity of supported bimetallic catalysts.

          4. The reaction products (cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene) can be easily monitored using spectroscopic techniques, allowing for quantitative analysis of reaction kinetics and selectivity.

          5. As a model compound, cyclohexene's behavior can offer insights into industrial hydrogenation processes involving similar cyclic or unsaturated hydrocarbons.

          The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene can provide insights about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes by:

          1. Revealing differences in catalytic behavior between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.

          2. Demonstrating how the arrangement of metal atoms on the catalyst surface affects reaction pathways and rates.

          3. Allowing researchers to correlate the performance of model surfaces (e.g., single crystal studies) with supported catalysts used in industrial applications.

          4. Providing a means to study the effects of catalyst preparation methods on the resulting catalytic properties, which is crucial for optimizing industrial catalysts.

          5. Offering a comprehensive view of catalyst performance by simultaneously studying both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation pathways.

          These insights can be valuable for understanding and optimizing industrial hydrogenation processes, as they help elucidate the relationship between catalyst structure and performance in hydrogenation reactions.
