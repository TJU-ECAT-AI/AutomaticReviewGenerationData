[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1), with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath."

[3] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It undergoes disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) at low temperatures, allowing researchers to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of different catalysts.

2. Its disproportionation pathway is sensitive to the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, specifically whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni in Pt/Ni catalysts.

3. It provides insights into how the preparation method (e.g., impregnation sequence) affects the catalytic activity of supported bimetallic catalysts.

The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene can provide insights about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes by:

1. Revealing differences in catalytic behavior between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.

2. Demonstrating how the arrangement of metal atoms on the catalyst surface affects reaction pathways and rates.

3. Allowing researchers to correlate the performance of model surfaces (e.g., single crystal studies) with supported catalysts used in industrial applications.

4. Providing a means to study the effects of catalyst preparation methods on the resulting catalytic properties, which is crucial for optimizing industrial catalysts.
