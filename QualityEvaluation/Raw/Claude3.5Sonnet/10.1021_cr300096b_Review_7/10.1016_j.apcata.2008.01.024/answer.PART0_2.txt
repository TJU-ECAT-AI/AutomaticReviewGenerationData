[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

[2] "A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1), with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath."

[3] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It undergoes disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) at low temperatures, allowing researchers to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of different catalysts.

2. Its disproportionation pathway is sensitive to the surface composition of bimetallic catalysts, particularly whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni in Pt/Ni systems.

3. It provides insights into how the preparation method (e.g., impregnation sequence) affects the catalytic activity of supported bimetallic catalysts.

The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene (e.g., disproportionation, hydrogenation) can provide insights about the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes by:

1. Revealing differences in catalytic behavior between monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.

2. Demonstrating how the surface composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts affect reaction rates and selectivity.

3. Allowing researchers to correlate the performance of model catalyst surfaces (e.g., single crystals) with supported catalysts used in industrial applications.

4. Providing a basis for understanding how catalyst preparation methods influence the formation of active sites and, consequently, catalytic performance in hydrogenation reactions.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它在低温下进行歧化（自氢化）反应，使研究人员能够比较不同催化剂的独特低温氢化活性。

2. 其歧化反应途径对双金属催化剂的表面组成敏感，特别是在Pt/Ni系统中，对表面是由Pt还是Ni终止很敏感。

3. 它提供了关于制备方法（如浸渍顺序）如何影响负载型双金属催化剂催化活性的见解。

环己烯的多重反应途径（如歧化、氢化）可以提供关于双金属催化剂对工业过程中氢化活性和选择性影响的见解，具体表现在：

1. 揭示单金属和双金属催化剂之间催化行为的差异。

2. 展示双金属催化剂的表面组成和结构如何影响反应速率和选择性。

3. 允许研究人员将模型催化剂表面（如单晶）的性能与工业应用中使用的负载型催化剂的性能相关联。

4. 为理解催化剂制备方法如何影响活性位点的形成，进而影响氢化反应中的催化性能提供基础。
