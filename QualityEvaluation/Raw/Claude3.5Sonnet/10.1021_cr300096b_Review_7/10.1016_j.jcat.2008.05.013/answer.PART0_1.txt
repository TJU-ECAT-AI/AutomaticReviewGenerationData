[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

[3] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. These diverse reaction possibilities allow researchers to compare the general trends in chemical properties across various bimetallic surfaces.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways include:

1. Sensitivity to surface modifications: The dominant reaction pathway can change significantly when Pt(111) is modified with different metals, revealing how bimetallic catalysts influence reaction selectivity.

2. Novel reaction pathways: Some bimetallic surfaces, such as subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures, exhibit new low-temperature hydrogenation pathways not seen on monometallic surfaces.

3. Structure-activity relationships: By comparing the activity and selectivity of different bimetallic surfaces for cyclohexene reactions, researchers can gain insights into how the electronic and geometric properties of catalysts influence their performance.

4. Binding energy effects: The study reveals that an optimal cyclohexene binding energy is crucial for maximizing hydrogenation activity, demonstrating the importance of tuning surface properties in catalyst design.

These insights can be applied to industrial processes by guiding the design of more efficient and selective bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Understanding how different metal combinations affect reaction pathways can help in developing catalysts that promote desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions, ultimately leading to improved yields and reduced waste in industrial hydrogenation processes.
