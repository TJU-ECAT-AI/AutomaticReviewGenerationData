[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

[3] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. This versatility allows researchers to compare the general trends in chemical properties across various bimetallic surfaces.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways can reveal how modifying catalysts with different metals affects hydrogenation activity and selectivity. For example, while cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition on pure Pt(111), modifying the surface with other metals can dramatically change the dominant reaction pathways. Some modifications promote reversible adsorption, leading to molecular desorption as the main pathway, while others introduce novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathways.

These observations help researchers understand how bimetallic catalysts can be tailored to enhance specific reaction pathways or suppress unwanted side reactions in industrial processes. By studying the behavior of cyclohexene on different bimetallic surfaces, scientists can gain insights into the electronic and structural factors that influence catalytic performance, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.
