[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

[3] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. This versatility allows researchers to compare the general trends in chemical properties across various bimetallic surfaces.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways are valuable for understanding the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By observing how the dominant reaction pathways change when Pt(111) is modified with different metals, researchers can gain information about:

1. Catalyst selectivity: Different metal modifications can promote specific reaction pathways. For example, Sn modification promotes reversible adsorption and molecular desorption.

2. Novel reaction mechanisms: Some bimetallic surfaces, like Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111), exhibit new low-temperature hydrogenation pathways not seen in monometallic surfaces.

3. Electronic and structural effects: The changes in reaction pathways can be linked to the electronic and structural modifications induced by the secondary metal, providing insights into the fundamental principles governing catalyst behavior.

4. Optimization strategies: By understanding how different metal combinations affect reaction pathways, researchers can develop strategies for optimizing catalyst composition to enhance desired reactions and suppress unwanted side reactions in industrial processes.

These insights can guide the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes, potentially leading to improved yields, reduced energy consumption, and more sustainable chemical production methods.

环己烯之所以成为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能够经历多种竞争性反应途径，包括分解、脱氢、自氢化和氢化。这种多样性使研究人员能够比较各种双金属表面的化学性质的总体趋势。

环己烯的多重反应途径提供的见解对于理解双金属催化剂在工业过程中对氢化活性和选择性的影响非常有价值。通过观察当Pt(111)被不同金属修饰时主导反应途径的变化，研究人员可以获得以下信息：

1. 催化剂选择性：不同的金属修饰可以促进特定的反应途径。例如，Sn修饰促进可逆吸附和分子脱附。

2. 新型反应机制：一些双金属表面，如Pt-Ni-Pt(111)和Pt-Co-Pt(111)，表现出单金属表面不具备的新型低温氢化途径。

3. 电子和结构效应：反应途径的变化可以与次级金属引起的电子和结构修饰联系起来，提供了关于控制催化剂行为的基本原理的见解。

4. 优化策略：通过了解不同金属组合如何影响反应途径，研究人员可以制定策略来优化催化剂组成，以增强所需反应并抑制工业过程中不需要的副反应。

这些见解可以指导设计更高效、更具选择性的工业氢化过程催化剂，可能导致提高产率、减少能源消耗和更可持续的化学生产方法。
