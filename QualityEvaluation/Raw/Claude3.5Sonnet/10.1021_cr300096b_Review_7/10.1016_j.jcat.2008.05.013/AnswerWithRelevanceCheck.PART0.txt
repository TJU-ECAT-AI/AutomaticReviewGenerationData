          "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

"On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

"Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

          Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. This versatility allows researchers to compare the general trends in chemical properties across various bimetallic surfaces.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways are valuable for understanding the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. These insights include:

1. Sensitivity to surface modifications: The dominant reaction pathway can change significantly when Pt(111) is modified with different metals, revealing how bimetallic catalysts influence reaction selectivity.

2. Novel reaction pathways: Some bimetallic surfaces, such as subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures, exhibit new low-temperature hydrogenation pathways not seen on monometallic surfaces.

3. Catalyst selectivity: Different metal modifications can promote specific reaction pathways. For example, Sn modification promotes reversible adsorption and molecular desorption.

4. Structure-activity relationships: By comparing the activity and selectivity of different bimetallic surfaces for cyclohexene reactions, researchers can gain insights into how the electronic and geometric properties of catalysts influence their performance.

5. Optimization strategies: By understanding how different metal combinations affect reaction pathways, researchers can develop strategies for optimizing catalyst composition to enhance desired reactions and suppress unwanted side reactions in industrial processes.

These insights can be applied to industrial processes by guiding the design of more efficient and selective bimetallic catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Understanding how different metal combinations affect reaction pathways can help in developing catalysts that promote desired products while minimizing unwanted side reactions, ultimately leading to improved yields, reduced energy consumption, and more sustainable chemical production methods in industrial hydrogenation processes.

          环己烯之所以成为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能够经历多种竞争性反应途径，包括分解、脱氢、自身加氢（歧化）和在共吸附原子氢存在下的加氢。这种多样性使研究人员能够比较各种双金属表面的化学性质的一般趋势。

环己烯的多重反应途径提供的见解对于理解双金属催化剂在工业过程中对加氢活性和选择性的影响非常有价值。这些见解包括：

1. 对表面修饰的敏感性：当Pt(111)被不同的金属修饰时，主要反应途径会发生显著变化，揭示了双金属催化剂如何影响反应选择性。

2. 新型反应途径：一些双金属表面，如亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt(111)和Pt-Co-Pt(111)结构，表现出单金属表面上未见的新型低温氢化途径。

3. 催化剂选择性：不同的金属修饰可以促进特定的反应途径。例如，Sn修饰促进可逆吸附和分子脱附。

4. 结构-活性关系：通过比较不同双金属表面对环己烯反应的活性和选择性，研究人员可以深入了解催化剂的电子和几何性质如何影响其性能。

5. 优化策略：通过了解不同金属组合如何影响反应途径，研究人员可以制定策略来优化催化剂组成，以增强所需反应并抑制工业过程中不需要的副反应。

这些见解可以应用于工业过程，指导设计更高效和选择性的双金属氢化反应催化剂。了解不同金属组合如何影响反应途径可以帮助开发促进所需产物同时最小化不需要的副反应的催化剂，最终提高工业氢化过程的产率，减少能源消耗，实现更可持续的化学生产方法。
