[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly."

[3] "For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway. Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. This versatility allows researchers to compare the general trends in chemical properties across various bimetallic surfaces.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways are significant for understanding the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes. By observing how the dominant reaction pathways change when Pt(111) is modified with different metals, researchers can gain valuable information about the catalytic properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

For instance, the study reveals that modifying Pt(111) with Sn promotes reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the primary pathway. In contrast, subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway. These findings demonstrate how the addition of different metals can dramatically alter the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst surface.

By studying these varied reaction pathways, researchers can better understand how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This knowledge can be applied to optimize catalysts for specific industrial processes, potentially leading to more efficient and selective hydrogenation reactions in various applications, such as fuel production, fine chemical synthesis, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

环己烯之所以成为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能够经历多个竞争性反应途径，包括分解、脱氢、自身加氢和加氢。这种多样性使研究人员能够比较各种双金属表面的化学性质的一般趋势。

环己烯的多重反应途径提供的见解对于理解双金属催化剂对工业过程中加氢活性和选择性的影响具有重要意义。通过观察当Pt(111)被不同金属修饰时主要反应途径的变化，研究人员可以获得关于这些双金属表面催化性质的宝贵信息。

例如，研究表明，用Sn修饰Pt(111)促进了可逆吸附，使分子脱附成为主要途径。相比之下，亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt(111)和Pt-Co-Pt(111)结构表现出新的低温加氢途径。这些发现表明，添加不同的金属可以显著改变催化剂表面的反应性和选择性。

通过研究这些不同的反应途径，研究人员可以更好地理解双金属催化剂如何影响加氢活性和选择性。这些知识可以应用于优化特定工业过程的催化剂，有可能在各种应用中实现更高效和更具选择性的加氢反应，如燃料生产、精细化学品合成和制药制造。
