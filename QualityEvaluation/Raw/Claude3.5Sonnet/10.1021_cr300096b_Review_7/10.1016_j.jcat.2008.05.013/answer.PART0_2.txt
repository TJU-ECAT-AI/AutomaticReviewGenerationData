[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

[3] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. This versatility allows researchers to compare the general trends in chemical properties across various bimetallic surfaces.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways include:

1. Sensitivity to surface modifications: The dominant reaction pathway can change significantly when the surface is modified with different metals. For instance, while cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition on Pt(111), modifying the surface with other metals can alter the preferred reaction route.

2. Identification of novel reaction pathways: Studies have shown that certain bimetallic surfaces, such as subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures, exhibit a new low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on monometallic surfaces.

3. Evaluation of catalytic selectivity: By observing which reaction pathways are favored on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can gain insights into how these catalysts might influence selectivity in industrial processes.

4. Assessment of binding strengths: The preferred reaction pathway can provide information about the relative binding strengths of hydrogen and cyclohexene on different surfaces, which is crucial for understanding catalytic activity.

5. Temperature-dependent behavior: TPD experiments with cyclohexene can reveal how reaction pathways change with temperature on various surfaces, providing valuable information for optimizing industrial processes.

These insights can be directly applied to the design and optimization of bimetallic catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes, potentially leading to improved activity, selectivity, and efficiency in various applications such as fuel production, fine chemical synthesis, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

环己烯之所以成为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能够经历多种竞争性反应途径，包括分解、脱氢、自身加氢（歧化）和在共吸附原子氢存在下的加氢。这种多样性使研究人员能够比较各种双金属表面的化学性质的一般趋势。

环己烯的多重反应途径提供的见解包括：

1. 对表面修饰的敏感性：当表面用不同的金属修饰时，主导反应途径可能会发生显著变化。例如，虽然环己烯在Pt(111)上经历脱氢和分解，但用其他金属修饰表面可以改变首选的反应路径。

2. 新型反应途径的识别：研究表明，某些双金属表面，如亚表面Pt-Ni-Pt(111)和Pt-Co-Pt(111)结构，表现出单金属表面上不存在的新的低温加氢途径。

3. 催化选择性评估：通过观察不同双金属表面上倾向于哪些反应途径，研究人员可以获得这些催化剂如何影响工业过程中选择性的见解。

4. 结合强度评估：优先反应途径可以提供关于氢和环己烯在不同表面上相对结合强度的信息，这对理解催化活性至关重要。

5. 温度依赖行为：对环己烯进行的TPD实验可以揭示各种表面上反应途径如何随温度变化，为优化工业过程提供宝贵信息。

这些见解可以直接应用于工业加氢过程中双金属催化剂的设计和优化，可能导致各种应用中活性、选择性和效率的提高，如燃料生产、精细化学品合成和制药。
