[1] "Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

[3] "Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its ability to undergo multiple competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, self-hydrogenation, and hydrogenation. This versatility allows researchers to compare the general trends in chemical properties across various bimetallic surfaces.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's multiple reaction pathways can reveal how modifying catalysts with different metals affects hydrogenation activity and selectivity. For example, while cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition on pure Pt(111), modifying the surface with other metals can dramatically change the dominant reaction pathways. Some modifications promote reversible adsorption, leading to molecular desorption as the main pathway, while others introduce novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathways.

These observations help researchers understand how bimetallic catalysts can be tailored to enhance specific reaction pathways or suppress unwanted side reactions in industrial processes. By studying the behavior of cyclohexene on different bimetallic surfaces, scientists can gain insights into the electronic and structural factors that influence catalytic performance, potentially leading to the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.

环己烯之所以成为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，是因为它能够经历多种竞争性反应途径，包括分解、脱氢、自身加氢和加氢。这种多样性使研究人员能够比较各种双金属表面的化学性质的一般趋势。

环己烯的多重反应途径所提供的见解可以揭示用不同金属修饰催化剂如何影响加氢活性和选择性。例如，虽然环己烯在纯Pt(111)表面上会发生脱氢和分解，但用其他金属修饰表面可以显著改变主要反应途径。某些修饰会促进可逆吸附，导致分子脱附成为主要途径，而其他修饰则引入新的低温加氢途径。

这些观察有助于研究人员了解如何调整双金属催化剂以增强特定反应途径或抑制工业过程中不需要的副反应。通过研究环己烯在不同双金属表面上的行为，科学家可以深入了解影响催化性能的电子和结构因素，可能导致为工业加氢过程设计出更高效和选择性的催化剂。
