[1] "Cyclohexene (CHE) is an ideal probe molecule for investigating hydrogenation reactions on metal surfaces."

[2] "The hydrogenation of CHE on metal surfaces can proceed through multiple reaction pathways, providing information about both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the catalyst."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Cyclohexene (CHE) serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways on metal surfaces. This characteristic allows researchers to gather information about both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of catalysts. By examining how bimetallic catalysts influence these pathways, insights can be gained into their effects on hydrogenation processes in industrial applications. The multiple reaction routes of cyclohexene provide a comprehensive view of catalyst performance, allowing for a better understanding of how different metal combinations may enhance or alter hydrogenation reactions in various industrial settings.
