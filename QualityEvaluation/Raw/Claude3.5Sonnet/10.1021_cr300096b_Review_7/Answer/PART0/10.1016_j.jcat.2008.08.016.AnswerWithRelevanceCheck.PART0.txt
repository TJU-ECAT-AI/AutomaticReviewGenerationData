          [1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."

          Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It is a model compound for C=C bond hydrogenation, allowing researchers to test catalytic activity specifically for this type of reaction.

2. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and disproportionation (self-hydrogenation).

3. Its behavior on bimetallic catalysts can be compared to results from previous single crystal surface studies, bridging the gap between fundamental surface science and practical catalysts.

4. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide information about the nature of active sites on bimetallic catalysts. For example, the observation of benzene formation on PtNi and PtCo catalysts but not on Pt alone suggests that the bimetallic catalysts have unique properties that promote dehydrogenation.

5. Comparing cyclohexene hydrogenation rates to those of more challenging molecules like benzene can reveal how bimetallic catalysts affect the hydrogenation of different types of C=C bonds.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can help researchers understand how bimetallic catalysts influence both activity and selectivity in industrial hydrogenation processes by:

1. Revealing synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic catalysts.
2. Showing how the addition of a second metal can alter reaction pathways and product distributions.
3. Providing a basis for comparing different bimetallic combinations and their effects on hydrogenation performance.
4. Helping to optimize catalyst compositions for specific industrial applications based on desired product selectivity.
5. Offering a way to study the relationship between catalyst structure (e.g., metal dispersion, alloy formation) and catalytic performance.

The simplicity of cyclohexene compared to more complex industrial feedstocks makes it easier to analyze reaction products and mechanisms, while still providing valuable insights into catalyst behavior.

          环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它是C=C键氢化的模型化合物，允许研究人员专门测试这类反应的催化活性。

2. 它可以经历多种反应途径，包括氢化成环己烷、脱氢成苯和歧化（自氢化）。

3. 它在双金属催化剂上的行为可以与之前单晶表面研究的结果进行比较，架起了基础表面科学和实用催化剂之间的桥梁。

4. 环己烯的多重反应途径提供了有关双金属催化剂活性位点性质的信息。例如，在PtNi和PtCo催化剂上观察到苯的形成，但在单独的Pt上没有观察到，这表明双金属催化剂具有促进脱氢的独特性质。

5. 将环己烯的氢化速率与更具挑战性的分子（如苯）的氢化速率进行比较，可以揭示双金属催化剂如何影响不同类型C=C键的氢化。

这些从环己烯反应中获得的见解可以帮助研究人员理解双金属催化剂如何影响工业氢化过程中的活性和选择性，通过：

1. 揭示双金属催化剂中金属之间的协同效应。
2. 显示添加第二种金属如何改变反应途径和产物分布。
3. 为比较不同的双金属组合及其对氢化性能的影响提供基础。
4. 帮助根据所需的产品选择性优化特定工业应用的催化剂组成。
5. 提供一种研究催化剂结构（如金属分散度、合金形成）与催化性能之间关系的方法。

与更复杂的工业原料相比，环己烯的简单性使得更容易分析反应产物和机理，同时仍能提供关于催化剂行为的有价值见解。
