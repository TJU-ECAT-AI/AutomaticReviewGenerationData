[1] "Our group has previously used the disproportionation (self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene as a probe reaction to compare the unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."

          [2] "A low-temperature disproportionation pathway was detected on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure prepared on Pt(1 1 1) and on the PtNi(1 1 1) surface structure prepared on Ni(1 1 1), with both structures characterized by a Pt surface modified by Ni atoms underneath."

          [3] "Because the disproportionation of cyclohexene is sensitive to whether the surface is terminated by Pt or Ni, it is chosen as one of the probe reactions in the current study to determine how the disproportionation activity is affected on Pt/Ni supported catalysts by the impregnation sequence."

          [4] "For the disproportionation of cyclohexene, the gas-phase reaction products were monitored by recording gas-phase spectra every 30 s during the reaction."

          [5] "The concentrations of the three main gas-phase species during the disproportionation reaction, cyclohexene, cyclohexane, and benzene, were estimated using the intensities of their vibrational modes"

[1] "Cyclohexene (CHE) is an ideal probe molecule for investigating hydrogenation reactions on metal surfaces."

          [2] "The hydrogenation of CHE on metal surfaces can proceed through multiple reaction pathways, providing information about both the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of the catalyst."

[1] "Previously, it was determined that the hydrogenation of cyclohexene has been used as a probe reaction to compare the different properties of Pt(1 1 1), surface NiPtPt(1 1 1), and subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1)"

[2] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."

[3] "The most significant similarity between the single crystal and the polycrystalline surfaces is the observation of hydrogenation pathway on the subsurface PtNiPt structures."

[4] "This difference is most likely due to the presence of the (1 0 0) facets and defect sites on the polycrystalline foil, which promote the decomposition of the benzene intermediate instead of desorption from the surface."

[5] "The current work utilizes the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to bridge the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces."

[6] "This is consistent with the recent batch and flow reactor studies of hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on c-Al2O3, which show significantly higher hydrogenation activity than supported Ni and Pt monometallic catalysts [32]."

[1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."

[2] "Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity."

[1] "The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center."

[2] "Fig. 38 (a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher."

[3] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS, as shown in Fig. 39. The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment, the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly Ï€-bonded cyclohexene."

[4] "Fig. 41 shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison. The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

[5] "The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPt(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces."

[6] "We would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e. when the adsorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in Fig. 42 by Humbert et al."

"Cyclohexene can undergo decomposition, dehydrogenation, and self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions, as well as hydrogenation in the presence of co-adsorbed atomic hydrogen. Due to the competitive nature of these reaction pathways, it is an ideal probe molecule for comparing the general trends in the chemical properties of the various bimetallic surfaces."

"On Pt(111), cyclohexene undergoes dehydrogenation and decomposition; however, when Pt(111) is modified with another metal, the dominant reaction pathways can vary markedly. For example, modification with Sn can promote reversible adsorption, making molecular desorption the dominant pathway."

"Previous studies on 3d-modified Pt(111) have shown that the subsurface Pt-Ni-Pt(111) and Pt-Co-Pt(111) structures exhibit a novel low-temperature hydrogenation pathway"

[1] "Because of the different reaction pathways, cyclohexene is an important probe molecule used to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons"

[2] "The three main reaction pathways of cyclohexene are dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and decomposition."

[3] "Cyclohexene decomposes to C(a) and H2 and dehydrogenates to benzene on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced."

[4] "Overall, the TPD and HREELS experiments demonstrate a distinct difference between the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces and the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface for the reaction pathways of cyclohexene."

[5] "On Ni(1 1 1), only the dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways are present."

[6] "The Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces exhibit different reactivities from that of clean Ni(1 1 1). At 0.5 ML Pt coverage, a small amount of cyclohexane is produced."

[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."
