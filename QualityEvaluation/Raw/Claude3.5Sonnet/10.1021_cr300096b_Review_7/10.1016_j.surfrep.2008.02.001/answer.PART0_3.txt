[1] "Fig. 38 (a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher."

[2] "Based on detailed vibrational assignment, the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π-bonded cyclohexene. In contrast, the surface species is assigned as strongly di-σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111)."

[3] "The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111). Interestingly, the PtNiPt(111) surface is also more active toward the production of gas-phase benzene from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene (78 amu)."

[4] "The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPt(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions on bimetallic catalysts for several reasons:

1. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including self-hydrogenation, hydrogenation with pre-adsorbed hydrogen, and dehydrogenation. This allows researchers to study the selectivity of different bimetallic surfaces towards these competing reactions.

2. Its adsorption mode (π-bonded vs di-σ bonded) is sensitive to the electronic properties of the surface, providing insights into how the d-band center shifts affect molecule-surface interactions.

3. The reactivity of cyclohexene varies significantly across different bimetallic surfaces. For example, self-hydrogenation occurs on PtNiPt(111) but not on Pt(111) or Ni(111), highlighting the unique properties of bimetallic surfaces.

4. It demonstrates a volcano-type relationship in hydrogenation activity across different bimetallic surfaces (e.g., PtNiPt(111) > PtCoPt(111) > PtFePt(111)), which can be correlated with the d-band center shifts.

These multiple reaction pathways and sensitivity to surface properties make cyclohexene an excellent probe for understanding how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This knowledge can be applied to optimize catalyst design for industrial hydrogenation processes, potentially leading to improved activity, selectivity, and efficiency in various applications such as fuel production and fine chemical synthesis.

环己烯作为研究双金属催化剂上加氢反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它可以经历多种反应途径，包括自加氢、预吸附氢的加氢以及脱氢。这使研究人员能够研究不同双金属表面对这些竞争反应的选择性。

2. 其吸附模式（π键合vs双σ键合）对表面的电子性质敏感，提供了关于d带中心位移如何影响分子-表面相互作用的见解。

3. 环己烯的反应活性在不同的双金属表面上有显著差异。例如，自加氢反应在PtNiPt(111)上发生，但在Pt(111)或Ni(111)上不发生，突显了双金属表面的独特性质。

4. 它在不同双金属表面上展示了火山型加氢活性关系（如PtNiPt(111) > PtCoPt(111) > PtFePt(111)），这可以与d带中心位移相关联。

这些多重反应途径和对表面性质的敏感性使环己烯成为理解双金属催化剂如何影响加氢活性和选择性的优秀探针。这些知识可以应用于优化工业加氢过程的催化剂设计，可能导致各种应用（如燃料生产和精细化学品合成）中活性、选择性和效率的提高。
