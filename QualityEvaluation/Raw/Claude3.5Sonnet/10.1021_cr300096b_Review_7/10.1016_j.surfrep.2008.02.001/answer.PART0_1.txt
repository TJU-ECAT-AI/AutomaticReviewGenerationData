[1] "The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center."

[2] "Fig. 38 (a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher."

[3] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS, as shown in Fig. 39. The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

[4] "Fig. 41 shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison. The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions on bimetallic catalysts for several reasons:

1. Multiple reaction pathways: Cyclohexene can undergo self-hydrogenation, hydrogenation with preadsorbed hydrogen, and dehydrogenation. This allows researchers to study different aspects of catalytic activity on bimetallic surfaces.

2. Sensitivity to surface structure: The behavior of cyclohexene is highly dependent on the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. For example, it shows distinctly different vibrational spectra and reactivity on PtNiPt(111) compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111).

3. Correlation with d-band center: The reactivity of cyclohexene can be directly correlated with the d-band center of bimetallic surfaces, providing insights into the electronic factors governing catalytic activity.

4. Quantifiable product yields: The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation products of cyclohexene (cyclohexane and benzene) can be easily quantified using techniques like TPD, allowing for precise comparisons of catalytic activity across different surfaces.

5. Industrial relevance: Understanding cyclohexene hydrogenation on bimetallic surfaces can provide insights applicable to industrial hydrogenation processes involving similar cyclic or unsaturated compounds.

By studying the various reaction pathways of cyclohexene on different bimetallic surfaces, researchers can gain valuable insights into how the electronic structure of catalysts influences hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This knowledge can then be applied to the rational design of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.

环己烯作为研究双金属催化剂上氢化反应的理想探针分子有以下几个原因：

1. 多重反应途径：环己烯可以进行自氢化、预吸附氢气的氢化以及脱氢反应。这使研究人员能够研究双金属表面上催化活性的不同方面。

2. 对表面结构敏感：环己烯的行为高度依赖于催化剂表面的电子结构。例如，它在PtNiPt(111)上显示出与Pt(111)或Ni(111)明显不同的振动谱和反应活性。

3. 与d带中心的相关性：环己烯的反应活性可以直接与双金属表面的d带中心相关联，提供了控制催化活性的电子因素的见解。

4. 可量化的产品产率：环己烯的氢化和脱氢产物（环己烷和苯）可以使用TPD等技术轻松量化，从而可以精确比较不同表面的催化活性。

5. 工业相关性：了解双金属表面上的环己烯氢化可以为涉及类似环状或不饱和化合物的工业氢化过程提供适用的见解。

通过研究环己烯在不同双金属表面上的各种反应途径，研究人员可以深入了解催化剂的电子结构如何影响氢化活性和选择性。这些知识随后可以应用于工业氢化过程中更高效、更具选择性的催化剂的理性设计。
