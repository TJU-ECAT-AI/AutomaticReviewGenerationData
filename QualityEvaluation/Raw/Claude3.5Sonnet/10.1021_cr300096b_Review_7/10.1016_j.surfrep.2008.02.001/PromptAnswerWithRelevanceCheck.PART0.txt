[1] "The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center."

[2] "Fig. 38 (a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher."

[3] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS, as shown in Fig. 39. The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment, the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π-bonded cyclohexene."

[4] "The DFT calculations also reveal that other subsurface MBS structures, such as PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111), also bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding surface monolayer structures."

[5] "Fig. 41 shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison. The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

[6] "We would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e. when the adsorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in Fig. 42 by Humbert et al."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions on bimetallic catalysts for several reasons:

1. Multiple reaction pathways: Cyclohexene can undergo self-hydrogenation, hydrogenation with pre-adsorbed hydrogen, and dehydrogenation. This allows researchers to study different aspects of catalytic activity on bimetallic surfaces.

2. Sensitivity to surface structure: The adsorption and reaction of cyclohexene are highly sensitive to the electronic and geometric properties of bimetallic surfaces. For example, it exhibits different bonding configurations (π-bonded vs. di-σ bonded) on different surfaces.

3. Correlation with d-band center: The binding energy and reactivity of cyclohexene show a clear correlation with the surface d-band center of bimetallic catalysts, allowing researchers to establish structure-property relationships.

4. Demonstration of unique bimetallic properties: Cyclohexene reactions reveal novel catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces that are distinct from their parent metals. For instance, the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure shows unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity not observed on pure Pt or Ni surfaces.

5. Volcano relationship: Cyclohexene hydrogenation demonstrates a volcano-type relationship between catalytic activity and surface electronic properties, providing insights into optimizing catalyst design.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can be applied to understand and predict the behavior of more complex industrial hydrogenation processes on bimetallic catalysts. The knowledge gained can guide the rational design of catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for specific hydrogenation reactions in industrial applications.
