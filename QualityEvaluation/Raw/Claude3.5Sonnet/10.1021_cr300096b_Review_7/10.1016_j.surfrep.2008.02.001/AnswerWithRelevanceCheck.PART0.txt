          [1] "The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center."

[2] "Fig. 38 (a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher."

[3] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS, as shown in Fig. 39. The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment, the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π-bonded cyclohexene."

[4] "Fig. 41 shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison. The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

[5] "The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPt(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces."

[6] "We would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e. when the adsorption of cyclohexene is too weak for the hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in Fig. 42 by Humbert et al."

          Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions on bimetallic catalysts for several reasons:

1. Multiple reaction pathways: Cyclohexene can undergo self-hydrogenation, hydrogenation with pre-adsorbed hydrogen, and dehydrogenation. This allows researchers to study different aspects of catalytic activity on bimetallic surfaces.

2. Sensitivity to surface structure: The adsorption and reaction of cyclohexene are highly sensitive to the electronic and geometric properties of bimetallic surfaces. For example, it exhibits different bonding configurations (π-bonded vs. di-σ bonded) on different surfaces.

3. Correlation with d-band center: The binding energy and reactivity of cyclohexene show a clear correlation with the surface d-band center of bimetallic catalysts, allowing researchers to establish structure-property relationships.

4. Demonstration of unique bimetallic properties: Cyclohexene reactions reveal novel catalytic properties of bimetallic surfaces that are distinct from their parent metals. For instance, the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure shows unique low-temperature hydrogenation activity not observed on pure Pt or Ni surfaces.

5. Volcano relationship: Cyclohexene hydrogenation demonstrates a volcano-type relationship between catalytic activity and surface electronic properties, providing insights into optimizing catalyst design.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can be applied to understand and predict the behavior of more complex industrial hydrogenation processes on bimetallic catalysts. The knowledge gained can guide the rational design of catalysts with improved activity and selectivity for specific hydrogenation reactions in industrial applications.

          环己烯作为研究双金属催化剂上氢化反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 多重反应途径：环己烯可以进行自氢化、预吸附氢的氢化以及脱氢反应。这使研究人员能够研究双金属表面上催化活性的不同方面。

2. 对表面结构敏感：环己烯的吸附和反应对双金属表面的电子和几何特性高度敏感。例如，它在不同表面上表现出不同的键合构型（π键合vs.双σ键合）。

3. 与d带中心的相关性：环己烯的结合能和反应活性与双金属催化剂的表面d带中心显示出明显的相关性，使研究人员能够建立结构-性能关系。

4. 展示独特的双金属特性：环己烯反应揭示了双金属表面独特的催化性质，这些性质与其母体金属不同。例如，PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构显示出纯Pt或Ni表面上未观察到的独特低温氢化活性。

5. 火山关系：环己烯氢化反应展示了催化活性与表面电子特性之间的火山型关系，为优化催化剂设计提供了见解。

这些从环己烯反应中获得的见解可以用于理解和预测更复杂的工业氢化过程在双金属催化剂上的行为。获得的知识可以指导针对工业应用中特定氢化反应的催化剂的理性设计，以提高活性和选择性。
