[1] "The adsorption and reaction of cyclohexene have been studied on several other bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "Fig. 38 (a) shows the production of cyclohexane from the self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene. It is clear from the TPD results that the self-hydrogenation occurs on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure, but not on either Pt(111) or the Ni(111) film with thickness of 3 monolayer or higher."

[3] "Fig. 41 shows the hydrogenation of cyclohexene with preadsorbed on these two surfaces, with the results from Pt(111) and a Ni(111) film also being included for comparison. The hydrogenation yield, based on peak areas of cyclohexane (84 amu), is much higher on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPt(111)."

[4] "The results in Fig. 43 further confirm the correlation of the self-hydrogenation activity with the value of the surface d-band center of MBS structures."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions on bimetallic catalysts for several reasons:

1. Multiple reaction pathways: Cyclohexene can undergo self-hydrogenation to produce cyclohexane, as well as hydrogenation with pre-adsorbed hydrogen. This allows researchers to study different hydrogenation mechanisms on the same surface.

2. Sensitivity to surface structure: The reactivity of cyclohexene varies significantly between different bimetallic surfaces. For example, self-hydrogenation occurs on PtNiPt(111) subsurface structures but not on Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces.

3. Correlation with electronic properties: The hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene correlates well with the surface d-band center of bimetallic structures, providing insights into the relationship between electronic properties and catalytic activity.

4. Comparison of surface vs subsurface structures: Cyclohexene reactions can distinguish between surface and subsurface bimetallic structures, as seen in the different hydrogenation yields on PtNiPt(111) vs NiPt(111).

5. Industrial relevance: As a cyclic molecule with a C=C bond, cyclohexene's behavior can provide insights applicable to industrial hydrogenation processes involving similar compounds.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions help researchers understand how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This knowledge can guide the design of improved catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes, potentially leading to more efficient and selective reactions in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other industrially important compounds.

环己烯作为研究双金属催化剂上加氢反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 多重反应途径：环己烯可以进行自身加氢生成环己烷，也可以与预吸附的氢进行加氢。这使研究人员能够在同一表面上研究不同的加氢机理。

2. 对表面结构敏感：环己烯的反应活性在不同的双金属表面上有显著差异。例如，自身加氢反应在PtNiPt(111)亚表面结构上发生，但在Pt(111)或Ni(111)表面上不发生。

3. 与电子性质的相关性：环己烯的加氢活性与双金属结构的表面d带中心位置有很好的相关性，为了解电子性质与催化活性之间的关系提供了见解。

4. 表面与亚表面结构的比较：环己烯反应可以区分表面和亚表面双金属结构，如在PtNiPt(111)和NiPt(111)上观察到的不同加氢产率。

5. 工业相关性：作为一种含有C=C键的环状分子，环己烯的行为可以为涉及类似化合物的工业加氢过程提供有价值的见解。

这些从环己烯反应中获得的见解帮助研究人员理解双金属催化剂如何影响加氢活性和选择性。这些知识可以指导改进的催化剂设计，用于工业加氢过程，potentially leading to更高效和选择性的反应，用于精细化学品、药物和其他工业重要化合物的生产。
