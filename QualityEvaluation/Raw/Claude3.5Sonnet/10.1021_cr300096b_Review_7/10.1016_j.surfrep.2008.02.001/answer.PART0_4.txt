[1] "The self-hydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been used as a probe reaction on several Ni monolayers, NiPt(111), NiW(110), NiRu(0001) to correlate the chemical activities with respect to the surface d-band center."

[2] "Unlike linear and cyclic alkenes, the hydrogenation of benzene does not occur under UHV conditions [141]. This was not unexpected, however, due to the nature of benzene being an aromatic molecule and therefore thermodynamically more stable as compared to the alkenes."

[3] "The unique activity of the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer toward cyclohexene is further confirmed using HREELS [143], as shown in Fig. 39. The vibrational spectrum of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) is substantially different from that on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). Based on detailed vibrational assignment [143], the species on the PtNiPt(111) subsurface is weakly π-bonded cyclohexene. In contrast, the surface species is assigned as strongly di-σ bonded cyclohexene on Pt(111) and the benzene intermediate on Ni(111)."

[4] "The hydrogenation yield is the highest on PtNiPt(111), but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions on bimetallic catalysts for several reasons:

1. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including self-hydrogenation, hydrogenation with pre-adsorbed hydrogen, and dehydrogenation. This allows researchers to study the selectivity of different bimetallic surfaces towards these competing reactions.

2. Its reactivity is sensitive to the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, particularly the d-band center position. This makes it useful for correlating catalytic activity with electronic structure across different bimetallic compositions.

3. The bonding configuration of cyclohexene (π-bonded vs di-σ bonded) can be readily distinguished using spectroscopic techniques like HREELS, providing insight into how bimetallic surfaces modify adsorbate-surface interactions.

4. It exhibits a clear "volcano" relationship between hydrogenation activity and surface electronic properties across a series of bimetallic catalysts. This demonstrates how optimal catalytic performance requires balancing adsorption strengths.

5. Comparison with benzene, which does not undergo hydrogenation under UHV conditions, highlights how cyclohexene's reactivity makes it more suitable as a probe molecule.

These multiple reaction pathways and sensitivity to surface properties allow cyclohexene to provide detailed insights into how bimetallic catalysts can be tuned to optimize activity and selectivity for industrial hydrogenation processes. The trends observed with cyclohexene can inform catalyst design for more complex substrates and reaction conditions.

环己烯之所以成为研究双金属催化剂上加氢反应的理想探针分子，有以下几个原因：

1. 它可以经历多种反应途径，包括自氢化、预吸附氢的加氢以及脱氢。这使研究人员能够研究不同双金属表面对这些竞争反应的选择性。

2. 其反应活性对催化剂表面的电子性质，特别是d带中心位置很敏感。这使其成为在不同双金属组成中将催化活性与电子结构相关联的有用工具。

3. 环己烯的键合构型（π键合vs二σ键合）可以通过HREELS等光谱技术很容易地区分，提供了双金属表面如何改变吸附质-表面相互作用的洞察。

4. 它在一系列双金属催化剂中展现出加氢活性与表面电子性质之间明确的"火山"关系。这表明最佳催化性能需要平衡吸附强度。

5. 与在超高真空条件下不发生加氢的苯相比，环己烯的反应活性更适合作为探针分子。

这些多重反应途径和对表面性质的敏感性使环己烯能够深入洞察双金属催化剂如何调整以优化工业加氢过程的活性和选择性。通过环己烯观察到的趋势可以为更复杂底物和反应条件下的催化剂设计提供信息。
