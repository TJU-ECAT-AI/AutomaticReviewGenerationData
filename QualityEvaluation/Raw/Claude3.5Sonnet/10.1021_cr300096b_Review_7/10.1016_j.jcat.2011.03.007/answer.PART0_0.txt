[1] "Previously, it was determined that hydrogen desorbs from Pt(1 1 1) as a relatively broad peak centered near 285 K [14]. Based on this observation, the hydrogen desorption peak at 302 K is attributed to desorption from the (1 1 1) facets of the Pt foil."

[2] "In previous studies, the reaction cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to compare the different properties of Pt(1 1 1), surface NiPtPt(1 1 1), and subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) [14]."

[3] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."

[4] "The most significant similarity between the single crystal and the polycrystalline surfaces is the observation of hydrogenation pathway on the subsurface PtNiPt structures."

[5] "This is consistent with the recent batch and flow reactor studies of hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on c-Al2O3, which show significantly higher hydrogenation activity than supported Ni and Pt monometallic catalysts [32]."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways, providing insights into the catalytic properties of different surfaces. On various catalysts, cyclohexene can either decompose, undergo hydrogenation to form cyclohexane, or dehydrogenate to form benzene. These different pathways are sensitive to the binding strength of cyclohexene and hydrogen on the catalyst surface.

For example, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and undergoes complete decomposition. In contrast, on PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces, both cyclohexene and hydrogen bind more weakly, leading to a hydrogenation pathway that produces cyclohexane. This difference in reactivity provides valuable information about how the electronic structure of the catalyst surface influences binding energies and reaction selectivity.

The use of cyclohexene as a probe molecule allows researchers to compare the performance of different catalysts, such as single crystal surfaces, polycrystalline materials, and supported catalysts. By observing the product distribution and reaction temperatures, researchers can gain insights into the relative binding strengths of reactants and the presence of different active sites on the catalyst surface.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can be extended to understand and predict the behavior of industrial catalysts for various hydrogenation processes. The correlation between single crystal, polycrystalline, and supported bimetallic catalysts demonstrates that fundamental studies using probe molecules like cyclohexene can provide useful guidance in selecting and designing novel bimetallic catalytic materials for industrial hydrogenation reactions.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它可以经历多种反应途径，从而提供关于不同表面催化性质的见解。在各种催化剂上，环己烯可以分解、氢化形成环己烷，或脱氢形成苯。这些不同的途径对催化剂表面环己烯和氢的结合强度很敏感。

例如，在NiPtPt(1 1 1)表面，环己烯强烈结合并完全分解。相比之下，在PtNiPt(1 1 1)表面，环己烯和氢的结合都较弱，导致产生环己烷的氢化途径。这种反应性的差异提供了有关催化剂表面电子结构如何影响结合能和反应选择性的宝贵信息。

使用环己烯作为探针分子允许研究人员比较不同催化剂的性能，如单晶表面、多晶材料和负载型催化剂。通过观察产物分布和反应温度，研究人员可以获得关于反应物相对结合强度和催化剂表面不同活性位点存在的见解。

这些来自环己烯反应的见解可以扩展到理解和预测各种工业氢化过程中催化剂的行为。单晶、多晶和负载型双金属催化剂之间的相关性表明，使用环己烯等探针分子进行的基础研究可以为选择和设计新型双金属催化材料提供有用的指导，以用于工业氢化反应。
