[1] "The current work utilizes the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe reactions to bridge the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces."

[2] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."

[3] "The most significant similarity between the single crystal and the polycrystalline surfaces is the observation of hydrogenation pathway on the subsurface PtNiPt structures."

[4] "This difference is most likely due to the presence of the (1 0 0) facets and defect sites on the polycrystalline foil, which promote the decomposition of the benzene intermediate instead of desorption from the surface."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the surface properties of the catalyst. These pathways include hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and decomposition. The behavior of cyclohexene on different surfaces provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

On single crystal surfaces, cyclohexene's reaction pathway is highly dependent on the surface structure. For example, on NiPtPt(1 1 1), cyclohexene binds strongly and completely decomposes, while on PtNiPt(1 1 1), it binds more weakly and undergoes hydrogenation to cyclohexane. This demonstrates how subtle changes in surface composition can dramatically alter reactivity.

On polycrystalline surfaces, which more closely resemble industrial catalysts, cyclohexene's behavior reveals the complex interplay of different surface facets and defect sites. The presence of multiple facets, such as (1 1 1) and (1 0 0), leads to a combination of reaction pathways, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and decomposition. This provides valuable insights into how real catalysts might behave under industrial conditions.

By comparing cyclohexene's behavior on single crystal and polycrystalline surfaces, researchers can bridge the materials gap and better understand how the insights gained from model systems translate to more complex, industrially relevant catalysts. This understanding can guide the design of improved bimetallic catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它可以根据催化剂表面性质的不同而经历多种反应途径。这些途径包括氢化成环己烷、脱氢成苯以及分解。环己烯在不同表面上的行为为双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中的氢化活性和选择性提供了见解。

在单晶表面上，环己烯的反应途径高度依赖于表面结构。例如，在NiPtPt(1 1 1)上，环己烯强烈结合并完全分解，而在PtNiPt(1 1 1)上，它结合较弱并经历氢化成环己烷。这表明表面组成的细微变化可以显著改变反应活性。

在多晶表面上，更接近工业催化剂，环己烯的行为揭示了不同表面晶面和缺陷位点之间的复杂相互作用。多个晶面（如(1 1 1)和(1 0 0)）的存在导致了反应途径的组合，包括氢化、脱氢和分解。这为真实催化剂在工业条件下的行为提供了宝贵的见解。

通过比较环己烯在单晶和多晶表面上的行为，研究人员可以弥合材料差距，更好地理解从模型系统获得的见解如何转化为更复杂的、工业相关的催化剂。这种理解可以指导改进的双金属催化剂的设计，从而在工业过程中增强氢化反应的活性和选择性。
