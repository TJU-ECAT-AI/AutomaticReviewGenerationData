[1] "Previously, it was determined that hydrogen desorbs from Pt(1 1 1) as a relatively broad peak centered near 285 K [14]. Based on this observation, the hydrogen desorption peak at 302 K is attributed to desorption from the (1 1 1) facets of the Pt foil."

[2] "In previous studies, the reaction cyclohexene was used as a probe reaction to compare the different properties of Pt(1 1 1), surface NiPtPt(1 1 1), and subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) [14]."

[3] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."

[4] "The most significant similarity between the single crystal and the polycrystalline surfaces is the observation of hydrogenation pathway on the subsurface PtNiPt structures."

[5] "This is consistent with the recent batch and flow reactor studies of hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts supported on c-Al2O3, which show significantly higher hydrogenation activity than supported Ni and Pt monometallic catalysts [32]."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways, providing insights into the catalytic properties of different surfaces. On various catalysts, cyclohexene can either decompose, undergo hydrogenation to form cyclohexane, or dehydrogenate to form benzene. These different pathways are sensitive to the binding strength of cyclohexene and hydrogen on the catalyst surface.

For example, on NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and undergoes complete decomposition. In contrast, on PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces, both cyclohexene and hydrogen bind more weakly, leading to a hydrogenation pathway that produces cyclohexane. This difference in reactivity provides valuable information about how the electronic structure of the catalyst surface influences binding energies and reaction selectivity.

The use of cyclohexene as a probe molecule allows researchers to compare the performance of different catalysts, such as single crystal surfaces, polycrystalline materials, and supported catalysts. By observing the product distribution and reaction temperatures, researchers can gain insights into the relative binding strengths of reactants and the presence of different active sites on the catalyst surface.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can be extended to understand and predict the behavior of industrial catalysts for various hydrogenation processes. The correlation between single crystal, polycrystalline, and supported bimetallic catalysts demonstrates that fundamental studies using probe molecules like cyclohexene can provide useful guidance in selecting and designing novel bimetallic catalytic materials for industrial hydrogenation reactions.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the catalytic surface properties. These pathways include hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and decomposition. The behavior of cyclohexene on different bimetallic surfaces provides insights into how surface composition and structure influence binding strengths and reactivity.

For example, on NiPtPt(111) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and completely decomposes. In contrast, on PtNiPt(111) surfaces, both hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly, enabling a hydrogenation pathway to cyclohexane. Comparing single crystal and polycrystalline surfaces reveals how different facets and defect sites impact reactivity and product selectivity.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions help elucidate structure-activity relationships in bimetallic catalysts. Understanding how surface composition tunes binding strengths and reaction pathways for this probe molecule can guide the rational design of industrial catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for hydrogenation processes. The multiple possible reaction pathways of cyclohexene make it particularly informative for assessing how bimetallic surfaces modulate reactivity compared to monometallic catalysts.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the surface properties of the catalyst. These pathways include complete decomposition, hydrogenation to cyclohexane, and dehydrogenation to benzene. The different reaction outcomes provide valuable insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

On NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and undergoes complete decomposition. In contrast, on PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces, both cyclohexene and hydrogen bind more weakly, enabling a hydrogenation pathway to produce cyclohexane. This demonstrates how the electronic structure of bimetallic catalysts can significantly alter reaction selectivity.

The study also shows that the hydrogenation pathway observed on single crystal PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces is similarly present on polycrystalline PtNiPt surfaces. This correlation between single crystal, polycrystalline, and potentially supported catalysts suggests that insights gained from fundamental studies on well-defined surfaces can be applicable to more complex, industrially relevant catalyst systems.

Additionally, the multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene allow researchers to probe the effects of different crystal facets and surface structures. For example, the study revealed that NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets on polycrystalline surfaces can also promote hydrogenation, unlike their (1 1 1) counterparts. This highlights the importance of considering various surface structures when designing bimetallic catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.

Overall, cyclohexene's versatility as a probe molecule enables researchers to gain detailed insights into the surface chemistry of bimetallic catalysts, helping to guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation reactions.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the surface properties of the catalyst. These pathways include hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and decomposition. The behavior of cyclohexene on different surfaces provides insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

On single crystal surfaces, cyclohexene's reaction pathway is highly dependent on the surface structure. For example, on NiPtPt(1 1 1), cyclohexene binds strongly and completely decomposes, while on PtNiPt(1 1 1), it binds more weakly and undergoes hydrogenation to cyclohexane. This demonstrates how subtle changes in surface composition can dramatically alter reactivity.

On polycrystalline surfaces, which more closely resemble industrial catalysts, cyclohexene's behavior reveals the complex interplay of different surface facets and defect sites. The presence of multiple facets, such as (1 1 1) and (1 0 0), leads to a combination of reaction pathways, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and decomposition. This provides valuable insights into how real catalysts might behave under industrial conditions.

By comparing cyclohexene's behavior on single crystal and polycrystalline surfaces, researchers can bridge the materials gap and better understand how the insights gained from model systems translate to more complex, industrially relevant catalysts. This understanding can guide the design of improved bimetallic catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenation reactions in industrial processes.

在多晶表面上，更接近工业催化剂，环己烯的行为揭示了不同表面晶面和缺陷位点之间的复杂相互作用。多个晶面（如(1 1 1)和(1 0 0)）的存在导致了反应途径的组合，包括氢化、脱氢和分解。这为真实催化剂在工业条件下的行为提供了宝贵的见解。

通过比较环己烯在单晶和多晶表面上的行为，研究人员可以弥合材料差距，更好地理解从模型系统获得的见解如何转化为更复杂的、工业相关的催化剂。这种理解可以指导改进的双金属催化剂的设计，从而在工业过程中增强氢化反应的活性和选择性。

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the catalyst surface properties. These pathways include hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and decomposition. The relative yields of these products provide insights into how different bimetallic catalyst structures influence binding energies and reaction selectivity.

For example, on NiPtPt(111) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and undergoes complete decomposition. In contrast, on PtNiPt(111) surfaces, both hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly, enabling a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway to cyclohexane. The NiPtPt(100) facets promote hydrogenation but not benzene formation.

By comparing product distributions across different bimetallic structures, researchers can correlate surface composition and structure with hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This allows for rational design of industrial catalysts with optimized performance for specific hydrogenation processes. The multiple possible reaction pathways of cyclohexene make it particularly informative as a probe molecule for evaluating subtle differences between catalyst surfaces.
