[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system."

[2] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."

[3] "The main difference between the surface NiPtPt foil and subsurface PtNiPt foil is that only the latter produces a significant amount of benzene. Thus, while the NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets promote hydrogenation, they do not possess favorable binding characteristics to facilitate benzene formation, as confirmed below in the HREELS measurements."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the catalyst surface properties. These pathways include hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and decomposition. The relative yields of these products provide insights into how different bimetallic catalyst structures influence binding energies and reaction selectivity.

For example, on NiPtPt(111) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and undergoes complete decomposition. In contrast, on PtNiPt(111) surfaces, both hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly, enabling a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway to cyclohexane. The NiPtPt(100) facets promote hydrogenation but not benzene formation.

By comparing product distributions across different bimetallic structures, researchers can correlate surface composition and structure with hydrogenation activity and selectivity. This allows for rational design of industrial catalysts with optimized performance for specific hydrogenation processes. The multiple possible reaction pathways of cyclohexene make it particularly informative as a probe molecule for evaluating subtle differences between catalyst surfaces.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它可以根据催化剂表面性质的不同而进行多种反应路径。这些路径包括氢化成环己烷、脱氢成苯以及分解。这些产物的相对产率提供了关于不同双金属催化剂结构如何影响结合能和反应选择性的洞察。

例如，在NiPtPt(111)表面上，环己烯强烈结合并完全分解。相比之下，在PtNiPt(111)表面上，氢和环己烯都结合得更弱，从而实现了低温氢化路径生成环己烷。NiPtPt(100)晶面促进氢化但不促进苯的形成。

通过比较不同双金属结构的产物分布，研究人员可以将表面组成和结构与氢化活性和选择性相关联。这允许理性设计具有优化性能的工业催化剂，以用于特定的氢化过程。环己烯的多种可能反应路径使其作为探针分子特别有助于评估催化剂表面之间的微妙差异。
