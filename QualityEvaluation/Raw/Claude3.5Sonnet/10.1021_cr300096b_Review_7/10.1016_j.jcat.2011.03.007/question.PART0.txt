The current work utilizes the adsorption of hydrogen and the hydrogenation of cyclohexene as probe
reactions to bridge the materials gap between single crystal and polycrystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.
Previous studies on Ni-modified Pt(1 1 1) have identified the formation of a PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface
structure that binds atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene more weakly, leading to a low-temperature
hydrogenation pathway not present on either of the parent metal surfaces. In the current work, the
PtNiPt subsurface structure is prepared by depositing Ni on a polycrystalline Pt foil substrate. The
adsorption of hydrogen and hydrogenation of cyclohexene are investigated using surface science exper-
iments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The polycrystalline PtNiPt subsurface struc-
ture shows general similarities to PtNiPt(1 1 1) in the low-temperature hydrogenation pathway,
demonstrating the validity of using single crystals to predict activity trends for more complex surfaces.

1. Introduction
The ultimate goal in rational design of catalytic materials is to
correlate theoretical calculations with catalytic properties of sup-
ported catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are
typically carried out on well-defined structures of single crystal
surfaces. On the other hand, an industrially relevant supported cat-
alyst is typically in the form of nanoparticles that contain various
low Miller-index facets as well as edge and defect sites. One way
to bridge the materials gap, between model surfaces in DFT cal-
culations and complex structures in supported catalysts, is to com-
pare the reaction pathways on single crystal and polycrystalline
surfaces. Results on the single crystal surface provide a direct ver-
ification of DFT predictions; studies on the polycrystalline foil ac-
count for the presence of different crystal planes and defects
typically present in a supported catalyst. In the current study, we
will use the hydrogenation of cyclohexene on polycrystalline Ni/
Pt bimetallic surfaces to demonstrate the correlation between
DFT calculations, surface science measurements on single crystal
and polycrystalline substrates, and reactor evaluations over sup-
ported catalysts.
It is well established that bimetallic catalysts often show en-
hanced catalytic properties when compared to those of the corre-
sponding monometallic materials [15]. Recent research has
combined theoretical and experimental approaches to elucidate
the underlying principles that govern the novel catalytic activity
of bimetallic systems [46]. A great deal of effort has been devoted
to investigate the adsorption and reactions of molecules on model
bimetallic surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions
[4,7]. One class of materials that has been particularly interesting
is monolayer bimetallic surfaces formed by the deposition of one
element onto the substrate of another [3,7,8]. Our research group
has conducted extensive experimental studies and DFT calcula-
tions on Pt(1 1 1) substrates modified by 3d transition metals, with
the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces demonstrating some of the
most unique chemical properties [915].
Modification of Pt(1 1 1) with approximately one monolayer
(ML) of Ni at 300 K results in a surface with Ni atoms residing in
a pseudomorphic overlayer on top of the Pt(1 1 1) single crystal,
which is referred to as NiPtPt(1 1 1). The binding of atomic
hydrogen, cyclohexene, and several other adsorbates is stronger
on this surface than on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) [13], which makes
it very active toward decomposition and reforming reactions
[3,11]. If the NiPtPt(1 1 1) surface is heated to 600 K, the surface
Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface layer to form a subsurface Pt
NiPt(1 1 1) structure [13]. The electronic properties of this surface
are modified in such a way that it interacts more weakly with
adsorbates than Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) [3], with the weak binding
energies of atomic hydrogen and unsaturated hydrocarbons lead-
ing to several low temperature C@C and C@O hydrogenation reac-
tions [1215].
In a supported Pt catalyst, the active metal will be present in the
form of nanoparticles to maximize utilization of the expensive
precious metal. Pt nanoparticles are comprised of not only the

low energy (1 1 1) facets, but also other crystalline facets and an
array of edge and defect sites. To account for these additional sur-
face sites, a polycrystalline Pt foil substrate is used in the current
study to approximate the morphology of supported Pt and to
bridge the materials gap between a Pt(1 1 1) single crystal and
more realistic catalytic materials. The hydrogenation of cyclohex-
ene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine
the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system. The
hydrogenation pathway is present only on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) sub-
surface structure, due to the weaker bonding of atomic hydrogen
and cyclohexene on this surface [9,14]. The main objective of the
current study is to determine whether the unique hydrogenation
pathway is also present on the corresponding polycrystalline
Ni/Pt surfaces, using a combination of surface science experiments
and DFT calculations. Specifically, the experiments focus on the
identification of surface intermediates and gas-phase products
following the reaction of cyclohexene with co-adsorbed hydrogen
on Ni/Pt polycrystalline surfaces. The DFT results extend previous
Ni/Pt(1 1 1) calculations to Pt(1 0 0) and Ni/Pt(1 0 0). These calcu-
lations reflect that both the (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) surface facets are
present on the polycrystalline Pt foil, as reported previously
[16,17].
2. Experimental and theoretical methods
2.1. Preparation of bimetallic surfaces
The current study utilized two UHV chambers to conduct TPD
and HREELS experiments. The TPD experiments were performed
in a two-level UHV chamber equipped with an Auger electron
spectrometer (AES) for surface characterization and a UTI 100C
quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for TPD and in situ verification
of the purity of the dosed gases. The HREELS chamber was
equipped with AES, MS, and an LK3000 HREEL spectrometer.
For both chambers, the substrate studied was a polycrystalline
Pt foil. The TPD experiments were performed on a 0.5 mm thick
foil, which was cut to a diameter of approximately 11 mm. The
HREELS experiments used a 0.1 mm thick foil that was cut into a
square shape (10 mm  10 mm) to facilitate tuning of the elec-
tron beam. Both foils were purchased from Alfa Aesar and were
99.997% pure. The substrates were each held in place by two tan-
talum posts. Temperature was measured with a K-type thermocou-
ple, spot-welded to the back of the Pt foil. Temperature control was
achieved via resistive heating and nitrogen cooling through the
tantalum posts and use of a feedback controller. In this manner,
the temperature could be controlled in the range of 1001100 K.
The Pt foil was cleaned by sputtering with Ne+ at 600 K. The sur-
face was then exposed to oxygen at 900 K to remove excess carbon,
followed by annealing at 1050 K for 300 s. This procedure was re-
peated until surface cleanliness was verified with AES. The poly-
crystalline Pt foil in the current study was characterized using
glancing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) [16]. The two domi-
nant peaks were (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) planes, with the latter being de-
tected as (2 0 0) due to the XRD selection rule. Although it is
difficult to quantify the surface fractions of different planes from
the GIXRD measurements, the detection of (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) as
the dominant diffraction peaks suggests that both planes are pres-
ent on the Pt foil. The presence of both Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0) facets
on a polycrystalline foil was also reported by McMillan et al. using
photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) [17].
Ni was deposited onto the clean Pt foil at 300 K until the AES
peak-to-peak ratio of the Ni (849 eV) to Pt (241 eV) peaks was
approximately 1.7. This ratio is representative of approximately
one monolayer (ML) of Ni residing on top of the Pt substrate, as
determined by standard substrate/overlayer calculations as de-
scribed in detail elsewhere [14,18]. The surface configuration is re-
ferred to as NiPtPt foil. To drive Ni into the subsurface region of
the Pt substrate, the NiPtPt foil was flashed to 725 K and held at
that temperature for 30 s, which resulted in the Ni (849 eV)/Pt
(241 eV) AES ratio decreasing to approximately 1.0, corresponding
to a PtNiPt subsurface structure [19].
2.2. TPD measurements
TPD studies were conducted after the adsorption of hydrogen
(Matheson, 99.999%), which was dosed into the chamber with
the substrate temperature at or below 140 K. Saturation coverage
of atomic hydrogen on Pt foil was determined to occur with an
exposure of approximately 10 L (1  107 Torr for 100 s). For the
cyclohexene hydrogenation experiments, hydrogen was dosed
onto the surface to achieve partial saturation (1 L) followed by a
5 L exposure of cyclohexene (Aldrich, 99+%), which was a high en-
ough exposure to result in multilayer desorption being detected in
the TPD spectra. Cyclohexene was purified by successive freeze
pumpthaw cycles prior to use. The TPD measurements were taken
with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s.
2.3. HREELS measurements
HREELS spectra were recorded with a primary beam energy of
6 eV. The angles of incidence and reflection of the beam were 60
with respect to the surface normal. Typical count rates were about
104 counts per second with spectral resolution of about 55 cm1
full width at half maximum (FWHM). The relatively poor resolu-
tion is attributed to the polycrystalline nature of the surfaces. Once
the desired surface was prepared and the substrate temperature
cooled to below 120 K, the surface was exposed to hydrogen to
achieve partial saturation, followed by an exposure of cyclohexene
to near monolayer coverage. The adsorbed layer was then flashed
to the temperature of interest, at a linear heating rate of 3 K/s,
and allowed to cool back down to below 120 K before acquiring
the HREEL spectrum.
3. DFT calculations
The binding energies of hydrogen and cyclohexene on Pt(1 0 0),
Pt(1 1 1), both with and without ML Ni, were calculated using the
Vienna Ab-initio Simulations Package (VASP). All calculations used
a 3  3  1 MonkhorstPack k-point mesh and the PW91 func-
tional with a planewave cutoff energy of 396 eV and implemented
spin polarization. The Pt(1 1 1) and Pt(1 0 0) surfaces were mod-
eled using a periodic 3  3 unit cell slab with four layers of metal
atoms and at least seven equivalent layers of vacuum separated
each metal slab. One adsorbate was placed on the surface per unit
cell, corresponding to 1/9 ML surface coverage. For the NiPtPt
surface configuration, the Pt in the top layer was substituted by
Ni atoms, while for the PtNiPt subsurface configuration Ni atoms
replaced Pt in the second atomic layer. During energy minimiza-
tion, the adsorbate and the top two layers of the metal slab were
allowed to relax while the bottom two layers remained frozen at
the bulk PtPt distance of 2.83 Å, as previously determined for
the PW-91 exchangecorrelation functional [3].
The hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and cyclohexene binding
energy were calculated, and the results are summarized in Table 1.
The binding of cyclohexene was calculated as di-r-bonded at two
adjacent atop sites and in the boat configuration, which was the
lowest energy configuration of this molecule. The binding energy
values in Table 1 were calculated by subtracting the sum of the
total energy of the gas-phase adsorbate and the bare slab from
the adsorbate-slab total energy. Since the energy from HH

interactions on the surface is generally very small compared with
HM interactions, it was not considered in the calculation of HBE
[20].
4. Results and discussion
4.1. DFT calculations of binding energies
As the surface of Pt foil is comprised of a multitude of crystal
facets, it is important to first review the behavior of hydrogen
adsorption on several low-index Pt single crystals. While hydrogen
desorption from Pt surfaces has been studied extensively, it lacks a
straightforward interpretation due to reports of multiple binding
sites, activation barriers for desorption varying by a factor of
two, pre-exponential factors varying over several orders of magni-
tude, and even disagreement over the order of desorption [13,21
25]. For example, the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on Pt(1 1 1)
has been reported to be anywhere from 42 to 90 kJ/mol, with the
large discrepancies in literature likely being attributed to step
edges and defect sites [25]. Thus, it is difficult to agree on an exact
value of the binding energy of hydrogen to each Pt facet, especially
those facets that can reconstruct, based on results found in litera-
ture. There is a general agreement, however, that the dissociative
binding energy of hydrogen (HBE) on Pt(1 1 1), Pt(1 0 0), and
Pt(1 1 0) is relatively similar [25]. Markovic and Ross report the
HBE on Pt(1 1 1) to be on the order of 240270 kJ/mol, which com-
pares favorably to the value of 265 kJ/mol reported in Table 1. It
should be noted that the focus of the current work is to determine
how the modification of Pt foil by Ni would affect hydrogen
adsorption energy and hydrogenation activity. Thus, the primary
objective for the DFT calculations is to identify trends in the values
of hydrogen and cyclohexene binding energies among the different
surfaces. As the values for HBE calculated in this work are in the
range found in literature, it is concluded that the DFT results ob-
tained and summarized in Table 1 are sufficiently accurate for
the purposes of identifying trends among the surfaces reported
in the current study.
As compared in Table 1, on the (1 1 1) surfaces the FCC threefold
site is slightly preferred over the HCP site for the adsorption of
atomic hydrogen. On the (1 0 0) surfaces, the bridge-site is pre-
ferred over the 4-fold site on NiPtPt(1 0 0) while the opposite
is observed on the Ni(1 0 0) surface. For the (1 1 1) surfaces, the va-
lue follows the trend of PtNiPt(1 1 1) < Pt(1 1 1) < Ni(1 1 1) < Ni
PtPt(1 1 1), which is consistent with experimental observations
over these surfaces [13]. On the (1 0 0) surfaces, however, the trend
in HBE is different, with the NiPtPt(1 0 0) surface binding most
weakly among the four surfaces. The DFT results suggest that the
presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(1 0 0) reduces the bind-
ing energy of atomic hydrogen, in contrast to the increase in HBE
upon the deposition of monolayer Ni on Pt(1 1 1).
The binding energy of cyclohexene also shows different trends
between the (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) surfaces. The trend is PtNi
Pt(1 1 1) < Pt(1 1 1) < NiPtPt(1 1 1), similar to that observed for
HBE on these surfaces. In contrast, both subsurface PtNi
Pt(1 0 0) and surface NiPtPt(1 0 0) structures show significantly
lower binding energies than that on Pt(1 0 0).
Overall, the DFT results in Table 1 indicate that three bimetallic
surfaces,
NiPtPt(1 0 0),
PtNiPt(1 1 1),
and
PtNiPt(1 0 0),
have weaker binding energies than unmodified Pt surfaces for both
atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene. Based on the previously re-
ported correlation between binding energies and hydrogenation
activity, these three facets on polycrystalline Pt foil should show
the unique low-temperature hydrogenation pathway for cyclohex-
ene. The remainder of this paper will provide experimental verifi-
cation of the adsorption of atomic hydrogen and the hydrogenation
of cyclohexene on these bimetallic facets.
4.2. TPD measurements of hydrogen adsorption and desorption
TPD experiments (Fig. 1) are performed on the polycrystalline
surfaces to verify the trends predicted by DFT. Previously, it was
determined that hydrogen desorbs from Pt(1 1 1) as a relatively
broad peak centered near 285 K [14]. Based on this observation,
the hydrogen desorption peak at 302 K is attributed to desorption
from the (1 1 1) facets of the Pt foil. The hydrogen desorption peak
at 354 K is attributed both to Pt(1 0 0) facets, which are predicted
by DFT to bind to atomic hydrogen more strongly than Pt(1 1 1)
(Table 1), and to step edges and defect sites, which should also
have stronger binding energy than Pt(1 1 1) due to the fact that
they are under-coordinated. The origins of the low-temperature
peak at 228 K and the shoulder at 170 K are not as clear. A similar
low-temperature peak is seen on Ni(1 1 1), which was determined
to be due to the presence of subsurface hydrogen [26]. It is noted
that this low-temperature feature was not seen on Pt(1 1 1) [14],
but it is possible that the presence of edges, defect sites, and other
low index planes can lead to more facile diffusion of hydrogen

atoms into the subsurface region of the polycrystalline Pt surface
[27]. In addition to the possibility of subsurface hydrogen, TPD
experiments on Pt(1 0 0)-hex have shown desorption of hydro-
gen from the surface at low temperatures [28].
Upon modification of the Pt foil by depositing one ML surface Ni
at 300 K (NiPtPt foil), the desorption of hydrogen occurs as one
very broad peak. The broadening of the desorption peak in compar-
ison with that from unmodified Pt foil is explained by several
simultaneously occurring phenomena. DFT results in Table 1 and
previous TPD studies on Ni/Pt(1 1 1) [14] demonstrate that the
NiPtPt(1 1 1) facets show a higher HBE than Pt(1 1 1), which
should lead to an upward shift of the 302 K peak from the unmod-
ified Pt foil. At the same time, DFT results predict that NiPt
Pt(1 0 0) facets have a lower HBE than Pt(1 0 0), as shown in
Table 1, which should result in a downward shift in hydrogen
desorption temperature for the (1 0 0) facets. In addition, on a vic-
inal Pt(1 1 1) surface, it was found that Ni can exchange with Pt at
step edges at temperatures as low as 150 K [29], and that an or-
dered surface alloy forms on the terraces at 300 K [29]. Thus, Ni
deposition onto Pt foil can result in alloy formation at lower tem-
peratures in comparison with Pt(1 1 1), especially at defect sites
and step edges. This makes it likely that the Ni/Pt foil at 300 K is
comprised of not only NiPtPt(1 1 1) and NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets,
but also an array of PtNi alloy sites which should lead to a variety
of unique binding sites for hydrogen, which should further contrib-
ute to the broadening of the TPD peaks.
By heating the NiPtPt foil surface to 725 K, the Ni (849 eV)/Pt
(241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio decreased from 1.7 to 1.0 due to
the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of the Pt substrate
[19]. The most noticeable difference in the TPD spectrum is the dis-
appearance of the 354 K peak, suggesting the disappearance of any
NiPtPt(1 1 1) facets and all of the higher energy lattices, step
edges, and defect sites responsible for the high temperature peak
on unmodified Pt foil. Because the calculated HBE values on

PtNiPt(1 0 0) and NiPtPt(1 0 0) are similar, it cannot be deter-
mined which of the two sites is present on the surface, though it is
expected that Ni should diffuse into Pt(1 0 0) facets as it does in
Pt(1 1 1). In summary, all three surfaces in Fig. 1 show some low-
temperature desorption states that are not present on single crys-
tal Pt(1 1 1). The next question to be addressed is whether the
presence of weakly bonded hydrogen should lead to the low-tem-
perature hydrogenation of cyclohexene from all three surfaces, as
described below.
4.3. TPD and HREELS studies of cyclohexene hydrogenation
In previous studies, the reaction cyclohexene was used as a
probe reaction to compare the different properties of Pt(1 1 1), sur-
face NiPtPt(1 1 1), and subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1) [14]. Cyclo-
hexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete
decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohex-
ane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more
weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway
for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane. TPD and HREELS
experiments were performed to determine whether similar reac-
tion pathways occur on the more complex polycrystalline bimetal-
lic surface structures. The TPD results presented in Fig. 2 will be
discussed first in order to quantify the product yields, and also to
gain insights into which adsorbates and intermediates may be
present on the surfaces in the HREELS experiments. On a clean Pt
foil, the primary reaction pathway is decomposition, as evidenced
by a post-TPD C (275 eV)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio of
0.76, which is indicative of a surface almost entirely covered with
carbon. There are also minor pathways leading to the formation of
very small amounts of benzene and cyclohexane, as shown in Fig. 2
and quantified in Table 2.
Modification of Pt foil with 1 ML of Ni results in a significant
change in the reaction pathways, with the most obvious difference
being a large yield of cyclohexane from both the PtNiPt and Ni
PtPt polycrystalline surfaces. The observation of hydrogenation
activity on the NiPtPt foil is unique to the polycrystalline surface,
as single crystal NiPtPt(1 1 1) does not exhibit the hydrogenation
pathway [14]. This difference suggests that the NiPtPt(1 0 0) fac-
ets on polycrystalline Pt, and possibly even the Ni-modified step
edge and defect sites, are active for cyclohexene hydrogenation.
This is not surprising considering the relatively weak cyclohexene
binding energy on NiPtPt(1 0 0) predicted by DFT (Table 1), and
also considering the presence of low-temperature desorption states
of hydrogen from the NiPtPt foil (Fig. 1).
The amount of gas-phase cyclohexane is quantified by compar-
ing the TPD peak area from the polycrystalline surface to that from
single
crystal
PtNiPt(1 1 1),
which
was
estimated
to
be
0.749 lmol/m2 based on the amount of cyclohexane molecules
desorbing from the single crystal surface [14] and by assuming that
the number of surface metal sites is 1.5  1015 atoms/cm2 on
Pt(1 1 1). By annealing the NiPtPt foil surface to 725 K, the cyclo-
hexane yield increased from 0.754 to 0.997 lmol/m2. This increase
in activity is likely a result of the NiPtPt(1 1 1) facets being
transformed into the PtNiPt(1 1 1) facets on the polycrystalline
foil, which should lead to higher hydrogenation yield.
The main difference between the surface NiPtPt foil and sub-
surface PtNiPt foil is that only the latter produces a significant
amount of benzene. Thus, while the NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets promote
hydrogenation, they do not possess favorable binding characteris-
tics to facilitate benzene formation, as confirmed below in the
HREELS measurements. In addition to hydrogenation and dehydro-
genation reactions, there is evidence of carbonaceous species
remaining after the TPD experiments on both NiPtPt foil and
PtNiPt foil, as evidenced by a substantial signal from C in the
post-TPD AES measurements. While the relative intensity of this
carbon signal is likely a function of the coverage of these carbona-
ceous species, it cannot be used to accurately quantify the decom-
position pathway. Due to alloying, diffusion, segregation, and other
mechanisms involving the movement of Pt and Ni relative to each
other during a TPD experiment, there is a great deal of uncertainty
in the ratio of C/Pt or C/Ni associated with a given coverage of CxHy
fragments. For this reason, these AES ratios are not used to quantify
the amount of carbon species after the TPD experiments on the Ni/
Pt polycrystalline surfaces.
As an approximation to a pure Ni metal surface, the hydrogena-
tion activity of a thick Ni film on the Pt foil is also studied as a ref-
erence. This surface promotes similar reactions as does the
unmodified Pt foil surface. Specifically, there is a relatively high
activity toward decomposition, with only minimal activity toward
gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane formation. This is not surprising
as previous work has shown similar hydrogen and cyclohexene
binding energies on Pt(1 1 1) and Ni(1 1 1) [14].
The findings from the TPD results are consistent with the HREEL
results in Figs. 3 and 4, which were recorded after the adsorption of
cyclohexene on hydrogen pre-dosed surfaces of Pt, PtNiPt and
NiPtPt polycrystalline surfaces. The development of vibrational
features on the Pt foil (Fig. 3) is similar to that observed previously
on the thermal behavior of cyclohexene on Pt(1 1 1) [9]. At 100 K,
the vibrational features are relatively weak, most likely due to ran-
dom orientations of cyclohexene on the polycrystalline substrate.

After heating to 200 K, the vibrational frequencies are characteris-
tic of di-r-bonded cyclohexene, as summarized in the vibrational
assignment in Table 3. The main vibrational features are related
to the following modes of cyclohexene, m(CC) at 819 cm1,
m(CAC) + q(CH2) at 1082 cm1, x(CH2) wag at 1312 cm1, x(CH2)
scissor at 1414 cm1, and m(ACAH) at 2868 cm1. The absence of
the m(C@C) and m(@CAH) modes suggests that cyclohexene is di-
r-bonded through the C@C bond on the Pt foil. After heating to
300 K, the spectrum is consistent with a mixture of adsorbed cyclo-
hexene and benzene. After heating to 400 K, the spectrum is char-
acteristic of chemisorbed benzene with the following vibrational
modes

intensities of the m(CAC) at 819 cm1 and m(CAH) at 1123 cm1
modes start to decrease after heating to 500 K, indicating that ad-
sorbed benzene starts to undergo either decomposition or desorp-
tion.

were also included to provide a point of comparison. Using similar
vibrational assignment in Table 3, the 100 K HREEL spectra on the
subsurface PtNiPt and surface NiPtPt foils are consistent with
the adsorption of di-r-bonded cyclohexene. A closer inspection
also reveals the presence of relatively weak features at 670 and
1610 cm1. In previous studies following the adsorption of

cyclohexene on single crystal PtNiPt(1 1 1), these two features
were much better resolved and were assigned to the d(C@C) and
t(C@C) modes, respectively, of weakly r-bonded cyclohexene with
the C@C bond parallel to the single crystal surface [9]. The presence
of weakly bonded cyclohexene on PtNiPt(1 1 1) is consistent
with the DFT prediction (Table 1) and is responsible for the low-
temperature hydrogenation pathway. Using a similar argument,
the presence of these two features in the current study suggests
that weakly r-bonded cyclohexene should also be present on the
PtNiPt and NiPtPt polycrystalline surfaces, although their rel-
ative intensities are not as intense as those on the single crystal
surfaces, likely due to the lack of preferred orientation of the
C@C bond on the polycrystalline foil. The disappearance of these
two features at 200 K is consistent with the TPD detection of gas-
phase cyclohexane at 176 K from NiPtPt and at 196 K from Pt
NiPt (Fig. 2). At 200 K and higher temperatures, the HREEL spectra
on the PtNiPt foil are qualitatively similar to those on unmodi-
fied Pt foil, with the surface species being mainly di-r-bonded
cyclohexene at 200 K and chemisorbed benzene at higher temper-
atures. One noticeable difference is that the benzene features are
less intense on PtNiPt than on Pt, consistent with the TPD results
(Fig. 2) that a significant amount of benzene desorbs from the Pt
NiPt foil instead of remaining on the surface and undergoing sub-
sequent decomposition. In comparison, one of the characteristic
features for benzene, m(CAC) at 819 cm1, is not well developed
on the NiPtPt surface at any temperature. This observation is
consistent with the near absence of gas-phase benzene from this
surface (Fig. 2), suggesting that the decomposition of cyclohexene
on NiPtPt does not occur through a stable benzene intermediate.
4.4. Similarities and differences between Ni/Pt(1 1 1) and Ni/Pt foil
The most significant similarity between the single crystal and
the polycrystalline surfaces is the observation of hydrogenation
pathway on the subsurface PtNiPt structures. As predicted in
the DFT calculations in Table 1, both the PtNiPt(1 1 1) and Pt
NiPt(1 0 0) facets should bond to atomic hydrogen and cyclohex-
ene weakly, resulting in the low-temperature hydrogenation
pathway (Fig. 2) that is not present on either polycrystalline Pt
or the thick Ni film. Recent DFT calculations [30] indicate that
the subsurface PtNiPt structure is thermodynamically preferred
under reducing conditions and in the presence of adsorbed hydro-
gen. This is confirmed experimentally using in situ X-ray absorp-
tion near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements of ML Ni on
polycrystalline Pt, where the surface and subsurface structures
can be recycled using oxidationreduction treatment, with the
subsurface PtNiPt being the preferred structure under atmo-
spheric pressure of hydrogen [31] These results suggest that the
desirable PtNiPt subsurface structure should also be present in
supported Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts under hydrogenation condi-
tions. This is consistent with the recent batch and flow reactor stud-
ies of hydrogenation of cyclohexene on Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts
supported on c-Al2O3, which show significantly higher hydrogena-
tion activity than supported Ni and Pt monometallic catalysts [32].
One interesting difference between the single crystal and the
polycrystalline surfaces is the detection of the hydrogenation path-
way on polycrystalline NiPtPt, which is not present on the single
crystal NiPtPt(1 1 1) [14]. Based on the DFT predictions in Table 1
and the TPD results, this difference is most likely related to the
presence of the NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets on the polycrystalline foil.
Both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene are predicted to adsorb
weakly on NiPtPt(1 0 0), and this is likely responsible for of the
hydrogenation pathway on the polycrystalline NiPtPt surface.
It is also important to point out that, although weakly adsorbed
hydrogen is detected in TPD on polycrystalline Pt, this surface does
not show the hydrogenation pathway due to the fact that cyclo-
hexene binds strongly on this surface. This observation further
confirms previous conclusions that atomic hydrogen and alkenes
both need to be weakly bonded in order to achieve the low-tem-
perature hydrogenation [3].
Finally, another difference is in the relative yields of gas-phase
cyclohexane and benzene. As shown in the TPD yield in Table 3, on
single crystal PtNiPt(1 1 1) the yields of cyclohexane and ben-
zene are comparable. In contrast, on polycrystalline PtNiPt the
yield of benzene (0.13 lmol/m2) is significantly lower than cyclo-
hexene (0.997 lmol/m2), although benzene is detected as a reac-
tion intermediate in the HREELS measurements (Fig. 4). This
difference is most likely due to the presence of the (1 0 0) facets
and defect sites on the polycrystalline foil, which promote the
decomposition of the benzene intermediate instead of desorption
from the surface.
5. Conclusions
The results in the current paper demonstrate general similari-
ties and interesting differences between single crystal and poly-
crystalline Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. Similar to the single crystal
PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, the PtNiPt foil is active
for the low-temperature hydrogenation due to the presence of
weakly bonded atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene. However, un-
like NiPtPt(1 1 1), the NiPtPt foil is also active toward the
hydrogenation, most likely related to the DFT prediction and

experimental verification that the NiPtPt(1 0 0) portion of the
polycrystalline bimetallic foil also bonds to hydrogen and cyclo-
hexene more weakly than unmodified Pt. Thus, it is expected that
supported Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts, which should consist of Pt
NiPt(1 1 1), PtNiPt(1 0 0), and possibly NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets,
should also exhibit enhanced low-temperature hydrogenation
properties, as reported recently in reactor studies on supported
Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts on c-Al2O3 [32]. The correlation between
single crystal, polycrystalline, and supported bimetallic catalysts
demonstrates that DFT calculations and UHV studies on single
crystal surfaces should provide useful guidance in selecting novel
bimetallic catalytic materials for hydrogenation reactions.
