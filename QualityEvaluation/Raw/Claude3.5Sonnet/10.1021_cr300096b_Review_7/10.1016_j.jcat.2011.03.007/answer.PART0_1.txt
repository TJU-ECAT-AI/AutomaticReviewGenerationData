[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene has previously been used as a probe reaction to determine the novel properties of the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic system."

[2] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."

[3] "The most significant similarity between the single crystal and the polycrystalline surfaces is the observation of hydrogenation pathway on the subsurface PtNiPt structures."

[4] "This difference is most likely due to the presence of the (1 0 0) facets and defect sites on the polycrystalline foil, which promote the decomposition of the benzene intermediate instead of desorption from the surface."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the catalytic surface properties. These pathways include hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and decomposition. The behavior of cyclohexene on different bimetallic surfaces provides insights into how surface composition and structure influence binding strengths and reactivity.

For example, on NiPtPt(111) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and completely decomposes. In contrast, on PtNiPt(111) surfaces, both hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly, enabling a hydrogenation pathway to cyclohexane. Comparing single crystal and polycrystalline surfaces reveals how different facets and defect sites impact reactivity and product selectivity.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions help elucidate structure-activity relationships in bimetallic catalysts. Understanding how surface composition tunes binding strengths and reaction pathways for this probe molecule can guide the rational design of industrial catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for hydrogenation processes. The multiple possible reaction pathways of cyclohexene make it particularly informative for assessing how bimetallic surfaces modulate reactivity compared to monometallic catalysts.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，因为它可以根据催化表面特性进行多种反应途径。这些途径包括氢化成环己烷、脱氢成苯以及分解。环己烯在不同双金属表面上的行为提供了关于表面组成和结构如何影响结合强度和反应活性的见解。

例如，在NiPtPt(111)表面上，环己烯结合强烈并完全分解。相比之下，在PtNiPt(111)表面上，氢和环己烯都结合得更弱，从而实现了向环己烷的氢化途径。比较单晶和多晶表面揭示了不同晶面和缺陷位点如何影响反应活性和产物选择性。

这些来自环己烯反应的见解有助于阐明双金属催化剂中的结构-活性关系。了解表面组成如何调节这种探针分子的结合强度和反应途径，可以指导工业催化剂的理性设计，优化氢化过程的活性和选择性。环己烯的多种可能反应途径使其在评估双金属表面如何调节反应活性方面特别具有信息量，与单金属催化剂相比。
