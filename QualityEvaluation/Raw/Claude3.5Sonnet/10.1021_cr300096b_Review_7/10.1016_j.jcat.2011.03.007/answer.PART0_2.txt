[1] "Previously, it was determined that the hydrogenation of cyclohexene has been used as a probe reaction to compare the different properties of Pt(1 1 1), surface NiPtPt(1 1 1), and subsurface PtNiPt(1 1 1)"

[2] "Cyclohexene binds strongly on NiPtPt(1 1 1), leading to complete decomposition without producing gas-phase benzene or cyclohexane. In contrast, both atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene bind more weakly on PtNiPt(1 1 1), resulting in a hydrogenation pathway for the production of gas-phase cyclohexane."

[3] "The most significant similarity between the single crystal and the polycrystalline surfaces is the observation of hydrogenation pathway on the subsurface PtNiPt structures."

[4] "As predicted in the DFT calculations in Table 1, both the PtNiPt(1 1 1) and PtNiPt(1 0 0) facets should bond to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene weakly, resulting in the low-temperature hydrogenation pathway (Fig. 2) that is not present on either polycrystalline Pt or the thick Ni film."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because it can undergo multiple reaction pathways depending on the surface properties of the catalyst. These pathways include complete decomposition, hydrogenation to cyclohexane, and dehydrogenation to benzene. The different reaction outcomes provide valuable insights into how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

On NiPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces, cyclohexene binds strongly and undergoes complete decomposition. In contrast, on PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces, both cyclohexene and hydrogen bind more weakly, enabling a hydrogenation pathway to produce cyclohexane. This demonstrates how the electronic structure of bimetallic catalysts can significantly alter reaction selectivity.

The study also shows that the hydrogenation pathway observed on single crystal PtNiPt(1 1 1) surfaces is similarly present on polycrystalline PtNiPt surfaces. This correlation between single crystal, polycrystalline, and potentially supported catalysts suggests that insights gained from fundamental studies on well-defined surfaces can be applicable to more complex, industrially relevant catalyst systems.

Additionally, the multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene allow researchers to probe the effects of different crystal facets and surface structures. For example, the study revealed that NiPtPt(1 0 0) facets on polycrystalline surfaces can also promote hydrogenation, unlike their (1 1 1) counterparts. This highlights the importance of considering various surface structures when designing bimetallic catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.

Overall, cyclohexene's versatility as a probe molecule enables researchers to gain detailed insights into the surface chemistry of bimetallic catalysts, helping to guide the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation reactions.

环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，因为它可以根据催化剂的表面性质经历多种反应途径。这些途径包括完全分解、加氢生成环己烷和脱氢生成苯。不同的反应结果为双金属催化剂如何影响加氢活性和选择性提供了宝贵的见解。

在NiPtPt(1 1 1)表面上，环己烯结合强烈并发生完全分解。相比之下，在PtNiPt(1 1 1)表面上，环己烯和氢的结合都较弱，从而实现了生成环己烷的加氢途径。这表明双金属催化剂的电子结构可以显著改变反应选择性。

研究还表明，在单晶PtNiPt(1 1 1)表面上观察到的加氢途径在多晶PtNiPt表面上也同样存在。单晶、多晶和潜在的负载催化剂之间的这种相关性表明，从定义明确的表面上的基础研究中获得的见解可以应用于更复杂的、工业相关的催化剂系统。

此外，环己烯的多种反应途径使研究人员能够探究不同晶面和表面结构的影响。例如，研究发现多晶表面上的NiPtPt(1 0 0)晶面也可以促进加氢，这与其(1 1 1)晶面不同。这突出了在设计工业加氢过程的双金属催化剂时考虑各种表面结构的重要性。

总的来说，环己烯作为探针分子的多功能性使研究人员能够深入了解双金属催化剂的表面化学，有助于指导开发更高效和选择性的工业加氢反应催化剂。
