This question cannot be answered based on the given literature. The document does not contain any information about cyclohexene or its use as a probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions. The text appears to focus on oxygen-induced segregation in platinum-based bimetallic structures, which is not related to the question about cyclohexene and hydrogenation reactions.
