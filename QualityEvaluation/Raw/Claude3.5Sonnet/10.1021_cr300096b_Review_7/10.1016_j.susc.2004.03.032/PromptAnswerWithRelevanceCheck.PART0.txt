[1] "Because of the different reaction pathways, cyclohexene is an important probe molecule used to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons"

[2] "The three main reaction pathways of cyclohexene are dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and decomposition."

[3] "Cyclohexene decomposes to C(a) and H2 and dehydrogenates to benzene on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced."

[4] "Overall, the TPD and HREELS experiments demonstrate a distinct difference between the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces and the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface for the reaction pathways of cyclohexene."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These diverse pathways allow researchers to observe how different catalysts affect each reaction route. In the case of bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt/Ni(1 1 1), cyclohexene reactions provide insights into how the addition of one metal to another can introduce new reaction pathways or modify existing ones.

The study of cyclohexene on different surfaces reveals how bimetallic catalysts can influence both activity and selectivity in hydrogenation processes. For instance, the addition of Pt to Ni(1 1 1) introduces a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. This demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can enable reactions to occur at lower temperatures, potentially improving energy efficiency in industrial processes.

Furthermore, the differences in cyclohexene behavior on various surfaces, as observed through techniques like TPD and HREELS, provide valuable information about the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic catalysts. These insights can be applied to the design and optimization of catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes, allowing for better control over reaction selectivity and efficiency.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These diverse pathways allow researchers to observe how different catalysts influence the selectivity and activity of various reactions.

In the case of bimetallic catalysts, cyclohexene's behavior provides valuable insights into how the combination of metals affects hydrogenation activity and selectivity. For example, the study shows that while pure Ni(111) surfaces only exhibit dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways, the addition of Pt introduces a new hydrogenation pathway. This demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can create new reaction possibilities that are not present with single-metal catalysts.

The changes in reactivity observed with different Pt coverages on Ni(111) surfaces illustrate how the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts can fine-tune reaction outcomes. This information is crucial for designing more efficient and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.

Furthermore, the study of cyclohexene on these surfaces reveals how factors such as metal-hydrogen bond strength and adsorbate bonding can influence reaction pathways. This fundamental understanding can guide the development of improved catalysts for various industrial hydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes.

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple possible reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These different pathways allow researchers to observe how bimetallic catalysts influence the activity and selectivity of hydrogenation processes.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's reaction pathways include:

1. Catalyst composition effects: The study shows that adding Pt to Ni(111) surfaces introduces a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on clean Ni(111), demonstrating how bimetallic catalysts can enable new reaction routes.

2. Surface reactivity changes: The distinct differences in cyclohexene reactions between Pt/Ni(111) and clean Ni(111) surfaces reveal how bimetallic catalysts can significantly alter surface reactivity.

3. Bonding strength influences: HREELS results indicate that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to Pt/Ni(111) than to Ni(111), showing how bimetallic catalysts can affect adsorbate-surface interactions.

4. Hydrogen effects: Pre-adsorption of H2 on Pt/Ni(111) enhances hydrogenation activity, highlighting the role of hydrogen availability in hydrogenation processes.

These insights are valuable for understanding and optimizing bimetallic catalysts in industrial hydrogenation processes, as they demonstrate how catalyst composition can be tuned to achieve desired reaction pathways, improve selectivity, and enhance activity at lower temperatures.
