[1] "Because of the different reaction pathways, cyclohexene is an important probe molecule used to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons"

[2] "The three main reaction pathways of cyclohexene are dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and decomposition."

[3] "On Ni(1 1 1), only the dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways are present."

[4] "The Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces exhibit different reactivities from that of clean Ni(1 1 1). At 0.5 ML Pt coverage, a small amount of cyclohexane is produced."

[5] "Overall, the TPD and HREELS experiments demonstrate a distinct difference between the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces and the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface for the reaction pathways of cyclohexene."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple possible reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These different pathways allow researchers to observe how bimetallic catalysts influence the activity and selectivity of hydrogenation processes.

The insights provided by cyclohexene's reaction pathways include:

1. Catalyst composition effects: The study shows that adding Pt to Ni(111) surfaces introduces a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway not present on clean Ni(111), demonstrating how bimetallic catalysts can enable new reaction routes.

2. Surface reactivity changes: The distinct differences in cyclohexene reactions between Pt/Ni(111) and clean Ni(111) surfaces reveal how bimetallic catalysts can significantly alter surface reactivity.

3. Bonding strength influences: HREELS results indicate that cyclohexene bonds more weakly to Pt/Ni(111) than to Ni(111), showing how bimetallic catalysts can affect adsorbate-surface interactions.

4. Hydrogen effects: Pre-adsorption of H2 on Pt/Ni(111) enhances hydrogenation activity, highlighting the role of hydrogen availability in hydrogenation processes.

These insights are valuable for understanding and optimizing bimetallic catalysts in industrial hydrogenation processes, as they demonstrate how catalyst composition can be tuned to achieve desired reaction pathways, improve selectivity, and enhance activity at lower temperatures.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它具有多种可能的反应途径，包括脱氢、加氢和分解。这些不同的途径使研究人员能够观察双金属催化剂如何影响氢化过程的活性和选择性。

环己烯反应途径提供的见解包括：

1. 催化剂组成效应：研究表明，将Pt添加到Ni(111)表面会引入在纯Ni(111)上不存在的低温氢化途径，这证明了双金属催化剂如何能够开启新的反应路线。

2. 表面反应性变化：Pt/Ni(111)和纯Ni(111)表面之间环己烯反应的明显差异揭示了双金属催化剂如何显著改变表面反应性。

3. 键合强度影响：HREELS结果表明，环己烯与Pt/Ni(111)的键合比与Ni(111)的键合更弱，显示了双金属催化剂如何影响吸附质-表面相互作用。

4. 氢气效应：在Pt/Ni(111)上预吸附H2增强了氢化活性，突出了氢气可用性在氢化过程中的作用。

这些见解对于理解和优化工业氢化过程中的双金属催化剂很有价值，因为它们展示了如何调整催化剂组成以实现所需的反应途径、提高选择性并在较低温度下增强活性。
