[1] "Because of the different reaction pathways, cyclohexene is an important probe molecule used to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons"

[2] "The three main reaction pathways of cyclohexene are dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and decomposition."

[3] "Cyclohexene decomposes to C(a) and H2 and dehydrogenates to benzene on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced."

[4] "Overall, the TPD and HREELS experiments demonstrate a distinct difference between the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces and the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface for the reaction pathways of cyclohexene."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These diverse pathways allow researchers to observe how different catalysts affect each reaction route. In the case of bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt/Ni(1 1 1), cyclohexene reactions provide insights into how the addition of one metal to another can introduce new reaction pathways or modify existing ones.

The study of cyclohexene on different surfaces reveals how bimetallic catalysts can influence both activity and selectivity in hydrogenation processes. For instance, the addition of Pt to Ni(1 1 1) introduces a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. This demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can enable reactions to occur at lower temperatures, potentially improving energy efficiency in industrial processes.

Furthermore, the differences in cyclohexene behavior on various surfaces, as observed through techniques like TPD and HREELS, provide valuable information about the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic catalysts. These insights can be applied to the design and optimization of catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes, allowing for better control over reaction selectivity and efficiency.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它具有多种反应途径，包括脱氢、氢化和分解。这些多样的途径使研究人员能够观察不同催化剂如何影响每种反应路线。在双金属催化剂（如Pt/Ni(1 1 1)）的情况下，环己烯反应提供了关于如何通过将一种金属添加到另一种金属来引入新的反应途径或修改现有途径的见解。

在不同表面上研究环己烯反应揭示了双金属催化剂如何影响氢化过程的活性和选择性。例如，将Pt添加到Ni(1 1 1)上引入了一种在纯Ni(1 1 1)表面上不存在的低温氢化途径。这表明双金属催化剂可以使反应在更低的温度下进行，从而可能提高工业过程的能源效率。

此外，通过TPD和HREELS等技术观察到的环己烯在各种表面上的行为差异，提供了有关双金属催化剂电子和结构特性的宝贵信息。这些见解可以应用于工业氢化过程催化剂的设计和优化，从而更好地控制反应选择性和效率。
