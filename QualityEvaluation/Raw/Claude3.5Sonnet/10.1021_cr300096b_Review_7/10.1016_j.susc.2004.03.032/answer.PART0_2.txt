Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple possible reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These diverse pathways allow researchers to observe how different catalysts affect the selectivity and activity of various reactions.

In the case of Ni(111) and Pt/Ni(111) bimetallic surfaces, cyclohexene's behavior provides valuable insights into how the addition of Pt influences catalytic activity. On clean Ni(111), only dehydrogenation and decomposition occur. However, when Pt is added to create a bimetallic surface, a new hydrogenation pathway emerges, producing cyclohexane.

This change in reactivity demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can introduce new reaction pathways and alter selectivity. By studying these changes, researchers can gain a better understanding of how to design and optimize bimetallic catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes, potentially improving efficiency and selectivity in various applications such as fuel production, fine chemical synthesis, and pharmaceutical manufacturing.

环己烯之所以成为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它具有多种可能的反应途径，包括脱氢、加氢和分解。这些多样的途径使研究人员能够观察不同催化剂如何影响各种反应的选择性和活性。

在Ni(111)和Pt/Ni(111)双金属表面的情况下，环己烯的行为为我们提供了宝贵的见解，说明了添加Pt如何影响催化活性。在纯Ni(111)表面上，只发生脱氢和分解反应。然而，当添加Pt形成双金属表面时，出现了一种新的加氢途径，产生环己烷。

这种反应性的变化表明，双金属催化剂可以引入新的反应途径并改变选择性。通过研究这些变化，研究人员可以更好地理解如何设计和优化双金属催化剂用于工业氢化过程，从而可能提高各种应用（如燃料生产、精细化学品合成和制药）的效率和选择性。
