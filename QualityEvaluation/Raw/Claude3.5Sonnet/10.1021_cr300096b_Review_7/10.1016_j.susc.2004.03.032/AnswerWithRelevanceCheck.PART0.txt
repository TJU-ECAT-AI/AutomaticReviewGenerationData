          [1] "Because of the different reaction pathways, cyclohexene is an important probe molecule used to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons"

[2] "The three main reaction pathways of cyclohexene are dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and decomposition."

[3] "Cyclohexene decomposes to C(a) and H2 and dehydrogenates to benzene on a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface. However, when Pt is added to the Ni(1 1 1) surface, a low-temperature hydrogenation pathway is introduced."

[4] "Overall, the TPD and HREELS experiments demonstrate a distinct difference between the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces and the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface for the reaction pathways of cyclohexene."

[5] "On Ni(1 1 1), only the dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways are present."

[6] "The Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces exhibit different reactivities from that of clean Ni(1 1 1). At 0.5 ML Pt coverage, a small amount of cyclohexane is produced."

          Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These diverse pathways allow researchers to observe how different catalysts affect each reaction route and provide insights into the influence of bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes.

The study of cyclohexene on different surfaces reveals how bimetallic catalysts can influence both activity and selectivity in hydrogenation processes:

1. On clean Ni(111) surfaces, only dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways are present.
2. The addition of Pt to Ni(111) introduces a new low-temperature hydrogenation pathway, producing cyclohexane.
3. The different reactivities observed between Pt/Ni(111) and clean Ni(111) surfaces demonstrate how bimetallic catalysts can create new reaction possibilities or enhance existing ones.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions on bimetallic surfaces can be applied to understand and improve industrial hydrogenation processes. By carefully tuning the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, researchers can potentially enhance the selectivity and efficiency of hydrogenation reactions in various industrial applications, such as in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, or in petroleum refining processes.

Furthermore, the differences in cyclohexene behavior on various surfaces, as observed through techniques like TPD and HREELS, provide valuable information about the electronic and structural properties of bimetallic catalysts. These insights can be applied to the design and optimization of catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes, allowing for better control over reaction selectivity and efficiency.

          环己烯之所以成为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它具有多种反应途径，包括脱氢、加氢和分解。这些多样化的途径使研究人员能够观察不同催化剂如何影响各种反应路线，并提供有关双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中氢化活性和选择性的见解。

在不同表面上研究环己烯反应揭示了双金属催化剂如何影响氢化过程的活性和选择性：

1. 在纯Ni(111)表面上，只存在脱氢和分解途径。
2. 将Pt添加到Ni(111)上引入了一种新的低温氢化途径，产生环己烷。
3. Pt/Ni(111)和纯Ni(111)表面之间观察到的不同反应性表明，双金属催化剂如何能够创造新的反应可能性或增强现有反应。

这些从双金属表面上环己烯反应获得的见解可以应用于理解和改进工业氢化过程。通过仔细调节双金属催化剂的组成和结构，研究人员可以潜在地提高各种工业应用中氢化反应的选择性和效率，例如在精细化学品、药品的生产或石油精炼过程中。

此外，通过TPD和HREELS等技术观察到的环己烯在各种表面上的行为差异，提供了有关双金属催化剂电子和结构特性的宝贵信息。这些见解可以应用于工业氢化过程催化剂的设计和优化，从而更好地控制反应选择性和效率。
