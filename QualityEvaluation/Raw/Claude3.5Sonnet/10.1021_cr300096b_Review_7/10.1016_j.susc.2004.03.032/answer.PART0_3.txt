[1] "Because of the different reaction pathways, cyclohexene is an important probe molecule used to understand the catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons"

[2] "The three main reaction pathways of cyclohexene are dehydrogenation, hydrogenation and decomposition."

[3] "On Ni(1 1 1), only the dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways are present."

[4] "The Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces exhibit different reactivities from that of clean Ni(1 1 1). At 0.5 ML Pt coverage, a small amount of cyclohexane is produced."

[5] "Overall, the TPD and HREELS experiments demonstrate a distinct difference between the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces and the clean Ni(1 1 1) surface for the reaction pathways of cyclohexene."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its multiple possible reaction pathways, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and decomposition. These diverse pathways allow researchers to observe how different catalytic surfaces influence the selectivity and activity of various reactions.

In the case of bimetallic catalysts, cyclohexene reactions provide valuable insights into how the addition of a second metal can dramatically alter the catalytic properties of a surface. For example, the study shows that while pure Ni(111) surfaces only exhibit dehydrogenation and decomposition pathways, the addition of Pt introduces a new hydrogenation pathway, producing cyclohexane.

This change in reactivity demonstrates how bimetallic catalysts can create new reaction possibilities or enhance existing ones. The study also reveals that the strength of bonding between the reactants and the catalyst surface plays a crucial role in determining reaction pathways and products.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions on bimetallic surfaces can be applied to understand and improve industrial hydrogenation processes. By carefully tuning the composition and structure of bimetallic catalysts, researchers can potentially enhance the selectivity and efficiency of hydrogenation reactions in various industrial applications, such as in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, or in petroleum refining processes.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，是因为它具有多种可能的反应途径，包括脱氢、氢化和分解。这些多样化的途径使研究人员能够观察到不同的催化表面如何影响各种反应的选择性和活性。

在双金属催化剂的情况下，环己烯反应提供了宝贵的洞见，揭示了添加第二种金属如何显著改变表面的催化性质。例如，该研究表明，纯Ni(111)表面只表现出脱氢和分解途径，而添加Pt则引入了新的氢化途径，产生环己烷。

这种反应性的变化表明双金属催化剂如何创造新的反应可能性或增强现有的反应。研究还揭示，反应物与催化剂表面之间的结合强度在决定反应途径和产物方面起着关键作用。

这些从双金属表面上环己烯反应获得的见解可以应用于理解和改进工业氢化过程。通过仔细调节双金属催化剂的组成和结构，研究人员可以潜在地提高各种工业应用中氢化反应的选择性和效率，例如在精细化学品、药品的生产或石油精炼过程中。
