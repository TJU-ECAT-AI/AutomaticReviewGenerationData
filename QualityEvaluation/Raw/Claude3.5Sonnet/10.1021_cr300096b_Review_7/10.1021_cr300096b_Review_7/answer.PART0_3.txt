[1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."

[2] "Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its relevance in industrial processes and its multiple reaction pathways. It is significant because cyclic hydrocarbons are important intermediates in refinery and petrochemical processes, as well as building blocks for many chemicals in the industry.

The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation, and hydrogenation, allow researchers to conduct comparative studies. These studies provide insights into how the formation of bimetallic bonds influences both the activity and selectivity of hydrogenation reactions. By examining these different pathways, researchers can better understand the effects of various bimetallic catalysts on hydrogenation processes, which is crucial for optimizing industrial applications.
