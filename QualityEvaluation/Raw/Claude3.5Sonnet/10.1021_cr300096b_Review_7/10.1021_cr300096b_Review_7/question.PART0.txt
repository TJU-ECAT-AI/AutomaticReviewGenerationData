4.1.1 CC Hydrogenation
4.1.1.1 Example: Cyclohexene Hydrogenation on Pt3d Catalysts
Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry. Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity.
DFT and UHV Studies on Single-Crystal 3d/Pt(111) Surfaces
To facilitate the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene, one hypothesis is that an effective catalyst should bond relatively weakly to atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene. Hammer and Nrskov (302) have shown that the binding strength of molecules on transition metals is dependent on the electronic structure of the surface, by using the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level to describe the surface electronic property. Chen et al. (10) have summarized experimental and theoretical studies that identify a nearly linear relationship between the binding energies and the surface d-band center for many adsorbates on a wide range of bimetallic surfaces.
DFT calculations were performed to estimate the values of hydrogen-binding energy (HBE) on several 3dPtPt(111) and Pt3dPt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 10a, (27) HBE is related to the position of the surface d-band center with respect to the Fermi level, in agreement with the trend observed in previous studies for other surfaces. (10) In general, the addition of a 3d metal surface layer on Pt(111) moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level compared to that of the bulk 3d metals. This is primarily due to the tensile strain induced by the Pt lattice because the ligand effect is weakest between late transition metal overlayers and the Pt(111) substrate. (16) Conversely, the presence of subsurface 3d metals shifts the surface d-band center of Pt away from the Fermi level as compared to that of Pt(111), mainly due to the electronic interaction of Pt and the subsurface 3d atoms. (16) The comparison in Figure 10a demonstrates that HBE typically follows the trend of 3dPtPt(111) > Pt(111) > Pt3dPt(111). In addition, the nearly linear correlation between HBE and the surface d-band center should enable one to predict HBE on other bimetallic catalysts based on the extensive database of d-band center values for many bimetallic surfaces.
The binding energies of unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexene, typically follow the same trend as HBE. As shown in Figure 10b, DFT calculations reveal that the Pt3dPt(111) subsurface structures bond to cyclohexene more weakly than Pt(111) and the corresponding 3dPtPt(111) surface structures. For example, DFT results indicate that both cyclohexene and atomic hydrogen are more weakly bonded on PtNiPt(111) than on NiPtPt(111), Pt(111), and Ni(111), suggesting that the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure should be more effective for the low-temperature hydrogenation of cyclohexene than the other three surfaces. This has been confirmed experimentally by comparing the hydrogenation activity of cyclohexene on these four surfaces using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), as shown in Figure 11. (27) As illustrated in the TPD peak area of the cyclohexane product, the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure shows the highest hydrogenation yield, with the desorption peak centered at a very low temperature of 203 K. Similar Pt-terminated bimetallic surface structures can be produced by depositing one monolayer of Pt on a Ni(111) substrate, which also possesses the novel low-temperature pathway for cyclohexene hydrogenation. (53)
The trend in the DFT calculations in Figure 10b also shows that the binding energies of cyclohexene on PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) are even weaker than that on PtNiPt(111). Although this might suggest that the former two surfaces would be more active toward hydrogenation than PtNiPt(111); one should keep in mind that the adsorption of cyclohexene needs to be strong enough for the hydrogenation to take place. One would therefore expect to observe a volcano relationship for the hydrogenation activity as the d-band center moves further away from the Fermi level, i.e., when the adsorption of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur. This is verified experimentally in the results shown in Figure 11b. The hydrogenation yield from TPD measurements is the highest on PtNiPt(111) but starts to decrease on the PtCoPt(111) and PtFePt(111) surfaces, where the binding of cyclohexene becomes too weak for hydrogenation to occur. On the other side of the volcano curve, the binding energies of cyclohexene on the 3dPtPt(111) surfaces are too strong, preventing the effective hydrogenation of cyclohexene. (27)
Extension to Polycrystalline Ni/Pt Films
Polycrystalline bimetallic films provide a potential way to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts. As illustrated earlier in Figure 4, it is possible to assume that the surface chemistry of a bimetallic nanoparticle should be dominated primarily by the first few atomic layers. It is also reasonable to assume that the chemistry of the individual crystal facets on the nanoparticle (primarily (111) and (100) for an fcc nanoparticle) can be approximated by their respective single-crystal extension. (33) This is verified by studying cyclohexene hydrogenation on PtNiPt subsurface structures prepared on a polycrystalline Pt film consisting of mainly the (111) and (100) facets. (239) Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on a Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure. (33) Similar to the corresponding single-crystal surfaces, the subsurface PtNiPt polycrystalline structure shows significantly higher hydrogenation activity than that from the polycrystalline Pt and Ni surfaces. These results confirm the assumption that the trend observed on single-crystal bimetallic surfaces can be extended to the polycrystalline counterparts.
Reactor Evaluation of Supported Ni/Pt Catalysts
Supported monometallic Pt and bimetallic PtNi and PtCo catalysts have been synthesized on γ-Al2O3 using the incipient wetness method. (280, 303) Characterization of the catalysts by a variety of techniques, including EXAFS, confirms the formation of Pt3d bimetallic bonds. As shown earlier in Figure 5, the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is Pt-terminated and resembles the subsurface PtNiPt structure. The Pt-terminated configuration is also consistent with results by Sedlacek et al. that the surfaces of PtNi alloys are enriched in Pt when treated with H2, (304) as well as with findings reported by Arenas-Alatorre et al. for PtNi catalysts supported on SiO2 (305) and by Mu et al. for PtNi catalysts supported on graphite. (209) Because the Pt-terminated structure is thermodynamically stable in the presence of hydrogen (Figure 6), one would expect that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 catalyst should be very active for cyclohexene hydrogenation.
The supported catalysts were evaluated using both batch and flow reactors to determine the hydrogenation kinetics of cyclohexene at a low temperature of 303 K. The hydrogenation rate constants were determined to be 1.7, 21, and 24 min1 for Pt/γ-Al2O3, PtCo/γ-Al2O3, and PtNi/γ-Al2O3, respectively. (280) The trend observed in the rate constant for cyclohexene hydrogenation is consistent with that from the single-crystal surfaces for the same reaction, PtNiPt(111) > PtCoPt(111) > Pt(111), as shown earlier in the volcano curve in Figure 11b. The similar trend between DFT predictions on single-crystal surfaces, UHV experimental studies on single-crystal and polycrystalline model surfaces, and reactor evaluation over supported catalysts provides an important demonstration of designing bimetallic catalysts from combined theoretical and experimental approaches.
