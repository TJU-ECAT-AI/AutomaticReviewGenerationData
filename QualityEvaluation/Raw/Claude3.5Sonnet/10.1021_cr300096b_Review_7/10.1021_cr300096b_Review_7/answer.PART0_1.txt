[1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."

[2] "Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its relevance in industrial processes and its multiple reaction pathways. It is representative of cyclic hydrocarbons, which are important intermediates in refinery and petrochemical processes, as well as building blocks for many chemicals in the industry. The multiple competitive reaction pathways of cyclohexene, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation, and hydrogenation, allow researchers to compare these pathways and gain insights into how bimetallic bonds influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By studying these various pathways, researchers can better understand the effects of different catalyst compositions and structures on the hydrogenation process, which is crucial for optimizing industrial catalysts and processes.
