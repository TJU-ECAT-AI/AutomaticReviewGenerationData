[1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."

[2] "Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its relevance in industrial processes and its multiple reaction pathways. As a cyclic hydrocarbon, it represents important reaction intermediates in refinery and petrochemical processes, as well as building blocks for various chemicals in the industry.

The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation, and hydrogenation, allow researchers to conduct comparative studies. These studies provide valuable insights into how the formation of bimetallic bonds influences both hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By examining the relative rates and yields of these competing pathways on different bimetallic catalysts, researchers can understand how the electronic and structural properties of the catalyst surface affect the preferred reaction route and overall efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

This information is crucial for designing more effective and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation reactions, potentially leading to improved efficiency and product yields in various chemical manufacturing processes.
