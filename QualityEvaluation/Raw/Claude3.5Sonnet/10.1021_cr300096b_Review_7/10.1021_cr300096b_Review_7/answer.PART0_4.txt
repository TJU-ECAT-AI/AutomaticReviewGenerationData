[1] "Cyclohexene is used as a probe molecule to study hydrogenation because cyclic hydrocarbons are important reaction intermediates in many refinery and petrochemical processes, in addition to serving as building blocks for many chemicals produced in the chemical industry."

[2] "Furthermore, cyclohexene has several competitive reaction pathways, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation (self-hydrogenation), and hydrogenation. Comparative studies of these reaction pathways provide an opportunity to determine how the formation of bimetallic bonds affects the hydrogenation activity and selectivity."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions due to its significance in industrial processes and its multiple reaction pathways. It is an important intermediate in refinery and petrochemical processes, as well as a building block for many chemicals in the industry. The multiple competitive reaction pathways of cyclohexene, including decomposition, dehydrogenation, disproportionation, and hydrogenation, allow researchers to compare and analyze how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity. By studying these various pathways, scientists can gain insights into the effects of bimetallic bond formation on catalytic performance, which is crucial for optimizing industrial hydrogenation processes and developing more efficient catalysts.
