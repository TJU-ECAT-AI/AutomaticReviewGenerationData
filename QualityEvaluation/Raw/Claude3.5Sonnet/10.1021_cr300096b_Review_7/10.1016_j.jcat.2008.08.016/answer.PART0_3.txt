[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites. More importantly, the results in Fig. 3 clearly showed that the PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts were more active than Pt, in agreement with previous studies on single crystal surfaces"

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions for several reasons:

1. It is a simple model compound with a CC bond, allowing researchers to study CC bond hydrogenation activity.

2. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and disproportionation (self-hydrogenation).

3. These multiple pathways provide insights into the selectivity and activity of different catalysts.

4. Its behavior on bimetallic catalysts can be compared to results from previous studies on single crystal surfaces, bridging the gap between fundamental surface science and practical catalysts.

5. The relative rates of hydrogenation vs dehydrogenation/disproportionation can indicate how the bimetallic catalysts influence the balance between these competing reactions.

6. Differences in cyclohexene reactivity between catalysts (e.g., PtNi vs PtCo) can reveal how the choice of metals affects hydrogenation activity.

7. Comparing cyclohexene hydrogenation to benzene hydrogenation provides insight into how the catalysts perform differently for aliphatic vs aromatic compounds.

These multiple reaction pathways and comparisons allow researchers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity, which can inform the development and optimization of catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.
