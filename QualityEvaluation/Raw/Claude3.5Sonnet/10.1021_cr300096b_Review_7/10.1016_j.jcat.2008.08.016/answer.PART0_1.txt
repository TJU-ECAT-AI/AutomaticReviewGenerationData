[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It is a model hydrogenation reaction that can be used to test catalytic activity for C=C bond hydrogenation.

2. It allows for comparison between different catalysts, such as PtNi and PtCo bimetallic catalysts, in terms of their hydrogenation performance.

3. Cyclohexene can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and disproportionation (self-hydrogenation).

These multiple reaction pathways provide insights into:

1. The relative activities of different catalysts for C=C bond hydrogenation.

2. The selectivity of catalysts towards hydrogenation versus dehydrogenation.

3. The potential for side reactions like disproportionation.

4. The relationship between catalyst properties (e.g., number of active sites) and hydrogenation activity.

These insights can help in understanding how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes, potentially leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for various hydrogenation applications.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它是一种模型氢化反应，可用于测试C=C键氢化的催化活性。

2. 它允许比较不同催化剂（如PtNi和PtCo双金属催化剂）的氢化性能。

3. 环己烯可以经历多种反应途径，包括氢化成环己烷、脱氢成苯以及歧化（自氢化）。

这些多重反应途径提供了以下见解：

1. 不同催化剂对C=C键氢化的相对活性。

2. 催化剂对氢化与脱氢的选择性。

3. 发生副反应（如歧化）的可能性。

4. 催化剂性质（如活性位点数量）与氢化活性之间的关系。

这些见解有助于理解双金属催化剂如何影响工业过程中的氢化活性和选择性，有可能导致开发出更高效、更具选择性的催化剂，用于各种氢化应用。
