[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It is a model compound for CC bond hydrogenation, allowing researchers to test catalytic activity specifically for this type of reaction.

2. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and disproportionation (self-hydrogenation). This provides insights into the selectivity of different catalysts.

3. Its behavior on bimetallic catalysts can be compared to results from previous single crystal surface studies, bridging the gap between fundamental surface science and practical catalysts.

4. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide information about the nature of active sites on bimetallic catalysts. For example, the observation of benzene formation on PtNi and PtCo catalysts but not on Pt alone suggests that the bimetallic catalysts have unique properties that promote dehydrogenation.

5. Comparing cyclohexene hydrogenation rates to those of more challenging molecules like benzene can reveal how bimetallic catalysts affect the hydrogenation of different types of CC bonds.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can help researchers understand how bimetallic catalysts influence both activity and selectivity in industrial hydrogenation processes, potentially leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for a wide range of applications.

环己烯作为研究氢化反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它是CC键氢化的模型化合物，允许研究人员专门测试这类反应的催化活性。

2. 它可以经历多种反应途径，包括氢化成环己烷、脱氢成苯和歧化（自氢化）。这为不同催化剂的选择性提供了洞察。

3. 它在双金属催化剂上的行为可以与之前单晶表面研究的结果进行比较，架起了基础表面科学和实用催化剂之间的桥梁。

4. 环己烯的多重反应途径提供了有关双金属催化剂活性位点性质的信息。例如，在PtNi和PtCo催化剂上观察到苯的形成，但在单独的Pt上没有观察到，这表明双金属催化剂具有促进脱氢的独特性质。

5. 将环己烯的氢化速率与更具挑战性的分子（如苯）的氢化速率进行比较，可以揭示双金属催化剂如何影响不同类型CC键的氢化。

这些从环己烯反应中获得的见解可以帮助研究人员理解双金属催化剂如何影响工业氢化过程中的活性和选择性，可能导致开发出更高效和选择性的催化剂，适用于广泛的应用。
