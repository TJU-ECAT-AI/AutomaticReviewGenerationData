[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It is a model compound for C=C bond hydrogenation, allowing researchers to test catalytic activity specifically for this type of reaction.

2. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and disproportionation (self-hydrogenation).

3. These multiple pathways provide insights into both the activity and selectivity of catalysts, particularly bimetallic catalysts.

4. The relative rates of these competing reactions can reveal important information about the catalyst surface properties and active sites.

5. Its behavior on single crystal bimetallic surfaces has been previously studied, allowing for comparisons between model systems and practical supported catalysts.

6. The simplicity of cyclohexene compared to more complex industrial feedstocks makes it easier to analyze reaction products and mechanisms.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can help researchers understand how bimetallic catalysts influence hydrogenation activity and selectivity in industrial processes by:

1. Revealing synergistic effects between metals in bimetallic catalysts.
2. Showing how the addition of a second metal can alter reaction pathways and product distributions.
3. Providing a basis for comparing different bimetallic combinations and their effects on hydrogenation performance.
4. Helping to optimize catalyst compositions for specific industrial applications based on desired product selectivity.
5. Offering a way to study the relationship between catalyst structure (e.g., metal dispersion, alloy formation) and catalytic performance.
