[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It is a model hydrogenation reaction that has been used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, allowing for comparison with past studies.

2. It provides a simple test for catalytic activity of C=C bond hydrogenation, which is relevant to many industrial processes.

3. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and disproportionation (self-hydrogenation).

These multiple reaction pathways provide insights about bimetallic catalysts by:

1. Allowing comparison of hydrogenation activity between different catalysts (e.g. PtNi showed better performance than PtCo for cyclohexene hydrogenation).

2. Revealing differences in selectivity (e.g. PtNi and PtCo catalysts produced small amounts of benzene, while Pt did not).

3. Demonstrating how catalyst composition affects reaction mechanisms (e.g. bimetallic catalysts facilitated side reactions that monometallic Pt did not).

4. Correlating catalytic performance with physical properties like number of active sites (e.g. PtNi's better performance was consistent with higher H2 chemisorption).

These insights can help in designing more effective and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes by providing a deeper understanding of how bimetallic compositions influence reaction pathways and catalytic properties.

环己烯作为研究加氢反应的理想探针分子，原因如下：

1. 它是一种在单晶双金属表面上曾经使用过的模型加氢反应，可以与过去的研究进行比较。

2. 它为C=C键加氢的催化活性提供了一个简单的测试，这与许多工业过程相关。

3. 它可以经历多种反应途径，包括加氢生成环己烷、脱氢生成苯和歧化（自加氢）。

这些多重反应途径提供了关于双金属催化剂的洞察：

1. 允许比较不同催化剂之间的加氢活性（例如，PtNi在环己烯加氢方面表现优于PtCo）。

2. 揭示选择性的差异（例如，PtNi和PtCo催化剂产生少量苯，而Pt没有）。

3. 展示催化剂组成如何影响反应机理（例如，双金属催化剂促进了单金属Pt没有的副反应）。

4. 将催化性能与物理特性（如活性位点数量）相关联（例如，PtNi的更好性能与更高的H2化学吸附一致）。

这些见解可以帮助设计更有效和选择性的工业加氢过程催化剂，通过提供对双金属组成如何影响反应途径和催化特性的深入理解。
