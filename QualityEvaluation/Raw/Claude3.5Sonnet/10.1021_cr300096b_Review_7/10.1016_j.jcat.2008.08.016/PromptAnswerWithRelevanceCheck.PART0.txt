[1] "The hydrogenation of cyclohexene, a model hydrogenation reaction that was used previously on single crystal bimetallic surfaces, was performed in the current study to test the catalytic activity for CC bond hydrogenation."

[2] "It was found that the PtNi bimetallic catalyst showed better performance than PtCo. This was consistent with the H2 chemisorption results, which indicated that PtNi catalyst had more metallic active sites."

[3] "It should be noted that for the PtNi and PtCo supported catalysts, there was a small amount of benzene production observed (data not shown) at the start of the cyclohexene hydrogenation reaction followed by its slow disappearance. Benzene production was likely due to the dehydrogenation or disproportionation (i.e. self-hydrogenation) of cyclohexene in parallel with the hydrogenation reaction."

Cyclohexene serves as an ideal probe molecule for studying hydrogenation reactions because:

1. It is a model compound for CC bond hydrogenation, allowing researchers to test catalytic activity specifically for this type of reaction.

2. It can undergo multiple reaction pathways, including hydrogenation to cyclohexane, dehydrogenation to benzene, and disproportionation (self-hydrogenation). This provides insights into the selectivity of different catalysts.

3. Its behavior on bimetallic catalysts can be compared to results from previous single crystal surface studies, bridging the gap between fundamental surface science and practical catalysts.

4. The multiple reaction pathways of cyclohexene provide information about the nature of active sites on bimetallic catalysts. For example, the observation of benzene formation on PtNi and PtCo catalysts but not on Pt alone suggests that the bimetallic catalysts have unique properties that promote dehydrogenation.

5. Comparing cyclohexene hydrogenation rates to those of more challenging molecules like benzene can reveal how bimetallic catalysts affect the hydrogenation of different types of CC bonds.

These insights from cyclohexene reactions can help researchers understand how bimetallic catalysts influence both activity and selectivity in industrial hydrogenation processes, potentially leading to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for a wide range of applications.

These insights can help in designing more effective and selective catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes by providing a deeper understanding of how bimetallic compositions influence reaction pathways and catalytic properties.
