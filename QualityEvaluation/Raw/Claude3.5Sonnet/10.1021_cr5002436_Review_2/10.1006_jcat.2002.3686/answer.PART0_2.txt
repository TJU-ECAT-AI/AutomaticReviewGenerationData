The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight their current significance and research focus areas:

1. Key industrial application: Chromia/alumina catalysts are used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce propene and other light alkenes, which is of great industrial importance.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide
   b) Understanding the origin of catalytic activity
   c) Investigating deactivation mechanisms

3. Support materials: Alumina is mentioned as the primary support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

4. Industrial catalyst composition: Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts typically have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2.

5. Deactivation: Long-term industrial use under severe oxidizing and reducing conditions leads to catalyst deactivation through the formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina.

The document does not provide information on the evolution of these catalysts since 1933 or specific details about promoters and reaction mechanisms. However, it is clear that ongoing research is focused on understanding the fundamental aspects of these catalysts to improve their performance and longevity in industrial applications.
