[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great importance as an effective route for the production of propene and other light alkenes (14). Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially used for this process, and much recent research has been devoted to elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide (524)."

[2] "Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."

[3] "Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus:

Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially important for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce propene and other light alkenes. This is a major application area.

Recent research has focused on understanding the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide. Despite extensive studies, there is still no consensus on the origin of catalytic activity or deactivation mechanisms.

Key areas of research include:
1. Structure of the catalysts
2. Active sites
3. Deactivation mechanisms

Industrial catalysts typically have high chromium loading (about 15 atCr/nm2).

A significant challenge is the deactivation of these catalysts in industrial use over time, due to the formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina under cyclic oxidizing and reducing conditions.

The literature suggests ongoing research efforts to elucidate fundamental aspects of these catalysts, improve their performance, and address deactivation issues for industrial applications.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但是，它确实强调了它们当前的重要性和研究重点的一些关键方面：

铬/氧化铝催化剂在工业上对烷烃催化脱氢生产丙烯和其他轻烯烃非常重要。这是一个主要的应用领域。

近期研究集中在理解氧化铝负载的铬氧化物的结构。尽管进行了广泛的研究，但对催化活性的来源或失活机制仍然没有共识。

关键研究领域包括：
1. 催化剂的结构
2. 活性位点
3. 失活机制

工业催化剂通常具有高铬负载量（约15 atCr/nm2）。

一个重要的挑战是这些催化剂在工业使用中随时间推移而失活，这是由于在循环氧化和还原条件下形成铬-氧化铝固溶体。

文献表明，正在进行持续的研究努力，以阐明这些催化剂的基本方面，改善它们的性能，并解决工业应用中的失活问题。
