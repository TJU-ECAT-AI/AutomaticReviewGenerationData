[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great importance as an effective route for the production of propene and other light alkenes (14). Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially used for this process, and much recent research has been devoted to elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide (524)."

[2] "Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."

[3] "Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1)."

[4] "When used under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solutions of chromiaalumina (1, 3)."

The literature does not provide information on the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas:

Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially important for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly in the production of propene and other light alkenes. This represents a major application area for these catalysts.

Recent research has focused heavily on elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide. This indicates that understanding the catalyst structure is a key area of investigation.

There is ongoing debate and research regarding the origin of catalytic activity and deactivation mechanisms in these catalysts. This suggests that identifying active sites and understanding reaction mechanisms are important research focus areas.

Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts typically have high chromium loading (about 15 atCr/nm2). This indicates that optimizing catalyst composition is an important consideration.

Deactivation of these catalysts in industrial settings occurs through the formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina under cyclic oxidizing and reducing conditions. This highlights catalyst stability and deactivation as significant research topics.

While not explicitly mentioned, the focus on alumina as a support material suggests that support materials play an important role in these catalyst systems.

文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史演变信息。但是，它确实强调了它们当前重要性和研究重点领域的一些关键方面：

氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂在烷烃催化脱氢方面具有工业重要性，特别是在丙烯和其他轻烯烃的生产中。这代表了这些催化剂的一个主要应用领域。

近期研究主要集中在阐明氧化铝负载的氧化铬结构。这表明了解催化剂结构是一个关键的研究领域。

关于这些催化剂的催化活性起源和失活机理仍存在持续的争论和研究。这表明识别活性位点和理解反应机理是重要的研究重点领域。

工业用氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂通常具有高铬负载量（约15 atCr/nm2）。这表明优化催化剂组成是一个重要的考虑因素。

在工业环境中，这些催化剂在循环氧化和还原条件下通过形成氧化铬-氧化铝固溶体而失活。这突出了催化剂稳定性和失活是重要的研究主题。

虽然没有明确提及，但对氧化铝作为载体材料的关注表明载体材料在这些催化剂系统中起着重要作用。
