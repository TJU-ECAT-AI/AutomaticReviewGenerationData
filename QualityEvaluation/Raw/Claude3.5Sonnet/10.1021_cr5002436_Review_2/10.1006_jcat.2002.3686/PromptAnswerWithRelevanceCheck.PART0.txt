The literature does not provide information on the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas:

Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially important for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly in the production of propene and other light alkenes. This represents a major application area for these catalysts.

Recent research has focused heavily on elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide. This indicates that understanding the catalyst structure is a key area of investigation.

There is ongoing debate and research regarding the origin of catalytic activity and deactivation mechanisms in these catalysts. This suggests that identifying active sites and understanding reaction mechanisms are important research focus areas.

Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts typically have high chromium loading (about 15 atCr/nm2). This indicates that optimizing catalyst composition is an important consideration.

Deactivation of these catalysts in industrial settings occurs through the formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina under cyclic oxidizing and reducing conditions. This highlights catalyst stability and deactivation as significant research topics.

While not explicitly mentioned, the focus on alumina as a support material suggests that support materials play an important role in these catalyst systems.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it mentions that chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially used for alkane dehydrogenation processes. Recent research has focused on elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide. 

Key industrial applications include the production of propene and other light alkenes through catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes. 

Research focus areas include:
1. Structure of alumina-supported chromium oxide
2. Active sites (various Cr3+ species)
3. Support materials (different phases of alumina)
4. Deactivation mechanisms

The literature mentions that industrial catalysts typically have high chromium loading (about 15 atCr/nm2). A significant challenge is the irreversible deactivation of these catalysts under industrial operating conditions, which involves the formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina over years of use under cyclic oxidizing and reducing conditions.

Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially important for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly in the production of propene and other light alkenes. This indicates their significant role in petrochemical processes.

Recent research has focused on elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide, suggesting that understanding the catalyst structure is a key area of interest. Despite extensive research, there is still no consensus on the origin of catalytic activity or deactivation mechanisms, indicating these remain active areas of investigation.

Industrial applications use chromia/alumina catalysts with high chromium loading (about 15 atCr/nm2). This suggests that optimizing chromium content has been an important aspect of catalyst development.

A major challenge in industrial use is the deactivation of these catalysts over time, particularly under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions. The formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina is identified as a deactivation mechanism, indicating that understanding and mitigating deactivation processes is a significant research focus.

The literature also mentions studies on support materials (various forms of alumina), active sites (different types of Cr3+ species), and deactivation mechanisms, highlighting these as important areas of ongoing research in chromia/alumina catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
