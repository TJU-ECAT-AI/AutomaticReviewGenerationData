[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great importance as an effective route for the production of propene and other light alkenes (14). Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially used for this process, and much recent research has been devoted to elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide (524)."

[2] "Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."

[3] "Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1)."

[4] "When used under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solutions of chromiaalumina (1, 3)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas:

Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially important for the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly in the production of propene and other light alkenes. This indicates their significant role in petrochemical processes.

Recent research has focused on elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide, suggesting that understanding the catalyst structure is a key area of interest. Despite extensive research, there is still no consensus on the origin of catalytic activity or deactivation mechanisms, indicating these remain active areas of investigation.

Industrial applications use chromia/alumina catalysts with high chromium loading (about 15 atCr/nm2). This suggests that optimizing chromium content has been an important aspect of catalyst development.

A major challenge in industrial use is the deactivation of these catalysts over time, particularly under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions. The formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina is identified as a deactivation mechanism, indicating that understanding and mitigating deactivation processes is a significant research focus.

The literature also mentions studies on support materials (various forms of alumina), active sites (different types of Cr3+ species), and deactivation mechanisms, highlighting these as important areas of ongoing research in chromia/alumina catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实突出了它们当前的重要性和研究重点领域的一些关键方面：

氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂在烷烃催化脱氢方面具有工业重要性，特别是在生产丙烯和其他轻烯烃方面。这表明它们在石油化工过程中扮演着重要角色。

近期研究集中在阐明氧化铝负载的氧化铬结构，表明理解催化剂结构是一个关键的兴趣领域。尽管进行了广泛的研究，但对催化活性的来源或失活机理仍未达成共识，表明这些仍然是活跃的研究领域。

工业应用使用高铬负载量（约15 atCr/nm2）的氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂。这表明优化铬含量一直是催化剂开发的一个重要方面。

工业使用中的一个主要挑战是这些催化剂随时间推移而失活，特别是在严重的氧化和还原条件循环下。氧化铬-氧化铝固溶体的形成被确定为一种失活机制，表明理解和减轻失活过程是一个重要的研究重点。

文献还提到了对支撑材料（各种形式的氧化铝）、活性位点（不同类型的Cr3+物种）和失活机理的研究，突出了这些是脱氢过程中氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂正在进行的重要研究领域。
