[1] "Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2]. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [3,4]."

[2] "The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5,8]."

[3] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes from 2 to 10 nm as well as a high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) [26], and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used in industrial dehydrogenation processes since their discovery. Key developments and research areas include:

1. Industrial applications: Production of lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes.

2. Support materials: Evolution from traditional silica and alumina supports to novel mesoporous materials like MCM-41, which offers uniform pore sizes and high surface area.

3. Active sites and structure: Focus on understanding the role of chromium species, particularly the transition between Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (active form) and Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (less active form).

4. Reaction mechanisms: Elucidation of the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra, which plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.

5. Promoters: Use of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant to regenerate active Cr(VI) species and enhance catalyst performance.

6. Dispersion: Importance of appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support for optimal catalytic activity.

These advancements have contributed to improving the efficiency and selectivity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions, making them significant in both industrial applications and academic research.
