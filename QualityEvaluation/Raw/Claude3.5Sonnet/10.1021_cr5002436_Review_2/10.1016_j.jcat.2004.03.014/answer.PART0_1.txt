[1] "Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2]. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [3,4]."

[2] "The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5,8]."

[3] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes from 2 to 10 nm as well as a high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) [26], and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used in industrial dehydrogenation processes since their discovery. Key developments and research areas include:

1. Industrial applications: Production of lower alkenes (ethene, propene, isobutene) through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes.

2. Support materials: Evolution from traditional silica and alumina supports to more advanced materials like MCM-41, a mesoporous molecular sieve with high surface area and controllable pore sizes.

3. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active chromium species, particularly the transition between Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination (active monochromate species) and Cr(III) in octahedral coordination (less active polychromate species).

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have revealed the importance of the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra in the dehydrogenation process, with carbon dioxide playing a role in reoxidizing the reduced chromium species.

5. Catalyst properties: Emphasis on the reduction-oxidation properties of chromium species and their appropriate dispersion on the support material.

These developments have contributed to improving the efficiency and understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, leading to their continued significance in industrial applications and academic research.
