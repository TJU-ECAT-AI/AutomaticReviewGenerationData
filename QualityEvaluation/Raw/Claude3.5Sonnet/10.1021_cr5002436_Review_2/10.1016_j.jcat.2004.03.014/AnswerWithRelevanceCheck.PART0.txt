          [1] "Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2]. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [3,4]."

[2] "The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5,8]."

[3] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes from 2 to 10 nm as well as a high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) [26], and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

[6] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [511] or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [12,13]."

[7] "Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane [1618], propane [1924], and isobutane [25] over supported chromium oxide."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key developments and research focus areas include:

1. Industrial applications: These catalysts are widely used for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. They have also been investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen.

2. Support materials: Initially, silica and alumina were used as supports. More recently, mesoporous molecular sieves like MCM-41 have been explored as promising supports due to their uniform pore structure, controllable pore sizes (2-10 nm), and high surface area (ca. 1000 m2/g).

3. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active chromium species. Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination forms the active monochromate species, which reduces to less active Cr(III) in octahedral coordination during reactions.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has been identified as crucial in dehydrogenation processes. This cycle can be maintained using carbon dioxide as an oxidizing agent.

5. Promoters and dispersion: The appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support has been recognized as important for catalytic performance. Carbon dioxide has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and isobutane over supported chromium oxide.

These developments have contributed to improving the efficiency, selectivity, and understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, making them significant in both industrial applications and academic research.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经有了显著的发展。主要进展和研究重点领域包括：

1. 工业应用：这些催化剂广泛用于通过相应烷烃的脱氢生产乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低碳烯烃。它们还被研究用于低碳烷烃的氧化脱氢和其他有机化合物与氧气的氧化。

2. 载体材料：最初使用二氧化硅和氧化铝作为载体。最近，由于介孔分子筛如MCM-41具有均匀的孔结构、可控的孔径（2-10 nm）和高比表面积（约1000 m2/g），被探索作为有前景的载体。

3. 活性位点和结构：研究重点是了解活性铬物种的性质。四面体配位的Cr(VI)形成活性单铬酸盐物种，在反应过程中还原为活性较低的八面体配位Cr(III)。

4. 反应机理：Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的还原-氧化循环被认定为脱氢过程的关键。这个循环可以使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂来维持。

5. 助剂和分散性：铬物种在载体上的适当分散被认为对催化性能很重要。研究发现，二氧化碳可以增强负载型铬氧化物对乙烷、丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢作用。

这些发展有助于提高铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的效率、选择性和理解，使它们在工业应用和学术研究中都具有重要意义。
