[1] "Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2]. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [3,4]."

[2] "The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5,8]."

[3] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes from 2 to 10 nm as well as a high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) [26], and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: They are widely used for producing lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes.

2. Support materials: Research has focused on silica and alumina supports, with recent interest in mesoporous materials like MCM-41, which offers high surface area and controllable pore sizes.

3. Active sites and structure: Studies have revealed the importance of chromium species dispersion on supports. The active sites are identified as Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination, which reduce to less active Cr(III) in octahedral coordination during reactions.

4. Reaction mechanisms: A redox cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has been identified as crucial in dehydrogenation processes, particularly with carbon dioxide as an oxidant.

5. Promoters: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, research on promoters likely plays a role in enhancing catalyst performance.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, with ongoing research focusing on improving their efficiency and understanding their fundamental mechanisms.

自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变。主要发展包括：

1. 工业应用：它们被广泛用于通过相应烷烃的脱氢生产低级烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯。

2. 载体材料：研究重点集中在硅和氧化铝载体上，近期对MCM-41等介孔材料的兴趣增加，因为它提供了高比表面积和可控的孔径。

3. 活性位点和结构：研究揭示了铬物种在载体上分散的重要性。活性位点被确定为四配位的Cr(VI)，在反应过程中还原为活性较低的八配位Cr(III)。

4. 反应机理：Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的氧化还原循环被确定为脱氢过程中的关键，特别是在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时。

5. 助剂：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但对助剂的研究可能在提高催化剂性能方面发挥作用。

这些发展使氧化铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中持续具有重要意义，正在进行的研究集中于提高它们的效率和理解其基本机理。
