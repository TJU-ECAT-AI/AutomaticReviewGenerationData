[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes"

[2] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [511] or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [12,13]."

[3] "Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane [1618], propane [1924], and isobutane [25] over supported chromium oxide."

[4] "The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5,8]."

[5] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: Production of lower alkenes (ethene, propene, isobutene) through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes using silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Structure: Studies on tetrahedral Cr(VI) and octahedral Cr(III) species.
   b) Active sites: Identification of monochromate species as more active than polychromate species.
   c) Support materials: Investigation of silica, alumina, and mesoporous materials like MCM-41.
   d) Reaction mechanisms: Understanding the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

3. Expanded applications: Oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen.

4. Use of carbon dioxide: Enhancement of dehydrogenation reactions for ethane, propane, and isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts.

5. Importance of chromium species dispersion on support materials for catalytic performance.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, with ongoing research focusing on improving their activity, selectivity, and stability.
