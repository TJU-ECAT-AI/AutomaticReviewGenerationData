[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."

[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [39], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10]"

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant"

[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [1525]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. Chromium oxides supported on silica and alumina have been industrially used for dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene.

2. Research has expanded to investigate Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and oxidation of other organic compounds using oxygen.

3. More recently, there has been growing interest in using CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation reactions with Cr-based catalysts. CO2 can act as a mild oxidant and has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene.

4. Key areas of focus in current research include understanding the role of CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions and elucidating the reaction mechanisms involved.

The literature does not provide specific information on the evolution of catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, or promoters over time. However, it is clear that research has progressed from simple dehydrogenation to oxidative dehydrogenation, with a current emphasis on CO2-assisted dehydrogenation processes using chromium-based catalysts.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但它确实突出了一些关键发展和应用：

1. 以二氧化硅和氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物已被工业用于烷烃脱氢生产乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低级烯烃。

2. 研究已扩展到探索铬基催化剂在低级烷烃的氧化脱氢以及使用氧气氧化其他有机化合物方面的应用。

3. 最近，使用CO2作为脱氢反应的共进料气体引起了越来越多的兴趣。CO2可以作为温和的氧化剂，并被发现能增强低级烷烃和乙苯的脱氢反应。

4. 当前研究的重点领域包括理解CO2在脱氢反应中的作用，以及阐明所涉及的反应机理。

文献没有提供关于催化剂结构、活性位点、载体材料或促进剂随时间演变的具体信息。然而，很明显研究已经从简单的脱氢进展到氧化脱氢，目前重点是使用铬基催化剂的CO2辅助脱氢过程。
