The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. Industrial use: Chromium oxides supported on silica and alumina are used industrially to produce lower alkenes (ethene, propene, isobutene) through dehydrogenation of alkanes.

2. Research focus areas:
- Oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes
- Oxidation of organic compounds with oxygen
- Use of CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation

3. Recent developments: CO2 has gained attention as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation processes. It has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The literature mentions ongoing discussions about the role of CO2 in dehydrogenation and the reaction mechanism, indicating this as an active area of research.

The document does not provide specific information on the evolution of catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, or promoters over time.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了一些关键的发展和应用：

1. 工业应用：以二氧化硅和氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物在工业上用于通过烷烃脱氢生产低级烯烃（乙烯、丙烯、异丁烯）。

2. 研究重点领域：
- 低级烷烃的氧化脱氢
- 有机化合物的氧气氧化
- 使用CO2作为脱氢反应的共进料气体

3. 近期发展：CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂在脱氢过程中受到关注。研究发现，它可以增强铬基催化剂上低级烷烃和乙苯的脱氢反应。

4. 反应机理：文献提到关于CO2在脱氢中的作用和反应机理的讨论仍在进行，表明这是一个活跃的研究领域。

该文档未提供关于催化剂结构、活性位点、载体材料或助剂随时间演变的具体信息。
