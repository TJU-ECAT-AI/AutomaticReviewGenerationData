The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. Industrial use: Chromium oxides supported on silica and alumina are used industrially for dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene.

2. Research focus: Studies have explored oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and oxidation of other organic compounds using Cr-based catalysts with oxygen.

3. Recent developments: CO2 has gained attention as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation reactions. It acts as a mild oxidant and has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts.

The document does not provide specific information on catalyst structure, active sites, promoters, or detailed reaction mechanisms. It also does not mention the original discovery date of 1933 or trace the full evolution of these catalysts over time.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但是，它确实突出了一些关键的发展和应用：

1. 工业应用：负载在二氧化硅和氧化铝上的铬氧化物在工业上用于烷烃脱氢生产低级烯烃，如乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯。

2. 研究重点：研究探索了使用基于铬的催化剂和氧气进行低级烷烃的氧化脱氢以及其他有机化合物的氧化。

3. 最新发展：二氧化碳作为脱氢反应的共进料气体受到关注。它作为温和的氧化剂，被发现可以增强基于铬的催化剂上低级烷烃和乙苯的脱氢。

该文档未提供关于催化剂结构、活性位点、促进剂或详细反应机理的具体信息。它也没有提到1933年的原始发现日期，或追溯这些催化剂随时间的完整演变过程。
