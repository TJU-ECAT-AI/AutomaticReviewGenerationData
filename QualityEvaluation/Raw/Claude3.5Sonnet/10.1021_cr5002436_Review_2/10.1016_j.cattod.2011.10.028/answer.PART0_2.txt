The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

Chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica and alumina have been industrially used for the production of lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of alkanes.

Research has expanded to investigate Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and oxidation of other organic compounds using oxygen.

More recently, there has been interest in using CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation reactions with Cr-based catalysts. CO2 can act as a mild oxidant and has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene.

The literature mentions research into the reaction mechanisms and the role of CO2 in these processes, indicating ongoing investigation into fundamental aspects of these catalysts.

Key focus areas appear to include support materials (silica and alumina mentioned), oxidation states of chromium, and the use of different oxidants (oxygen, CO2) to enhance reactions.

这篇文献并未提供自1933年发现铬氧化物基催化剂以来的全面历史，但确实突出了一些关键发展和应用:

以二氧化硅和氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物催化剂已在工业上用于通过烷烃脱氢生产乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低级烯烃。

研究已扩展到使用氧气对低级烷烃进行氧化脱氢以及其他有机化合物的氧化反应的铬基催化剂。

最近，人们对使用二氧化碳作为脱氢反应的共进料气体产生了兴趣。二氧化碳可以作为温和的氧化剂，并被发现可以增强低级烷烃和乙苯的脱氢反应。

文献提到了对这些过程中的反应机理和二氧化碳作用的研究，表明对这些催化剂的基本方面正在进行持续的调查。

关键研究领域似乎包括载体材料(提到了二氧化硅和氧化铝)、铬的氧化态，以及使用不同氧化剂(氧气、二氧化碳)来增强反应。
