[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."

[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [39], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10]"

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant"

[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [1525]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. Chromium oxides supported on silica and alumina have been industrially used for dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene.

2. Research has expanded to investigate Cr-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and oxidation of other organic compounds using oxygen.

3. More recently, there has been growing interest in using CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation reactions with Cr-based catalysts. CO2 can act as a mild oxidant and has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene.

4. Key areas of focus in current research include understanding the role of CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions and elucidating the reaction mechanisms involved.

The literature does not provide specific information on the evolution of catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, or promoters over time. However, it is clear that research has progressed from simple dehydrogenation to oxidative dehydrogenation, with a current emphasis on CO2-assisted dehydrogenation processes using chromium-based catalysts.
