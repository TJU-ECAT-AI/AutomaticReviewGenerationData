The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

Chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica and alumina have been industrially used for dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene. 

Research has expanded to investigate these catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and oxidation of other organic compounds using oxygen.

More recently, there has been interest in using CO2 as a co-feed gas and mild oxidant with chromium-based catalysts. Studies have found that CO2 can enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over these catalysts.

Key areas of focus appear to be the role of different supports (silica vs alumina), the oxidation state and structure of chromium species, and reaction mechanisms, particularly with the addition of CO2. However, the literature does not provide details on the evolution of understanding around active sites, promoters, or specific structural insights over time.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但是,它确实强调了一些关键的发展和应用:

以二氧化硅和氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物催化剂已在工业上用于烷烃脱氢生产乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低级烯烃。

研究已扩展到使用这些催化剂进行低级烷烃的氧化脱氢以及使用氧气对其他有机化合物的氧化。

最近,人们对使用CO2作为共进料气体和温和氧化剂与铬基催化剂结合使用产生了兴趣。研究发现,CO2可以增强这些催化剂对低级烷烃和乙苯的脱氢作用。

关注的主要领域似乎是不同载体(二氧化硅与氧化铝)的作用、铬物种的氧化态和结构,以及反应机理,特别是在添加CO2的情况下。然而,该文献并未提供关于活性位点、助剂或随时间推移的具体结构见解的理解演变的详细信息。
