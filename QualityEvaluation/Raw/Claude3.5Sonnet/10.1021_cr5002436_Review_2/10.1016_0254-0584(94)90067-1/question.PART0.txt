Abstract 
The effects 
of the kind and amount 
of certain 
lanthanide 
oxides (Ln=La, 
Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) on the structure 
and thermal 
stability 
of transition 
aluminas 
have been 
investigated. 
Lanthanide 
oxide addition 
has been 
found 
to retard 
the transformation 
of y-Alz03 
to LY-AIO 
and the associated 
sintering. 
The presence 
of lanthanide 
aluminate 
with the perovskite-type 
structure 
is responsible 
for the thermal stabilization 
of transition 
alumina. 
Introduction 
The current 
catalytic 
converter 
controlling 
automobile 
exhaust 
emission 
contains 
noble 
metals such as Pt, Pd 
and Rh, finely dispersed on a high-surface-area 
support, 
usually r-A&O, [l]. The major mechanisms 
of dete- 
rioration of automobile 
exhaust catalysts are thermal 
damage due to exposure of the catalyst to a very high 
temperature, 
poisoning by contaminants 
(such as lead, 
phosphorus 
and zinc) in the exhaust, and mechanical 
damage of the catalyst support [2]. In this application 
the operating temperature 
is below 1000 C, and usually 
below 800 C. Recently, catalytic combustion has been 
tested intensively for application in gas turbines, whose 
major purpose is to minimize the formation of nitrogen 
oxides [l, 31. In this application, 
the operating 
tem- 
perature 
will be above 1000 C and possibly higher 
than 1200 C. 
One of the most important 
problems related to the 
use of these catalysts is the decrease in their activity 
after thermal exposure to the exhaust gas [3]. It is well 
known that thermal deactivation 
is directly related to 
the sintering of active components. 
Alumina may exist 
in several forms, depending 
on the temperature, 
the 
kind of raw materials used and the processing (especially 
thermal) conditions 
[4]. 
A serious drawback to the use of these solids as 
catalyst carriers is the transformation 
of the transition 
aluminas into a-phase (corundum), 
which takes place 
above 900 C, a temperature 
that can be reached in 
a catalytic converter 
[5]. Consequently, 
it is necessary 
to stabilize the transition aluminas at high temperature 
(1250-1300 C) in order to improve the durability of 
the catalyst. One of the most interesting stabilization 
methods consists of adding a small amount of an alien 
oxide, such as alkaline-earth metal [6-91, zirconium [7], 
silicon [8, lo] or rare earth metal [ll-181 
oxides, to 
alumina. According to Nortier and Soustelle [19], the 
stabilization 
of alumina is more effective when the 
added cation is larger in size or more charged. Matsuda 
et al. [15] reported that the mixing of lanthanum oxide 
with alumina brought about a large surface area at 
elevated temperature. 
The authors attributed 
the sta- 
bilization effect to the formation of the La-P-alumina 
structure with the composition La,O, .l lAl,O,. Schaper 
et al. [13, 141 showed that the addition of La,O, 
to 
Al,O, 
leads to an increase 
in the temperature 
of 
transition 
from r-Al,O, 
to c-A&.0,. These 
authors 
attributed 
the stabilization 
effect to the formation 
of 
a lanthanum aluminate surface layer. Oudet et al. [16, 
171 obtained results indicating that the stabilization of 
alumina by lanthanum 
occurred 
owing to nucleation 
of a cubic lanthanum 
aluminate 
with a perovskite 
structure on the surface of the alumina, inhibiting the 
surface diffusion of the species responsible for sintering. 
Recently Beguin et al. [18] showed that the retardation 
of the sintering is caused by the formation 
of micro- 
domains of lanthanum aluminate on the alumina surface. 
The authors concluded that lanthanum 
ions must be 
present at a sufficiently high concentration 
to ensure 
complete lanthanum aluminate formation from the more 
reactive surface aluminum ions. 
Thus it appears from various studies that the origin 
of the stabilizing effect is not well documented, 
since

either the lanthanum+-Al,O, 
phase or LaAIO, could 
be responsible 
for inhibiting the transformation 
of y- 
Al,O, to (Y-AI,O,. 
A detailed 
investigation 
of the changes in surface 
and physicochemical 
properties 
of alumina as a result 
of addition of lanthanide oxide is the aim of this work. 
Experimental 
Preparation 
The alumina used in this study was prepared 
after 
the method of Medema [20] by hydrolysis of alumina 
isopropoxide. Prior to the experiment, the isopropoxide 
was distilled and the molten product was dissolved in 
dry chloroform. 
The amount of aluminum in the pre- 
pared solution was determined 
gravimetrically 
using 8- 
hydroxyquinoline. 
The 
aluminum 
isopropoxide, 
dis- 
solved in chloroform, 
was next subjected to hydrolysis 
(with distilled water) at 333 K. In order to convert 
into boehmite the small quantity of bayerite that might 
have been formed during the hydrolysis, the suspension 
was aged at room temperature 
for one week. The 
resulting precipitate was washed thoroughly with water, 
filtered, washed with &propanol 
and distilled water 
and dried at 383 K for 12 h. Its composition, 
as 
determined gravimetrically, corresponded 
to the formula 
A1,03.2.86H20, 
and the X-ray pattern 
showed the 
diffraction lines of a poorly developed crystalline phase 
of boehmite. 
The sample was then divided into four 
parts and annealed 
for 6 h in air at 500, 800, 1000 
and 1200 C, respectively. 
Al,O,-Ln,O, 
systems (where Ln=La,Ce, 
Pr, Nd, 
Sm) containing up to 15 wt.% of modifying oxide were 
prepared by two different methods: coprecipitation 
(N) 
and impregnation 
(N*). 
In the case of the former method, an ethanol solution 
of an appropriate 
lanthanide(II1) 
nitrate and a chlo- 
roform solution of aluminum isopropoxide 
were used 
as the parent materials. 
All reactants used were analytical reagent grade, and 
the trace amounts of water were removed directly from 
the solvents before their use. 
Homogeneous 
mixtures of the parent materials with 
an appropriate 
stoichiometry 
were subjected 
to hy- 
drolysis at 333 K with the pH value 
maintained 
between 7.0 and 7.5 with the help of ammonia water 
(2% w/w). The obtained solution with a precipitate was 
aged at this temperature, 
for one week. The resulting 
precipitate 
was filtered, washed (with chloroform 
and 
distilled water) and dried at 383 K for 12 h. Finally, 
samples were obtained by annealing the material for 
6 h in air at a temperature 
between 500 and 1200 C. 
For the impregnation 
technique, 
pure alumina pre- 
pared by the above-described 
method was made into 
a slurry in an appropriate 
lanthanide(II1) 
nitrate dis- 
solved in ethanol, followed by evaporation 
to dryness. 
By changing the concentration 
of the lanthanide(II1) 
nitrate, samples with various lanthanide contents were 
obtained. 
The samples were then dried at 383 K for 
12 h and finally annealed for 6 h in air at a temperature 
between 500 and 1200 C. 
All samples were ground in a mortar after annealing 
and sieved to collect the 0.1-0.315 mm fraction. 
The lanthanide content of the prepared samples was 
determined 
chelatometrically 
by titration with EDTA, 
that of aluminum, gravimetrically as the 8-hydroxyqui- 
noline complex. 
X-ray difiaction 
(XRD) analysis 
X-ray analysis was performed on a Drezno (Germany) 
TUR-M-61 diffractometer 
with an HZG-3 goniometer, 
using Cu Ka radiation. Spectrally pure NaCl was em- 
ployed as an internal 
standard. 
The patterns 
were 
recorded for 10<28<50 
with a scan rate of 1 min- 
and a chart speed of 1 cm min-. 
Diffraction 
analysis of all samples was performed 
under the same conditions. 
The identification of various transition aluminas pres- 
ent in samples prepared under different conditions was 
performed 
by comparing the XRD spectra of samples 
with the data given by Lippens and Steggerda [4]. The 
lines chosen as characteristic 
of the rare-earth 
alu- 
minates were taken from the paper by Geller and Bala 
WI* 
Surface area determination 
The surface areas of the samples were determined 
by the BET method from nitrogen adsorption isotherms 
measured at liquid nitrogen temperature, 
using a Sar- 
torius Gravimat microthermobalance 
(model 4133). 
Thermal analysis 
Thermogravimetric 
(TGA) and differential 
thermal 
(DTA) analyses were conducted using a Shimadzu TGA- 
50(H)/A 50 thermoanalytic 
network system. For mea- 
surements 
of the differential 
thermal 
electromotive 
force, a-alumina 
was used as a reference 
material. 
Specimens weighing about 20 mg were heated at a rate 
of 5 C min-  in air under atmospheric 
pressure. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
Powdered samples for examination by high-resolution 
TEM were prepared by grinding samples and suspending 
the powder in hexane. A drop of the suspension was 
then placed on a 4 nm carbon film mounted on a 1000 
mesh Cu grid, and the hexane was allowed to evaporate. 
TEM analysis was performed 
on a JEOL JEM 7A 
electron microscope operated at 80 kV. The specimens 
were viewed at a magnification of 40 000X.

The results of XRD examination of selected samples 
(containing 
10 wt.% of Ln,O,) 
subjected to thermal 
treatment 
at 500, 800, 1000 and 1200 C in air for 6 
h, obtained via the coprecipitation 
method, are shown 
in Figs. l-3. The changes in the XRD patterns 
of 
alumina containing praseodymium, 
neodymium and sa- 
marium are illustrated in Fig. 4, using samples calcined 
at 1000 and 1200 C as examples. The diffraction patterns 
of pure A&O, (Fig. 1) after thermal aging at a tem- 
perature between 500 and 1200 C show a gradual shift 
in the phase composition 
from r-Al,O, 
at 500 C, to 
&Al,O, at 800 C, to 8-Al,O, at 1000 C and finally 
a-Al,O, at 1200 C. 
The introduction 
of a lanthanide 
component 
leads 
to a decrease in the intensity of the reflections due to 
the r-Al,O, 
phase when compared with the standard 
sample (N-500). In diffraction patterns of samples with 
higher lanthanide 
concentrations 
(starting 
from the 
diffraction pattern of the N-Ln-3 sample), in addition 
to the main reflections 
originating from the r-A&O, 
phase, other reflections 
corresponding 
to the phases 
of lanthanide oxides (Ln=La, 
Pr, Nd or Sm) were also 
observed. 
Increasing the calcination temperature 
up to 800 C 
(Fig. 2, N-La-800) leads to the appearance of reflections

attributed 
to the &Al,O, 
phase (in addition 
to the 
ones ascribed to the r-A&O, phase) and new reflections, 
indicating the formation 
of a new phase. The number 
and intensities 
of the new reflections 
increase with 
increasing lanthanide 
concentration. 
A comparison of 
these diffraction patterns with literature data [21] proves 
the presence 
of LnAlO, phases with the perovskite- 
type structure. 
The diffraction pattern of the standard sample (Fig. 
1, N-1000), after calcination 
at 1000 C, reveals only 
the B-A&O3 phase. In this temperature 
series, even a 
small amount of lanthanide admixture changes the shape 
of the diffraction 
pattern 
compared with that of the 
standard sample (N-1000). In addition to the reflections 
originating from 6 and &4120, phases, we could also 
detect 
reflections 
related 
to the perovskite 
phase 
LnA103. An increase in the lanthanide 
concentration 
in this temperature 
series (1000 C) leads to an increase 
in the intensity of the LnA103 phase. Comparison of 
the XRD patterns 
after treatment 
at 1200 C shows 
that the admixed samples have a transformation

structure 
S-A&O,, whereas the pure alumina is com- 
pletely transformed 
into a-A1,03 
(corundum). 
This 
indicates that an admixture of a lanthanide inhibits the 
phase transformation 
of r-Al,O,. 
It is worth adding 
that samples admixed with rare-earth-element 
oxides 
(such as La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) show the same 
sequence of alumina phase transformations, 
irrespective 
of their calcination temperature. 
It was observed that 
the intensities of the reflections characteristic of a given 
perovskite 
phase (LnAlO,) 
decrease 
with increasing 
atomic number of the lanthanide 
used (cf. Figs. 2, 3 
and 4). This probably results from the fact that the 
formation 
temperature 
of the perovskite-type 
phase 
increases with increasing atomic number of the lan- 
thanide [22]. 
It has been reported 
that La-P-A1203 rare-earth 
aluminate with the @-A1203 structure 
is formed via 
LnAlO, 
at a temperature 
higher than 1400 C by 
calcination of a Ln,O,-A&O, 
mixture for 24 h [23, 241. 
Only in the diffraction 
patterns 
of samples obtained 
via coprecipitation 
and annealed 
at 1200 C did we 
observe reflections that may be ascribed to the presence

of Ln-p-A&O, 
phases. The peaks assigned to Ln-p- 
Al,O, are rather weak, broad and blurred, indicating 
that crystal growth has proceeded 
to a small extent. 
The formation of Ln+Al,O, 
at a lower temperature 
( 
i.e., 1200 C) for 6 h in the present study may be 
caused by the different preparation 
method applied in 
this work (coprecipitation), 
as opposed to the mixing 
of two oxides used in other reports [lo, 141. 
The changes in the diffraction spectra of the samples 
containing 
cerium are slightly different, 
as shown in 
Fig. 3. In contrast to the above-described 
series, the 
diffraction patterns in this case did not show the presence 
of the perovskite-type 
phase of CeAlO,. The diffraction 
patterns of these samples after their calcination at 500, 
800, 1000 and 1200 C revealed 
only reflections 
due 
to the CeO, phase or to transient phases of alumina. 
The latter are fewer in number and weaker in intensity 
when compared with the samples containing lanthanum, 
praseodymium, neodymium or samarium. This indicates 
that a cerium admixture 
also leads to thermal stabi- 
lization of transition 
alumina. 
For the sake of comparison we prepared samples in 
which the precursor sources of lanthanide and aluminum 
were taken in a molar ratio of 1:l. The diffraction

patterns of these samples after their calcination at 800, 
1000 and 1200 C contained reflections from the phases 
of a given perovskite LnAlO, and reflections belonging 
to phases of oxide substrates. 
With increasing 
tem- 
perature 
of annealing, the number and intensities of 
the reflections 
attributed 
to the phases of oxide sub- 
strates decrease. 
According 
to reports 
[25, 261, the 
presence of the residues may be a consequence 
of the 
parent materials not being homogeneous 
enough, the 
calcination time not long enough, and the temperature 
of sintering not high enough. As revealed by chemical 
analysis (consisting of extraction 
of unreacted 
rare- 
earth-element 
oxides with ammonium acetate solution 
and weighing) as well as by XRD examination, 
there 
was about 95% formation 
of the perovskite 
phase in 
this temperature 
range. In the case of the sample 
containing cerium in a molar ratio Ce:Al= 1:l (similar 
to that of the case of samples containing lower amounts 
of cerium), the formation 
of CeAlO, phase was not 
observed. The above sample subjected to the thermal 
treatment 
at 600 C for 2 h in a hydrogen atmosphere 
reveals only reflections characteristic of CeAlO,. Chem- 
ical and magnetic investigations 
revealed 
that under 
the synthesis conditions applied some of the Ce3+ ions

a decrease 
in the yield of the perovskite-type 
phase 
P71. 
A comparison of the X-ray analysis data shows that 
the reflections 
of the LnAlO, phases have higher in- 
tensities and better 
resolution 
in spectra of samples 
prepared by the coprecipitation 
method than in spectra 
of samples obtained 
by impregnation. 
The observed 
differences are a consequence 
of the different degrees 
of homogeneity 
of the parent materials produced 
by 
the different methods 
[26]. Moreover, 
in each series, 
alumina peaks broadened with increasing Ln,O, loading, 
i.e., Ln,O, 
seemed to reduce 
the size of the A&O, 
crystallites. 
Further investigation was aimed at determining 
the 
specific surface 
areas. The variation 
of the specific 
surface area with calcination 
temperature 
for repre- 
sentative samples containing lanthanum and cerium is 
illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. The general character 
of 
the curves is similar in all cases. It should be emphasized 
that admixed samples maintain the highest surface area 
in the range 500-1000 C and keep a relatively high 
specific surface area even after calcination 
at 1200 C, 
although the surface area of the pure alumina dete- 
riorates rapidly on calcination at the same temperature.

oxide introduced 
into alumina 
is shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the 
addition of lanthanum leads to nonmonotonic 
changes 
in the surface area. For all series of samples (with the 
exception of those containing cerium), the surface area 
increases with increasing lanthanide content and reaches 
a maximum at about 3 wt.% Ln,O, (Ln =La, Pr, Nd 
and Sm). In the case of samples admixed with cerium 
(Fig@, two characteristic 
concentrations 
may be dis- 
tinguished - one is about 1 wt.% CeO, and the other 
is about 4 wt.% CeO,. Thus it has been shown that 
the addition of only a small amount of Ln,O, into the 
alumina markedly increases its thermal stability. The 
results of the studies performed 
so far cannot provide 
an explanation of the two maxima seen in Fig. 8. 
The data shown in Figs. 7 and 8 indicate that samples 
prepared 
by means of coprecipitation 
(N) have higher 
surface areas than those obtained by impregnation (N*). 
Figure 9 illustrates the dependence 
of the surface 
area on the elements for the samples of Ln,O,-A&O, 
containing 3 wt.% of Ln,O,. Relatively small differences 
in the surface area, as the atomic number increases 
on going from lanthanum to samarium, may result from 
the great similarity in the chemical properties 
of all 
rare-earth 
elements. 
In order to investigate the phase changes, the samples 
dried at 383 K (noncalcined) 
were subjected to ther- 
mogravimetric 
measurements. 
Figure 10 presents ex- 
amples of DTA curves obtained 
for the samples of 
pure and lanthanum-doped 
alumina. All samples display 
three endothermic 
peaks, with minima at 100, 300 and 
400 C. The first peak is related to the elimination of 
adsorbed water; the second and third are a result of 
dehydroxylation 
of hydrated 
alumina 
[28]. A small 
exothermic peak at 1252 or at 1388 C, for pure and 
lanthanum-doped 
alumina, respectively, is assigned to 
the O--+(Y 
transition. It may be noted that the intensity 
of this peak increases with increasing lanthanum con- 
centration. The large difference (136 C) in the transition 
temperature 
between 
samples of pure alumina and 
those containing 
lanthanum 
leads to the conclusion 
that in the presence of lanthanide the solid-state trans- 
formation of alumina is retarded. Although X-ray dif- 
fraction results clearly indicate the presence of LnAlO, 
perovskite 
phase, the formation 
of the perovskite 
is 
probably too slow to be detected 
by DTA. 
Transmission 
electron microscopy was used to com- 
pare the evolution 
of doped and undoped 
aluminas 
after thermal aging at temperatures 
between 500 and 
1200 C in air. The electron 
micrographs 
of some 
representative 
samples are given in Fig. 11 (sample 
designations as in Table 1). Sample N-800 (Fig. 11(a)) 
presents agglomerated crystallites, with the predominant 
grain size being approximately 
2WOO 
nm (diameter).

(d) N-3-b-

(e) N-3-Ce-800; 
(f) N-3-Ce-1200. 
As the temperature 
of aging is elevated, 
a gradual 
increase in the number of nearly spherical particles of 
smaller size (about 120 nm in diameter) 
is observed. 
Sample N-1200 (Fig. 11(b)) contains nearly spherical 
particles in contact with the neck formed between two 
neighboring 
particles, 
which is characteristic 
of the 
initial stage of sintering. As is seen from Fig. 11(c), 
(d), (e) and (f), th e addition 
of lanthanide 
to the 
alumina modifies its crystal growth characteristics. 
The 
degree of crystallization of admixed samples (with par- 
ticles having the shape of rectangular 
or rhomboidal 
sheets) is not as good as that of pure alumina. Moreover, 
a large number of irregularly 
shaped crystallites are 
observed. 
Conclusions 
1. The results of the present investigation 
support 
the finding that when rare-earth 
elements 
(Ln=La, 
Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) are present in alumina, they hinder 
the phase transformation 
associated with a higher an- 
nealing temperature. 
2. The stabilizing effect of a lanthanide 
oxide ad- 
mixture on the phase changes of alumina is related to 
the formation of LnAlO, with the perovskite-type 
struc- 
ture. 
3. The addition 
of La,O, 
delays the phase trans- 
formation by 136 K. 
4. The optimum stabilization of alumina by lanthanide 
alumina is obtained 
using a concentration 
of 3 wt.% 
of the Ln,O, admixture. 
5. The great similarity of the chemical properties 
of 
lanthanide 
oxides makes them almost identically 
ef- 
fective, both for inhibiting a-alumina 
formation 
and 
for decreasing the surface area. 
6. Alumina samples admixed with lanthanide oxides 
obtained 
by the coprecipitation 
method were not as 
crystalline 
as those 
obtained 
by the 
impregnation 
method, and showed higher surface areas at elevated 
heat-treatment 
temperatures.
