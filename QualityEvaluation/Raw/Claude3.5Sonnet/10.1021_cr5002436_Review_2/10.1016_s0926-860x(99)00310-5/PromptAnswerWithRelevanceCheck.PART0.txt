[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[4] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation. New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied for decades and are used commercially to produce propene and i-butene from paraffins. Key research areas include:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) and their roles in catalysis. Recent research suggests that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites are the active sites for dehydrogenation.

2. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) is a common support material for these catalysts.

3. Preparation methods: Traditionally, these catalysts were prepared by impregnation using Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solutions. However, researchers are exploring new preparation techniques like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) to create well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The literature discusses the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ during dehydrogenation conditions and the role of these redox sites in the catalytic process.

While the document doesn't provide information on the discovery of these catalysts in 1933 or specific promoters, it demonstrates the ongoing research interest in improving the understanding and performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
