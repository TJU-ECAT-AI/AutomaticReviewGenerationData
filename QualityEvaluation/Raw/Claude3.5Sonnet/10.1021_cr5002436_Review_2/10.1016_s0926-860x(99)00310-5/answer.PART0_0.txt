[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[4] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation. New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied for decades and are used commercially to produce propene and i-butene from paraffins. Key research areas include:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) and their roles in catalysis. Recent research suggests that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites are the active sites for dehydrogenation.

2. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) is a common support material for these catalysts.

3. Preparation methods: Traditionally, these catalysts were prepared by impregnation using Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solutions. However, researchers are exploring new preparation techniques like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) to create well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The literature discusses the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ during dehydrogenation conditions and the role of these redox sites in the catalytic process.

While the document doesn't provide information on the discovery of these catalysts in 1933 or specific promoters, it demonstrates the ongoing research interest in improving the understanding and performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂已经被研究了几十年，并在商业上用于从对应的烷烃生产丙烯和异丁烯。主要研究领域包括：

1. 结构和活性位点：研究集中在理解铬的氧化态（6+、5+、3+和2+）及其在催化中的作用。最新研究表明，氧化还原或暴露的非氧化还原Cr3+位点是脱氢反应的活性位点。

2. 载体材料：氧化铝（Al2O3）是这些催化剂常用的载体材料。

3. 制备方法：传统上，这些催化剂是通过使用Cr(NO3)3或CrO3溶液进行浸渍法制备的。然而，研究人员正在探索新的制备技术，如原子层外延（ALE），以在载体表面创建结构明确的活性位点。

4. 反应机理：文献讨论了在脱氢条件下Cr6+还原为Cr3+的过程，以及这些氧化还原位点在催化过程中的作用。

虽然文档没有提供关于1933年发现这些催化剂的信息或具体的助剂，但它显示了对改进铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的理解和性能的持续研究兴趣。
