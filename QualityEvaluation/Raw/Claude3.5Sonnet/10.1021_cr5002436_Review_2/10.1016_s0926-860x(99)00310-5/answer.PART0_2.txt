[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]."

[4] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[5] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation. New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied for decades and have found commercial applications in the production of propene and i-butene from paraffins. Key areas of research and development include:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) and their roles in catalysis. Recent research suggests that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites are the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has been a primary support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

3. Preparation methods: Traditional methods involve impregnation using Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solutions. However, new preparation techniques are being explored to create well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Research has focused on understanding how chromium species interact with the support and reactants during dehydrogenation processes.

5. Chromium loading and distribution: Studies have examined the effects of chromium concentration and its distribution on the catalyst surface.

These areas of focus have contributed to the ongoing development and improvement of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
