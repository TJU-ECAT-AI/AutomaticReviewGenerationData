[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[4] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation. New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied for decades since their discovery. They have found significant industrial applications in the production of propene and i-butene from corresponding paraffins on a commercial scale. 

Key research areas have included:

1. Structure: Studies on the oxidation states of chromium (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) and how they depend on pretreatment, concentration, and support material.

2. Active sites: Recent research has focused on identifying the active sites, with current consensus pointing to redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has been a key support material for these catalysts.

4. Preparation methods: While conventional methods like impregnation using Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solutions have been used, researchers are constantly exploring new preparation techniques to obtain well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface.

These areas of focus have contributed significantly to the understanding and improvement of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂自发现以来已经被研究了几十年。它们在商业规模上生产丙烯和异丁烯方面找到了重要的工业应用。

主要研究领域包括：

1. 结构：研究铬的氧化态（6+、5+、3+和2+）以及它们如何依赖于预处理、浓度和支撑材料。

2. 活性位点：最近的研究集中在识别活性位点上，目前的共识认为氧化还原或暴露的非氧化还原Cr3+位点是脱氢反应的活性位点。

3. 支撑材料：氧化铝（Al2O3）一直是这些催化剂的关键支撑材料。

4. 制备方法：虽然使用Cr(NO3)3或CrO3溶液的传统浸渍法已被使用，但研究人员不断探索新的制备技术，以在支撑表面上获得结构明确的活性位点。

这些研究重点显著地促进了对脱氢过程中铬氧化物基催化剂的理解和改进。
