[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."

[4] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[5] "New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied for decades and have found significant industrial applications in the production of propene and i-butene from paraffins. The key research focus areas that have contributed to their importance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Structure and oxidation states: Research has shown that chromium can exist in multiple oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+) depending on factors such as pretreatment, concentration, and support material.

2. Active sites: Recent studies have concluded that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 are the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has been extensively studied as a support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

4. Preparation methods: Researchers are constantly exploring new preparation techniques to obtain well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface, which can potentially improve catalyst activity and selectivity.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Understanding the role of different chromium species in the dehydrogenation process has been a key focus area, with studies examining the behavior of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species during reactions.

These research efforts have contributed to the development and optimization of chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
