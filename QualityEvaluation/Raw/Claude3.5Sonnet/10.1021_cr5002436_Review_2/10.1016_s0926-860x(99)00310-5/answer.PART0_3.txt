[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."

[4] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[5] "New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied for decades since their discovery, with significant developments in understanding their structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms. Key industrial applications include the commercial-scale production of propene and i-butene from corresponding paraffins.

Research has focused on several key areas:

1. Oxidation states: Studies have shown that Cr can exist in 6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+ states, depending on pretreatment, concentration, and support material.

2. Active sites: Recent research concludes that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 are the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Al2O3 has been extensively studied as a support, with research showing how chromium interacts with it at different loadings.

4. Preparation methods: New techniques like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) are being explored to create well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Understanding how Cr6+ reduces to Cr3+ under reaction conditions has been a focus of research.

These areas of study have contributed to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, driving improvements in catalyst performance and efficiency.

自发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经被研究了几十年，在理解其结构、活性位点和反应机理方面取得了重大进展。主要工业应用包括从相应的烷烃商业规模生产丙烯和异丁烯。

研究主要集中在几个关键领域：

1. 氧化态：研究表明，根据预处理、浓度和载体材料的不同，Cr可以存在于6+、5+、3+和2+状态。

2. 活性位点：最新研究认为，CrOx/Al2O3中的氧化还原或暴露的非氧化还原Cr3+位点是脱氢反应的活性位点。

3. 载体材料：Al2O3作为载体已被广泛研究，研究表明了不同载量下铬与之的相互作用。

4. 制备方法：正在探索原子层外延（ALE）等新技术，以在载体表面创建明确定义的活性位点结构。

5. 反应机理：理解Cr6+如何在反应条件下还原为Cr3+一直是研究的重点。

这些研究领域为铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续重要性做出了贡献，推动了催化剂性能和效率的改进。
