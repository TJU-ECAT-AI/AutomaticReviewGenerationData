[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K"

[5] "A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent has the following make-up, ~20% Cr, ~1% Zr as ZrO2, ~0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at ~0.75%."

[6] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction (TPR)."

[7] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in the early 1930s:

1. Industrial applications: Initially used during World War II for producing high-octane aviation fuel through butane dehydrogenation. Commercial processes using chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years.

2. Operating conditions: Current commercial reactors typically operate at 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K.

3. Catalyst composition: Modern formulations include chromium oxide (~20%) supported on alumina, with additives like zirconia, magnesia, and alkali metal oxide promoters.

4. Research focus areas:
   a) Structure: Extensive characterization using various techniques like XRD, UV-Vis DRS, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, EPR, IR spectroscopy, and TPR.
   b) Active sites: Debate over whether Cr(II), Cr(III), or Cr(II)/Cr(III) pairs are the active species.
   c) Support materials: Primarily alumina-based supports.
   d) Promoters: Use of additives like zirconia, magnesia, and alkali metal oxides to enhance performance.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Ongoing research to understand the precise nature of the active sites and reaction pathways.

The evolution of chromia-based catalysts has focused on improving their activity, selectivity, and stability through optimizing composition, support materials, and operating conditions, while research continues to elucidate the fundamental aspects of their structure and function.
