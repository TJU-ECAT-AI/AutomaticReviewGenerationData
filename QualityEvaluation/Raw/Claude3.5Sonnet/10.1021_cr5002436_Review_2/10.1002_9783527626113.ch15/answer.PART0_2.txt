[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years. During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[3] "A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent [9] has the following make-up, ~20% Cr, ~1% Zr as ZrO2, ~0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at ~0.75%."

[4] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) [10−12], UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) [11, 12], Raman spectroscopy [10, 11, 14−17], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [11, 12, 18], electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [12, 19], infrared spectroscopy [10, 20] and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) [16, 21]."

[5] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers [28]. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence [12, 24, 25, 29]. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair [18]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in the early 1930s:

1. Industrial applications: Initially used during World War II for dehydrogenation of butane to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Commercial processes using chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years.

2. Catalyst composition: Modern formulations include chromium oxide (~20%) supported on alumina, with additives like zirconia, magnesia, and alkali metal oxide promoters.

3. Characterization techniques: Researchers have employed a wide range of advanced analytical methods to study the structure and properties of chromia catalysts, including XRD, UV-Vis DRS, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, EPR, IR spectroscopy, and TPR.

4. Active sites: The nature of the active site remains a subject of ongoing research. Initially thought to be Cr(II), more recent studies suggest Cr(III) as the active species, while some researchers propose a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair.

5. Research focus: Key areas of investigation include understanding the catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials and promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.

The continued research and development of chromia-based catalysts demonstrate their enduring significance in dehydrogenation processes, with ongoing efforts to improve their performance and understand their fundamental properties.
