[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm."

[5] "A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent has the following make-up, ~20% Cr, ~1% Zr as ZrO2, ~0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at ~0.75%."

[6] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction (TPR)."

[7] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have undergone significant evolution since their discovery in the early 1930s:

1. Industrial applications: Initially used during World War II for producing high-octane aviation fuel through butane dehydrogenation. Commercial processes using chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years.

2. Process improvements: Houdry made a significant innovation by introducing a sub-atmospheric pressure system, improving conversion rates.

3. Catalyst composition: Modern formulations typically include chromium oxide supported on alumina, with additives like zirconia, magnesia, and alkali metal oxide promoters.

4. Research focus areas:
   a) Structure: Extensive characterization using various techniques like XRD, UV-Vis DRS, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, EPR, IR spectroscopy, and TPR.
   b) Active sites: Debate over whether Cr(II), Cr(III), or Cr(II)/Cr(III) pairs are the active species.
   c) Support materials: Primarily alumina-based supports.
   d) Promoters: Use of additives like zirconia, magnesia, and alkali metal oxides to enhance performance.
   e) Reaction mechanisms: Ongoing studies to understand the dehydrogenation process and catalyst deactivation.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, balancing industrial applicability with academic research to improve performance and understanding.
