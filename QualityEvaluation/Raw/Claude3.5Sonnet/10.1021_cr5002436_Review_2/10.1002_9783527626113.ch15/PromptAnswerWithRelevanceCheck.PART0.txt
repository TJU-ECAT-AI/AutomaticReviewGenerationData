[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K"

[5] "A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent [9] has the following make-up, ~20% Cr, ~1% Zr as ZrO2, ~0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at ~0.75%."

[6] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) [10-12], UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) [11, 12], Raman spectroscopy [10, 11, 14-17], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [11, 12, 18], electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [12, 19], infrared spectroscopy [10, 20] and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) [16, 21]."

[7] "Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V) and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as-prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species."

[8] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers [28]. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence [12, 24, 25, 29]. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair [18]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in the early 1930s:

1. Industrial applications: Initially used during WWII for producing high-octane aviation fuel, chromia catalysts have been in commercial use for over 60 years. They are primarily used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

2. Process improvements: Houdry made a significant advancement by introducing a sub-atmospheric pressure system, achieving higher per-pass conversion. Current commercial reactors typically operate at 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K.

3. Catalyst composition: Modern formulations include chromium (~20%) with promoters like zirconium, magnesium, and alkali metal oxides, supported on alumina.

4. Characterization techniques: A wide range of analytical methods have been employed to study the catalyst structure and surface properties, including XRD, UV-Vis DRS, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, EPR, IR spectroscopy, and TPR.

5. Active sites: The nature of the active site remains a subject of debate. While initially thought to be Cr(II), more recent studies suggest Cr(III) or a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair as the active species.

6. Oxidation states: Chromium can exist in multiple oxidation states (II, III, V, VI), with III and VI being predominant in as-prepared catalysts.

Research continues to focus on understanding the exact nature of the active sites, optimizing support materials and promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms to further improve the performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

4. 表征技术：采用了广泛的分析方法来研究催化剂结构和表面性质，包括XRD、UV-Vis DRS、拉曼光谱、XPS、EPR、红外光谱和TPR。

5. 活性位点：活性位点的本质仍然是争论的主题。虽然最初认为是Cr(II)，但最近的研究表明Cr(III)或Cr(II)/Cr(III)对可能是活性物种。

6. 氧化态：铬可以存在多种氧化态（II、III、V、VI），其中III和VI在制备的催化剂中占主导地位。

研究继续关注于理解活性位点的确切性质、优化载体材料和助剂、阐明反应机理，以进一步提高铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能。
