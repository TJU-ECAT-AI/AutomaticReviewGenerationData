[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm."

[5] "A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent has the following make-up, ~20% Cr, ~1% Zr as ZrO2, ~0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at ~0.75%."

[6] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction (TPR)."

[7] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved since their discovery in 1933:

1. Industrial applications: Initially used for dehydrogenation of light alkanes, they were applied during World War II to produce high-octane aviation fuel. Commercial processes using chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years.

2. Process developments: Houdry made a significant innovation by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, which was unusual in an industry accustomed to high-pressure operations.

3. Catalyst formulation: Modern formulations include chromium oxide supported on alumina, with additives like zirconium oxide, magnesium oxide, and alkali metal oxide promoters.

4. Characterization techniques: A wide range of analytical methods have been employed to study the catalyst structure and surface properties, including XRD, UV-Vis DRS, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, EPR, infrared spectroscopy, and TPR.

5. Active sites: There has been ongoing research to identify the active species. Initially thought to be Cr(II), more recent studies favor Cr(III), while some researchers propose a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair. However, the exact nature of the active site remains a subject of debate.

6. Research focus: Key areas of investigation include catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms, all contributing to the continued significance of chromia-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年发现以来有了显著的发展：

1. 工业应用：最初用于轻烷烃脱氢，在第二次世界大战期间被用来生产高辛烷值航空燃料。使用铬氧化物催化剂的商业工艺已经运行了60多年。

2. 工艺发展：Houdry公司做出了重大创新，使用低于大气压的系统，这在习惯于高压操作的行业中是不寻常的。

3. 催化剂配方：现代配方包括以氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物，添加了氧化锆、氧化镁和碱金属氧化物等促进剂。

4. 表征技术：使用了多种分析方法来研究催化剂结构和表面性质，包括XRD、UV-Vis DRS、拉曼光谱、XPS、EPR、红外光谱和TPR。

5. 活性位点：一直在进行研究以确定活性物种。最初认为是Cr(II)，最近的研究倾向于Cr(III)，而一些研究人员提出Cr(II)/Cr(III)对。然而，活性位点的确切性质仍然是一个争议的话题。

6. 研究重点：关键研究领域包括催化剂结构、活性位点、载体材料、促进剂和反应机理，所有这些都为铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续重要性做出了贡献。
