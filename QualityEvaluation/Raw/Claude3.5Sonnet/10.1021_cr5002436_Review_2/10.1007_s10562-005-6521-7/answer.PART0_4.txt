[1] "High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have shown to be very active and selective in this reaction and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all over the world"

[2] "In the last decade a significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long-term deactivation routes"

[3] "Surprisingly, not much studies have been devoted to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system."

[4] "In all these catalyst systems, a CrO moiety with chromium in its tri- or divalent state is envisaged as the active site for CH activation."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalyst evolution since 1933. However, it indicates that Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have become industrially important for dehydrogenation processes worldwide. Key research areas have included:

1. Molecular structure of supported chromium oxides
2. Nature of the active chromium oxide site
3. Short- and long-term deactivation routes
4. Reaction mechanisms (though surprisingly understudied)

The active site is believed to be a CrO moiety with chromium in its tri- or divalent state. The literature suggests that while significant knowledge has been gained about structural aspects and deactivation, there is still a need for more mechanistic studies on these industrially important catalysts.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的全面历史概述。然而，它表明Cr/Al2O3催化剂已在全球范围内成为工业脱氢过程中的重要催化剂。主要研究领域包括：

1. 负载型铬氧化物的分子结构
2. 活性铬氧化物位点的性质
3. 短期和长期失活途径
4. 反应机理（尽管研究得出人意料地少）

活性位点被认为是一个三价或二价铬的CrO部分。文献表明，虽然在结构方面和失活方面已获得了大量知识，但对这些工业重要催化剂的机理研究仍然需要更多关注。
