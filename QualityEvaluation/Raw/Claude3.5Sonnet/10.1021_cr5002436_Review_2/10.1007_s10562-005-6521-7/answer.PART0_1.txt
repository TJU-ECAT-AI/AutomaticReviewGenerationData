Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: These catalysts are now widely used in dehydrogenation plants globally, particularly for the production of propylene for the growing polypropylene market.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Molecular structure of supported chromium oxides
   b) Nature of active chromium oxide sites
   c) Short- and long-term deactivation routes
   d) Reaction mechanisms (though this area has received less attention)

3. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has emerged as an important support material, with high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts showing high activity and selectivity.

4. Catalyst complexity: The complexity of these catalysts has driven extensive research in both academia and industry.

While significant progress has been made in understanding the structure and active sites of chromium oxide catalysts, there is still a need for more studies on the reaction mechanisms of these industrially important catalytic systems.
