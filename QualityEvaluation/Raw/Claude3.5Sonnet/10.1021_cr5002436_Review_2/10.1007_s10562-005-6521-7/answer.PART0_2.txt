The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their evolution and significance:

1. Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have become widely used in industrial dehydrogenation plants worldwide due to their high activity and selectivity.

2. The growing demand for propylene in the polypropylene market has driven increased research into these catalysts in both academia and industry.

3. Recent research has focused on understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites, and deactivation mechanisms.

4. Despite their industrial importance, there has been limited research on the reaction mechanisms of these catalysts.

5. Key areas of study include the use of different support materials (e.g., alumina, zirconia, silica) and the investigation of active site structures (e.g., CrO moieties with tri- or divalent chromium).

While the document doesn't provide a complete historical perspective, it suggests that research on chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved to focus on optimizing their performance, understanding their structure and active sites, and improving their longevity in industrial applications.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了它们演变和重要性的一些关键方面：

1. 由于其高活性和选择性，Cr/Al2O3催化剂已在全球工业脱氢工厂中广泛使用。

2. 聚丙烯市场对丙烯需求的增长推动了学术界和工业界对这些催化剂的深入研究。

3. 近期研究重点关注支撑铬氧化物的分子结构、活性位点的性质以及失活机理的理解。

4. 尽管这些催化剂具有重要的工业意义，但对其反应机理的研究仍然有限。

5. 研究的关键领域包括不同支撑材料的使用（如氧化铝、氧化锆、二氧化硅）以及活性位点结构的研究（如具有三价或二价铬的CrO部分）。

虽然该文档没有提供完整的历史视角，但它表明铬氧化物基催化剂的研究已经演变为专注于优化其性能、理解其结构和活性位点，以及改善其在工业应用中的寿命。
