          [1] "High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have shown to be very active and selective in this reaction and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all over the world"

[2] "The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market, the related use of this catalytic system as well as the catalyst complexity have initiated many research activities in both academia and chemical industries."

[3] "In the last decade a significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long-term deactivation routes"

[4] "Surprisingly, not much studies have been devoted to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system."

[5] "In all these catalyst systems, a CrO moiety with chromium in its tri- or divalent state is envisaged as the active site for CH activation."

          Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly:

1. Industrial applications: High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have become widely used in dehydrogenation plants globally due to their high activity and selectivity, particularly for propylene production in the growing polypropylene market.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Molecular structure of supported chromium oxides
   b) Nature of active chromium oxide sites (CrO moiety with tri- or divalent chromium)
   c) Short- and long-term deactivation routes
   d) Support materials (e.g., alumina)
   e) Reaction mechanisms (though this area has received less attention)

3. Catalyst complexity: The complexity of these catalysts has driven extensive research in both academia and industry.

4. Recent advances: In the last decade, significant knowledge has been gathered about the molecular structure, active sites, and deactivation mechanisms.

5. Knowledge gaps: Despite their industrial importance, there is still a need for more studies on the reaction mechanisms of these catalytic systems.

The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by industrial needs, particularly in petrochemicals. However, there are still areas for further research and development, especially regarding detailed reaction mechanisms.
