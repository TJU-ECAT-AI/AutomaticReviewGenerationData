Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become widely used in industrial dehydrogenation processes since their discovery. Key developments include:

1. Use of high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which are very active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Widespread industrial adoption in dehydrogenation plants globally.

3. Increased research focus due to growing demand for propene in polypropylene production.

4. Advances in understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, nature of active sites, and deactivation mechanisms.

5. Studies on support materials, with alumina being a common support.

However, the reaction mechanism remains an area needing further research, as relatively few studies have focused on elucidating it for this industrially important catalyst system. Key research areas have included catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, and deactivation processes, though the mechanism itself requires more attention.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their evolution and significance:

1. Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have become widely used in industrial dehydrogenation plants worldwide due to their high activity and selectivity.

2. The growing demand for propylene in the polypropylene market has driven increased research into these catalysts in both academia and industry.

3. Recent research has focused on understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites, and deactivation mechanisms.

4. Despite their industrial importance, there has been limited research on the reaction mechanisms of these catalysts.

5. Key areas of study include the use of different support materials (e.g., alumina, zirconia, silica) and the investigation of active site structures (e.g., CrO moieties with tri- or divalent chromium).

While the document doesn't provide a complete historical perspective, it suggests that research on chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved to focus on optimizing their performance, understanding their structure and active sites, and improving their longevity in industrial applications.
