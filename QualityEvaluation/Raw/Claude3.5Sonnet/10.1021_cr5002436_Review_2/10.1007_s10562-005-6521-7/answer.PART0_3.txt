Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become widely used in industrial dehydrogenation plants since their discovery. Key developments include:

1. Use of high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which show high activity and selectivity.

2. Growing industrial applications, especially for propylene production due to increased polypropylene demand.

3. Research focus areas have included:
   - Molecular structure of supported chromium oxides
   - Nature of active chromium oxide sites
   - Short- and long-term deactivation mechanisms
   - Support materials (e.g. alumina)
   - Reaction mechanisms (though less studied)

4. Ongoing research in both academia and industry due to the catalysts' complexity and industrial importance.

The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by industrial needs, particularly in petrochemicals. However, there are still knowledge gaps, especially regarding detailed reaction mechanisms, indicating areas for further research and development.
