Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become widely used in industrial dehydrogenation processes since their discovery. Key developments include:

1. Use of high-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, which are very active and selective for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Widespread industrial adoption in dehydrogenation plants globally.

3. Increased research focus due to growing demand for propene in polypropylene production.

4. Advances in understanding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, nature of active sites, and deactivation mechanisms.

5. Studies on support materials, with alumina being a common support.

However, the reaction mechanism remains an area needing further research, as relatively few studies have focused on elucidating it for this industrially important catalyst system. Key research areas have included catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, and deactivation processes, though the mechanism itself requires more attention.

自发现以来,铬氧化物基催化剂在工业脱氢过程中得到了广泛应用。主要发展包括:

1. 使用高负载Cr/Al2O3催化剂,这种催化剂对脱氢反应具有很高的活性和选择性。

2. 在全球脱氢工厂中广泛采用。

3. 由于聚丙烯生产中对丙烯需求的增长,研究重点增加。

4. 在理解负载铬氧化物的分子结构、活性位点性质和失活机理方面取得进展。

5. 对支撑材料的研究,其中氧化铝是常用的支撑材料。

然而,反应机理仍然是一个需要进一步研究的领域,因为相对较少的研究集中在阐明这个工业重要催化剂系统的机理上。主要研究领域包括催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料和失活过程,尽管机理本身需要更多关注。
