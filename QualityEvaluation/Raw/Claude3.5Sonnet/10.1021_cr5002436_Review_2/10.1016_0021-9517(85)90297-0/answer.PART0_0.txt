[1] "Both supported chromium and a-Cr203 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(II) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (l-3), although Cr(III) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."

[3] "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiO2, Cr/Al2O3, and a-Cr2O3, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of research focus and applications:

1. Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are known to be active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, indicating their significance in this process.

2. There has been ongoing research to identify the active site, with most evidence pointing to Cr(II) as the active oxidation state, though some studies have also proposed Cr(III).

3. The structure of the active site has been a focus area, with low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

4. Support materials have been investigated, with the study comparing Cr/SiO2, Cr/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3. These showed similar turnover frequencies, suggesting that the support may not significantly affect the intrinsic activity of the chromium sites.

5. The importance of the chromium oxidation state is highlighted by the inactivity of CrY zeolite, where chromium remains in the +3 oxidation state.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss industrial applications or promoters, it does provide insight into the ongoing research on the structure of active sites, the role of support materials, and the importance of the chromium oxidation state in dehydrogenation processes.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实提供了一些关于研究重点和应用的洞察：

1. 负载型铬和α-Cr2O3都被认为是烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂，表明它们在这个过程中的重要性。

2. 一直有持续的研究来识别活性位点，大多数证据指向Cr(II)是活性氧化态，尽管一些研究也提出了Cr(III)。

3. 活性位点的结构一直是研究的重点领域，低核数A型铬(II)离子被认为是Cr/SiO2催化剂上乙烷脱氢的活性位点。

4. 对支撑材料进行了研究，该研究比较了Cr/SiO2、Cr/Al2O3和α-Cr2O3。这些催化剂显示出相似的转化频率，表明支撑材料可能不会显著影响铬位点的本征活性。

5. 铬的氧化态的重要性通过CrY沸石的不活性得到突出，在CrY沸石中铬保持在+3氧化态。

虽然文档没有明确讨论工业应用或助剂，但它确实提供了关于活性位点结构、支撑材料作用以及铬氧化态在脱氢过程中重要性的持续研究洞察。
