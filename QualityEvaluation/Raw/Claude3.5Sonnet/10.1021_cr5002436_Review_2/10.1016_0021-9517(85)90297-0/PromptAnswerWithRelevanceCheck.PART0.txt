[1] "Both supported chromium and a-Cr203 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(II) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (l-3), although Cr(III) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."

[3] "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiO2, Cr/Al2O3, and a-Cr2O3, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of research focus and applications:

1. Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are known to be active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, indicating their significance in this process.

2. There has been ongoing research to identify the active site, with most evidence pointing to Cr(II) as the active oxidation state, though some studies have also proposed Cr(III).

3. The structure of the active site has been a focus area, with low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

4. Support materials have been investigated, with the study comparing Cr/SiO2, Cr/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3. These showed similar turnover frequencies, suggesting that the support may not significantly affect the intrinsic activity of the chromium sites.

5. The importance of the chromium oxidation state is highlighted by the inactivity of CrY zeolite, where chromium remains in the +3 oxidation state.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss industrial applications or promoters, it does provide insight into the ongoing research on the structure of active sites, the role of support materials, and the importance of the chromium oxidation state in dehydrogenation processes.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实提供了一些关于研究重点和应用的洞察：

1. 负载型铬和α-Cr2O3都被认为是烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂，表明它们在这个过程中的重要性。

2. 一直有持续的研究来识别活性位点，大多数证据指向Cr(II)是活性氧化态，尽管一些研究也提出了Cr(III)。

3. 活性位点的结构一直是研究的重点领域，低核数A型铬(II)离子被认为是Cr/SiO2催化剂上乙烷脱氢的活性位点。

4. 对支撑材料进行了研究，该研究比较了Cr/SiO2、Cr/Al2O3和α-Cr2O3。这些催化剂显示出相似的转化频率，表明支撑材料可能不会显著影响铬位点的本征活性。

5. 铬的氧化态的重要性通过CrY沸石的不活性得到突出，在CrY沸石中铬保持在+3氧化态。

虽然文档没有明确讨论工业应用或助剂，但它确实提供了关于活性位点结构、支撑材料作用以及铬氧化态在脱氢过程中重要性的持续研究洞察。

1. Both supported chromium catalysts and α-Cr2O3 are recognized as active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. There has been significant research focus on identifying the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. While some researchers favor Chromium(II) as the active oxidation state, others have proposed Chromium(III).

3. Recent evidence suggests that low nuclearity, coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(II) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

4. The structure and oxidation state of the chromium species, as well as the nature of the support material, are key areas of investigation.

5. Spectroscopic techniques, particularly infrared spectroscopy using probe molecules like CO and NO, have been important tools in characterizing the active sites.

6. The degree of coordinative unsaturation of the chromium ions appears to be a critical factor in determining catalytic activity.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into current research focus areas and applications:

1. Active sites: There is ongoing debate about the oxidation state of the active chromium species. While some researchers favor Cr(II), others propose Cr(III). The paper suggests that low nuclearity A-type Cr(II) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

2. Support materials: The study compares various supports including silica, alumina, and zeolites. Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 show similar activities, while CrY zeolite is essentially inactive due to the difficulty in reducing Cr(III) to Cr(II).

3. Structure: The research focuses on the coordination state and nuclearity of chromium ions, suggesting that coordinatively unsaturated Cr(II) ions are important for catalytic activity.

4. Applications: The paper specifically examines ethane dehydrogenation, which is an important industrial process for producing ethylene.

5. Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly discussed, the study investigates the kinetics and deactivation of the catalysts, which contribute to understanding the reaction mechanisms.

The research demonstrates ongoing efforts to optimize chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes by investigating various aspects such as oxidation state, support materials, and catalyst structure.

2. 载体材料：该研究比较了包括二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石在内的各种载体。Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3表现出相似的活性，而CrY沸石由于难以将Cr(III)还原为Cr(II)而基本上不活跃。

3. 结构：研究重点关注铬离子的配位状态和核数，表明配位不饱和的Cr(II)离子对催化活性很重要。

4. 应用：本文特别研究了乙烷脱氢，这是生产乙烯的一个重要工业过程。

5. 反应机理：虽然没有明确讨论，但该研究调查了催化剂的动力学和失活，这有助于理解反应机理。

这项研究表明，通过研究氧化态、载体材料和催化剂结构等各个方面，正在持续努力优化用于脱氢过程的铬氧化物催化剂。
