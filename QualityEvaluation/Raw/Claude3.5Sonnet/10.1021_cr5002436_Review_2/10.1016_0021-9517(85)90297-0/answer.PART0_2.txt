[1] "Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(II) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (1-3), although Cr(III) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."

[3] "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiO2, Cr/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into current research focus areas and applications:

1. Active sites: There is ongoing debate about the oxidation state of the active chromium species. While some researchers favor Cr(II), others propose Cr(III). The paper suggests that low nuclearity A-type Cr(II) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

2. Support materials: The study compares various supports including silica, alumina, and zeolites. Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 show similar activities, while CrY zeolite is essentially inactive due to the difficulty in reducing Cr(III) to Cr(II).

3. Structure: The research focuses on the coordination state and nuclearity of chromium ions, suggesting that coordinatively unsaturated Cr(II) ions are important for catalytic activity.

4. Applications: The paper specifically examines ethane dehydrogenation, which is an important industrial process for producing ethylene.

5. Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly discussed, the study investigates the kinetics and deactivation of the catalysts, which contribute to understanding the reaction mechanisms.

The research demonstrates ongoing efforts to optimize chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes by investigating various aspects such as oxidation state, support materials, and catalyst structure.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实提供了当前研究重点领域和应用的见解：

1. 活性位点：关于活性铬物种的氧化态仍存在争议。一些研究者倾向于Cr(II)，而其他人则提出Cr(III)。本文认为，低核数A型Cr(II)离子是Cr/SiO2催化剂上乙烷脱氢的活性位点。

2. 载体材料：该研究比较了包括二氧化硅、氧化铝和沸石在内的各种载体。Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3表现出相似的活性，而CrY沸石由于难以将Cr(III)还原为Cr(II)而基本上不活跃。

3. 结构：研究重点关注铬离子的配位状态和核数，表明配位不饱和的Cr(II)离子对催化活性很重要。

4. 应用：本文特别研究了乙烷脱氢，这是生产乙烯的一个重要工业过程。

5. 反应机理：虽然没有明确讨论，但该研究调查了催化剂的动力学和失活，这有助于理解反应机理。

这项研究表明，通过研究氧化态、载体材料和催化剂结构等各个方面，正在持续努力优化用于脱氢过程的铬氧化物催化剂。
