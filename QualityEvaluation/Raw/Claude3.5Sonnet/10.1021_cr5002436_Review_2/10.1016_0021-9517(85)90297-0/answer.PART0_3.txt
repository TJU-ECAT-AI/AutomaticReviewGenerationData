[1] "Both supported chromium and a-Cr203 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(II) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (l-3), although Cr(III) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."

[3] "The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium supported on silica gel has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, together with kinetic measurements."

[4] "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts."

The document does not provide information on the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does discuss some key aspects of current research and applications:

1. Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. There is ongoing debate about the nature of the active site, with some researchers favoring Cr(II) and others proposing Cr(III).

3. Research focuses on identifying active sites using techniques like infrared spectroscopy and kinetic measurements.

4. For ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts, low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites.

5. Studies have examined various support materials, including silica gel, alumina, and zeolites.

6. The effects of catalyst preparation methods, such as dehydration temperature and chromium loading, have been investigated.

7. Reaction mechanisms and the role of catalyst poisoning by coking have been explored.

While the document doesn't provide a historical perspective, it demonstrates that current research on chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes focuses on understanding the nature of active sites, optimizing support materials and preparation methods, and elucidating reaction mechanisms.
