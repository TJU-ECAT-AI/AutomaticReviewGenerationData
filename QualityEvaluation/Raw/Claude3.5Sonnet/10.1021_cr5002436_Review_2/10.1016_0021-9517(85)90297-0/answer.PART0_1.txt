[1] "Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."

[2] "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(II) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (1-3), although Cr(III) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."

[3] "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts."

[4] "The evidence from the present study suggests that the coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(II) ions, which result in the carbonyl band at 2182 cm-1, are responsible for ethane dehydrogenation."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of current research and understanding:

1. Both supported chromium catalysts and α-Cr2O3 are recognized as active catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. There has been significant research focus on identifying the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. While some researchers favor Chromium(II) as the active oxidation state, others have proposed Chromium(III).

3. Recent evidence suggests that low nuclearity, coordinatively unsaturated A-type chromium(II) ions are the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

4. The structure and oxidation state of the chromium species, as well as the nature of the support material, are key areas of investigation.

5. Spectroscopic techniques, particularly infrared spectroscopy using probe molecules like CO and NO, have been important tools in characterizing the active sites.

6. The degree of coordinative unsaturation of the chromium ions appears to be a critical factor in determining catalytic activity.

The literature does not specifically mention industrial applications or the use of promoters for these catalysts.

这篇文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实提供了一些关于当前研究和理解的关键方面的见解：

1. 支持的铬催化剂和α-Cr2O3都被认为是烷烃脱氢的活性催化剂。

2. 研究重点主要集中在识别脱氢反应的活性位点上。虽然一些研究者倾向于认为铬(II)是活性氧化态，但也有人提出了铬(III)。

3. 最新证据表明，在Cr/SiO2催化剂上，低核态、配位不饱和的A型铬(II)离子是乙烷脱氢的活性位点。

4. 铬物种的结构和氧化态，以及载体材料的性质，是研究的关键领域。

5. 光谱技术，特别是使用CO和NO等探针分子的红外光谱，是表征活性位点的重要工具。

6. 铬离子的配位不饱和度似乎是决定催化活性的关键因素。

这篇文献没有具体提到这些催化剂的工业应用或助剂的使用。
