Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become crucial in the chemical industry since their discovery, finding key applications in polyethylene production and light paraffin dehydrogenation. The Philips catalyst (chromium-on-silica) is responsible for about one-third of global high-density polyethylene production. Chromium-on-alumina catalysts are used in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes for light paraffin dehydrogenation.

Research focus areas have included elucidating the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relationship to catalytic performance. Specific areas of interest include understanding the role of different chromium oxidation states (Cr6+, Cr3+, and Cr2+) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Support materials have also been an area of study, with silica and alumina being common supports.

The evolution of these catalysts has involved ongoing efforts to improve their performance and understand their underlying mechanisms. This has included investigations into the nature of active sites, the effects of different support materials, and the reaction mechanisms involved in dehydrogenation processes.
