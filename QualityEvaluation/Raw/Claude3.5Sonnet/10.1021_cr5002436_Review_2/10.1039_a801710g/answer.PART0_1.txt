Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become crucial in chemical industries since their discovery, with significant applications in polyethylene production and light paraffin dehydrogenation. The Philips catalyst (chromium-on-silica) is responsible for about one-third of global high-density polyethylene production. Chromium-on-alumina catalysts are used in important industrial processes like Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE for light paraffin dehydrogenation.

Key research focus areas have included elucidating the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relationship to catalytic performance. This has involved studying the role of different chromium oxidation states (Cr6+, Cr3+, and Cr2+) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. Support materials have also been an important area of research, with silica and alumina being prominent examples.

The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by their industrial importance, leading to extensive research in both academic and industrial settings. This research has aimed to improve catalyst performance by understanding the nature of active sites, optimizing support materials, and investigating reaction mechanisms.
