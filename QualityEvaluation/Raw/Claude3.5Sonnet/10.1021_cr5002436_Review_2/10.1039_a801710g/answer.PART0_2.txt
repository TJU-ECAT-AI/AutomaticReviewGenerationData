Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become crucial in chemical industries since their discovery, with significant applications in polyethylene production and light paraffin dehydrogenation. The Philips polymerization catalyst (chromium-on-silica) is responsible for about one-third of global high-density polyethylene production. Chromium-on-alumina is used in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes for light paraffin dehydrogenation.

Key research focus areas have included:

1. Elucidating the molecular structure of chromium oxides
2. Understanding the relationship between structure and catalytic performance
3. Investigating the role of different chromium oxidation states (Cr6+, Cr3+, and Cr2+) in dehydrogenation reactions
4. Studying support materials (e.g., silica, alumina, and mixed silica-alumina supports)
5. Examining reaction mechanisms

The industrial importance of these catalysts has driven extensive research in both academic and industrial settings, aiming to improve their performance and understand their fundamental properties.
