[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor. In contrast to this, the chromia/alumina catalysts of the present work were prepared by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) with the use of sequential saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied extensively since the 1950s and 1960s, with ongoing interest in recent years. They are known for their high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes like propane and butane.

Key developments and research focus areas include:

1. Preparation methods: Traditional impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 has been the common method. However, newer techniques like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) using Cr(acac)3 vapor and air have emerged.

2. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface. At low loadings, Cr6+ is generally accepted as the anchored species on alumina. For higher loadings, the distribution of oxidation states is less clear and depends on preparation methods and characterization techniques.

3. Support materials: Alumina has been a primary support material for these catalysts.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have aimed to understand how chromium species interact with the support and reactants during dehydrogenation processes.

5. Industrial applications: The main application has been in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, particularly propane and butane.

While the literature doesn't explicitly mention promoters, it's likely that research has also explored their use to enhance catalyst performance. The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by the need to improve activity, selectivity, and stability in important industrial dehydrogenation processes.

铬氧化物催化剂自20世纪50年代和60年代以来就一直被广泛研究，近年来仍然受到持续关注。它们以在轻烷烃（如丙烷和丁烷）脱氢反应中具有高活性和选择性而闻名。

主要发展和研究重点领域包括：

1. 制备方法：传统的浸渍法使用CrO3或Cr(NO3)3一直是常用方法。然而，新兴的技术如使用Cr(acac)3蒸汽和空气的原子层外延(ALE)法也已出现。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点在于理解催化剂表面铬的氧化态。在低负载量时，Cr6+通常被认为是锚定在氧化铝表面的物种。对于高负载量，氧化态的分布不太明确，取决于制备方法和表征技术。

3. 载体材料：氧化铝一直是这些催化剂的主要载体材料。

4. 反应机理：研究旨在理解脱氢过程中铬物种与载体和反应物之间的相互作用。

5. 工业应用：主要应用于轻烷烃的脱氢，特别是丙烷和丁烷。

虽然文献中没有明确提到助剂，但研究可能也探索了助剂的使用以提高催化剂性能。这些催化剂的演变主要是由于需要在重要的工业脱氢过程中提高活性、选择性和稳定性。
