[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The interesting feature of the catalytic behavior above monolayer coverage cannot wholly be explained by our present knowledge or on the basis of the literature. We are therefore carrying out experiments at still higher loadings, to shed light on these questions."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied extensively since the 1950s and 1960s, with continued interest in recent years. They are primarily used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane, where they exhibit high activity and selectivity.

Key research focus areas include:

1. Preparation methods: Traditionally, impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 has been the main preparation technique. However, new methods like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) are being explored.

2. Structure and active sites: There is ongoing debate about the valence state distribution of chromia, especially at higher loadings. The oxidation state of chromium (Cr6+ vs Cr3+) and its impact on catalyst performance is a key area of study.

3. Support materials: Alumina is a common support material, but research continues on how the support interacts with and influences the chromium species.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The behavior of these catalysts, particularly above monolayer coverage, is not fully understood and is an area of active research.

5. Loading effects: Studies are being conducted on the impact of chromium loading on catalyst performance, including investigations at higher loadings beyond monolayer coverage.

These research areas contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.

氧化铬基催化剂自20世纪50年代和60年代以来就一直受到广泛研究，近年来仍然备受关注。它们主要用于轻烷烃（如丙烷和丁烷）的脱氢反应，在这些反应中表现出高活性和高选择性。

主要研究重点领域包括：

1. 制备方法：传统上，使用CrO3或Cr(NO3)3进行浸渍是主要的制备技术。然而，现在正在探索原子层外延（ALE）等新方法。

2. 结构和活性位点：关于铬氧化物的价态分布，特别是在高负载时，仍存在争议。铬的氧化态（Cr6+与Cr3+）及其对催化剂性能的影响是一个关键研究领域。

3. 载体材料：氧化铝是常用的载体材料，但研究仍在继续探讨载体如何与铬物种相互作用并影响它们。

4. 反应机理：这些催化剂的行为，特别是在单层覆盖度以上的情况，尚未完全理解，是一个活跃的研究领域。

5. 负载效应：正在研究铬负载对催化剂性能的影响，包括对超过单层覆盖度的高负载情况的研究。

这些研究领域为工业脱氢过程中氧化铬基催化剂的持续发展和改进做出了贡献。
