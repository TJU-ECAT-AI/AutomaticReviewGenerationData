[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The interesting feature of the catalytic behavior above monolayer coverage cannot wholly be explained by our present knowledge or on the basis of the literature. We are therefore carrying out experiments at still higher loadings, to shed light on these questions."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied extensively since the 1950s and 1960s, with continued interest in recent years. They are primarily used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane, where they exhibit high activity and selectivity.

Key research focus areas include:

1. Preparation methods: Traditionally, impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 has been the main preparation technique. However, new methods like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) are being explored.

2. Structure and active sites: There is ongoing debate about the valence state distribution of chromia, especially at higher loadings. The oxidation state of chromium (Cr6+ vs Cr3+) and its impact on catalyst performance is a key area of study.

3. Support materials: Alumina is a common support material, but research continues on how the support interacts with and influences the chromium species.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The behavior of these catalysts, particularly above monolayer coverage, is not fully understood and is an area of active research.

5. Loading effects: Studies are being conducted on the impact of chromium loading on catalyst performance, including investigations at higher loadings beyond monolayer coverage.

These research areas contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
