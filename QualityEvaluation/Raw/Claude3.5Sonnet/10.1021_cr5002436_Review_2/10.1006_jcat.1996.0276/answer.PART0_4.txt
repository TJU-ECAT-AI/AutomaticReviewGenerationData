[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied extensively since the 1950s and 1960s, with ongoing interest in recent years. They are primarily used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane, where they exhibit high activity and selectivity.

Key research focus areas include:

1. Preparation methods: Traditionally, impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursors has been common. However, newer techniques like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) are being explored.

2. Structure and active sites: There is significant interest in understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface. At low loadings, Cr6+ is generally accepted as the anchored species on alumina. However, for higher loadings, the distribution of oxidation states is still debated.

3. Support materials: Alumina is a common support material, but research continues on how the support interacts with and influences the chromium species.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have focused on how chromium loading affects catalyst activity, with findings showing increased activity with higher chromium content.

Industrial applications primarily revolve around dehydrogenation processes for light alkanes, which are important in the production of various petrochemicals and polymers.

The evolution of these catalysts has been marked by continuous efforts to improve their performance, stability, and understanding of their fundamental properties, driving their significance in industrial dehydrogenation processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂自20世纪50年代和60年代以来就被广泛研究，近年来仍然受到持续关注。它们主要用于轻烷烃（如丙烷和丁烷）的脱氢反应，表现出高活性和高选择性。

主要研究重点领域包括：

1. 制备方法：传统上，使用CrO3或Cr(NO3)3作为前驱体的浸渍法很常见。然而，现在正在探索原子层外延（ALE）等更新的技术。

2. 结构和活性位点：对了解催化剂表面铬的氧化态有很大兴趣。在低负载量时，Cr6+通常被认为是锚定在氧化铝表面的物种。然而，对于更高的负载量，氧化态的分布仍有争议。

3. 载体材料：氧化铝是常见的载体材料，但研究仍在继续探讨载体如何与铬物种相互作用并影响它们。

4. 反应机理：研究集中在铬负载量如何影响催化剂活性，结果表明随着铬含量的增加，活性也增加。

工业应用主要围绕轻烷烃的脱氢过程，这在各种石油化学品和聚合物的生产中很重要。

这些催化剂的演变一直伴随着持续不断的努力，以提高其性能、稳定性，并加深对其基本特性的理解，从而推动它们在工业脱氢过程中的重要性。
