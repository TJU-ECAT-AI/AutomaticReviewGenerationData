          [1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor. In contrast to this, the chromia/alumina catalysts of the present work were prepared by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) with the use of sequential saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "The work of Haukka et al. (25) has shown that the adsorption of Cr(acac)3 on silica occurs selectively through reaction with OH groups. Probably OH groups behave as bonding sites on alumina as well, at least during the first sequences of Cr(acac)3."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Historical Development:
   - Intensive studies were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s.
   - Interest has continued to the present day.

2. Preparation Methods:
   - Initially, impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursors was common.
   - More advanced techniques like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) have been developed, using Cr(acac)3 vapor and air in sequential saturating reactions.

3. Structure and Active Sites:
   - At low loadings, chromium is generally accepted to be anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+.
   - For higher loadings, the distribution of oxidation states (Cr6+ vs Cr3+) is debated.
   - The role of OH groups as bonding sites for chromium species has been investigated.

4. Support Materials:
   - Alumina has been the primary support material.
   - Studies have also explored other supports like silica.

5. Reaction Mechanisms:
   - Research has focused on understanding how chromium loading affects catalytic activity.
   - Increased activity with higher chromium content has been observed in propane dehydrogenation.

6. Industrial Applications:
   - Primarily used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, especially propane and butane.

7. Characterization Techniques:
   - Various methods have been employed, leading to some divergent opinions on the nature of active sites.

8. Research Focus Areas:
   - Improving catalyst performance by controlling chromium dispersion.
   - Optimizing oxidation states.
   - Enhancing stability.

The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by the need for more efficient and selective dehydrogenation processes in the petrochemical industry.
