[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied extensively since the 1950s and 1960s, with ongoing interest in recent years. They are primarily used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane, where they show high activity and selectivity.

Key research focus areas include:

1. Preparation methods: Initially, impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 was common. More recent studies have explored alternative preparation techniques.

2. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation state of chromium on the catalyst surface, particularly the distribution of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species at different loadings.

3. Support materials: Alumina has been a primary support material, with studies examining the interaction between chromium and the alumina surface.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Investigations have looked at how chromium loading affects catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

5. Characterization techniques: Various methods have been employed to study the structure and properties of these catalysts, leading to some divergent opinions on the nature of the active sites.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has involved refining preparation methods, improving understanding of the active sites and their interaction with support materials, and optimizing catalyst performance for industrial dehydrogenation processes.
