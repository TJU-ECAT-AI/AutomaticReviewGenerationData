[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The work of Haukka et al. (25) has shown that the adsorption of Cr(acac)3 on silica occurs selectively through reaction with OH groups. Probably OH groups behave as bonding sites on alumina as well, at least during the first sequences of Cr(acac)3."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial intensive studies were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s, with interest continuing to the present day.

2. Preparation methods have evolved from simple impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 precursors to more advanced techniques like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE).

3. Key research focus areas include:
   - Structure: Understanding the distribution and nature of chromium species on the support surface.
   - Active sites: Investigating the role of different chromium oxidation states (Cr6+ and Cr3+) in catalytic activity.
   - Support materials: Primarily focused on alumina, but also exploring other supports like silica.
   - Reaction mechanisms: Studying the interaction between chromium species and support hydroxyl groups.

4. Industrial applications have centered on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, particularly propane and butane.

5. Recent research has aimed to improve catalyst performance by controlling chromium dispersion, optimizing oxidation states, and enhancing stability.

The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by the need for more efficient and selective dehydrogenation processes in the petrochemical industry.

自1933年发现以来，用于脱氢过程的铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 最初的密集研究是在20世纪50年代和60年代进行的，直到现在仍然持续受到关注。

2. 制备方法已从使用CrO3或Cr(NO3)3前体的简单浸渍法演变为更先进的技术，如原子层外延（ALE）。

3. 关键研究重点领域包括：
   - 结构：理解铬物种在载体表面的分布和性质。
   - 活性位点：研究不同铬氧化态（Cr6+和Cr3+）在催化活性中的作用。
   - 载体材料：主要集中在氧化铝上，但也探索其他载体如二氧化硅。
   - 反应机理：研究铬物种与载体羟基基团之间的相互作用。

4. 工业应用主要集中在轻烷烃的脱氢上，特别是丙烷和丁烷。

5. 近期研究旨在通过控制铬的分散度、优化氧化态和提高稳定性来改善催化剂性能。

这些催化剂的演变主要是由石油化工行业对更高效和选择性脱氢过程的需求所推动的。
