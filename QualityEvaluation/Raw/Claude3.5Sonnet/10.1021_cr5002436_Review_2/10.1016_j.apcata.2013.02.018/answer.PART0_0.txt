[1] "Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years [10]. Currently, this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation [11]."

[2] "It is well known that the nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content and calcination treatment [1,2,1215]."

[3] "Besides, the researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability. It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation [2,6,1622]."

[4] "Many preparation methods for the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts described in the literatures, such as incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation method and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) strategy, have been explored over the alkanes dehydrogenation [2,7,15,23,24]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for industrial dehydrogenation processes since their discovery. Key developments include:

1. Commercial application: Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have been used for isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years, currently dominating over half the world market for paraffin dehydrogenation catalysts.

2. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of surface chromia, which is crucial for catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia depends on factors like support type, chromium content, and calcination treatment.

3. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has been a primary support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

4. Promoters: The addition of alkali metals, particularly potassium, has been found to promote olefin selectivity and improve catalyst resistance to deactivation.

5. Preparation methods: Various techniques have been explored, including incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation, and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA).

6. Research focus: Efforts have been directed towards improving catalytic dehydrogenation activity, selectivity, and catalyst stability.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, with ongoing research aimed at further enhancing their performance and understanding reaction mechanisms.
