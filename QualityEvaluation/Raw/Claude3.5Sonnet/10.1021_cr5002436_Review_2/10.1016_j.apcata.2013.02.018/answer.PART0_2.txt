[1] "Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years [10]. Currently, this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation [11]."

[2] "It is well known that the nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content and calcination treatment [1,2,1215]."

[3] "Besides, the researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability. It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation [2,6,1622]."

[4] "Many preparation methods for the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts described in the literatures, such as incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation method and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) strategy, have been explored over the alkanes dehydrogenation [2,7,15,23,24]."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, particularly in the field of dehydrogenation processes. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have become widely used for isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale, now occupying more than half of the world market for commercial paraffin dehydrogenation catalysts.

2. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of surface chromia, which is critical for catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia depends on factors such as support type, chromium content, and calcination treatment.

3. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has emerged as a primary support material for chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

4. Promoters: The addition of alkali metals, particularly potassium, has been found to promote olefin selectivity and improve catalyst resistance to deactivation.

5. Preparation methods: Various techniques have been explored for synthesizing Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, including incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation, and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA).

6. Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, understanding reaction mechanisms has likely been a focus area in the development of these catalysts.

These developments have contributed to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, driving improvements in catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability.
