[1] "Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years [10]. Currently, this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation [11]."

[2] "It is well known that the nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content and calcination treatment [1,2,1215]."

[3] "Besides, the researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability. It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation [2,6,1622]."
