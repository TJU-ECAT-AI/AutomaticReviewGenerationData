[1] "Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years [10]. Currently, this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation [11]."

[2] "It is well known that the nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content and calcination treatment [1,2,1215]."

[3] "Besides, the researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability. It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation [2,6,1622]."

[4] "Many preparation methods for the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts described in the literatures, such as incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation method and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) strategy, have been explored over the alkanes dehydrogenation [2,7,15,23,24]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for commercial isobutane dehydrogenation since their discovery. Key developments include:

1. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has become the primary support, with Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts dominating the market for paraffin dehydrogenation.

2. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of surface chromia species, which strongly influence catalytic activity and selectivity. The type of support, chromium content, and calcination conditions affect the speciation of surface chromia.

3. Promoters: Addition of alkali metals like potassium has been found to promote olefin selectivity and improve catalyst stability against deactivation.

4. Preparation methods: Various techniques have been explored, including incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy, co-precipitation, and evaporation-induced self-assembly.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have investigated the relationship between surface chromia species and catalytic performance.

The main industrial application has been in paraffin dehydrogenation, particularly isobutane dehydrogenation to produce isobutene. Research continues to focus on improving catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability through optimizing composition, structure, and preparation methods.
