Hydrous zirconium oxide containing Mo(VI) oxide, prepared at different pH, was investigated to elucidate the influence of 
interacting surface species on zirconia crystallization, together with other solid-state processes 
such as sintering and phase trans- 
formation. Several techniques were applied including X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy. 
The results show that the pH affects the uptake and the nature of 
the Mo adsorbed species 
which, by 
interacting with the ZrO2 surface, exert different effects on the crystallization, sintering and stabilization of the tetragonal form 
of 
zirconia. 
1. Introduction 
Zirconia-based ceramics are often prepared by us- 
ing "hydrous zirconium oxide" as starling material. 
This amorphous and ultrafine powder is an ionic ex- 
changer, and during the preparation it may therefore 
adsorb impurities from the solution. In the subse- 
quent thermal treatment, the adsorbed species may 
interact with the zirconium oxide, to affect many 
technologically important properties such as, for ex- 
ample, densification [ 1 ]. The dispersed species-sup- 
port interaction is also of interest in heterogeneous 
catalysis. 
The crystallization and phase stabilization of zir- 
conia has been studied in the past, the attention being 
focused on the preparation conditions of the hy- 
drous zirconium oxide: starting zirconium salts [2,3 ], 
precipitating agents [ 
4,5 ], pH effect [ 6 ], rate of base 
addition [ 7-11 ] . In our laboratory a systematic re- 
search program was started to investigate the role of 
foreign species on certain solid-state processes of zir- 
conia, such as crystallization, sintering and phase 
transition [ 12 ] when the foreign species is added to 
the previously precipitated xerogel. The present pa- 
per deals with the effect caused by the addition of 
Mo(VI)-containing species. 
Molybdic ions are 
known to be present in different degrees of conden- 
sation, depending on the solution pH which enables 
the interaction of the different molybdic species to 
be studied. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Sample preparation and analysis 
The Mo-containing samples were prepared by sus- 
pending a known amount of hydrous zirconium ox- 
ide (HZ) (details in ref. [ 13] ) in a relatively large 
volume of a water solution of (NH4)6Mo7024 • 
4H20 
(Erba R.P.), at pH= 1 (fixed by nitric acid) or at 
pH=8 (fixed by addition of ammonia). The sus- 
pension was shaken at room temperature for 72 h, 
and the solid was then separated by filtration and 
dried at 383 K for 24 h. Pure zirconium oxide was 
treated at several pH values ( 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 8 ) by a sim- 
ilar procedure. After filtration, each sample was dried 
at 383 K for 24 h. Samples with and without Mo are 
designated ZMoX(Y) and ZrO2(Y) respectively, 
where X stands for the Mo (metal) content, % by 
weight, and Y the pH of the solution. The samples 
were studied "as prepared" (a.p.) and after thermal 
treatments in air. 
The Mo content (table 1) was determined by 
atomic absorption after dissolution of a sample in

concentrated (40%) HF solution, and subsequent 
dilution. The NO- content in ZrO2(Y) was deter- 
mined spectrophotometrically [ 14]. The sample to 
be analyzed was dissolved in HF, as described above. 
All standard solutions contained ZrO2 dissolved in 
HF in a concentration similar to that of the sample. 
The following NO- concentrations 
(percent by 
weight) 
were found for the different samples: 
ZrO2(1), 
1.91; ZrO2(1.5), 
1.33; ZrO2(2), 0.35; 
ZrO2(3), 0.01; ZrO2(8), 0.0. 
2.2. Characterization 
DTA measurements were performed starting from 
room temperature to 1073 K in flowing 0 2 (60 ml 
min-  
), temperature rate 20 K min- , using t-Al203 
as reference [13 ]. The measured area of the crys- 
tallization peaks, A, was normalized to 50 mg of zir- 
conium oxide, Asp, by considering the Mo present as 
MoO3 and using the formula 
Aso =A)< 50/{P[ ( 1 -.4%/100) 
-%Mo× 143.94/100×95.94) ]}, 
( 1 ) 
where P=sample weight for the DTA experiment, 
A%=loss in weight (due to water and NO- decom- 
position) after heating at 770 K for five hours in air 
(table 1), 143.94=MOO3 molecular weight and 
95.94=Mo atomic weight. The same procedure was 
applied to ZrOz(Y) 
samples containing 
NO- 
(%Mo=0). 
X-ray diffraction phase analysis was carried out by 
employing Cu Kct (Ni-filtered) radiation. The frac- 
tion of the tetragonal zirconia, f, was evaluated by 
the formula 
f=It(lO1)/[Im(lll)+lm(lll)+It(lO1)], 
where the Im(hkl) stands for the intensity of the hkl 
reflection of the monoclinic phase, and It ( 101 ) the 
intensity of the 101 peak of the tetragonal phase (in- 
dexing by Teufer [ 15 ] ). 
XPS spectra were obtained with a Leybold- 
Heraeus LHS 10 Spectrometer interfaced with a 
Hewlett-Packard 2113 B computer, using Al Kct 
( 1486.6 eV) radiation. The experimental procedure 
and data treatment have been reported previously 
[ 16 ]. The spectra were acquired in the sequence Mo 
3d, O Is, C ls, Zr 3d. The reference was Zr 3d5/2 at 
182.5 eV. 
Optical reflectance spectra were recorded in the 
range 2500-200 nm at room temperature. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. As-prepared samples 
NO- uptake by ZrO2(Y) decreases as the pH in- 
creases, until the specimen prepared at pH = 8 con- 
tains no nitrate ions. This behaviour has two causes: 
(i) the uptake of anionic species decreases as the so- 
lution pH increases, until it becomes negligible at a 
pH > isoelectric point (i.p), which for zirconia is re- 
ported to be 4.5 [17] to 5.5 [18]; (ii) the pH in- 
crease involves a decrease of the NO- added 
concentration. 
Fig. 1 shows the Mo uptake versus the molybde- 
num available in solution. The dashed line m rep- 
resents the adsorption of all the Mo present in so- 
lution (total adsorption). For the ZMoX( 1 ) samples 
(curve a), as the concentration of available Mo in- 
creases, so the total adsorption is initially observed. 
The slope of the uptake then decreases, to rise once 
more when the Mo concentration increases. For the 
ZMoX(8) samples (curve b) the Mo adsorbed is 
considerably lower than that at pH = l, and a satu- 
ration value is clearly observed. The higher Mo up- 
take for ZMoX( 1 ) samples compared with that of 
the ZMoX(8 ) samples, fig. l, is explained by the fact

that several phenomena take place during adsorp- 
tion. First of all, as already mentioned, the pH af- 
fects the adsorption capacity of the solid. At pH = 1 
(pH<i.p.), molybdic anions are more easily ad- 
sorbed than at pH=8 (pH> i.p). Secondly, the H  
concentration modifies the type of molybdic species 
in 
solution. 
Depending 
on 
the 
equilibrium 
7MoO 
2- +8H+'--*Mo706 
- +4H20, the predomi- 
nant anion in solution at pH = 8 is MoO 
2- , while at 
pH = 1 the species present are Mo7 
O64 
- or even more 
condensed ones [ 19]. As a consequence, while the 
ZMoX(8) samples mostly involve MoO 
2- adsorp- 
tion, those of the ZMoX(1 ) series contain polyox- 
omolybdate species. This conclusion is supported by 
the reflectance spectra. 
The HZ spectrum shows two absorption bands at 
about 210 and 300 nm, the latter of very small in- 
tensity. For the samples of the ZMoX(8) and 
ZMoX( 1 
) series, the addition of Mo causes an ab- 
sorption in the range 280-330 nm, which increases 
with the Mo content. However, the comparison of 
spectra of specimens with similar Mo content but 
prepared at different pH, shows an absorption onset 
at lower wavelength for the ZMoX( 1 
) samples com- 
pared with that of the ZMoX(8) ones. Fig. 2 pre- 
sents the absorption spectra of typical samples of the 
ZMoX(8) and ZMoX(1) series with similar Mo 
content. In the past, differences in the reflectance 
spectra of Mo(VI) dispersed on various supports 
have been discussed in terms of tetrahedral or oc- 
tahedral coordination of the molybdenum atom 
.

[ 
20 ]. It was recently realized that, for molybdic spe- 
cies, the effect of the local symmetry on the ligand- 
metal charge transfer is negligible compared with the 
effect of the more distant environment of the metal, 
which occurs when a polyoxomolybdate is formed 
[20,21]. The batochromic shift observed on the 
spectra of the ZMoX(1) samples is therefore ex- 
plained by the formation of condensed species. 
Finally, while a.p. samples with X< 14% are amor- 
phous to X-rays those with higher Mo content con- 
tain hexagonal MoO3 [22,23]. The precipitation of 
MoO3 explains the increase in the Mo uptake for 
samples prepared from solutions with Mo concen- 
tration over 80 mmol 1-, fig 1. From the plateau- 
like region of fig. 1, the Mo content present in an ad- 
sorbed form in samples prepared at pH= 1 is esti- 
mated as 11%. This finding is confirmed by the XPS 
analysis. Both ZMoX(8 ) and ZMoX( 1 
)samples with 
Mo content lower than 11% (p/s--0.19) show that 
the intensity ratio IMo(3d)/Izr(3d) is linear with the 
Mo content (fig. 3). A good correlation between the 
experimental points and those calculated by the 
Kerkhof and Moulijn model [24] is obtained. This 
behaviour confirms that molybdenum is in a dis- 
perse form while the positive deviation for higher Mo 
content is ascribed to the presence of MoO3 
microcrystals.

3.2. Thermally treated samples 
Two thermal effects are detected during the DTA 
experiments for the Mo-free HZ prepared at differ- 
ent pH: an endothermic effect in the range 350-425 
K, due to water release, and a very sharp exothermic 
peak around 720 K, caused by the crystallization of 
amorphous material. For the ZrO2 (8) sample (HZ 
contacted with a Mo-free solution at pH--8), the 
DTA parameters of the crystallization process are 
very similar to those observed for the starting HZ. 
For the ZrO2 (Y) with Y from 1 to 3 a small but sig- 
nificant shift to a higher temperature and a decrease 
of the normalized area of the crystallization peak, 
Aso, are observed. The Aso values are given after the 
specimen's symbols: ZrO2(8), 245; ZRO2(3), 232; 
ZRO2(2), 162; ZrO2(l.5), 160; ZrO2(1), 148. It is 
argued that the first addition of NO7 (up to 0.35%) 
causes a strong decrease of As0, which suggests that 
during heating the adsorbed species interact with the 
solid surface and affect crystallization [25 ]. On the 
basis of the results of C1- interaction [ 25 ], NO j- is 
expected to interact strongly with the support. How- 
ever, the effect on the zirconia crystallization process 
is modest, since the nitric ions decompose as the 
temperature increases. 
In the case of Mo-containing samples a strong in- 
teraction takes place, which affects the zirconia 
properties in relation to the Mo dispersion, and 
thereby to the preparation pH. This effect is revealed 
by DTA measurements. In fact, for the ZMoX(8) 
samples, as the Mo content increases, the crystalli- 
zation peak is shifted to higher temperature, fig. 4A, 
while for the samples of the ZMoX( 1 ) series, the 
crystallization peak is split into two components, ct 
and 13, fig. 4B. The ct peak appears around 720 K, as 
in the case of Mo-free HZ at pH = 1, ZrO2 ( 1 
), and 
thus containing adsorbed NO- ; the 13 thermal effect 
is shifted to higher temperature and broadened as 
the molybdenum content increases. Moreover, for 
the ZMoX(8) samples, the Aso value decreases lin- 
early with the Mo content, fig. 5, curve a; for the 
samples of the ZMoX(1) series, fig. 6, on the other 
hand, the normalized area of the ct peak, A3o, de- 
creases for X up to  10% and then remains prac- 
tically constant. 
There is a variation in both the peak temperature 
and the Aso value with Mo content for the ZMoX(8 ) 
samples; this suggests that the interaction is directly 
related to the Mo content. The peak area reflects the 
amount of zirconia undergoing crystallization, on the 
hypothesis of the absence of other thermal effects 
such as those resulting from compound formation.

Fig. 6. Area of the ct exothermic peak, normalized to 50 mg of 
ZrO2, A%, for the ZMoX( 1 
) samples. 
The only known compound between ZrO2 and MoO3 
[ 26 ] is ZrMozOs, which is not detected in the X-ray 
patterns of samples heated at 820 K for 5 h. For sam- 
ples with increasing Mo content, constant Aso values 
should therefore be expected, such as that obtained 
for the Mo-free specimen. On the contrary, fig.5 
(curve a) shows that the values decrease. As a con- 
sequence, we deduce that a fraction of zirconia re- 
lated to the Mo content is unable to crystallize. In 
order to normalize the DTA peak area to 50 mg of 
"free" zirconia able to crystallize, the formula ( 1 ) is 
modified as follows: 
A5o = A × 50/{P[ 1 -A%/100- %Mo X ( 143.94 
+nX 123.22)/100×95.94]}, 
where 123.22=ZRO2 formula weight, n=number of 
ZrO2 formula units per MoO 3 unit, which by inter- 
action with MoO3 are prevented from crystallizing. 
Fig. 5 shows that fairly constant values are obtained 
with n  2 (curve c ). The high Zr/Mo ratio involved 
( 2) indicates that the influence on the crystalli- 
zation must be ascribed to the presence of a surface 
compound rather than to a bulk one, ZrMo208 
(n=0.5). Regarding the influence of surface com- 
pounds on the zirconia crystallization, it should be 
recalled that HZ is formed by very small ordered re- 
gions with a tetragonal structure exposing the ( 101 ) 
plane [27]. The Teufer unit cell, fig. 7, contains two 
ZrO2 formula units and two oxygen atoms on the ex- 
ternal (101) plane which, in principle, are able to 
adsorb one molybdate ion. One molybdate is there- 
fore sufficient to prevent the crystallization of the 
interacting unit cell, hence of two ZrO2 units. 
The dispersed state of the molybdate ion for the 
thermally treated ZMoX( 8 ) samples is also deduced 
from an IR emission spectroscopy study [ 28 ], which 
has revealed isolated MoO ]- even after treatment at 
820 K for a 2% MoO 3 on ZrO2. 
For the ZMoX( 1 ) samples a different situation is 
encountered, since in the DTA experiments two 
peaks, ct and 13, are obtained, fig. 4B. The two-peak

M. Valigi et aL / Mo(VI) interaction with zirconia surface 
141 
structure shows that zirconia crystallizes in two dis- 
tinct processes. The et peak appears at the same tem- 
perature as that observed for ZrO2 ( 1 ), and can be 
assigned to the crystallization of a fraction of zir- 
conia not interacting with the polyoxomolybdate 
ions. To clarify this point, it is recalled that, due to 
the texture of the solid (small platelets loosely held 
to each other [ 27 ] ), during preparation the solution 
comes into contact with the entire oxide surface; 
consequently some of the polyoxomolybdate ions 
may initially be adsorbed at random. However, the 
Mo species tend to condense in acidic conditions, 
and those involved in a subsequent uptake may at 
least in part be anchored directly to the Mo species 
adsorbed. As a result, only some regions of the sur- 
face are covered. The precipitation of MoO3 is de- 
tectable at about 11% (XPS, XRD). One can deduce 
that, starting from this concentration, MoO3 for- 
mation is favoured with regard to interaction with 
zirconia, thereby justifying the constancy of the or- 
peak area (fig. 6). 
The 13 peak is due to the crystallization 
of that frac- 
tion of zirconia which interacts with the polyoxo- 
molybdate ions. The temperature shift and the peak 
broadening observed are both manifestations of this 
interaction, which tends to slow down the crystalli- 
zation. The first Mo addition has a greater effect on 
the temperature shift; for samples with X> 5.94, the 
13 peak appears at around 850 K. This temperature 
represents an upper limit since, once reached, the 
zirconia crystallization will in any case take place. 
It has been reported that the zirconia crystalliza- 
tion starts from the surface [29,30]. This point is 
confirmed by its sensitivity to the formation of sur- 
face compounds. Indeed, the anchorage of surface 
compounds blocks the surface sites and decreases the 
surface mobility. From this point of view, other solid- 
state processes are also believed to be affected. This 
is particularly true for sintering, fig. 8A, and the sta- 
bilization of the tetragonal modification with regard 
to the monoclinic one, fig. 8B. The latter transition 
involves a change of zirconium coordination from 8 
to 7 oxygen ions [ 31 ], an evidently difficult process 
when surface compounds are present.
