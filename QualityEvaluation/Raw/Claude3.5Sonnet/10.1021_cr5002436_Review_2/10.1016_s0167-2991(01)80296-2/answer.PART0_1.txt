[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. CrOx/Al2O3 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and i-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2 in ethene polymerisation."

[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods"

[3] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "A number of arguments can be given to support the idea that the Cr3+ sites formed in the reduction of Cr6+ (so called redox Cr3+ [4] or dispersed phase [2]) might be the active sites."

[5] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr3+, also some non-redox Cr3+ could be responsible for the catalytic activity."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become widely used in various industrial processes since their discovery. Key applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes (such as propane and i-butane) using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, and ethene polymerization using the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2.

Research has extensively focused on characterizing these catalysts due to their industrial importance. However, there are still open questions regarding the catalyst structure under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of the active sites, reaction mechanisms, and deactivation processes.

Key areas of research focus include:

1. Structure: Understanding the catalyst structure, especially under reaction conditions.

2. Active sites: Investigating the nature of the active sites, with debates around whether Cr3+ sites formed from reduction of Cr6+ (redox Cr3+) are the main active sites, or if non-redox Cr3+ sites also contribute to catalytic activity.

3. Support materials: Studying different support materials, with alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) being common choices.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Elucidating the mechanisms of dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions.

5. Deactivation: Understanding the processes leading to catalyst deactivation.

While significant progress has been made in understanding these catalysts, many aspects of their behavior and performance still require further research to optimize their industrial use.

自从发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已广泛应用于各种工业过程。主要应用包括使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂进行轻烷烃（如丙烷和异丁烷）的脱氢，以及使用Phillips催化剂CrOx/SiO2进行乙烯聚合。

由于其工业重要性，研究人员已广泛关注这些催化剂的表征。然而，关于催化剂在脱氢条件下的结构、活性位点的性质、反应机理和失活过程等方面仍存在未解决的问题。

研究的主要关注领域包括：

1. 结构：了解催化剂的结构，特别是在反应条件下的结构。

2. 活性位点：研究活性位点的本质，围绕Cr6+还原形成的Cr3+位点（氧化还原Cr3+）是否是主要活性位点，或非氧化还原Cr3+位点是否也对催化活性有贡献存在争论。

3. 载体材料：研究不同的载体材料，其中氧化铝（Al2O3）和二氧化硅（SiO2）是常见的选择。

4. 反应机理：阐明脱氢和聚合反应的机理。

5. 失活：理解导致催化剂失活的过程。

虽然在理解这些催化剂方面已取得重大进展，但其行为和性能的许多方面仍需要进一步研究，以优化其工业应用。
