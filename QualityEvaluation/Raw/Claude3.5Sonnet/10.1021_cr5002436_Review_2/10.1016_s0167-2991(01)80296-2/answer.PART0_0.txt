Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become important industrial catalysts since their discovery, with key applications in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes and ethene polymerization. Their industrial significance has led to extensive research using various characterization methods.

The main research focus areas for these catalysts include:

1. Structure: Understanding the catalyst structure under dehydrogenation conditions remains an active area of research.

2. Active sites: There is ongoing debate about the nature of the catalytic sites, with suggestions that both redox Cr3+ and non-redox Cr3+ species may be responsible for catalytic activity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The exact reaction mechanisms are still not fully understood and remain a focus of research.

4. Deactivation: Long-term deactivation of the catalysts, potentially caused by irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase, is an important area of study.

5. Support materials: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, the use of different support materials (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2) is evident and likely an area of ongoing research.

6. Promoters: Although not directly addressed in the provided text, the mention of industrial catalysts suggests that promoters may be an area of focus in improving catalyst performance.

The evolution of these catalysts has involved continuous efforts to improve their performance, stability, and understanding of their fundamental properties. However, many aspects of their behavior and structure remain subjects of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community.

自发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已成为重要的工业催化剂，主要应用于轻烷烃的脱氢和乙烯聚合。它们的工业重要性导致了使用各种表征方法进行广泛研究。

这些催化剂的主要研究重点领域包括：

1. 结构：了解脱氢条件下的催化剂结构仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。

2. 活性位点：关于催化位点的性质仍存在争议，有人认为redox Cr3+和non-redox Cr3+物种都可能负责催化活性。

3. 反应机理：确切的反应机理仍未完全了解，仍然是研究的重点。

4. 失活：催化剂的长期失活（可能由活性相结构的不可逆改变引起）是一个重要的研究领域。

5. 载体材料：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但使用不同的载体材料（如Al2O3、SiO2）是显而易见的，可能是正在进行的研究领域。

6. 助催化剂：虽然在提供的文本中没有直接提到，但提到工业催化剂表明助催化剂可能是改善催化剂性能的一个研究重点领域。
