Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become widely used in various industrial processes since their discovery. Key applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes (such as propane and i-butane) using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, and ethene polymerization using the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2.

Research has extensively focused on characterizing these catalysts due to their industrial importance. However, there are still open questions regarding the catalyst structure under dehydrogenation conditions, the nature of the active sites, reaction mechanisms, and deactivation processes.

Key areas of research focus include:

1. Structure: Understanding the catalyst structure, especially under reaction conditions.

2. Active sites: Investigating the nature of the active sites, with debates around whether Cr3+ sites formed from reduction of Cr6+ (redox Cr3+) are the main active sites, or if non-redox Cr3+ sites also contribute to catalytic activity.

3. Support materials: Studying different support materials, with alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) being common choices.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Elucidating the mechanisms of dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions.

5. Deactivation: Understanding the processes leading to catalyst deactivation.

While significant progress has been made in understanding these catalysts, many aspects of their behavior and performance still require further research to optimize their industrial use.
