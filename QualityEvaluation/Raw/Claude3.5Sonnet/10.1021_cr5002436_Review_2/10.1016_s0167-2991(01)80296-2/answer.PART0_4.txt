[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. CrOx/Al2O3 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and i-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2 in ethene polymerisation."

[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods"

[3] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr3+, also some non-redox Cr3+ could be responsible for the catalytic activity."

[5] "Two processes have been postulated [6] as possible explanations for this: 1) some of the chromium sites could migrate into the alumina lattice becoming inactive, or 2) deactivation could occur due to irreversible clustering of the active chromium species."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become widely used in various industrial processes since their discovery. Key applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes (using CrOx/Al2O3) and ethene polymerization (using the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2).

Research has focused extensively on characterizing these catalysts due to their industrial importance. Key areas of study include:

1. Structure: Understanding the catalyst structure under dehydrogenation conditions.

2. Active sites: Investigating the nature of catalytic sites, including both redox Cr3+ and non-redox Cr3+ species.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Elucidating the dehydrogenation process.

4. Deactivation: Examining causes of catalyst deactivation, such as migration of chromium sites into the support lattice or clustering of active species.

5. Support materials: Studying different supports like alumina and silica.

Despite extensive research, many questions remain unanswered, particularly regarding the catalyst structure under reaction conditions, the exact nature of active sites, and the mechanisms of deactivation. This ongoing research aims to develop better and more durable catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes.

自发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已广泛应用于各种工业过程。主要应用包括轻烷烃的脱氢（使用CrOx/Al2O3）和乙烯聚合（使用Phillips催化剂CrOx/SiO2）。

由于其工业重要性，对这些催化剂的研究已经非常广泛。主要研究领域包括：

1. 结构：了解脱氢条件下的催化剂结构。

2. 活性位点：研究催化位点的性质，包括氧化还原Cr3+和非氧化还原Cr3+物种。

3. 反应机理：阐明脱氢过程。

4. 失活：研究催化剂失活的原因，如铬位点迁移到支撑体晶格中或活性物种的聚集。

5. 支撑材料：研究不同的支撑体，如氧化铝和二氧化硅。

尽管研究广泛，但仍有许多问题未得到解答，特别是关于反应条件下的催化剂结构、活性位点的确切性质以及失活机理。这些持续的研究旨在为工业脱氢过程开发更好、更耐用的催化剂。
