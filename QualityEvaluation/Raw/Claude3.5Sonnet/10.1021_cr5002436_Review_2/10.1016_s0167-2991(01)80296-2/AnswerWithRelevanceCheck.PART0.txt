          [1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. CrOx/Al2O3 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and i-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2 in ethene polymerisation."

[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods"

[3] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr3+, also some non-redox Cr3+ could be responsible for the catalytic activity."

[5] "Irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase have been proposed as potential causes for the long-term deactivation of the CrOx catalysts."

[6] "Two processes have been postulated [6] as possible explanations for this: 1) some of the chromium sites could migrate into the alumina lattice becoming inactive, or 2) deactivation could occur due to irreversible clustering of the active chromium species."

          Since their discovery, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved to become widely used in various industrial processes. Key applications include:

1. Dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g., propane and i-butane) using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts
2. Ethene polymerization using the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2

The industrial significance of these catalysts has led to extensive research using various characterization methods. Key research focus areas that have contributed to their importance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Structure: Understanding the catalyst structure under dehydrogenation conditions remains an active area of research.

2. Active sites: Investigating the nature of catalytic sites, with ongoing debates about whether both redox Cr3+ and non-redox Cr3+ species are responsible for catalytic activity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Elucidating the exact reaction mechanisms, which are still not fully understood.

4. Deactivation: Studying long-term deactivation of the catalysts, potentially caused by irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase. Two processes have been proposed: migration of chromium sites into the alumina lattice, and irreversible clustering of active chromium species.

5. Support materials: Research on different support materials, with alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2) being common choices.

6. Characterization methods: Developing and applying various techniques to study these catalysts.

Despite extensive research, many aspects of the catalysts' behavior and structure remain subjects of ongoing investigation. The evolution of these catalysts has involved continuous efforts to improve their performance, stability, and understanding of their fundamental properties to optimize their industrial use.

          自发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经发展成为广泛应用于各种工业过程的重要催化剂。主要应用包括：

1. 使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂进行轻烷烃（如丙烷和异丁烷）的脱氢
2. 使用Phillips催化剂CrOx/SiO2进行乙烯聚合

这些催化剂的工业重要性导致了使用各种表征方法进行广泛研究。对其在脱氢过程中重要性有贡献的主要研究重点领域包括：

1. 结构：理解脱氢条件下催化剂的结构仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。

2. 活性位点：研究催化位点的性质，围绕氧化还原Cr3+和非氧化还原Cr3+物种是否都对催化活性负责存在持续争论。

3. 反应机理：阐明确切的反应机理，这些机理仍未完全理解。

4. 失活：研究催化剂的长期失活，可能由活性相结构的不可逆改变引起。已提出两种过程：铬位点迁移到氧化铝晶格中，以及活性铬物种的不可逆聚集。

5. 载体材料：研究不同的载体材料，其中氧化铝（Al2O3）和二氧化硅（SiO2）是常见的选择。

6. 表征方法：开发和应用各种技术来研究这些催化剂。

尽管进行了广泛的研究，但催化剂行为和结构的许多方面仍然是正在进行的研究主题。这些催化剂的演变涉及持续努力改善其性能、稳定性以及对其基本特性的理解，以优化其工业应用。
