[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. CrOx/Al2O3 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and i-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2 in ethene polymerisation."

[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods"

[3] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr3+, also some non-redox Cr3+ could be responsible for the catalytic activity."

[5] "Irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase have been proposed as potential causes for the long-term deactivation of the CrOx catalysts."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become widely used in various industrial processes since their discovery. Key applications include:

1. Dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane, i-butane) using CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts
2. Ethene polymerization using the Phillips catalyst (CrOx/SiO2)

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Structure of the catalyst under reaction conditions
2. Nature of the active sites (both redox Cr3+ and non-redox Cr3+ species)
3. Reaction mechanisms
4. Catalyst deactivation processes
5. Support materials (e.g. alumina, silica)
6. Characterization methods to study these catalysts

Despite extensive research, there are still open questions regarding the exact structure and behavior of these catalysts under dehydrogenation conditions. Long-term deactivation due to irreversible alterations in the active phase structure remains an important research topic. The evolution of these catalysts has involved improving their activity, selectivity, and stability through better understanding of their fundamental properties and behavior.

自发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已广泛应用于各种工业过程。主要应用包括：

1. 使用CrOx/Al2O3催化剂进行轻烷烃（如丙烷、异丁烷）的脱氢
2. 使用Phillips催化剂（CrOx/SiO2）进行乙烯聚合

对其在脱氢过程中重要性有贡献的研究重点领域包括：

1. 反应条件下催化剂的结构
2. 活性位点的性质（包括氧化还原Cr3+和非氧化还原Cr3+物种）
3. 反应机理
4. 催化剂失活过程
5. 载体材料（如氧化铝、二氧化硅）
6. 研究这些催化剂的表征方法

尽管进行了广泛的研究，但关于这些催化剂在脱氢条件下的确切结构和行为仍存在未解答的问题。由于活性相结构的不可逆变化而导致的长期失活仍然是一个重要的研究课题。这些催化剂的演变涉及通过更好地理解其基本特性和行为来提高其活性、选择性和稳定性。
