[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. CrOx/Al2O3 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and i-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2 in ethene polymerisation."

[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods"

[3] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr3+, also some non-redox Cr3+ could be responsible for the catalytic activity."

[5] "Irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase have been proposed as potential causes for the long-term deactivation of the CrOx catalysts."

While the literature does not provide a historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933, it does highlight their current significance and research focus areas:

Chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. Key applications include:
1. Dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g., propane and i-butane) using CrOx/Al2O3
2. Ethene polymerization using the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2

The industrial importance of these catalysts has led to extensive research using various characterization methods. Current research focus areas include:

1. Structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions
2. Nature of the catalytic site(s)
3. Reaction mechanisms
4. Catalyst deactivation

Researchers are investigating both redox Cr3+ and non-redox Cr3+ sites as potentially responsible for catalytic activity. Long-term deactivation is another area of study, with irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase proposed as a potential cause.

Support materials (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2) play a crucial role in these catalysts, as evidenced by the different applications of CrOx on different supports. However, the literature does not provide specific information on the evolution of support materials or promoters over time.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来氧化铬基催化剂的历史概述，但它确实突出了它们当前的重要性和研究重点领域：

氧化铬催化剂在各种工业过程中被广泛使用。主要应用包括：
1. 使用CrOx/Al2O3进行轻烷烃（如丙烷和异丁烷）的脱氢
2. 使用Phillips催化剂CrOx/SiO2进行乙烯聚合

这些催化剂的工业重要性导致了使用各种表征方法的广泛研究。当前的研究重点领域包括：

1. 脱氢条件下催化剂的结构
2. 催化活性位点的性质
3. 反应机理
4. 催化剂失活

研究人员正在调查氧化还原Cr3+和非氧化还原Cr3+位点，认为它们可能都对催化活性负责。长期失活是另一个研究领域，活性相结构的不可逆改变被提出作为潜在原因。

载体材料（如Al2O3, SiO2）在这些催化剂中起着至关重要的作用，这从CrOx在不同载体上的不同应用可以看出。然而，文献没有提供关于载体材料或助剂随时间演变的具体信息。
