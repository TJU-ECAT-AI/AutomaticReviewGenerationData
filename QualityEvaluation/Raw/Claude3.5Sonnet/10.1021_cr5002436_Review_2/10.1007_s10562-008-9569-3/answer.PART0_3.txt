[1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane [30, 31]."

[3] "Ge et al. [32] had used ESR and UV-DRS to probe the active site for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst, and found that species with high oxidation state (Cr5+ or Cr6+) are important for the reaction."

[4] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[5] "Mimura et al. [39] used FTIR and XAFS to probe the active species and role of CO2 for the ODH of ethane over Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. They found that there existed a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr3+ species in which a Cr6+ species was reduced to Cr3+ by ethane treatment, and CO2 treatment led to reoxidation to Cr6+ species."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been an important focus in dehydrogenation processes since their discovery. Key developments and research areas include:

1. Active sites: Research has shown that chromium species in higher oxidation states, particularly Cr5+ and Cr6+, are crucial for catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Support materials: Various supports have been investigated, including silica-based materials like SBA-15, which can provide high surface areas and improve dispersion of active chromium species.

3. Promoters: Cerium has been found to enhance catalytic activity by improving metal-support interactions and the dispersion of active chromium components.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have revealed a redox cycle involving Cr6+ and Cr3+ species during the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. This cycle is important for maintaining catalyst activity.

5. Characterization techniques: Advanced methods such as ESR, UV-DRS, FTIR, and XAFS have been employed to probe active sites and understand reaction mechanisms.

6. Industrial applications: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various dehydrogenation processes in the petrochemical industry.

These developments have contributed to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, with research focusing on improving activity, selectivity, and stability through understanding of catalyst structure and reaction mechanisms.
