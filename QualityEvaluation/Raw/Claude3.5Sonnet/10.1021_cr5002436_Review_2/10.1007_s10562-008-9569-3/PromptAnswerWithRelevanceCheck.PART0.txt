[1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[3] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane [31, 40]."

[4] "Indeed, the reduction of the Cr6+ to Cr3+ was demonstrated by the above TPR analysis. At the same time, the reduced Cr3+ species was also reoxygenated to Cr6+ species by CO2 which will be proven by the following TPR, as a result, the high dehydrogenation activity Cr6+ species can be obtained by the Cr redox cycle during the ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2."

While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933, it does highlight some key developments in their evolution for dehydrogenation processes:

1. Supported chromium-based catalysts have become widely studied and shown excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

2. Research has focused on improving catalyst activity through metal-support interactions and better dispersion of the active metal component. For example, ceria has been used as a reducible oxide support to enhance catalytic activity.

3. Understanding the role of chromium oxidation states has been an important area of study. Higher oxidation state chromium species (e.g. Cr6+) have been identified as key for higher catalytic activity in ethane dehydrogenation.

4. The reaction mechanism involving a redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species has been elucidated. During ethane dehydrogenation, Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+, which can then be reoxidized back to the more active Cr6+ state by CO2.

5. Support materials like SBA-15 mesoporous silica have been explored to improve chromium dispersion and catalyst performance.

6. The use of promoters like cerium has been investigated to enhance activity and stability of chromium catalysts.

While not providing a complete historical perspective, these developments showcase how research has advanced chromium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation through studying structure-activity relationships, active sites, supports, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.
