[1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[3] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane [31, 40]."

[4] "Indeed, the reduction of the Cr6+ to Cr3+ was demonstrated by the above TPR analysis. At the same time, the reduced Cr3+ species was also reoxygenated to Cr6+ species by CO2 which will be proven by the following TPR, as a result, the high dehydrogenation activity Cr6+ species can be obtained by the Cr redox cycle during the ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2."

While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933, it does highlight some key developments in their evolution for dehydrogenation processes:

1. Supported chromium-based catalysts have become widely studied and shown excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

2. Research has focused on improving catalyst activity through metal-support interactions and better dispersion of the active metal component. For example, ceria has been used as a reducible oxide support to enhance catalytic activity.

3. Understanding the role of chromium oxidation states has been an important area of study. Higher oxidation state chromium species (e.g. Cr6+) have been identified as key for higher catalytic activity in ethane dehydrogenation.

4. The reaction mechanism involving a redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species has been elucidated. During ethane dehydrogenation, Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+, which can then be reoxidized back to the more active Cr6+ state by CO2.

5. Support materials like SBA-15 mesoporous silica have been explored to improve chromium dispersion and catalyst performance.

6. The use of promoters like cerium has been investigated to enhance activity and stability of chromium catalysts.

While not providing a complete historical perspective, these developments showcase how research has advanced chromium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation through studying structure-activity relationships, active sites, supports, promoters, and reaction mechanisms.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实突出了它们在脱氢过程中演变的一些关键发展：

1. 负载型铬基催化剂已被广泛研究，并在氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中表现出优异的性能。

2. 研究重点是通过金属-载体相互作用和活性金属组分的更好分散来提高催化剂活性。例如，使用氧化铈作为可还原氧化物载体来提高催化活性。

3. 理解铬氧化态的作用一直是一个重要的研究领域。高氧化态的铬物种（如Cr6+）被确定为乙烷脱氢反应中获得更高催化活性的关键。

4. 阐明了涉及Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间氧化还原循环的反应机理。在乙烷脱氢过程中，Cr6+被还原为Cr3+，然后可以被CO2重新氧化回更活跃的Cr6+状态。

5. 探索了如SBA-15介孔二氧化硅等载体材料，以改善铬的分散性和催化剂性能。

6. 研究了使用铈等助剂来增强铬催化剂的活性和稳定性。

虽然没有提供完整的历史视角，但这些发展展示了研究如何通过研究结构-活性关系、活性位点、载体、助剂和反应机理来推进铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应中的应用。
