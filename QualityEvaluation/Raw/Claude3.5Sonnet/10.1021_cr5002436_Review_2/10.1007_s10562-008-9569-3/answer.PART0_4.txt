The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments in recent research on these catalysts for dehydrogenation processes:

1. Supported chromium-based catalysts have shown excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

2. Research has focused on improving catalyst activity through metal-support interactions and better dispersion of the active metal component. Ceria has been used as a reducible oxide support to enhance catalytic activity.

3. Studies have identified that chromium species in higher oxidation states are key to achieving higher catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation.

4. The redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species has been found to play an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2.

5. Recent research has explored the use of mesoporous supports like SBA-15 and the addition of promoters like cerium to further improve catalyst performance.

While the literature doesn't cover the full evolution since 1933, it demonstrates ongoing research into optimizing chromium oxide catalysts through investigating support materials, promoters, active sites, and reaction mechanisms for dehydrogenation processes.

这篇文献并没有提供自1933年以来氧化铬基催化剂的全面历史。但是，它确实强调了这些催化剂在脱氢过程中最近研究的一些关键发展：

1. 负载型铬基催化剂在氧化脱氢(ODH)反应中表现出优异的性能。

2. 研究重点是通过金属-载体相互作用和活性金属组分的更好分散来提高催化剂活性。氧化铈被用作可还原氧化物载体来增强催化活性。

3. 研究表明，高氧化态的铬物种是实现乙烷脱氢更高催化活性的关键。

4. Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的氧化还原循环在CO2存在下的乙烷ODH反应中发挥重要作用。

5. 最近的研究探索了使用SBA-15等介孔载体和添加铈等助剂来进一步提高催化剂性能。

虽然文献没有涵盖自1933年以来的完整演变，但它展示了通过研究载体材料、助剂、活性位点和反应机理来优化氧化铬催化剂的持续研究，以用于脱氢过程。
