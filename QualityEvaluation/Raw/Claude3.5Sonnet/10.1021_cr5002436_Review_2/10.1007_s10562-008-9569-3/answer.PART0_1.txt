[1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[3] "The chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the dehydrogenation of light alkane [30, 31]."

[4] "Mimura et al. [39] used FTIR and XAFS to probe the active species and role of CO2 for the ODH of ethane over Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. They found that there existed a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr3+ species in which a Cr6+ species was reduced to Cr3+ by ethane treatment, and CO2 treatment led to reoxidation to Cr6+ species."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their development and significance in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Supported chromium-based catalysts have shown excellent performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

2. Research has focused on various aspects of these catalysts:

   - Support materials: The use of ceria as a reducible oxide support has been explored to enhance catalytic activity through metal-support interactions and improved active metal dispersion.
   
   - Active sites: High oxidation state chromium species have been identified as key to higher catalytic activity in light alkane dehydrogenation.
   
   - Reaction mechanisms: Studies have revealed a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr3+ species in the ODH of ethane with CO2. This cycle involves the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ by ethane and reoxidation to Cr6+ by CO2.

3. The research has focused on understanding the structure-activity relationships, the role of promoters (such as ceria), and the reaction mechanisms to improve catalyst performance.

While the literature doesn't explicitly mention industrial applications, the focus on ethane dehydrogenation suggests potential applications in the production of ethylene, an important industrial chemical.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实强调了它们在脱氢过程中发展和重要性的一些关键方面：

1. 负载型铬基催化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现出优异的性能。

2. 研究集中在这些催化剂的各个方面：

   - 载体材料：探索了使用氧化铈作为可还原氧化物载体，通过金属-载体相互作用和改善活性金属分散性来增强催化活性。
   
   - 活性位点：高氧化态铬物种被确定为轻烷烃脱氢反应中催化活性较高的关键。
   
   - 反应机理：研究揭示了在乙烷与CO2的ODH反应中涉及Cr6+/Cr3+物种的氧化还原循环。这个循环包括乙烷还原Cr6+到Cr3+，以及CO2将Cr3+重新氧化为Cr6+。

3. 研究重点是理解结构-活性关系、促进剂（如氧化铈）的作用以及反应机理，以改善催化剂性能。

虽然文献没有明确提到工业应用，但对乙烷脱氢的关注表明它可能在乙烯（一种重要的工业化学品）的生产中有潜在应用。
