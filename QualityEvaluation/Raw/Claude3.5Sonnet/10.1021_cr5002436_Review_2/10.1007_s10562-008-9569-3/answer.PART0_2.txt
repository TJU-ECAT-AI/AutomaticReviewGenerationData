[1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[3] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane [31, 40]."

[4] "Indeed, the reduction of the Cr6+ to Cr3+ was demonstrated by the above TPR analysis. At the same time, the reduced Cr3+ species was also reoxygenated to Cr6+ species by CO2 which will be proven by the following TPR, as a result, the high dehydrogenation activity Cr6+ species can be obtained by the Cr redox cycle during the ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments in this field:

Chromium-based catalysts have shown excellent performance for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions. Research has focused on improving their activity through various means:

1. Support materials: Using ceria as a reducible oxide support can enhance catalytic activity through metal-support interactions and improved dispersion of the active metal.

2. Active sites: Chromium species in higher oxidation states, particularly Cr6+, are key to higher catalytic activity in ethane dehydrogenation.

3. Reaction mechanisms: A redox cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ plays an important role in the ODH of ethane with CO2. Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ during dehydrogenation, then reoxidized back to Cr6+ by CO2.

4. Promoters: While not explicitly mentioned, the study investigates cerium as a promoter for chromium catalysts, showing its beneficial effects on catalyst performance.

The research focuses on understanding and optimizing these aspects to improve catalyst performance in dehydrogenation processes, particularly for ethane to ethylene conversion using CO2 as an oxidant.

虽然文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实强调了该领域的一些关键发展：

铬基催化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现出优异的性能。研究重点在于通过各种方式提高它们的活性：

1. 载体材料：使用氧化铈作为可还原的氧化物载体可以通过金属-载体相互作用和改善活性金属的分散性来增强催化活性。

2. 活性位点：高氧化态的铬物种，特别是Cr6+，是乙烷脱氢反应中提高催化活性的关键。

3. 反应机理：Cr6+和Cr3+之间的氧化还原循环在CO2存在下的乙烷ODH反应中起着重要作用。Cr6+在脱氢过程中被还原为Cr3+，然后被CO2重新氧化回Cr6+。

4. 助剂：虽然没有明确提及，但该研究调查了铈作为铬催化剂的助剂，显示了其对催化剂性能的有益影响。

研究的重点是理解和优化这些方面，以改善催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能，特别是使用CO2作为氧化剂将乙烷转化为乙烯的过程。
