          [1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[3] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane [31, 40]."

[4] "Indeed, the reduction of the Cr6+ to Cr3+ was demonstrated by the above TPR analysis. At the same time, the reduced Cr3+ species was also reoxygenated to Cr6+ species by CO2 which will be proven by the following TPR, as a result, the high dehydrogenation activity Cr6+ species can be obtained by the Cr redox cycle during the ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2."

[5] "Ge et al. [32] had used ESR and UV-DRS to probe the active site for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst, and found that species with high oxidation state (Cr5+ or Cr6+) are important for the reaction."

[6] "Mimura et al. [39] used FTIR and XAFS to probe the active species and role of CO2 for the ODH of ethane over Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. They found that there existed a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr3+ species in which a Cr6+ species was reduced to Cr3+ by ethane treatment, and CO2 treatment led to reoxidation to Cr6+ species."

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933, it highlights several key developments and research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Supported chromium-based catalysts have shown excellent performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions.

2. Active sites: Research has identified that chromium species in higher oxidation states, particularly Cr5+ and Cr6+, are crucial for catalytic activity in dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Various supports have been investigated, including silica-based materials and ceria. Ceria, as a reducible oxide support, has been found to enhance catalytic activity through metal-support interactions and improved dispersion of active chromium components.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have revealed a redox cycle involving Cr6+ and Cr3+ species during the ODH of ethane with CO2. This cycle is important for maintaining catalyst activity, where Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by ethane and then reoxidized to Cr6+ by CO2.

5. Characterization techniques: Advanced methods such as ESR, UV-DRS, FTIR, TPR, and XAFS have been employed to probe active sites, understand reaction mechanisms, and analyze the oxidation states of chromium species.

6. Research focus: Ongoing studies aim to optimize chromium oxide catalysts by investigating support materials, promoters, active sites, and reaction mechanisms to improve activity, selectivity, and stability in dehydrogenation processes.

While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, chromium oxide catalysts are known to have important industrial applications in various dehydrogenation processes in the petrochemical industry, particularly in the production of light olefins like ethylene.

          虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它强调了几个对其在脱氢过程中的重要性有贡献的关键发展和研究重点领域：

1. 负载型铬基催化剂在氧化脱氢（ODH）反应中表现出优异的性能。

2. 活性位点：研究表明，高氧化态的铬物种，特别是Cr5+和Cr6+，对脱氢反应的催化活性至关重要。

3. 载体材料：研究了各种载体，包括基于二氧化硅的材料和氧化铈。作为可还原氧化物载体的氧化铈被发现可以通过金属-载体相互作用和改善活性铬组分的分散性来增强催化活性。

4. 反应机理：研究揭示了在使用CO2进行乙烷氧化脱氢过程中，Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间存在一个氧化还原循环。这个循环对于维持催化剂活性很重要，其中Cr6+被乙烷还原为Cr3+，然后被CO2重新氧化为Cr6+。

5. 表征技术：采用了先进的方法如ESR、UV-DRS、FTIR、TPR和XAFS来探测活性位点、理解反应机理和分析铬物种的氧化态。

6. 研究重点：持续的研究旨在通过研究载体材料、助剂、活性位点和反应机理来优化铬氧化物催化剂，以提高脱氢过程中的活性、选择性和稳定性。

虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但众所周知，铬氧化物催化剂在石油化工行业的各种脱氢过程中有重要的工业应用，特别是在生产乙烯等轻烯烃方面。
