[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia- alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "No definite conclusion as to the role of the 2 + and 3 + valence states has been reached."

[3] "The oxidation, reduction and water treatments of chromia-alumina catalysts of different chromia concentrations have been investigated by e.s.r. and the surface composition, with respect to Cr2+ and Cr3+, was evaluated."

[4] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."

[5] "Preliminary studies showed that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation depends on the initial pressure of ethane which suggested first-order kinetics."

[6] "The results depicted in fig. 4 show that the rate of dehydrogenation proceeds much faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of ongoing research and applications:

1. A major focus is on understanding the oxidation-reduction behavior of chromium ions in chromia-alumina catalysts.

2. There is ongoing research into the roles of Cr2+ and Cr3+ valence states in catalytic activity.

3. Electron spin resonance (e.s.r.) techniques are being used to investigate the surface composition of chromia-alumina catalysts with different chromia concentrations.

4. Ethane dehydrogenation is an important industrial application being studied.

5. Research is examining reaction kinetics, with findings suggesting first-order kinetics for ethane dehydrogenation.

6. Studies indicate that catalysts containing Cr2+ ions show faster rates of dehydrogenation compared to those with only Cr3+ ions.

While the document doesn't provide a comprehensive evolution of these catalysts since 1933, it demonstrates that research is ongoing in areas such as active sites (Cr2+ vs Cr3+), support materials (alumina), and reaction mechanisms (dehydrogenation). The focus on ethane dehydrogenation suggests this remains an important industrial application for chromium oxide-based catalysts.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史。然而，它确实突出了一些正在进行的研究和应用的关键方面：

1. 主要焦点是了解铬-氧化铝催化剂中铬离子的氧化还原行为。

2. 正在进行研究以了解Cr2+和Cr3+价态在催化活性中的作用。

3. 正在使用电子自旋共振（e.s.r.）技术来研究不同铬含量的铬-氧化铝催化剂的表面组成。

4. 乙烷脱氢是正在研究的一个重要工业应用。

5. 研究正在检验反应动力学，研究结果表明乙烷脱氢遵循一级动力学。

6. 研究表明，含有Cr2+离子的催化剂比只含有Cr3+离子的催化剂表现出更快的脱氢速率。

虽然该文献没有提供自1933年以来这些催化剂的全面演变，但它表明在活性位点（Cr2+与Cr3+）、载体材料（氧化铝）和反应机理（脱氢）等领域的研究仍在进行中。对乙烷脱氢的关注表明，这仍然是铬氧化物基催化剂的一个重要工业应用。
