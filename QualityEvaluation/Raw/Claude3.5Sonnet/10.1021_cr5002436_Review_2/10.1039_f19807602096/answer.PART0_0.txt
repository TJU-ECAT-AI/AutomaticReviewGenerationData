[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium : Cr203 + H2 2 CrO + H2O"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."

[4] "Evidence supporting the presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface has also been provided."

[5] "It is clearly possible, as seen from the trend of the results in fig- 3, that at the lowest chromium concentrations essentially all of the chromium ions have been reduced to Cr2+. On the other hand, at higher chromia concentrations bulk chromia (P-phase) is formed on the surface where the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+ may be affected by a stabilizing influence exerted by the alumina lattice."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of research focus and applications:

1. Surface chemistry: The ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions is highlighted as a crucial feature of chromia-alumina catalysts.

2. Active sites: The research focuses on the role of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions as active sites, with evidence provided for the presence of Cr2+ ions on the catalyst surface.

3. Support materials: Alumina is used as a support material for the chromia catalysts in this study.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The paper investigates the equilibrium between Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions, which depends on factors such as hydrogen and water vapor partial pressures.

5. Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the study of ethane dehydrogenation suggests potential applications in the production of ethylene, an important industrial chemical.

6. Structure: The research examines how chromia concentration affects the catalyst structure, noting differences between low and high chromia concentrations in terms of ion reduction and phase formation.

7. Promoters: The study does not mention the use of promoters.

This research contributes to the understanding of chromia-alumina catalysts by investigating the relationship between surface composition, active sites, and catalytic activity in dehydrogenation processes.
