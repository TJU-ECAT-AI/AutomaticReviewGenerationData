[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."

[4] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."

[5] "Preliminary kinetic results suggested that Cr2+ ions, which were identified in the present work, could play some role in the dehydrogenation of ethane by facilitating the breakage of a C-H bond as previously suggested."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of their research and applications:

1. The ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions is highlighted as a crucial feature of chromia-alumina catalysts.

2. Research has focused on understanding the valence states of chromium ions on the catalyst surface, particularly the roles of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions.

3. The study of reaction mechanisms, specifically for ethane dehydrogenation, is an important area of research. The paper suggests that Cr2+ ions may facilitate C-H bond breakage in this process.

4. The relationship between chromia concentration and the extent of reduction to Cr2+ is identified as a significant factor in catalyst behavior.

5. Catalytic activity for dehydrogenation processes, particularly ethane dehydrogenation, is a key application area being investigated.

6. The paper demonstrates ongoing research into the preparation methods and characterization techniques (such as ESR) for these catalysts.

While the paper doesn't provide a comprehensive evolution of these catalysts since 1933, it illustrates that research continues to focus on understanding the active sites, oxidation states, and reaction mechanisms of chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly in the context of dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献并没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实提供了一些关于其研究和应用的关键方面的见解：

1. 铬离子能够进行氧化还原反应被强调为铬-氧化铝催化剂的一个关键特征。

2. 研究的重点是理解催化剂表面铬离子的价态，特别是Cr2+和Cr3+离子的作用。

3. 反应机理的研究，特别是乙烷脱氢，是一个重要的研究领域。该论文提出Cr2+离子可能在这个过程中促进C-H键的断裂。

4. 铬氧化物浓度与还原为Cr2+的程度之间的关系被确定为影响催化剂行为的一个重要因素。

5. 脱氢过程的催化活性，特别是乙烷脱氢，是正在研究的一个关键应用领域。

6. 该论文展示了对这些催化剂的制备方法和表征技术（如ESR）的持续研究。

虽然这篇论文没有提供自1933年以来这些催化剂的全面演变，但它说明研究继续集中在理解铬氧化物基催化剂的活性位点、氧化态和反应机理上，特别是在脱氢反应的背景下。
