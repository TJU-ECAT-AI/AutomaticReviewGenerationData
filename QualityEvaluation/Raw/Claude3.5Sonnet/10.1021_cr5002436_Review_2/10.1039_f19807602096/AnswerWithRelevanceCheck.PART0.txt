          [1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium : Cr203 + H2 2 CrO + H2O"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."

[4] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."

[5] "It is clearly possible, as seen from the trend of the results in fig- 3, that at the lowest chromium concentrations essentially all of the chromium ions have been reduced to Cr2+. On the other hand, at higher chromia concentrations bulk chromia (P-phase) is formed on the surface where the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+ may be affected by a stabilizing influence exerted by the alumina lattice."

[6] "The oxidation, reduction and water treatments of chromia-alumina catalysts of different chromia concentrations have been investigated by e.s.r. and the surface composition, with respect to Cr2+ and Cr3+, was evaluated."

[7] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."

[8] "The rate of ethane dehydrogenation was followed by measuring the pressure change in a constant volume reaction vessel. The product, ethylene, was identified by mass analysis using an A.E.I. type MSlO mass spectrometer."

[9] "Preliminary studies showed that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation depends on the initial pressure of ethane which suggested first-order kinetics."

[10] "The results depicted in fig. 4 show that the rate of dehydrogenation proceeds much faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions."

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, it offers insights into key research areas and applications:

1. Surface chemistry and active sites: The ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions is highlighted as a crucial feature. Research focuses on understanding the roles of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions as active sites, with evidence suggesting that Cr2+ ions are more active for ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Structure and support materials: Alumina is used as a support material for chromia catalysts. The concentration of chromia on the alumina surface affects the extent of reduction to Cr2+, with lower concentrations favoring more complete reduction.

3. Characterization techniques: Electron spin resonance (ESR) is used to investigate the oxidation states and surface composition of chromium ions under different conditions.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The study explores the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation, suggesting that Cr2+ ions may facilitate C-H bond breakage.

5. Kinetics: Preliminary kinetic studies show that ethane dehydrogenation follows first-order kinetics and proceeds faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions.

6. Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the focus on ethane dehydrogenation implies potential applications in the production of ethylene, an important industrial chemical.

7. Preparation methods: The research involves investigating the effects of oxidation, reduction, and water treatments on chromia-alumina catalysts with different chromia concentrations.

This research contributes to the understanding of chromia-alumina catalysts by examining their surface composition, the role of different chromium oxidation states, and their performance in ethane dehydrogenation reactions.

          虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它提供了关于关键研究领域和应用的见解：

1. 表面化学和活性位点：铬离子进行氧化还原反应的能力被强调为一个关键特征。研究重点是理解Cr2+和Cr3+离子作为活性位点的作用，证据表明Cr2+离子在乙烷脱氢反应中更活跃。

2. 结构和载体材料：氧化铝被用作铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料。铝氧化物表面上的铬氧化物浓度影响还原为Cr2+的程度，较低的浓度有利于更完全的还原。

3. 表征技术：电子自旋共振（ESR）被用来研究不同条件下铬离子的氧化态和表面组成。

4. 反应机理：研究探讨了乙烷脱氢的机理，表明Cr2+离子可能促进C-H键的断裂。

5. 动力学：初步动力学研究表明，乙烷脱氢遵循一级动力学，并且在含有Cr2+离子的催化剂上进行得更快。

6. 工业应用：虽然没有明确说明，但对乙烷脱氢的关注暗示了在生产乙烯（一种重要的工业化学品）方面的潜在应用。

7. 制备方法：研究涉及考察氧化、还原和水处理对不同铬浓度的铬-氧化铝催化剂的影响。

这项研究通过考察铬-氧化铝催化剂的表面组成、不同铬氧化态的作用以及它们在乙烷脱氢反应中的性能，为理解这类催化剂做出了贡献。
