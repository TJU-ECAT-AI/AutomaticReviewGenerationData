[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."

[4] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."

[5] "It is clearly possible, as seen from the trend of the results in fig- 3, that at the lowest chromium concentrations essentially all of the chromium ions have been reduced to Cr2+. On the other hand, at higher chromia concentrations bulk chromia (P-phase) is formed on the surface where the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+ may be affected by a stabilizing influence exerted by the alumina lattice."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their significance in dehydrogenation processes:

1. The ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions is a crucial feature of chromia-alumina catalysts.

2. The surface composition of these catalysts, particularly the presence of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions, plays a significant role in their catalytic activity.

3. Research has focused on understanding the equilibrium between Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions on the catalyst surface, which is influenced by factors such as hydrogen and water vapor partial pressures.

4. The concentration of chromia on the alumina support affects the extent of reduction to Cr2+, with lower concentrations favoring more complete reduction.

5. Preliminary kinetic studies have shown that Cr2+ sites are more active than Cr3+ sites for ethane dehydrogenation.

6. The support material (alumina) appears to have a stabilizing influence on the chromia, affecting the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+.

7. Research has focused on characterization techniques such as electron spin resonance (ESR) to study the oxidation states and surface composition of chromium ions.

8. The study of reaction mechanisms, particularly the role of Cr2+ ions in facilitating C-H bond breakage, is an area of research interest.

While the document does not explicitly mention industrial applications, the focus on ethane dehydrogenation suggests that these catalysts are significant in the production of ethylene, an important industrial chemical.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了这些催化剂在脱氢过程中重要性的一些关键方面：

1. 铬离子能够进行氧化还原反应是铬氧化铝催化剂的一个关键特征。

2. 这些催化剂的表面组成，特别是Cr2+和Cr3+离子的存在，在其催化活性中起着重要作用。

3. 研究重点是了解催化剂表面Cr2+和Cr3+离子之间的平衡，这受到氢气和水蒸气分压等因素的影响。

4. 铝氧化物载体上的铬氧化物浓度影响还原为Cr2+的程度，较低的浓度有利于更完全的还原。

5. 初步动力学研究表明，Cr2+位点比Cr3+位点在乙烷脱氢反应中更活跃。

6. 载体材料（氧化铝）似乎对铬氧化物有稳定作用，影响还原为Cr2+的程度和容易程度。

7. 研究重点是使用电子自旋共振（ESR）等表征技术来研究铬离子的氧化态和表面组成。

8. 反应机理的研究，特别是Cr2+离子在促进C-H键断裂中的作用，是一个研究兴趣领域。

虽然文档没有明确提到工业应用，但对乙烷脱氢的关注表明这些催化剂在生产乙烯（一种重要的工业化学品）方面具有重要意义。
