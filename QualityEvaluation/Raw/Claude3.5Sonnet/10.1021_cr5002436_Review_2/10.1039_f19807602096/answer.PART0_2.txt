[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."

[4] "The rate of ethane dehydrogenation was followed by measuring the pressure change in a constant volume reaction vessel. The product, ethylene, was identified by mass analysis using an A.E.I. type MSlO mass spectrometer."

[5] "Preliminary studies showed that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation depends on the initial pressure of ethane which suggested first-order kinetics."

[6] "The results depicted in fig. 4 show that the rate of dehydrogenation proceeds much faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of research focus and applications for these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Surface chemistry: The ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions is highlighted as a crucial feature of chromia-alumina catalysts. Research has focused on understanding the valence states of chromium ions (Cr2+ and Cr3+) on the catalyst surface.

2. Structure and active sites: The study investigates the surface composition of chromia-alumina catalysts, particularly the presence and role of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions. Electron spin resonance (ESR) was used to analyze changes in chromium ion signals under different reduction conditions.

3. Support materials: Alumina is used as the support material for the chromium oxide catalysts in this study.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The research explores the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on chromia-alumina catalysts. It suggests that Cr2+ ions may facilitate the breakage of C-H bonds, leading to higher catalytic activity.

5. Industrial applications: While not explicitly stated, the focus on ethane dehydrogenation implies potential applications in the production of ethylene, an important industrial chemical.

6. Kinetics: The study includes preliminary kinetic investigations of ethane dehydrogenation, finding that the reaction follows first-order kinetics and proceeds faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions.

This research contributes to the understanding of chromia-alumina catalysts by examining their surface composition, the role of different chromium oxidation states, and their performance in ethane dehydrogenation reactions.

这篇文献并没有提供自1933年发现铬氧化物基催化剂以来的全面历史概述。然而，它确实提供了一些关于这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的研究重点和应用的关键方面的见解：

1. 表面化学：铬离子能够进行氧化还原反应被强调为铬-氧化铝催化剂的一个关键特征。研究重点在于理解催化剂表面铬离子的价态（Cr2+和Cr3+）。

2. 结构和活性位点：该研究调查了铬-氧化铝催化剂的表面组成，特别是Cr2+和Cr3+离子的存在和作用。电子自旋共振（ESR）被用来分析不同还原条件下铬离子信号的变化。

3. 载体材料：在这项研究中，氧化铝被用作铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料。

4. 反应机理：研究探讨了乙烷在铬-氧化铝催化剂上的脱氢机理。它表明Cr2+离子可能促进C-H键的断裂，从而导致更高的催化活性。

5. 工业应用：虽然没有明确说明，但对乙烷脱氢的关注暗示了在生产乙烯（一种重要的工业化学品）方面的潜在应用。

6. 动力学：该研究包括乙烷脱氢的初步动力学研究，发现反应遵循一级动力学，并且在含有Cr2+离子的催化剂上进行得更快。

这项研究通过考察铬-氧化铝催化剂的表面组成、不同铬氧化态的作用以及它们在乙烷脱氢反应中的性能，为理解这类催化剂做出了贡献。
