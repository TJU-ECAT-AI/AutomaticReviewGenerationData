[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium : Cr203 + H2 2 CrO + H2O"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."

[4] "Evidence supporting the presence of Cr2+ ions on the surface has also been provided."

[5] "It is clearly possible, as seen from the trend of the results in fig- 3, that at the lowest chromium concentrations essentially all of the chromium ions have been reduced to Cr2+. On the other hand, at higher chromia concentrations bulk chromia (P-phase) is formed on the surface where the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+ may be affected by a stabilizing influence exerted by the alumina lattice."
