[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

The document does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their evolution and significance in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Chromia-based catalysts are important for producing light olefins, which are increasingly used in reformulated gasoline and city diesel production.

2. Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface, which can exist as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, or Cr2+ depending on various factors such as pretreatment, chromium content, and support material.

3. Recent studies have attributed the dehydrogenation activity to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, particularly in chromia/alumina and chromia/zirconia catalysts with low chromium content (0.04-2.55 wt%).

4. Earlier research suggested that Cr2+ species might also be active in catalysts with higher chromium content (0.1-7.3 wt%).

5. The document mentions ongoing research into the effects of different reducing agents on catalyst activity and the importance of understanding the origin of dehydrogenation activity for optimal catalyst and process design.

While the document does not provide a complete historical overview, it demonstrates that research has focused on understanding the active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms of chromia-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

该文档并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物催化剂的完整历史，但它确实强调了它们在脱氢过程中演变和重要性的一些关键方面：

1. 铬基催化剂对于生产轻烯烃很重要，这些轻烯烃越来越多地用于改性汽油和城市柴油的生产。

2. 研究重点在于理解催化剂表面铬的氧化态，根据各种因素（如预处理、铬含量和载体材料），铬可以存在为Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+或Cr2+。

3. 最近的研究将脱氢活性归因于配位不饱和的Cr3+物种，特别是在低铬含量（0.04-2.55 wt%）的铬/氧化铝和铬/氧化锆催化剂中。

4. 早期研究表明，在铬含量较高（0.1-7.3 wt%）的催化剂中，Cr2+物种也可能具有活性。

5. 该文档提到了正在进行的关于不同还原剂对催化剂活性影响的研究，以及理解脱氢活性起源对于最优催化剂和工艺设计的重要性。

虽然该文档没有提供完整的历史概述，但它表明研究重点集中在理解铬基催化剂用于脱氢过程的活性位点、载体材料和反应机理上。
