[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support"

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas:

1. Industrial applications: Chromia-based catalysts are important for dehydrogenation processes to produce light olefins, which are used in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel.

2. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface. Chromium can exist in different oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium content, and support material.

3. Active sites: Recent studies have attributed the dehydrogenation activity to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, although earlier research also suggested the activity of Cr2+ species.

4. Support materials: The literature mentions alumina and zirconia as support materials for chromia catalysts.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The document discusses research into the effects of different reducing agents on catalyst activity, indicating ongoing efforts to understand reaction mechanisms.

While the literature provides insights into current research focus areas, it does not offer a historical perspective on the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or a comprehensive overview of all industrial applications.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史。然而，它确实强调了它们目前的重要性和研究重点领域的一些关键方面：

1. 工业应用：铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中很重要，用于生产轻烯烃，这些轻烯烃用于生产改良汽油和城市柴油的组分。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点是了解催化剂表面铬的氧化态。铬可以以不同的氧化态（6+、5+、3+或2+）存在，这取决于预处理、铬含量和载体材料。

3. 活性位点：最近的研究将脱氢活性归因于配位不饱和的Cr3+物种，尽管早期研究也提出了Cr2+物种的活性。

4. 载体材料：文献提到氧化铝和氧化锆作为铬催化剂的载体材料。

5. 反应机理：该文档讨论了不同还原剂对催化剂活性的影响的研究，表明正在努力理解反应机理。

虽然该文献提供了当前研究重点领域的见解，但它并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的历史视角，也没有提供所有工业应用的全面概述。
