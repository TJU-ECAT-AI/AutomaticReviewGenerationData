[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas:

1. Chromia-based catalysts are important for dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of light olefins for reformulated gasoline and city diesel components.

2. Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface, which can exist as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, or Cr2+, depending on various factors such as pretreatment, chromium content, and support material.

3. Recent studies have attributed dehydrogenation activity to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species in chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with low chromium content (0.04-2.55 wt%).

4. Earlier research on catalysts with higher chromium content (0.1-7.3 wt%) suggested that Cr2+ species might also be active in dehydrogenation.

5. The literature mentions alumina and zirconia as support materials for chromia catalysts.

6. Research has explored the effects of different reducing agents (such as hydrogen, methane, n-butane, and carbon monoxide) on catalyst activity and selectivity.

While the document does not provide a complete historical perspective, it demonstrates ongoing research interest in optimizing chromia-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, with a focus on understanding active sites, support materials, and the impact of different pretreatment methods.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了它们当前重要性和研究重点领域的一些关键方面：

1. 铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中很重要，特别是在生产用于改良汽油和城市柴油成分的轻质烯烃方面。

2. 研究重点是了解催化剂表面铬的氧化态，根据预处理、铬含量和载体材料等各种因素，可以存在Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+或Cr2+。

3. 最近的研究将脱氢活性归因于低铬含量（0.04-2.55 wt%）的铬/氧化铝或铬/氧化锆催化剂中的配位不饱和Cr3+物种。

4. 早期对高铬含量（0.1-7.3 wt%）催化剂的研究表明，Cr2+物种在脱氢中也可能是活性的。

5. 文献提到氧化铝和氧化锆作为铬催化剂的载体材料。

6. 研究探索了不同还原剂（如氢气、甲烷、正丁烷和一氧化碳）对催化剂活性和选择性的影响。

虽然该文档没有提供完整的历史视角，但它表明在优化铬基催化剂用于脱氢过程方面持续存在研究兴趣，重点是理解活性位点、载体材料以及不同预处理方法的影响。
