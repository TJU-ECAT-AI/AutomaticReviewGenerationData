[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support"

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of their current applications and research focus:

1. Industrial applications: Chromia-based catalysts are used in dehydrogenation processes to produce light olefins, which are important components in reformulated gasoline and city diesel.

2. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface. Cr may exist in different oxidation states (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on pretreatment, chromium content, and the nature of the support material.

3. Active species: Recent studies have attributed the dehydrogenation activity to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species in chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with low chromium content (0.04-2.55 wt%). However, earlier studies with higher chromium content (0.1-7.3 wt%) have also suggested activity of Cr2+ species.

4. Support materials: The literature mentions alumina and zirconia as support materials for chromia catalysts.

5. Research focus: Current research appears to be centered on understanding the nature of active sites, the effect of different pretreatments, and the influence of chromium content on catalyst performance.

The document does not provide information on the evolution of these catalysts since 1933, promoters, or detailed reaction mechanisms.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史，但它确实提供了一些关于它们当前应用和研究重点的见解：

1. 工业应用：铬基催化剂用于脱氢过程，生产轻质烯烃，这是改良汽油和城市柴油的重要组成部分。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点在于理解催化剂表面铬的氧化态。根据预处理、铬含量和载体材料的性质，Cr可能以不同的氧化态（6+、5+、3+或2+）存在。

3. 活性物种：最近的研究将脱氢活性归因于铬含量较低（0.04-2.55 wt%）的铬/氧化铝或铬/氧化锆催化剂中的配位不饱和Cr3+物种。然而，早期对铬含量较高（0.1-7.3 wt%）的研究也表明Cr2+物种具有活性。

4. 载体材料：文献提到氧化铝和氧化锆作为铬催化剂的载体材料。

5. 研究重点：当前研究似乎集中在理解活性位点的性质、不同预处理的影响，以及铬含量对催化剂性能的影响。

文献没有提供自1933年以来这些催化剂的演变信息，也没有提供关于助剂或详细反应机理的信息。
