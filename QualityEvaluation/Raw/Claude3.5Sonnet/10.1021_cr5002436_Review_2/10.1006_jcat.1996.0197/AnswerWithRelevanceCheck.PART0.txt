          [1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

[4] "Since there is no general agreement about the effect of reducing agent on the initial activity, the subject was studied further in this work using a FTIR gas analyzer."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it offers insights into their current applications and research focus areas:

1. Industrial applications: Chromia-based catalysts are used in dehydrogenation processes to produce light olefins, which are important components in reformulated gasoline and city diesel production.

2. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface, which can exist as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, or Cr2+. The specific oxidation state depends on pretreatment conditions, chromium content, and the nature of the support material.

3. Active species: Recent studies have attributed the dehydrogenation activity to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species in chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with low chromium content (0.04-2.55 wt%). Earlier research on catalysts with higher chromium content (0.1-7.3 wt%) suggested that Cr2+ species might also be active.

4. Support materials: The literature mentions alumina and zirconia as support materials for chromia catalysts.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Current research is focused on understanding the effect of different reducing agents on the initial activity of the catalyst, using techniques such as FTIR gas analysis to monitor the early stages of the reaction.

While the document does not provide a complete historical perspective, it demonstrates that research on chromium oxide-based catalysts is ongoing, with efforts to optimize their performance in dehydrogenation processes by understanding the nature of active sites, the impact of various pretreatment conditions, and reaction mechanisms.

          该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史。然而，它确实提供了一些关于其当前应用和研究重点领域的见解：

1. 工业应用：铬基催化剂用于脱氢过程，生产轻质烯烃，这是重整汽油和城市柴油生产中的重要组成部分。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点是了解催化剂表面铬的氧化态，可以存在为Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+或Cr2+。具体的氧化态取决于预处理条件、铬含量和载体材料的性质。

3. 活性物种：最近的研究将脱氢活性归因于低铬含量（0.04-2.55 wt%）的铬/氧化铝或铬/氧化锆催化剂中的配位不饱和Cr3+物种。早期对高铬含量（0.1-7.3 wt%）催化剂的研究表明，Cr2+物种也可能是活性的。

4. 载体材料：文献提到氧化铝和氧化锆作为铬催化剂的载体材料。

5. 反应机理：当前研究集中在理解不同还原剂对催化剂初始活性的影响，使用如FTIR气体分析等技术来监测反应的早期阶段。

虽然该文档未提供完整的历史视角，但它表明铬氧化物基催化剂的研究仍在进行中，努力通过理解活性位点的性质、各种预处理条件的影响和反应机理来优化其在脱氢过程中的性能。
