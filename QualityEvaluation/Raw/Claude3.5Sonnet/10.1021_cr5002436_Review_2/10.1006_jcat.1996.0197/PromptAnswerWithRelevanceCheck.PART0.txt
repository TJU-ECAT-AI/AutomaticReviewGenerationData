[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

The document does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their evolution and significance in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Chromia-based catalysts are important for producing light olefins, which are increasingly used in reformulated gasoline and city diesel production.

2. Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium on the catalyst surface, which can exist as Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, or Cr2+ depending on various factors such as pretreatment, chromium content, and support material.

3. Recent studies have attributed the dehydrogenation activity to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, particularly in chromia/alumina and chromia/zirconia catalysts with low chromium content (0.04-2.55 wt%).

4. Earlier research suggested that Cr2+ species might also be active in catalysts with higher chromium content (0.1-7.3 wt%).

5. The document mentions ongoing research into the effects of different reducing agents on catalyst activity and the importance of understanding the origin of dehydrogenation activity for optimal catalyst and process design.

While the document does not provide a complete historical overview, it demonstrates that research has focused on understanding the active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms of chromia-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
