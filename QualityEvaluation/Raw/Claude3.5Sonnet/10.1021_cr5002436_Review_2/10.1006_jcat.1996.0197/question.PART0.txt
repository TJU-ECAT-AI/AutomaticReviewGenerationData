The initial activity of chromia/alumina catalyst (13 wt% Cr) in
n-butane dehydrogenation was studied in a flow reactor at 853 K.
The initial activity was determined by on-line FTIR gas analysis,
which enabled sampling of the gaseous product mixture at a time
resolution of seconds. The catalysts were processed in repeated cy-
cles of oxidation, reduction, and dehydrogenation using n-butane,
methane, hydrogen, or carbon monoxide as reducing agents. With
n-butane, methane, and hydrogen the dehydrogenation activity was
associated with Cr3+ species apparently formed in the reduction of
high-valence Cr species. The catalyst reduced with carbon mono-
xide at 853 K showed poor initial selectivity for butenes and, rela-
tive to the other catalysts, stronger formation of coke in dehydro-
genation. The initial selectivity for butenes increased with time on
stream, however, and within 2 min reached the level obtained with
the other catalysts. Simultaneous data relating the initial activity,
coke content, and some of the physicochemical properties of the
catalyst indicated that the surfaces of all catalysts were modified to
some extent by the successive reaction cycles.

INTRODUCTION
Light olefins will be of growing importance in the pro-
duction of components for reformulated gasoline and city
diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehy-
drogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia.
Because of thermodynamic limitations, the dehydrogena-
tion is carried out at elevated temperatures, and the catalyst
is rapidly deactivated by coke deposition (1). The combi-
nation of the high endothermicity of dehydrogenation and
the deactivation of the catalyst represents a particularly
difficult challenge for process and catalyst designers. One
approach to solving these problems is to run exothermic
reactions between moderately short dehydrogenation pe-
riods (cyclic reactor operation). The obvious exothermic
reaction is burning of the coke. Prereduction of the catalyst
can also be included in the operation, since high-valence
chromium, inactive in dehydrogenation (2), is produced
during the regeneration. In the design of optimal dehy-
drogenation catalysts and processes, understanding of the
origin of the dehydrogenation activity would be of great
value.
The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has
revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different ox-
idation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pre-
treatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4).
When supported by alumina, chromium mainly occurs in
its 3+ oxidation state on a reduced surface (3). Recently,
the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chro-
mia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been at-
tributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57),
although some earlier studies where the Cr content was be-
tween 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+
species as well (811). According to De Rossi et al. (5),
prereduction of the chromia/alumina catalyst with carbon
monoxide or hydrogen before propane dehydrogenation
does not influence the activity. In a study of the aroma-
tization activity of prereduced chromia/alumina catalysts
(10.5 wt% Cr), Gr
unert et al. (12) likewise found that the
nature of the reducing agent (H2, CH4, n-C6H14, or CO)
did not influence the activity. Gorriz et al. (2) nevertheless
found slight differences in the dehydrogenation activity de-
pending on the reducing agent (H2, C3H8, or CO). Follow-
ing the reaction for several hours, while determining the pro
duct distribution with a gas chromatograph, they suggested
that the main differences occured during the first 10 min on
stream.
Since there is no general agreement about the effect of
reducing agent on the initial activity, the subject was stud-
ied further in this work using a FTIR gas analyzer. Unlike
gas chromatography, the FTIR technique allowed us to
continuously monitor the very first stages of the reaction
and it thus provided a suitable way of studying the initial
dehydrogenation activity on a prereduced surface. The
catalysts were processed in repeated cycles of oxidation,
reduction, and dehydrogenation using n-butane, methane,
hydrogen, or carbon monoxide as reducing agents. The
origin of the dehydrogenation activity is discussed in light
of the initial activity and some physicochemical properties
of the catalyst.

EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
A γ -alumina layer (36 m) carried by a metallic sheet of
cylindrical shape was used as support for the chromia cata-
lysts (13, 14). The weight of the alumina layer corresponded
to 26 wt% of the weight of the sheet. After heating at 1027 K
in air for 2 h, the alumina was impregnated with an aqueous
solution of Cr(NO3)3 · 9H2O. Before use, the samples were
dried at 400 K for 1 h and calcined in air at 873 K for 16 h.
The alumina layer contained 13 wt% chromium (instru-
mental neutron-activation analysis, INAA), corresponding
to the chromium content of commercial chromia/alumina
catalysts (15). The calcined catalysts contained Cr2O3 crys-
tallites (Siemens Diffrac 500/X-ray source CuKα). The sur-
face areas of the fresh and used catalysts were determined
by nitrogen adsorption and condensation (Micromeritics
ASAP 2400). The catalysts were not separated from the
metallic sheet for the analysis of BET areas and thus the
reported BET areas are quite low. The specific BET area
of alumina separated from the metallic sheet was 160 m2/g.
X-ray photoelectron spectra of the catalysts were
recorded with a Surface Science Instruments (S.S.I./Fisons)
X-probe model 101 spectrometer. The spectrometer was
equipped with a monochromatized AlKα X-ray source. The
catalyst samples for XPS analysis were reduced in the test
reactor and were inertly transferred to the glove box of the
spectrometer in a closed reactor tube. Reduction of Cr6+
by impinging X rays during XPS analysis was minimized
by using a short analysis time. The curve fitting of Cr 2p3/2
spectra was accomplished with a standard peak synthesis
program. The Al 2p line of the alumina support assumed
to be at 74.5 eV was used as an internal binding energy
