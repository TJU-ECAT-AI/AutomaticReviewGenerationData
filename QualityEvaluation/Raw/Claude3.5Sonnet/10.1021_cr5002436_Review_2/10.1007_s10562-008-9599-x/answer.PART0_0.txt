[1] "Catalysts based on chromia have received much attention due to their favorable properties in various important processes. Examples are numerous and include catalytic oxidation of organic compounds [13], large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene over Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts [4], potential use of chromia supported catalysts in the processes of chlorinated carbon removal [5], and others."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane [6, 7]."

[3] "Widespread application of chromia supported catalysts and the rich chemistry of chromium compounds laid ground for a steady interest towards the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions [6, 7, 9, 10]."

[4] "However, despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include:

1. Catalytic oxidation of organic compounds
2. Large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene (Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts)
3. Potential use in chlorinated carbon removal processes
4. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene (CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts)

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Structure of supported chromium oxides
2. Nature of active sites
3. Reaction mechanisms
4. Support materials (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3)
5. Oxidation state of active chromium species (debate between Cr2+, Cr3+, or both)

The ongoing research in these areas has led to a better understanding of chromia-based catalysts and their applications in various industrial processes, particularly in dehydrogenation reactions.
