[1] "Catalysts based on chromia have received much attention due to their favorable properties in various important processes. Examples are numerous and include catalytic oxidation of organic compounds [13], large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene over Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts [4], potential use of chromia supported catalysts in the processes of chlorinated carbon removal [5], and others."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane [6, 7]."

[3] "Widespread application of chromia supported catalysts and the rich chemistry of chromium compounds laid ground for a steady interest towards the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions [6, 7, 9, 10]."

[4] "However, despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17]."
