[1] "Catalysts based on chromia have received much attention due to their favorable properties in various important processes. Examples are numerous and include catalytic oxidation of organic compounds [13], large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene over Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts [4], potential use of chromia supported catalysts in the processes of chlorinated carbon removal [5], and others. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane [6, 7]."

[2] "Widespread application of chromia supported catalysts and the rich chemistry of chromium compounds laid ground for a steady interest towards the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions [6, 7, 9, 10]. However, despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17]."

[3] "There are quite a few approaches to prepare chromia-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes including impregnation, coprecipitation and atomic layer epitaxy. The need to achieve high dispersion dictates the necessity of anchoring chromia species onto the surface of the support."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have significantly evolved since their discovery in 1933, finding applications in various important industrial processes. Key applications include:

1. Catalytic oxidation of organic compounds
2. Large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene (Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts)
3. Potential use in chlorinated carbon removal processes
4. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene (CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts)

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Structure of supported chromium oxides
2. Nature of active sites
3. Reaction mechanisms
4. Oxidation state of active chromium species (debate between Cr2+, Cr3+, or both)
5. Support materials (e.g., silica, alumina)
6. Preparation methods (impregnation, coprecipitation, atomic layer epitaxy)
7. Achieving high dispersion of chromia species on support surfaces

The ongoing research in these areas has led to a better understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts and their performance in dehydrogenation processes, contributing to their continued industrial significance and development of improved catalyst formulations.
