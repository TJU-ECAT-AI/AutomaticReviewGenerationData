[1] "Catalysts based on chromia have received much attention due to their favorable properties in various important processes. Examples are numerous and include catalytic oxidation of organic compounds [13], large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene over Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts [4], potential use of chromia supported catalysts in the processes of chlorinated carbon removal [5], and others."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane [6, 7]."

[3] "Widespread application of chromia supported catalysts and the rich chemistry of chromium compounds laid ground for a steady interest towards the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions [6, 7, 9, 10]."

[4] "However, despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, finding applications in various important industrial processes. Key applications include:

1. Catalytic oxidation of organic compounds
2. Large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene (Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts)
3. Potential use in chlorinated carbon removal processes
4. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene (CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts)

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Structure of supported chromium oxides
2. Nature of active sites
3. Reaction mechanisms
4. Support materials (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3)
5. Oxidation state of active chromium species (debate between Cr2+, Cr3+, or both)

The ongoing research in these areas has led to a better understanding of chromia-based catalysts and their performance in various industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes. However, some aspects, such as the exact oxidation state of active chromium species, remain topics of debate and continued investigation.
