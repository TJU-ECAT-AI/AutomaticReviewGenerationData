[1] "Currently, propylene is primarily produced by the high temperature cracking of hydrocarbons; however, the controlled dehydrogenation of propane provides a useful alternative process [31–47]."

[2] "The endothermic dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, currently employed on an industrial scale, utilizes Cr-based catalysts with Al2O3 as a support and alkali metal promoters [32]."

[3] "Many of the best propane ODH catalysts are based on vanadium [48–51], and TMP-derived V/Zr/O catalysts perform at levels among the very best of these [29,30]."

[4] "Chromium XANES spectra of 2.5CrSiAl and 5CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K are similar to that for 10CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K, in that they exhibit significant amounts of tetrahedral Cr6+ species (Fig. 4)."

[5] "It has been previously observed that coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species are formed under typical propane DH conditions (upon reduction of Cr6+ species), and that these species are active sites [32,45]. Additionally, Cr3+ species in small amorphous clusters have been proposed as active DH sites [32]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been significant in dehydrogenation processes since their discovery in 1933. They have evolved to become a key industrial catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, utilizing alumina as a support and alkali metal promoters. Research has focused on several key areas:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have examined the role of different chromium species, particularly Cr3+ and Cr6+, in catalytic activity. Coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species, as well as Cr3+ in small amorphous clusters, have been identified as active sites for dehydrogenation.

2. Support materials: While alumina remains a common support, research has explored other materials like zirconia to improve catalyst performance.

3. Promoters: Alkali metals are used as promoters in industrial catalysts to enhance performance.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Research has investigated both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, with chromium catalysts showing promise in both areas.

5. Synthesis methods: New preparation techniques, such as the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method, have been developed to create highly dispersed and homogeneous catalysts.

The ongoing focus on chromium oxide catalysts reflects their continued importance in industrial dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane to propylene conversion. However, research also explores alternatives, such as vanadium-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, indicating a dynamic field of study in catalytic dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中一直具有重要意义。它们已经发展成为丙烷脱氢的关键工业催化剂，使用氧化铝作为载体和碱金属作为助剂。研究集中在几个关键领域：

1. 结构和活性位点：研究考察了不同铬物种，特别是Cr3+和Cr6+，在催化活性中的作用。配位不饱和和孤立的Cr3+物种，以及小型无定形簇中的Cr3+，已被确定为脱氢的活性位点。

2. 载体材料：虽然氧化铝仍然是常用的载体，但研究已经探索了其他材料如氧化锆，以提高催化剂性能。

3. 助剂：碱金属在工业催化剂中用作助剂，以提高性能。

4. 反应机理：研究已经调查了氧化和非氧化脱氢过程，铬催化剂在这两个领域都显示出前景。

5. 合成方法：已经开发了新的制备技术，如热解分子前驱体（TMP）方法，以创造高度分散和均匀的催化剂。

对氧化铬催化剂的持续关注反映了它们在工业脱氢过程中，特别是丙烷到丙烯的转化中的持续重要性。然而，研究也探索了替代品，如用于氧化脱氢的钒基催化剂，表明催化脱氢过程研究领域是动态的。
