[1] "Currently, propylene is primarily produced by the high temperature cracking of hydrocarbons; however, the controlled dehydrogenation of propane provides a useful alternative process [3147]."

[2] "The endothermic dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, currently employed on an industrial scale, utilizes Cr-based catalysts with Al2O3 as a support and alkali metal promoters [32]."

[3] "In studies on various chromium-based catalysts, DeRossi and co-workers found that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited increased activity over similarly prepared Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 materials [4245]."

[4] "Given the reported efficiency of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts, it was of interest to utilize the TMP cothermolysis method for the generation of such materials with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites."

[5] "For Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, it has been shown that coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species are formed under typical propane DH conditions (upon reduction of Cr6+ species), and that these species are active sites [32,45]. Additionally, Cr3+ species in small amorphous clusters have been proposed as active DH sites [32]."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, with key developments in industrial applications and research focus areas:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium-based catalysts have become widely used for the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene, providing an alternative to high-temperature hydrocarbon cracking.

2. Support materials: Research has focused on various support materials, with Al2O3 being commonly used in industrial applications. Studies have shown that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit increased activity compared to Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 materials.

3. Active sites: Research has identified coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Cr3+ species in small amorphous clusters have also been proposed as active sites.

4. Synthesis methods: New techniques, such as the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) cothermolysis method, have been developed to create catalysts with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites.

5. Promoters: Alkali metal promoters have been utilized in industrial Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Structure: Focus has been placed on creating catalysts with highly dispersed chromium centers and controlling the oxidation state of chromium (Cr3+ vs. Cr6+) to optimize catalytic performance.

7. Reaction mechanisms: Research has investigated the formation of active Cr3+ species under typical propane dehydrogenation conditions through the reduction of Cr6+ species.

These developments have contributed to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, driving improvements in catalyst efficiency and selectivity.
