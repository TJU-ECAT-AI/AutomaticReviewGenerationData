Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key developments include:

1. Focus on well-dispersed catalytic centers within support matrices to improve efficiency.

2. Industrial application in propane dehydrogenation, using Cr-based catalysts supported on Al2O3 with alkali metal promoters.

3. Research into various support materials, with Cr/ZrO2 catalysts showing increased activity compared to Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2.

4. Identification of coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species as active sites in Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5. Efforts to overcome limitations of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts, particularly in obtaining high surface area and thermally stable zirconia supports for large-scale applications.

Research has focused on understanding catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, promoters, and reaction mechanisms to improve performance in dehydrogenation processes. The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by the need for more efficient and selective catalysts in industrial applications, particularly in the production of propylene from propane.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经有了显著的发展。主要进展包括：

1. 关注在支撑基质中分散良好的催化中心，以提高效率。

2. 在工业丙烷脱氢应用中，使用以Al2O3为载体并添加碱金属助剂的Cr基催化剂。

3. 对各种载体材料的研究，发现Cr/ZrO2催化剂compared to Cr/Al2O3和Cr/SiO2表现出更高的活性。

4. 识别出在Cr/Al2O3催化剂中，配位不饱和和孤立的Cr3+物种是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。

5. 努力克服Cr/ZrO2催化剂的局限性，特别是在大规模应用中获得高比表面积和热稳定性良好的氧化锆载体。

研究重点集中在理解催化剂结构、活性位点、载体材料、助剂和反应机理，以提高脱氢过程的性能。这些催化剂的演变主要是由工业应用中对更高效和选择性催化剂的需求驱动的，特别是在从丙烷生产丙烯的过程中。
