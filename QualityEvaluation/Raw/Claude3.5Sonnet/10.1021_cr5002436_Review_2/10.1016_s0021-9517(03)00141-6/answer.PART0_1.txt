The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 has focused on several key areas:

1. Support materials: Research has explored various supports beyond the traditional Al2O3, such as ZrO2 and SiO2, to improve catalyst performance. Cr/ZrO2 catalysts have shown increased activity compared to Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2.

2. Active sites: Studies have identified coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. The focus has been on generating well-dispersed catalytic centers within the support matrix.

3. Synthesis methods: New techniques like thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) cothermolysis have been developed to create materials with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites.

4. Industrial applications: Chromium-based catalysts are primarily used for the industrial-scale endothermic dehydrogenation of propane. This process typically uses Cr-based catalysts with Al2O3 as a support and alkali metal promoters.

5. Promoters: Alkali metal promoters are used in industrial Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, though the specific effects are not detailed in the given text.

6. Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly discussed in the provided quotes, understanding the reaction mechanisms has likely been a focus area to improve catalyst performance and selectivity.

The research has continually aimed to improve catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability by optimizing these various aspects of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的演变主要集中在以下几个关键领域：

1. 载体材料：研究探索了除传统Al2O3之外的各种载体，如ZrO2和SiO2，以提高催化剂性能。Cr/ZrO2催化剂显示出比Cr/Al2O3和Cr/SiO2更高的活性。

2. 活性位点：研究已确定配位不饱和和孤立的Cr3+物种是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。重点是在载体基质中生成分散良好的催化中心。

3. 合成方法：开发了新的技术，如热解分子前驱体（TMP）共热解法，以创造具有高比表面积和高度分散活性位点的材料。

4. 工业应用：铬基催化剂主要用于工业规模的吸热丙烷脱氢过程。这个过程通常使用以Al2O3为载体并添加碱金属助剂的铬基催化剂。

5. 助剂：工业铬基催化剂中使用碱金属助剂进行丙烷脱氢，但给定文本中未详细说明其具体效果。

6. 反应机理：虽然在提供的引文中没有明确讨论，但了解反应机理可能一直是一个研究重点，以提高催化剂的性能和选择性。

研究一直致力于通过优化铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的这些各个方面，以提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
