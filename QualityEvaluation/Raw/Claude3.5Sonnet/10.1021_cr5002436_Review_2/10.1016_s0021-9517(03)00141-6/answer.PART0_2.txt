[1] "Currently, propylene is primarily produced by the high temperature cracking of hydrocarbons; however, the controlled dehydrogenation of propane provides a useful alternative process [3147]."

[2] "The endothermic dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, currently employed on an industrial scale, utilizes Cr-based catalysts with Al2O3 as a support and alkali metal promoters [32]."

[3] "Many of the best propane ODH catalysts are based on vanadium [4851], and TMP-derived V/Zr/O catalysts perform at levels among the very best of these [29,30]."

[4] "Given the reported efficiency of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts, it was of interest to utilize the TMP cothermolysis method for the generation of such materials with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites."

[5] "Use of the TMP-cothermolysis method has resulted in nCrSiZr materials with high surface areas after calcination at temperatures above those required for the propane DH reaction."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 has been driven by their significance in dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane dehydrogenation. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium-based catalysts are widely used for the controlled dehydrogenation of propane on an industrial scale, providing an alternative to high-temperature hydrocarbon cracking for propylene production.

2. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has been a primary support material for chromium catalysts. However, research has explored other supports, such as zirconia (ZrO2), to improve catalyst performance.

3. Promoters: Alkali metal promoters have been used to enhance the performance of chromium-based catalysts on alumina supports.

4. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on creating highly dispersed active sites and improving the surface area of catalysts. The thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) cothermolysis method has been used to generate materials with high surface areas and well-dispersed chromium sites.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have compared the performance of chromium-based catalysts in both oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, with research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind each process.

6. Competing catalysts: While chromium-based catalysts remain significant, research has also explored other catalysts, such as vanadium-based systems, for propane ODH reactions.

The ongoing research in these areas aims to improve the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, particularly at lower reaction temperatures.

自1933年以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展主要由其在脱氢过程中的重要性推动，特别是在丙烷脱氢方面。主要发展包括：

1. 工业应用：铬基催化剂广泛用于工业规模的丙烷受控脱氢，为丙烯生产提供了一种替代高温烃类裂解的方法。

2. 载体材料：氧化铝（Al2O3）一直是铬催化剂的主要载体材料。然而，研究也探索了其他载体，如氧化锆（ZrO2），以改善催化剂性能。

3. 助剂：在氧化铝载体的铬基催化剂中使用碱金属助剂来提高性能。

4. 活性位点和结构：研究重点是创造高度分散的活性位点并提高催化剂的比表面积。热解分子前驱体（TMP）共热解方法被用来生成具有高比表面积和良好分散铬位点的材料。

5. 反应机理：研究比较了铬基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢（DH）过程中的性能，旨在理解每个过程背后的机理。

6. 竞争性催化剂：虽然铬基催化剂仍然重要，但研究也探索了其他催化剂，如钒基系统，用于丙烷ODH反应。

这些领域的持续研究旨在提高铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的效率、选择性和稳定性，特别是在较低反应温度下的性能。
