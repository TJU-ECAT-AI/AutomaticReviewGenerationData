          [1] "Currently, propylene is primarily produced by the high temperature cracking of hydrocarbons; however, the controlled dehydrogenation of propane provides a useful alternative process [3147]."

[2] "The endothermic dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, currently employed on an industrial scale, utilizes Cr-based catalysts with Al2O3 as a support and alkali metal promoters [32]."

[3] "In studies on various chromium-based catalysts, DeRossi and co-workers found that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited increased activity over similarly prepared Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 materials [4245]."

[4] "Given the reported efficiency of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts, it was of interest to utilize the TMP cothermolysis method for the generation of such materials with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites."

[5] "For Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, it has been shown that coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species are formed under typical propane DH conditions (upon reduction of Cr6+ species), and that these species are active sites [32,45]. Additionally, Cr3+ species in small amorphous clusters have been proposed as active DH sites [32]."

[6] "An important goal in the synthesis of new heterogeneous catalysts is the generation of materials containing well-dispersed catalytic centers within a support matrix."

[7] "Many of the best propane ODH catalysts are based on vanadium [4851], and TMP-derived V/Zr/O catalysts perform at levels among the very best of these [29,30]."

[8] "Use of the TMP-cothermolysis method has resulted in nCrSiZr materials with high surface areas after calcination at temperatures above those required for the propane DH reaction."

[9] "Difficulties in obtaining high surface area and thermally stable zirconia supports were cited as being a large reason for limited use of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts for large-scale propane DH reactions"

[10] "Chromium XANES spectra of 2.5CrSiAl and 5CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K are similar to that for 10CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K, in that they exhibit significant amounts of tetrahedral Cr6+ species (Fig. 4)."

          The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, with key developments in industrial applications and research focus areas:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium-based catalysts have become widely used for the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene, providing an alternative to high-temperature hydrocarbon cracking.

2. Support materials: Research has focused on various support materials, with Al2O3 being commonly used in industrial applications. Studies have shown that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit increased activity compared to Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 materials. However, difficulties in obtaining high surface area and thermally stable zirconia supports have limited the use of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts for large-scale propane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Active sites: Research has identified coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species as active sites for propane dehydrogenation. Cr3+ species in small amorphous clusters have also been proposed as active sites. Studies have examined the role of different chromium species, particularly Cr3+ and Cr6+, in catalytic activity.

4. Synthesis methods: New techniques, such as the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) cothermolysis method, have been developed to create catalysts with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites. This method has resulted in materials with high surface areas after calcination at temperatures above those required for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

5. Promoters: Alkali metal promoters have been utilized in industrial Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Structure: Focus has been placed on creating catalysts with highly dispersed chromium centers and controlling the oxidation state of chromium (Cr3+ vs. Cr6+) to optimize catalytic performance.

7. Reaction mechanisms: Research has investigated the formation of active Cr3+ species under typical propane dehydrogenation conditions through the reduction of Cr6+ species. Studies have also compared the performance of chromium-based catalysts in both oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane.

8. Competing catalysts: While chromium-based catalysts remain significant, research has also explored other catalysts, such as vanadium-based systems, for propane ODH reactions.

These developments have contributed to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, driving improvements in catalyst efficiency, selectivity, and stability.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的演变一直很显著，在工业应用和研究重点领域取得了关键进展：

1. 工业应用：铬基催化剂已广泛用于丙烷脱氢生产丙烯，为高温烃裂解提供了替代方案。

2. 载体材料：研究集中在各种载体材料上，其中Al2O3在工业应用中常用。研究表明，与Cr/Al2O3和Cr/SiO2材料相比，Cr/ZrO2催化剂表现出更高的活性。然而，获得高比表面积和热稳定性氧化锆载体的困难限制了Cr/ZrO2催化剂在大规模丙烷脱氢反应中的使用。

3. 活性位点：研究已确定配位不饱和和孤立的Cr3+物种是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。小型无定形簇中的Cr3+物种也被提出作为活性位点。研究考察了不同铬物种，特别是Cr3+和Cr6+，在催化活性中的作用。

4. 合成方法：开发了新技术，如热解分子前体（TMP）共热解方法，以创建具有高比表面积和高度分散活性位点的催化剂。这种方法在高于丙烷脱氢反应所需温度的条件下煅烧后，产生了具有高比表面积的材料。

5. 助剂：在工业用铬基丙烷脱氢催化剂中使用了碱金属助剂。

6. 结构：重点放在创建具有高度分散铬中心的催化剂，并控制铬的氧化态（Cr3+与Cr6+）以优化催化性能。

7. 反应机理：研究了在典型丙烷脱氢条件下通过Cr6+物种还原形成活性Cr3+物种的机理。研究还比较了铬基催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢（DH）过程中的性能。

8. 竞争性催化剂：虽然铬基催化剂仍然重要，但研究也探索了其他催化剂，如用于丙烷ODH反应的钒基系统。

这些发展为铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续重要性做出了贡献，推动了催化剂效率、选择性和稳定性的提高。
