[1] "Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [13], oxidation of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [35] and to a lesser degree in many other processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]."

[2] "Recently, it has been found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane [811], propane [1221], isobutane [22], and ethylbenzene [23,24]."

[3] "Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+ [8,10,13], Cr5+/Cr3+ [9], and Cr3+/Cr2+ [18,23,24] have been proposed."

[4] "Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts. Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 [12,13,15,1720,22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key industrial applications include ethene polymerization (Phillips process), oxidation of organic compounds, and hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. They are also used in dehydroisomerization of n-butane and selective catalytic reduction of NOx.

Recent research has focused on their excellent performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane, propane, isobutane, and ethylbenzene. This has opened up new applications in CO2 utilization processes.

Key research areas include:

1. Structure and active sites: Various redox cycles between Cr species (Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, Cr3+/Cr2+) have been proposed and studied to understand the reaction mechanisms.

2. Support materials: Recent attention has been given to Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts with different pore architectures.

3. Preparation methods: Both one-pot and post-synthesis techniques have been investigated for preparing mesoporous catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, expanding their applications and improving their performance.
