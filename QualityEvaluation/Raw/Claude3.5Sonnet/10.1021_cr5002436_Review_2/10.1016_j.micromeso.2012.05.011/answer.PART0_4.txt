[1] "Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [13], oxidation of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [35] and to a lesser degree in many other processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]."

[2] "Recently, it has been found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane [811], propane [1221], isobutane [22], and ethylbenzene [23,24]."

[3] "Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+ [8,10,13], Cr5+/Cr3+ [9], and Cr3+/Cr2+ [18,23,24] have been proposed."

[4] "More attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts. Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 [12,13,15,1720,22,23]."
