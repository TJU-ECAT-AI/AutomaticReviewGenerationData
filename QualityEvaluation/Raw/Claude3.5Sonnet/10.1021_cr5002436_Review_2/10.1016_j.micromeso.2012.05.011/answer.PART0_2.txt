[1] "Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [13], oxidation of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [35] and to a lesser degree in many other processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]."

[2] "Recently, it has been found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane [811], propane [1221], isobutane [22], and ethylbenzene [23,24]."

[3] "Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+ [8,10,13], Cr5+/Cr3+ [9], and Cr3+/Cr2+ [18,23,24] have been proposed."

[4] "More attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts. Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 [12,13,15,1720,22,23]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. They have found wide industrial applications in ethene polymerization (Phillips process), oxidation of organic compounds, and hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Other applications include dehydroisomerization of n-butane and selective catalytic reduction of NOx.

Recent research has focused on their excellent performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane, propane, isobutane, and ethylbenzene. This has opened up new avenues for CO2 utilization in chemical processes.

Key research areas have included understanding the redox cycles of chromium species, with proposed cycles including Cr6+/Cr3+, Cr5+/Cr3+, and Cr3+/Cr2+. This focus on the active sites and reaction mechanisms has contributed to improving catalyst performance.

There has been increased attention on developing Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts with different pore architectures. These have been prepared by both one-pot and post-synthesis techniques, aiming to enhance catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. This research on support materials and synthesis methods has been crucial in advancing the field.

Overall, the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by a combination of industrial needs and academic research, focusing on understanding and optimizing catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms.
