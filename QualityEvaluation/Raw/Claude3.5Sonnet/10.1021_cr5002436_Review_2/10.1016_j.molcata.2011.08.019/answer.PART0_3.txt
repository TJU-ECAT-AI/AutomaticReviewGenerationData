[1] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "Cr species on 3+, 5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[3] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant developments in various areas:

1. Active species: Research has expanded beyond chromium to include other metal oxides like gallium, zinc, iron, vanadium, indium, and manganese for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

2. Structure and active sites: Studies have focused on understanding the oxidation states of chromium (3+, 5+, and 6+) on the catalyst surface. Cr6+ species, particularly in the form of mono- and polychromates, are considered to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

3. Support materials: There has been a shift towards using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports for chromium species. These materials offer 2-4 times larger surface areas compared to commercial silica gels and provide uniform pore structures.

4. Research focus: Key areas of investigation include the influence of support properties on catalytic performance, the role of different oxidation states of chromium, and the mechanisms of dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

5. Industrial applications: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, propane dehydrogenation to produce propene is a significant industrial application, driven by the demand for propene in the production of various polymers and chemical intermediates.

The literature does not provide specific information about the initial discovery in 1933 or the use of promoters, so these aspects cannot be addressed based on the given information.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物催化剂的发展在多个领域取得了重大进展：

1. 活性物种：研究已经从铬扩展到包括镓、锌、铁、钒、铟和锰等其他金属氧化物，用于在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点是了解催化剂表面铬的氧化态（3+、5+和6+）。Cr6+物种，特别是以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。

3. 载体材料：研究趋势转向使用高比表面积的介孔材料作为铬物种的载体。这些材料比商业硅胶提供2-4倍的表面积，并具有均匀的孔结构。

4. 研究重点：主要研究领域包括载体性质对催化性能的影响、铬的不同氧化态的作用，以及在CO2存在下的脱氢机理。

5. 工业应用：虽然给定文本中没有明确提到，但丙烷脱氢生产丙烯是一个重要的工业应用，这是由于丙烯在各种聚合物和化学中间体生产中的需求驱动的。

文献没有提供关于1933年初次发现或助剂使用的具体信息，因此无法基于给定信息讨论这些方面。
