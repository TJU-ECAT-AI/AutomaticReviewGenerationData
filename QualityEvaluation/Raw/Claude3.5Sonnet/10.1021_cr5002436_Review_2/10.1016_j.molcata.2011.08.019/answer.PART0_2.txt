[1] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "Cr species on 3+, 5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[3] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been significant, with key developments in several areas:

1. Expansion of active species: While chromium remains a primary focus, research has expanded to include other active species like gallium, zinc, iron, vanadium, indium, and manganese for dehydrogenation processes.

2. Understanding of active sites: Research has revealed that multiple oxidation states of chromium (3+, 5+, and 6+) coexist on catalyst surfaces, with Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates believed to be the active sites or precursors.

3. Support materials: There has been a shift towards using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports, which offer 2-4 times larger surface areas than commercial silica gels and have uniform pore structures. This allows for better dispersion of chromium species.

4. Focus on structure and dispersion: Efforts have been made to achieve high dispersion of chromium species, as this is crucial for catalytic activity. The structure of the support and its interaction with chromium species have become important areas of study.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Research has explored the role of CO2 in dehydrogenation processes, investigating both oxidative and non-oxidative pathways.

Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, particularly propane to propene, which is an important petrochemical used in the production of various polymers and chemical intermediates.

While the literature doesn't explicitly mention promoters, the research focus areas have clearly expanded to include detailed studies of catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms, all contributing to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂的发展取得了显著进展，主要在以下几个领域有重要发展：

1. 活性物种的扩展：虽然铬仍然是主要研究对象，但研究已扩展到包括镓、锌、铁、钒、铟和锰等其他活性物种，用于脱氢过程。

2. 对活性位点的理解：研究表明，催化剂表面存在多种氧化态的铬（3+、5+和6+），其中以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+物种被认为是活性位点或前体。

3. 载体材料：研究转向使用高比表面积的介孔材料作为载体，这些材料比商业二氧化硅凝胶的表面积大2-4倍，并具有均匀的孔结构。这允许铬物种更好地分散。

4. 关注结构和分散性：为了提高催化活性，研究努力实现铬物种的高度分散。载体的结构及其与铬物种的相互作用已成为重要的研究领域。

5. 反应机理：研究探索了CO2在脱氢过程中的作用，调查了氧化和非氧化途径。

主要工业应用包括轻烷烃的脱氢，特别是丙烷到丙烯的转化，这是生产各种聚合物和化学中间体的重要石油化工产品。

虽然文献没有明确提到助剂，但研究重点显然已扩展到包括催化剂结构、活性位点、载体材料和反应机理的详细研究，所有这些都促进了氧化铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中持续的重要性。
