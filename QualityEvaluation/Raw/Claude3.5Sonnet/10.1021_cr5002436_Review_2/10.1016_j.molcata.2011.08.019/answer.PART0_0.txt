[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is considered to be one of the alternative methods of obtaining valuable alkenes with a higher yield than in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation variation, as well as a method of chemical CO2 utilization."

[2] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point  IEP) [2931]."

[4] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[5] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by several key factors:

1. Industrial applications: These catalysts have been primarily used for dehydrogenation processes, particularly for obtaining valuable alkenes from light alkanes. The presence of CO2 in these reactions has been found to increase yield compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. Research focus areas:

a) Active species: Besides chromium, other active species such as Ga, Zn, Fe, V, In, and Mn have been investigated for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

b) Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states and structure of Cr species, particularly Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, which are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

c) Support materials: There has been a shift towards using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports, which offer 2-4 times larger surface area than commercial silica gels and have uniform pore structures.

d) Preparation methods: Factors such as the type of Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point) have been studied for their influence on catalyst activity.

e) Reaction mechanisms: Research has investigated the interaction between chromium and silica, as well as the role of CO2 in enhancing dehydrogenation reactions.

The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by the need to improve yield, selectivity, and efficiency in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the presence of CO2. This has led to a deeper understanding of the catalyst structure, active sites, and the role of support materials in enhancing catalytic performance.

自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂的演变主要受以下几个关键因素驱动：

1. 工业应用：这些催化剂主要用于脱氢过程，特别是从轻烷烃中获得有价值的烯烃。在这些反应中，CO2的存在被发现可以提高产率，相比于非氧化性脱氢。

2. 研究重点领域：

a) 活性物种：除铬外，还研究了Ga、Zn、Fe、V、In和Mn等其他活性物种在CO2存在下对丙烷脱氢的作用。

b) 结构和活性位点：研究集中在理解Cr物种的氧化态和结构，特别是以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+物种，它们被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。

c) 载体材料：研究转向使用高比表面积的介孔材料作为载体，这些材料提供了比商业硅胶大2-4倍的表面积，并具有均匀的孔结构。

d) 制备方法：研究了Cr前体的类型、制备条件（如焙烧温度）、Cr含量以及硅载体的性质（如等电点）等因素对催化剂活性的影响。

e) 反应机理：研究了铬和硅之间的相互作用，以及CO2在增强脱氢反应中的作用。

这些催化剂的演变主要是由提高脱氢过程中的产率、选择性和效率的需求驱动的，特别是在CO2存在的情况下。这导致了对催化剂结构、活性位点以及载体材料在增强催化性能中的作用有了更深入的理解。
