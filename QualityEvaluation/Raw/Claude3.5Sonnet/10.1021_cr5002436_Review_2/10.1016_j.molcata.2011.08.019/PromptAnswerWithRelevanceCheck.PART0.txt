[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is considered to be one of the alternative methods of obtaining valuable alkenes with a higher yield than in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation variation, as well as a method of chemical CO2 utilization."

[2] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[3] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point  IEP) [2931]."

[4] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[5] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been driven by several key factors:

1. Industrial applications: These catalysts have been primarily used for dehydrogenation processes, particularly for obtaining valuable alkenes from light alkanes. The presence of CO2 in these reactions has been found to increase yield compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. Research focus areas:

a) Active species: Besides chromium, other active species such as Ga, Zn, Fe, V, In, and Mn have been investigated for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

b) Structure and active sites: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states and structure of Cr species, particularly Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, which are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

c) Support materials: There has been a shift towards using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports, which offer 2-4 times larger surface area than commercial silica gels and have uniform pore structures.

d) Preparation methods: Factors such as the type of Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point) have been studied for their influence on catalyst activity.

e) Reaction mechanisms: Research has investigated the interaction between chromium and silica, as well as the role of CO2 in enhancing dehydrogenation reactions.

The evolution of these catalysts has been driven by the need to improve yield, selectivity, and efficiency in dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the presence of CO2. This has led to a deeper understanding of the catalyst structure, active sites, and the role of support materials in enhancing catalytic performance.
