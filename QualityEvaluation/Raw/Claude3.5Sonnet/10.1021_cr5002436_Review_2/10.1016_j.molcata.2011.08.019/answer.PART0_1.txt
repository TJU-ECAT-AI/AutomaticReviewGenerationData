[1] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "Cr species on 3+, 5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts. Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[3] "In this work we presented a comparative study of the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structure and two commercially available silica."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer insights into recent developments and research focus areas:

1. Catalyst materials: Various oxide-based materials containing active species like Cr, Ga, Zn, Fe, V, In, and Mn have been investigated for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

2. Active sites and oxidation states: Research has focused on understanding the oxidation states of Cr species (3+, 5+, and 6+) on the catalyst surface. Cr6+ species, particularly in the form of mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites.

3. Support materials: Recent research has explored the use of different siliceous supports, including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structures, as well as commercially available silica.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The literature mentions the investigation of dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, indicating a focus on understanding reaction mechanisms in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

While the literature does not explicitly mention industrial applications, the focus on propane dehydrogenation suggests potential applications in the production of propene, an important petrochemical used in various industries.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实提供了关于最近发展和研究重点领域的见解：

1. 催化剂材料：已经研究了含有Cr、Ga、Zn、Fe、V、In和Mn等活性物种的各种氧化物基材料，用于在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢。

2. 活性位点和氧化态：研究重点是了解催化剂表面Cr物种的氧化态（3+、5+和6+）。Cr6+物种，特别是以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐的形式，被认为是活性位点或活性位点的前体。

3. 载体材料：最近的研究探索了不同硅基载体的使用，包括具有立方结构（SBA-1）和六方结构（SBA-15）的介孔筛，以及商业可用的二氧化硅。

4. 反应机理：文献提到了在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢的研究，表明研究重点是理解氧化脱氢过程中的反应机理。

虽然文献没有明确提到工业应用，但对丙烷脱氢的关注表明在丙烯生产方面有潜在应用，丙烯是各种行业中使用的重要石油化工产品。
