[1] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point  IEP) [2931]."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[4] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant developments in several key areas:

1. Expansion of active species: While chromium remains a primary focus, researchers have investigated various other active species including gallium, zinc, iron, vanadium, indium, and manganese for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

2. Understanding of catalytic activity factors: Research has shown that the activity of silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts depends on oxidation states, structure of Cr species, and chromium-silica interaction. These are influenced by precursor type, preparation conditions, Cr content, and silica support properties.

3. Identification of active sites: Studies have revealed that Cr6+ species, particularly in the form of mono- and polychromates, are believed to be the active sites or precursors to active sites in silica-supported catalysts.

4. Development of support materials: There has been a shift towards using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports. These materials offer 2-4 times larger surface area than commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure, allowing for better dispersion of chromium species.

5. Focus on reaction mechanisms: Research has explored the role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation process, including its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propene and the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

Key industrial applications include the production of propene, which is used in the manufacture of various polymers and chemical intermediates. Research continues to focus on improving catalyst performance, understanding reaction mechanisms, and developing more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的演变在几个关键领域取得了重大进展：

1. 活性物种的扩展：虽然铬仍然是主要焦点，但研究人员已经在CO2存在下研究了各种其他活性物种，包括镓、锌、铁、钒、铟和锰，用于丙烷脱氢。

2. 了解催化活性因素：研究表明，硅胶负载的铬氧化物催化剂的活性取决于氧化态、Cr物种的结构以及铬-硅相互作用。这些因素受前驱体类型、制备条件、Cr含量和硅胶支持材料性质的影响。

3. 识别活性位点：研究揭示，Cr6+物种，特别是以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式存在的物种，被认为是硅胶负载催化剂中的活性位点或活性位点的前体。

4. 支持材料的发展：研究已转向使用高比表面积的介孔材料作为载体。这些材料比商业硅胶的表面积大2-4倍，并具有均匀的孔结构，可以更好地分散铬物种。

5. 关注反应机理：研究探讨了CO2在脱氢过程中的作用，包括其参与丙烷直接氧化为丙烯的过程以及逆水煤气变换反应。

主要工业应用包括生产丙烯，用于制造各种聚合物和化学中间体。研究继续关注改善催化剂性能、理解反应机理以及开发更高效和稳定的脱氢过程催化剂。
