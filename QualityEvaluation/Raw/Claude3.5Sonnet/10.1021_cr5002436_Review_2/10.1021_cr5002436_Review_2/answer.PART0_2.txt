[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."

[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."

[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques."

[5] "The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions."

[6] "Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, as well as a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been all proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions."

[7] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."

[8] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have undergone significant evolution since their discovery in 1933. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: In the 1940s, UOP used chromia supported on alumina catalysts for butane dehydrogenation to produce high-octane aviation fuels.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Structure: Studies have identified various surface species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+) and forms (chromates, polychromates, crystalline and amorphous chromia).
   b) Active sites: Research has proposed Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, or a mixture of both as active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.
   c) Support materials: Alumina is the most common support, with various preparation methods investigated.
   d) Promoters: Alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) have been found to promote activity and selectivity.
   e) Reaction mechanisms: Intensive studies have been conducted on the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism.

3. Technological advancements: The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has allowed for better understanding of catalyst behavior under reaction conditions.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, driving both industrial applications and academic research in the field.
