[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."

[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."

[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

[4] "To summarize, in recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated."

[5] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."

[6] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: In the 1940s, UOP used chromia-alumina catalysts for butane dehydrogenation to produce high-octane aviation fuels.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Structure under reaction conditions
   b) Nature of active sites
   c) Role of support materials
   d) Effect of alkali metal promoters
   e) Reaction mechanisms

3. Active sites: Recent research has identified dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species as the primary active sites for dehydrogenation.

4. Support materials: Alumina remains the most common support, with various preparation methods investigated. Other supports like zirconia, silica, and mixed oxides have also been studied.

5. Promoters: Alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) have been found to enhance both activity and selectivity of chromium-based catalysts.

These advancements have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, with ongoing research aimed at improving their performance and understanding their fundamental properties.
