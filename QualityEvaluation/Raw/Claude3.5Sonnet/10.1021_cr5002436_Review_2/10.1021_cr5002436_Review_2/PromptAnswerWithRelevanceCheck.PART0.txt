[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."

[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."

[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques."

[5] "Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, as well as a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been all proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions."

[6] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."
