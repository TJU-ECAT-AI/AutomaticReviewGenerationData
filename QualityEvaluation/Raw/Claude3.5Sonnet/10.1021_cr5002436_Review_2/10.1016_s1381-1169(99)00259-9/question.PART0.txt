Abstract
The dehydrogenation of isobutane over supported chromium oxide catalysts was studied by a combination of in situ
UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and on line GC analysis. A well-defined set of experiments, based on an
experimental design, was carried out to develop mathematical models, which quantitatively relate Cr-speciation and
dehydrogenation activity with reaction temperature and time, support composition, gas composition and Cr loading. It will

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and
isobutane over supported chromium oxide cata-
lysts has a considerable industrial impact be-
cause it represents a route to obtain alkenes

tion is nowadays important because the tradi-
tional sources of isobutane; i.e., steam cracking
and fluid catalytic cracking, are already heavily
used, and the availability of isobutane has be-
come a bottle-neck in the expansion of the
MTBE and ETBE market.
Most characterization studies on supported
chromium oxide catalysts describe the catalyst
structure under conditions often far away from
w x
real catalytic ones 3 . As a consequence, only a
limited amount of information is known about

Therefore, research must be directed towards
the catalytic characterization under in situ con-
w

ditions 911 .
In this work, a novel method has been devel-
oped for deriving quantitative structureactivity
relationships by using the technique of experi-
mental design. It is important to stress that this
technique has been successfully introduced in
the field of drugs and pharmaceuticals design
w
x
1214 , but  to our best knowledge  not in
the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The goal of
this paper is to explore its possibilities and
limitations for studying heterogeneous catalysts.
We have chosen the dehydrogenation of isobu-
tane over supported chromium oxide catalysts
as model reaction because we have studied this
system in great detail in the past. The used
spectroscopic technique is UVVis diffuse re-
flectance spectroscopy, which allows to monitor

and Cr
911,15,16 . The
developed method involves a three-pronged ap-
proach. In a first step, the number of required
experiments was optimized by using an experi-
mental design, and five factors were selected to
describe the dehydrogenation process. Secondly,
both Cr-speciation and dehydrogenation activity
were measured by in situ diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy and on line GC analysis, respec-
tively. In a final step, a mathematical or statisti-
cal model for the optimization of isobutane
dehydrogenation was derived. The obtained
conditions are compared with those used in
chemical industry.

was first treated in oxygen in the in situ cell at
5508C for 1 h, and then cooled in He to the
reaction temperature. The reaction conditions
applied to the catalyst sample were chosen ac-
cording to an experimental design, which is

X , the gas composition, characterized by the

percentage of isobutane in N ; X , the reaction

The selection of these five factors was based
on our preliminary work of n-butane dehydro-

deed, it was previously found that the alkane

position and the reaction time and temperature.
It is important to stress that other factors such as
the possible formation of solid solutions are
equally important. The latter is especially true
for catalyst recycling; however, long-term deac-
tivation via the formation of a solid solution
.
e.g., Cr Al
O
will not be the subject of
x
2yx

this paper, and is therefore excluded. Therefore,
we have limited ourselves to a detailed study of
the influence of the five factors on both the
dehydrogenation activity and Cr speciation.
The values of each of the above-described
factors can be easily changed between experi-
.
mental limits. The most difficult point here is
to use an appropriate parameter to describe the
support. However, as was shown in previous
w
x
publications
3,19,2224 , it is especially the
.
chemical composition SiO :Al O ratio of the
2
2
3
support which determines  via its chemical
hardnessrsoftness, solid-state chemistry and hy-
droxyl chemistry  the dispersion, coordina-
tion environment, oxidation state and poly-
merization degree of Cr species. We have cho-
sen the IEP as a parameter to describe the
support composition because the IEP is directly
related with the SiO :Al O
ratio of the sup-

design where some points

However, this experimental design is different
from a standard central composite design in a
number of ways.
One of the variables, namely X , could only
1
take three values, which means that it will not
be possible to check whether the second-order
approximation of the underlying relation is ade-
quate or not. The reason is, of course, that there
are no SiO PAl O

By measuring the catalytic activity for the set
of 30 experiments by on line GC analysis, one
can obtain the response values y in Table 2. It
is important to stress here that the selectivities
towards isobutane were always very high, and
reaches a maximum at around 9095%. There-
fore, the catalytic conversions as measured by
on line GC analysis in the in situ cell are a good
measure of the catalytic performances of the
supported chromium oxide catalysts. The influ-

Appendix A and a RMSE of 0.2 with RMSE,
the root mean square error; i.e., the standard
deviation of the differences between fitted and
.
measured response values . The quality of the
fit, visualized in Fig. 2, is quite reasonable, but
not perfect because there seems to be some
minor higher-order effects operative. However,
 .
Eq.
2
allows to calculate the conditions in
order to maximize the dehydrogenation activity
over supported chromium oxide catalysts. The
following conditions were obtained: X s8; X
1
2
s7.5; X s2; X s500 and X s10. Thus, a
3
4
5
predicted maximum conversion of 5.58% is ob-
tained after 10 min for a 7.5 wt.% CrrAl O
2
3
catalyst at 5008C with a mixture of 2% isobu-
tane in N , which is close to the experimental
2
value of 5.18% Experiment N12 in Table 2 and
.
Fig. 2 .
 .
In order to visualize Eq. 2 , one can make
conversion surface plots, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
For example, Fig. 3A predicts the catalytic ac-
tivity after 30 min for a CrrSiO PAl O
cata-
2
2
3
lyst at 4258C as a function of the amount of
isobutane in N
and as a function of the Cr
2
loading. It is clear that the dehydrogenation
activity gradually increases with increasing Cr
loading and decreasing amount of isobutane in
N . The influence of the reaction time and the
2
Cr loading on the predicted dehydrogenation
activity of a CrrSiO PAl O catalyst at 4258C
2
2
3
is illustrated in Fig. 3B. It shows a gradual
decrease in activity with increasing reaction
time. The combined effect of the IEP of the
support of the support and the reaction tempera-
ture on the catalytic activity is given in Fig. 3C.
One can notice that at high reaction tempera-
tures the dehydrogenation activity increases with
increasing IEP; i.e., with an increasing amount
of Al O in the support.

Finally, it is important to note that the IEP of
the support seems to be a good measure to
differentiate between the different support com-
positions. This is clear from the results of exper-
.
iments N29 and N30

N29 and N30 are not detected as outliers within
the frame of our experimental design, and the
IEP is a good measure to differentiate between
the different supports.

In situ diffuse reflectance spectra were moni-
tored between 200 and 800 nm as a function of
time for each experiment of Table 2. The scan
time was 1 min, and 60 different spectra were
recorded during 1 h. An example of a set of in
situ diffuse reflectance spectra is given in Fig. 4
for experiment N01 and N06. N01 is an experi-
ment with a 0.5 wt.% CrrSiO
catalyst treated
2
at 3508C in 2% isobutane, and the correspond-
ing DRS spectra are given in Fig. 4A. Fig. 4A
shows a gradual decrease of absorption maxima
around 360 and 450 nm with increasing reaction
time at the expense of a new weak band with an
absorption maximum at around 625 nm. The
insert of Fig. 4A illustrates the presence of an
isobestic point, suggesting the presence of two
different Cr-species. By applying principal com-

 a common chemo-
metric technique, which is briefly explained in
Appendix C  to the set of spectra of Fig. 4A,
two principal components were obtained. An-
other chemometrical technique to unravel a se-

ries of spectra is SIMPLISMA Appendix D .
This technique does not only determine the
number of pure component spectra in the exper-
imental diffuse reflectance spectra, but also de-
livers each of the pure component spectra, to-

2 The absorption maxima of the pure compo-
nent spectra extracted by the SIMPLISMA tech-
nique differ from one support to another. In-
deed, as discussed above, the absorption max-
ima of reduced Cr is around 570 nm for
CrrAl O
catalysts, and around 630 nm for

CrrSiO catalysts. These discrepancies are due

to differences in Cr-speciation; i.e., mainly Cr 3q

11,15,16,2224 ; 3 The noise level of both the
in situ diffuse reflectance spectra and the corre-
sponding pure component spectra increases with
increasing Cr-loading and reaction time. The
former is due to a decreasing amount of re-
flected light from the samples, while the latter is
related with coke formation.
In order to develop a relevant model to relate
the Cr-speciation with the reaction time and
temperature, the gas composition, the support
composition and the Cr-loading, one has to
define the response factor z. We have selected
