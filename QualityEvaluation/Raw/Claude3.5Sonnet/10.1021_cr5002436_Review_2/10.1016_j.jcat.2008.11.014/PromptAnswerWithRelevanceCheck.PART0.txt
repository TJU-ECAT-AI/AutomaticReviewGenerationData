The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 or their key industrial applications. The document focuses on a specific study of chromium catalysts supported on SBA-15 and Al2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad historical overview. However, based on the content, we can infer that current research focus areas for chromium catalysts in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Investigating the nature and distribution of chromium species (monomers, oligomers, crystalline particles) on different support materials.

2. Understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and catalytic performance.

3. Studying the behavior of chromium species during reaction conditions using in situ characterization techniques.

4. Exploring the effects of support materials (e.g., SBA-15 vs Al2O3) on the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium catalysts.

5. Examining the role of isolated vs. oligomeric chromium species in dehydrogenation reactions.

6. Investigating catalyst deactivation and regeneration processes.

These research areas contribute to the ongoing development and optimization of chromium-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

给定的文献并不包含关于铬氧化物催化剂自1933年发现以来的历史演变或其主要工业应用的信息。该文档主要集中于研究SBA-15和Al2O3负载的铬催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用，而不是提供广泛的历史概述。然而，根据文献内容，我们可以推断出目前铬催化剂在脱氢过程中的研究重点包括：

1. 研究不同载体材料上铬物种（单体、寡聚体、晶态颗粒）的性质和分布。

2. 理解催化剂结构与催化性能之间的关系。

3. 使用原位表征技术研究反应条件下铬物种的行为。

4. 探索载体材料（如SBA-15与Al2O3）对铬催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的影响。

5. 考察孤立铬物种与寡聚铬物种在脱氢反应中的作用。

6. 研究催化剂失活和再生过程。

这些研究领域有助于铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续开发和优化。

The given literature does not provide information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or their key industrial applications. The document focuses on a specific study of chromium catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, rather than giving a broad historical overview. It does not discuss the discovery of these catalysts or their long-term development.

However, the paper does provide some insights into current research focus areas for chromium catalysts in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Structure and active sites: The study investigates the nature and distribution of chromium species (monomers, oligomers, crystalline particles) on different supports.

2. Support materials: The research compares SBA-15 and γ-Al2O3 as supports for chromium catalysts.

3. Reaction mechanisms: In-situ XAS studies are used to understand the behavior of chromium species during the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Characterization techniques: Various methods like XRD, UV-Raman spectroscopy, STEM-EDXS, and XAS are employed to analyze the catalysts.

While the paper does not directly address industrial applications or historical evolution, it represents current research efforts to understand and improve chromium-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.
