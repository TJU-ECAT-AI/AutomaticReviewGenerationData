Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation since their discovery. A key industrial application has been Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts used on a commercial scale for years. Research has focused on understanding the nature of surface chromium species, which depends on the oxide support and chromium content. Studies have examined how chromium can exist as isolated monomeric species, polymeric species, or combinations thereof depending on loading. The catalytic activity is related to the nature of these surface chromium species. Research areas have included investigating different oxide supports, optimizing chromium loading and dispersion, and elucidating the structure-activity relationships of the active sites.
