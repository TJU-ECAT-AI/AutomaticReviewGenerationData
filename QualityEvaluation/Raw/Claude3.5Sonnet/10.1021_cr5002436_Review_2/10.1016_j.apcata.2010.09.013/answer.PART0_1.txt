[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation [1-3]. Among the various supported chromia materials, a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been used on a commercial scale for years [1]."

[2] "The catalytic activity is related to the nature of surface chromium, whose speciation is strongly dependent on the nature of oxide support and the chromium content [4,5]."

[3] "Depending on the loading, surface chromium may be present as isolated monomeric species, polymeric species or a combination thereof."

[4] "Previous studies reported that supported chromia catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation reaction, most likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous material [10,11]."

[5] "The present contribution deals with light hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over novel chromia-alumina catalysts with well-developed mesoporosity and relatively high surface area."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation since their discovery. Key developments include:

1. Use of supported chromia catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been used commercially for years.

2. Focus on understanding the nature of surface chromium species, which depends on the support material and chromium content. 

3. Research on chromium speciation, including isolated monomeric and polymeric species.

4. Studies on catalyst deactivation, mainly due to carbon deposition.

5. Development of novel mesoporous chromia-alumina catalysts with high surface area.

Key research areas include catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, and deactivation mechanisms. The main industrial application is in alkane dehydrogenation processes.
