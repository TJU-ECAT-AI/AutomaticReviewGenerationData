The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it indicates that these catalysts have become important for light alkane dehydrogenation, particularly ethane, propane, and iso-butane. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on various materials, especially alumina, have been widely used commercially for years. 

Key research areas include:
1. The nature of surface chromium species
2. Effect of oxide support on chromium speciation
3. Impact of chromium content on catalyst properties
4. Structure-activity relationships

Industrial applications focus on the production of light olefins to meet increasing demand. The literature suggests ongoing research into optimizing catalyst performance through understanding surface chemistry, support interactions, and chromium loading.

该文献并没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史。但它表明,这些催化剂已经成为轻烷烃脱氢的重要工具,特别是乙烷、丙烷和异丁烷。负载在各种材料上的铬氧化物催化剂,尤其是氧化铝负载的,已经在商业上广泛使用多年。

主要研究领域包括:
1. 表面铬物种的性质
2. 氧化物载体对铬物种的影响
3. 铬含量对催化剂性能的影响
4. 结构-活性关系

工业应用主要集中在生产轻烯烃以满足不断增长的需求。文献表明,通过理解表面化学、载体相互作用和铬负载量来优化催化剂性能的研究仍在进行中。
