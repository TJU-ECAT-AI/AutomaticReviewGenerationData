Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation since their discovery. A key industrial application has been Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, which have been used commercially for years. Research has focused on several key areas:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have examined how the nature of surface chromium species affects catalytic activity. This has been found to depend strongly on the support material and chromium content.

2. Support materials: Alumina has been an important support, but research has also looked at other oxides.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Work has been done to understand how alkanes adsorb and react on the catalyst surface.

4. Deactivation: A major focus has been understanding catalyst deactivation, which occurs mainly due to carbon deposition during the reaction.

5. Regeneration: Research has examined how to regenerate deactivated catalysts through oxidative treatments.

Overall, the evolution of these catalysts has involved optimizing the chromium species, support interactions, and stability to improve their industrial performance in dehydrogenation processes.

自发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已被广泛用于烷烃脱氢。一个关键的工业应用是Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂，它已商业化使用多年。研究主要集中在以下几个关键领域：

1. 结构和活性位点：研究了表面铬物种的性质如何影响催化活性。这被发现强烈依赖于载体材料和铬含量。

2. 载体材料：氧化铝一直是重要的载体，但研究也关注了其他氧化物。

3. 反应机理：开展了工作以了解烷烃如何在催化剂表面吸附和反应。

4. 失活：一个主要焦点是了解催化剂失活，这主要是由于反应过程中碳沉积造成的。

5. 再生：研究了如何通过氧化处理再生失活的催化剂。

总的来说，这些催化剂的演变涉及优化铬物种、载体相互作用和稳定性，以提高它们在脱氢过程中的工业性能。
