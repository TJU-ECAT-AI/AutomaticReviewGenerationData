The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. The document focuses on a specific study of mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad historical overview. It does not discuss the discovery of these catalysts, their industrial applications over time, or the long-term research focus areas. The paper is limited to describing the synthesis, characterization, and performance of a particular set of chromia-alumina catalysts for ethane and propane dehydrogenation.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation since their discovery. A key industrial application has been Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, which have been used commercially for years. Research has focused on several key areas:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have examined how the nature of surface chromium species affects catalytic activity. This has been found to depend strongly on the support material and chromium content.

2. Support materials: Alumina has been an important support, but research has also looked at other oxides.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Work has been done to understand how alkanes adsorb and react on the catalyst surface.

4. Deactivation: A major focus has been understanding catalyst deactivation, which occurs mainly due to carbon deposition during the reaction.

5. Regeneration: Research has examined how to regenerate deactivated catalysts through oxidative treatments.

Overall, the evolution of these catalysts has involved optimizing the chromium species, support interactions, and stability to improve their industrial performance in dehydrogenation processes.
