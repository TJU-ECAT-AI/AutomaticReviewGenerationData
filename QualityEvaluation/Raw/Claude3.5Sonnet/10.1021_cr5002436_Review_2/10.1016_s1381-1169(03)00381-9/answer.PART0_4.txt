[1] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [1-5]. The active sites for these reactions are Cr2+ [6-9] and Cr3+ [10-12], respectively."

[2] "Chromium supported catalysts are used in the ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutane dehydrogenations to the corresponding olefins, in the temperature range of 623-773 K and atmospheric pressure, with high selectivity to alkenes [19]."

[3] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have been used industrially in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by impregnation of a chromium compound, usually nitrate, and resulting catalysts with chromium loading in the range of 3-13 wt.% Cr [3]."

[4] "Several factors have influence in the catalytic activity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state, the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium species with the support. These variations depend on the metallic content, the precursor compound of chromium, the support characteristics and calcination conditions [2,3]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, with key industrial applications in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions. The main research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Active sites: Studies have identified Cr2+ as the active site for ethylene polymerization and Cr3+ for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Support materials: Both silica and alumina have been extensively used as supports, with alumina being particularly favored for industrial dehydrogenation catalysts.

3. Precursor compounds and preparation methods: Various chromium precursors and preparation techniques have been explored to optimize catalyst performance, including impregnation methods using chromium nitrate.

4. Reaction conditions: Dehydrogenation reactions typically occur in the temperature range of 623-773 K at atmospheric pressure, with high selectivity to alkenes.

5. Catalyst structure and oxidation state: Research has focused on understanding the influence of chromium's oxidation state, structure (amorphous or crystalline), and interaction with the support on catalytic activity.

6. Chromium loading: Industrial catalysts for dehydrogenation typically contain 3-13 wt.% Cr.

7. Promoters: The addition of promoters, such as potassium, has been studied to reduce unwanted side reactions like cracking.

These research areas have contributed to the development of highly efficient and selective chromium oxide-based catalysts for various dehydrogenation processes, including the production of ethylene, propylene, and butenes from their corresponding alkanes.
