[1] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [15]."

[2] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have been used industrially in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by impregnation of a chromium compound, usually nitrate, and resulting catalysts with chromium loading in the range of 313 wt.% Cr [3]."

[3] "Several factors have influence in the catalytic activity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state, the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium species with the support. These variations depend on the metallic content, the precursor compound of chromium, the support characteristics and calcination conditions [2,3]."

[4] "The literature reports that the active site in the dehydrogenation is the Cr3+ species coordinated to the hydroxyls, coordinativelly unsaturated [1012]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming important in industrial applications such as ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions. Key areas of research and development have included:

1. Support materials: Silica and alumina have been extensively studied as supports for chromium catalysts, with each offering different properties for dispersion and interaction with chromium species.

2. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active sites, with Cr3+ species coordinated to hydroxyl groups identified as important for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Catalyst preparation: The method of preparation, including the choice of chromium precursor compound, metal loading, and calcination conditions, has been found to significantly influence catalyst properties and performance.

4. Structure and oxidation state: Studies have investigated the effects of chromium's oxidation state and structure (amorphous vs. crystalline, chromates vs. dichromates) on catalytic activity.

5. Promoters: The addition of promoters, such as potassium, has been explored to enhance catalyst performance and reduce undesired side reactions.

6. Reaction mechanisms: Ongoing research aims to elucidate the mechanisms of dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions on chromium catalysts.

These areas of focus have contributed to the development of more efficient and selective chromium catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the production of olefins from alkanes.
