[1] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [15]."

[2] "The active sites for these reactions are Cr2+ [69] and Cr3+ [1012], respectively."

[3] "Chromium supported catalysts are used in the ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutane dehydrogenations to the corresponding olefins, in the temperature range of 623773 K and atmospheric pressure, with high selectivity to alkenes [19]."

[4] "Several factors have influence in the catalytic activity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state, the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium species with the support. These variations depend on the metallic content, the precursor compound of chromium, the support characteristics and calcination conditions [2,3]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current industrial applications and research focus areas:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium catalysts supported on silica and alumina are used in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions. Specifically, they are employed in the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, n-butane, and isobutane to produce the corresponding olefins.

2. Active sites: For dehydrogenation reactions, the active sites are Cr3+ species, while for ethylene polymerization, the active sites are Cr2+ species.

3. Reaction conditions: Dehydrogenation reactions typically occur in the temperature range of 623-773 K at atmospheric pressure, with high selectivity towards alkenes.

4. Research focus areas: The literature indicates that research has focused on understanding the factors influencing catalytic activity, including:
   - Oxidation state of chromium
   - Structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates)
   - Interaction between chromium species and the support material
   - Metal content
   - Precursor compound of chromium
   - Support characteristics
   - Calcination conditions

While the document does not explicitly discuss the evolution of these catalysts since 1933 or mention specific promoters, it does highlight the ongoing research into understanding and optimizing the performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概览。然而，它确实强调了它们当前工业应用和研究重点领域的一些关键方面：

1. 工业应用：负载在二氧化硅和氧化铝上的铬催化剂用于乙烯聚合和脱氢反应。具体来说，它们被用于乙烷、丙烷、正丁烷和异丁烷的脱氢以生产相应的烯烃。

2. 活性位点：对于脱氢反应，活性位点是Cr3+物种，而对于乙烯聚合，活性位点是Cr2+物种。

3. 反应条件：脱氢反应通常在623-773 K的温度范围内和大气压下进行，对烯烃具有高选择性。

4. 研究重点领域：文献指出，研究集中在理解影响催化活性的因素，包括：
   - 铬的氧化态
   - 结构（无定形或结晶、铬酸盐或重铬酸盐）
   - 铬物种与载体材料之间的相互作用
   - 金属含量
   - 铬的前驱体化合物
   - 载体特性
   - 焙烧条件

虽然该文档没有明确讨论自1933年以来这些催化剂的演变或提到具体的助剂，但它确实强调了对铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能理解和优化的持续研究。
