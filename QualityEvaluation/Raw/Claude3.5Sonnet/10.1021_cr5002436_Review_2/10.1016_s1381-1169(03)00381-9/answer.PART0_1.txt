[1] "Chromium catalysts, prepared with different chromium contents, supports and precursor compounds, were characterized by O2 and CO chemisorption, in order to quantify the Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, active species to dehydrogenation and ethylene polymerization reactions."

[2] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [15]."

[3] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have been used industrially in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by impregnation of a chromium compound, usually nitrate, and resulting catalysts with chromium loading in the range of 313 wt.% Cr [3]."

[4] "Several factors have influence in the catalytic activity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state, the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium species with the support."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current applications and research focus areas:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium catalysts supported on silica and alumina are used in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Catalyst preparation: Cr/Al2O3 catalysts for dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnation of chromium compounds (usually nitrate) with chromium loadings of 3-13 wt%.

3. Active sites: Research focuses on quantifying Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, which are active species for dehydrogenation and ethylene polymerization reactions, respectively.

4. Support materials: Silica and alumina are mentioned as common support materials for chromium catalysts.

5. Structure and oxidation state: The catalytic activity is influenced by the oxidation state of chromium, its structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates), and its interaction with the support material.

6. Characterization techniques: O2 and CO chemisorption are used to quantify Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, respectively. Other techniques mentioned include XRD, DRS, TPR, FT-IR, and DRIFTS.

The literature focuses on current research and characterization methods rather than providing a historical perspective on the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但它确实突出了它们当前应用和研究重点领域的一些关键方面:

1. 工业应用:以硅和氧化铝为载体的铬催化剂用于乙烯聚合和脱氢反应。

2. 催化剂制备:用于脱氢的Cr/Al2O3催化剂通常通过浸渍铬化合物(通常是硝酸盐)制备,铬负载量为3-13 wt%。

3. 活性位点:研究集中在量化Cr3+和Cr2+位点,它们分别是脱氢和乙烯聚合反应的活性物种。

4. 载体材料:硅和氧化铝被提及为铬催化剂的常见载体材料。

5. 结构和氧化态:催化活性受铬的氧化态、结构(无定形或结晶、铬酸盐或重铬酸盐)以及与载体材料的相互作用的影响。

6. 表征技术:O2和CO化学吸附分别用于量化Cr3+和Cr2+位点。其他提到的技术包括XRD、DRS、TPR、FT-IR和DRIFTS。

该文献侧重于当前的研究和表征方法,而不是提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的历史视角。
