[1] "Chromium catalysts, prepared with different chromium contents, supports and precursor compounds, were characterized by O2 and CO chemisorption, in order to quantify the Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, active species to dehydrogenation and ethylene polymerization reactions."

[2] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [15]."

[3] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have been used industrially in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by impregnation of a chromium compound, usually nitrate, and resulting catalysts with chromium loading in the range of 313 wt.% Cr [3]."

[4] "Several factors have influence in the catalytic activity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state, the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium species with the support."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their development and applications:

1. Chromium catalysts have found industrial applications in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Research has focused on understanding and optimizing various factors that influence catalytic activity, including:
   - Oxidation state of chromium
   - Structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates)
   - Interaction between chromium species and the support material
   - Chromium content
   - Precursor compounds
   - Support materials (particularly silica and alumina)

3. Characterization techniques such as O2 and CO chemisorption have been developed to quantify the active Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites for dehydrogenation and ethylene polymerization reactions, respectively.

4. For dehydrogenation reactions, Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are commonly used industrially, typically prepared by impregnation with chromium nitrate and containing 3-13 wt% Cr.

The document does not provide information on promoters or detailed reaction mechanisms, nor does it offer a comprehensive historical perspective on the evolution of these catalysts since 1933.

该文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了它们发展和应用的一些关键方面：

1. 铬催化剂在乙烯聚合和脱氢反应中找到了工业应用。

2. 研究集中在理解和优化影响催化活性的各种因素，包括：
   - 铬的氧化态
   - 结构（非晶态或晶态、铬酸盐或重铬酸盐）
   - 铬物种与载体材料之间的相互作用
   - 铬含量
   - 前驱化合物
   - 载体材料（特别是二氧化硅和氧化铝）

3. 已开发出O2和CO化学吸附等表征技术，用于定量测定脱氢和乙烯聚合反应的活性Cr3+和Cr2+位点。

4. 对于脱氢反应，工业上常用Cr/Al2O3催化剂，通常通过铬硝酸盐浸渍制备，含3-13 wt%的铬。

该文档没有提供关于助剂或详细反应机理的信息，也没有提供自1933年以来这些催化剂演变的全面历史视角。
