<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. The document focuses on specific chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad overview of chromium oxide catalysts' development over time. It does not discuss key industrial applications or research focus areas beyond the specific materials studied. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in the given text.

The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 or their key industrial applications and research focus areas. The document focuses on specific experiments using chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad overview of chromium oxide catalysts' development over time. To answer this question would require additional sources covering the history and industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts since 1933.

给定的文献中不包含关于铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年发现以来的历史演变,或其关键工业应用和研究重点领域的信息。该文档主要关注使用铬柱撑磷酸锆催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的特定实验,而不是提供铬氧化物催化剂随时间发展的广泛概述。要回答这个问题需要额外的资料来源,涵盖自1933年以来铬氧化物催化剂的历史和工业应用。

[1] "Up to the present supported chromia catalysts have been used for this purpose, 1-3 but this nonoxidative reaction presents some disadvantages."

[2] "An alternative method for dehydrogenation is the reaction of alkane with oxygen, that is, to carry out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH). This provides great advantages over a nonoxidative process due to engineering and economic considerations."

[3] "The goal of this work is to study the performance of two sets of catalysts based on chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, prepared by two colloidal methods, in the dehydrogenation of propane in inert and oxidative conditions."

[4] "Chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate materials show activity values for the ODH of propane similar to or higher than other catalysts reported in the literature, but working at lower temperatures."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does discuss some key developments and research areas:

1. Supported chromia catalysts have been traditionally used for non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, though this process has some disadvantages.

2. More recently, there has been a shift towards oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes using chromium-based catalysts, which offer engineering and economic advantages over non-oxidative methods.

3. Current research is focusing on improving catalyst performance through novel support materials and preparation methods. The study examines chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate catalysts prepared by different colloidal methods.

4. A key area of investigation is lowering reaction temperatures while maintaining high activity. The chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate materials studied showed comparable or higher activity for propane ODH at lower temperatures compared to other reported catalysts.

5. Research areas include studying catalyst structure, identifying active sites, exploring new support materials, and understanding reaction mechanisms for both oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

While the literature doesn't provide a comprehensive historical account, it illustrates the ongoing evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts towards more efficient and economical dehydrogenation processes.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来氧化铬基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实讨论了一些关键发展和研究领域：

1. 传统上，负载型氧化铬催化剂被用于非氧化脱氢反应，尽管这个过程存在一些缺点。

2. 最近，研究重点转向使用铬基催化剂的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程，与非氧化方法相比，这种方法在工程和经济方面具有优势。

3. 当前研究正致力于通过新型载体材料和制备方法来提高催化剂性能。该研究考察了通过不同胶体方法制备的氧化铬柱撑α-磷酸锆催化剂。

4. 一个关键的研究领域是在保持高活性的同时降低反应温度。研究的氧化铬柱撑磷酸锆材料在较低温度下显示出与其他报道的催化剂相当或更高的丙烷ODH活性。

5. 研究领域包括研究催化剂结构、识别活性位点、探索新的载体材料，以及理解氧化和非氧化脱氢过程的反应机理。

虽然文献没有提供全面的历史记录，但它展示了氧化铬基催化剂朝着更高效和经济的脱氢过程不断发展的过程。
