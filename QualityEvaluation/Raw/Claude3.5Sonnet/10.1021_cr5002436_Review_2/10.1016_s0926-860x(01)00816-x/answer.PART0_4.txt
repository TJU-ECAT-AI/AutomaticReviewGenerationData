[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "In addition, two Catofin units were built for the production of propylene, but it is understood that only one is operational with a nameplate dehydrogenation capacity of about 250,000 MTA propylene, but usually operating only on a seasonal basis."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial development: Chromia-alumina catalysts were first developed and commercialized in Germany, the United States, and England for butane dehydrogenation in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

2. Expansion of applications: In the late 1980s, Houdry extended the use of chromia-alumina catalysts to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation with the CatofinTM process.

3. Industrial adoption: By 2000, eight Catofin units were operational for isobutylene production, with a total capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum.

4. Diversification: Two Catofin units were built for propylene production, though only one was operational with a capacity of about 250,000 MTA.

5. Process improvements: The Catofin process operates on a cyclic principle, building upon the earlier Catadiene process.

Key research focus areas have likely included catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms, though specific details are not provided in the given text. The industrial applications have primarily been in the production of isobutylene and propylene through dehydrogenation processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年发现以来发展显著：

1. 初始开发：铬-氧化铝催化剂最初于20世纪30年代末和40年代初在德国、美国和英国开发并商业化，用于丁烷脱氢。

2. 应用扩展：20世纪80年代末，Houdry公司将铬-氧化铝催化剂的使用扩展到丙烷和异丁烷脱氢，推出了CatofinTM工艺。

3. 工业采用：到2000年，已有八个Catofin装置用于异丁烯生产，总产能约为280万吨/年。

4. 多样化：建造了两个用于丙烯生产的Catofin装置，但只有一个在运行，产能约为25万吨/年。

5. 工艺改进：Catofin工艺采用循环原理，在早期Catadiene工艺的基础上进行了改进。

关键研究重点领域可能包括催化剂结构、活性位点、载体材料和反应机理，尽管给定文本中未提供具体细节。工业应用主要集中在通过脱氢工艺生产异丁烯和丙烯。
