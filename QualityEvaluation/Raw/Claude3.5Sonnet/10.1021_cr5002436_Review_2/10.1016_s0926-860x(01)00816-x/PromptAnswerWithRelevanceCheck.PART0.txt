[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by S

[2] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the former Soviet Union. This process avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor configuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries [6]."
