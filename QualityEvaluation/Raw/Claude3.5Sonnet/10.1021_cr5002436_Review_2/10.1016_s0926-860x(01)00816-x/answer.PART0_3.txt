[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "In addition, two Catofin units were built for the production of propylene, but it is understood that only one is operational with a nameplate dehydrogenation capacity of about 250,000 MTA propylene, but usually operating only on a seasonal basis."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initially developed for butane dehydrogenation in Germany and independently by UOP and ICI in the 1940s.

2. The technology spread with plants coming online in England in 1940 and 1941.

3. In the late 1980s, Houdry extended the application to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation with the Catofin process.

4. By 2000, eight Catofin units were producing isobutylene, with a total capacity of 2.8 million MTA.

5. Two Catofin units were also built for propylene production, though only one was operational with a 250,000 MTA capacity.

Key industrial applications have focused on the production of butenes, isobutylene, and propylene. Research areas have likely included improving catalyst structure, identifying active sites, optimizing support materials, and developing promoters to enhance performance. While not explicitly stated in the given text, research on reaction mechanisms has likely been ongoing to further improve these catalysts and processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年发现以来在脱氢过程中的演变有很大进展：

1. 最初在德国开发用于丁烷脱氢，之后在20世纪40年代由UOP和ICI独立开发。

2. 该技术在1940年和1941年在英国的工厂投入使用后得到推广。

3. 20世纪80年代末，Houdry将其应用扩展到丙烷和异丁烷脱氢，开发了Catofin工艺。

4. 到2000年，已有8个Catofin装置生产异丁烯，总产能达280万吨/年。

5. 还建造了两个用于生产丙烯的Catofin装置，但据了解只有一个在运行，名义脱氢产能约为25万吨/年丙烯，通常只在季节性基础上运行。

主要工业应用集中在生产丁烯、异丁烯和丙烯。研究领域可能包括改进催化剂结构、识别活性位点、优化载体材料，以及开发促进剂以提高性能。虽然在给定的文本中没有明确说明，但对反应机理的研究可能一直在进行，以进一步改进这些催化剂和工艺。
