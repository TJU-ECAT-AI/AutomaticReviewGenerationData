[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by S
ud-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial development: Chromia-alumina catalysts were first developed and commercialized in Germany, with independent development by UOP in the US and ICI in England.

2. Early industrial applications: The first UOP-designed plant using chromia-alumina catalysts began operation in England in 1940, followed by two more units in 1941.

3. Process expansion: In the late 1980s, Houdry extended the application of chromia-alumina catalysts to dehydrogenate propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene, introducing the Catofin process.

4. Industrial scale-up: By 2000, eight Catofin units were in operation for isobutylene production, with a total capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum.

5. Technology ownership: The Catofin process technology is now owned by Süd-Chemie and licensed by ABB Lummus.

Key research focus areas have included improving catalyst structure, understanding active sites, developing better support materials, and optimizing promoters. The reaction mechanisms have also been studied to enhance the catalysts' performance in dehydrogenation processes. These advancements have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in industrial dehydrogenation applications.

自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 初期开发：氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂最早在德国开发和商业化，同时由美国的UOP和英国的ICI独立开发。

2. 早期工业应用：第一个使用氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂的UOP设计工厂于1940年在英国投产，随后1941年又有两个装置投产。

3. 工艺扩展：20世纪80年代末，Houdry将氧化铬-氧化铝催化剂的应用扩展到丙烷脱氢制丙烯和异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯，推出了Catofin工艺。

4. 工业规模扩大：到2000年，已有8个Catofin装置用于异丁烯生产，总产能约为280万吨/年。

5. 技术所有权：Catofin工艺技术现在由Süd-Chemie拥有，由ABB Lummus授权。

主要研究重点领域包括改进催化剂结构、理解活性位点、开发更好的载体材料和优化助剂。反应机理也被研究以提高催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能。这些进展促进了氧化铬基催化剂在工业脱氢应用中持续的重要性。
