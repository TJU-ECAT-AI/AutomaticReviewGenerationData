[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by S
ud-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial development: Chromia-alumina catalysts were first developed and commercialized for butane dehydrogenation in Germany, the United States, and England in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

2. Process expansion: In the late 1980s, Houdry extended the application of chromia-alumina catalysts to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation, introducing the Catofin process.

3. Industrial applications: The Catofin process became widely used for isobutylene production, with eight units operating by 2000, having a total capacity of 2.8 million metric tons per annum.

4. Ownership and licensing: The Catofin process technology is now owned by Süd-Chemie and licensed by ABB Lummus, indicating continued commercial relevance.

Key research focus areas have included:

1. Catalyst structure and active sites: Improving understanding of the chromia-alumina catalyst structure and identifying active sites for dehydrogenation.

2. Support materials: Optimizing the alumina support to enhance catalyst performance and stability.

3. Process design: Developing cyclic operation principles to maintain catalyst activity and manage heat requirements.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studying the dehydrogenation reaction pathways to improve selectivity and yield.

While the literature doesn't provide specific details on promoters or recent research developments, the evolution of chromia-alumina catalysts demonstrates their continued significance in industrial dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 初期开发：铬-氧化铝催化剂最初于20世纪30年代末和40年代初在德国、美国和英国开发并商业化，用于丁烷脱氢。

2. 工艺扩展：20世纪80年代末，Houdry将铬-氧化铝催化剂的应用扩展到丙烷和异丁烷脱氢，推出了Catofin工艺。

3. 工业应用：Catofin工艺广泛用于异丁烯生产，到2000年时已有8个装置运行，总产能达280万公吨/年。

4. 所有权和许可：Catofin工艺技术现由Süd-Chemie拥有，由ABB Lummus授权，表明其持续的商业相关性。

主要研究重点领域包括：

1. 催化剂结构和活性位点：提高对铬-氧化铝催化剂结构的理解，并识别脱氢的活性位点。

2. 载体材料：优化氧化铝载体以提高催化剂性能和稳定性。

3. 工艺设计：开发循环操作原理以维持催化剂活性并管理热量需求。

4. 反应机理：研究脱氢反应途径以提高选择性和产率。

虽然文献没有提供关于助剂或最近研究进展的具体细节，但铬-氧化铝催化剂的演变表明它们在工业脱氢工艺中持续具有重要意义。
