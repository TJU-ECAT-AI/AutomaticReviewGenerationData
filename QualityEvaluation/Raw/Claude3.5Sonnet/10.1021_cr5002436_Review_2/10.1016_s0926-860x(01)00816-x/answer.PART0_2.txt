[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the former Soviet Union. This process avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor configuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries [6]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initially developed for butane dehydrogenation in Germany, the US, and England.

2. The process typically used fixed shallow beds of chromia-alumina catalyst in various reactor designs.

3. In the late 1980s, the application expanded to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation with the Catofin process.

4. An alternative fluidized bed process was developed in the Soviet Union in 1959.

Key industrial applications include the production of butenes, propylene, and isobutylene. Research focus areas have included:

1. Reactor design: Fixed bed, fluidized bed, and cyclic operation processes.
2. Support materials: Primarily alumina.
3. Process improvements: Cyclic operation, continuous regeneration, and fluidized bed configurations.

The literature does not provide specific information on catalyst structure, active sites, promoters, or reaction mechanisms.

自1933年发现以来，用于脱氢的铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 最初在德国、美国和英国开发用于丁烷脱氢。

2. 该工艺通常在各种反应器设计中使用固定浅层铬-氧化铝催化剂床。

3. 在20世纪80年代末，应用扩展到丙烷和异丁烷脱氢，形成了Catofin工艺。

4. 1959年，苏联开发了一种替代性的流化床工艺。

主要工业应用包括生产丁烯、丙烯和异丁烯。研究重点领域包括：

1. 反应器设计：固定床、流化床和循环操作工艺。
2. 载体材料：主要是氧化铝。
3. 工艺改进：循环操作、连续再生和流化床配置。
