[1] "The activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation alkanes have been known for many decades, 2,3 and a recent investigation of the catalytic activity of CrOx/ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been reported."

[2] "This work concluded that Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."

[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using chromium oxide supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) has been widely studied."

[4] "Very recently, it has been shown that chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate displays rather high ethylene selectivities 24,25 in the ODH of ethane."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Applications: They have been widely used for dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane dehydrogenation.

2. Support materials: Research has focused on various supports, including alumina (Al2O3), zirconia (ZrO2), and layered zirconium phosphate.

3. Active sites: Studies have identified Cr(III) species as the primary active sites.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Research has explored the role of oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III) in the catalytic process.

5. Structure: Efforts have been made to improve catalyst dispersion and accessibility, such as incorporating chromium oxide into layered structures.

6. Selectivity: Recent work has shown high selectivity for ethylene in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane using chromium oxide catalysts.

Key research areas have included optimizing support materials, understanding the nature of active sites, and improving catalyst selectivity and stability. Industrial applications have primarily focused on the production of olefins from alkanes, with propane dehydrogenation being a significant area of interest.
