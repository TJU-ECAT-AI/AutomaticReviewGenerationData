[1] "The activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation alkanes have been known for many decades, 2,3 and a recent investigation of the catalytic activity of CrOx/ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been reported."

[2] "This work concluded that Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."

[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using chromium oxide supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) has been widely studied."

[4] "Very recently, it has been shown that chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate displays rather high ethylene selectivities 24,25 in the ODH of ethane."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Support materials: Initially, chromium oxide was supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3). More recently, zirconia (CrOx/ZrO2) and layered zirconium phosphate have been explored as support materials, showing improved performance.

2. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active sites. Cr(III) species have been identified as the primary active sites, with adjacent oxide ions potentially playing a role.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have investigated both traditional dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) mechanisms.

4. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts have been applied to the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, including propane and ethane.

5. Selectivity improvements: Recent research has shown high selectivity for ethylene in the ODH of ethane using chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate.

6. Structure: The structure of chromium oxide catalysts has been a key area of research, with studies exploring the effects of dispersion and incorporation into layered materials.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, driving improvements in activity, selectivity, and stability.

自1933年发现以来，用于脱氢过程的铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 载体材料：最初，铬氧化物被负载在氧化铝上（CrOx/Al2O3）。最近，氧化锆（CrOx/ZrO2）和层状磷酸锆被研究作为载体材料，显示出改进的性能。

2. 活性位点：研究重点集中在理解活性位点的性质上。Cr(III)物种被确定为主要活性位点，相邻的氧化物离子可能也起到作用。

3. 反应机理：研究调查了传统脱氢和氧化脱氢（ODH）机理。

4. 工业应用：铬氧化物催化剂已被应用于各种烷烃的脱氢，包括丙烷和乙烷。

5. 选择性改进：最近的研究表明，使用负载在氧化锆上或掺入层状磷酸锆中的铬氧化物进行乙烷的ODH反应时，对乙烯具有高选择性。

6. 结构：铬氧化物催化剂的结构一直是研究的关键领域，研究探讨了分散和掺入层状材料的影响。

这些发展促进了铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中持续的重要性，推动了活性、选择性和稳定性的改进。
