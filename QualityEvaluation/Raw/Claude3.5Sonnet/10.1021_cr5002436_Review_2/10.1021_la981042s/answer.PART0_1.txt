Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been studied for dehydrogenation processes for many decades since their discovery in 1933. Key developments include:

1. Support materials: Evolution from alumina supports to zirconia and layered zirconium phosphate.

2. Active sites: Identification of Cr(III) species as the primary active sites.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Investigation of the role of oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III) in the catalytic process.

4. Applications: Expansion from propane dehydrogenation to oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane.

5. Structure: Development of supported chromia catalysts and incorporation into layered materials.

6. Selectivity: Improvement in ethylene selectivity for ODH reactions.

Research has focused on understanding the nature of active sites, optimizing support materials, and improving catalyst performance in terms of activity and selectivity. Industrial applications have primarily been in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, with recent interest in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
