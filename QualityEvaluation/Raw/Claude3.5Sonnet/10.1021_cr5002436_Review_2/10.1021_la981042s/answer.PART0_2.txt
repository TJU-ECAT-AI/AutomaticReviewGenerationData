[1] "The activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation alkanes have been known for many decades, 2,3 and a recent investigation of the catalytic activity of CrOx/ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been reported. 4 The system was found to be highly active and selective in the dehydrogenation of propane at 723823 K."

[2] "This work concluded that Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."

[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using chromium oxide supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) has been widely studied. 5-8 This support is largely employed because of its high refractory surface area, but it presents the undesired feature of catalyzing side reactions (cracking and coking), leading to catalyst deactivation."

[4] "Very recently, it has been shown that chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate displays rather high ethylene selectivities 24,25 in the ODH of ethane."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Support materials: Initially, chromium oxide was supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) due to its high surface area. However, this support had issues with side reactions like cracking and coking. More recently, zirconia (CrOx/ZrO2) and layered zirconium phosphate have been used as supports, showing improved performance.

2. Active sites: Research has identified Cr(III) species as the primary active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The role of adjacent oxide ions to Cr(III) has also been investigated.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have focused on understanding the mechanisms of both direct dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes.

4. Industrial applications: These catalysts have been widely used for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, particularly propane dehydrogenation. They have also shown high selectivity for ethylene production in the ODH of ethane.

5. Performance improvements: Over time, research has led to catalysts with higher activity and selectivity, capable of operating at temperatures between 723-823 K for propane dehydrogenation.

6. Promoters and modifiers: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, research in this field often involves studying the effects of various promoters and modifiers to enhance catalyst performance.

The ongoing research focus areas include optimizing catalyst structure, improving selectivity, reducing coke formation, and developing more efficient supports to enhance the overall performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年发现以来，用于脱氢过程的铬氧化物基催化剂已经有了显著的发展：

1. 载体材料：最初，铬氧化物被负载在氧化铝上（CrOx/Al2O3），因为它具有高比表面积。然而，这种载体存在副反应如裂化和结焦的问题。最近，氧化锆（CrOx/ZrO2）和层状磷酸锆被用作载体，显示出更好的性能。

2. 活性位点：研究已经确定Cr(III)物种是脱氢反应的主要活性位点。邻近Cr(III)的氧化物离子的作用也已被研究。

3. 反应机理：研究集中在理解直接脱氢和氧化脱氢（ODH）过程的机理。

4. 工业应用：这些催化剂被广泛用于烷烃的脱氢，特别是丙烷脱氢。它们在乙烷的ODH过程中也表现出对乙烯的高选择性。

5. 性能改进：随着时间的推移，研究已经导致了具有更高活性和选择性的催化剂，能够在723-823 K的温度下进行丙烷脱氢。

6. 助剂和改性剂：虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但该领域的研究通常涉及研究各种助剂和改性剂对催化剂性能的影响。

持续的研究重点领域包括优化催化剂结构，提高选择性，减少焦炭形成，以及开发更有效的载体，以提高铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的整体性能。
