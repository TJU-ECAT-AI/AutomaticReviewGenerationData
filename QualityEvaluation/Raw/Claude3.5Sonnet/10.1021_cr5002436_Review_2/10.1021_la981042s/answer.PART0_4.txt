[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has great industrial importance because it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes for the polymerization and other organic syntheses from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "Metals deposited on different supports and supported chromium oxide have been used as heterogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[3] "The activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation alkanes have been known for many decades, and a recent investigation of the catalytic activity of CrOx/ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been reported."

[4] "This work concluded that Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."

[5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using chromium oxide supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) has been widely studied."

[6] "Very recently, it has been shown that chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate displays rather high ethylene selectivities in the ODH of ethane."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Industrial applications: They have become important for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to produce alkenes, which are valuable for polymerization and other organic syntheses.

2. Support materials: Research has focused on various supports for chromium oxide, including alumina, zirconia, and layered zirconium phosphate. These supports help improve catalyst performance and stability.

3. Active sites: Studies have identified Cr(III) species as the primary active sites, with adjacent oxide ions potentially playing a role in the catalytic process.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Research has explored both traditional dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, with recent work showing high ethylene selectivities in ODH of ethane using chromium oxide catalysts.

5. Structure: The development of supported chromium oxide catalysts has allowed for better dispersion and accessibility of active sites, improving overall catalytic performance.

6. Promoters: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, the use of promoters is a common area of research in catalyst development to enhance activity and selectivity.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by the need for more efficient and selective processes in the production of valuable alkenes from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons. Research continues to focus on optimizing catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions to improve performance in various dehydrogenation processes.
