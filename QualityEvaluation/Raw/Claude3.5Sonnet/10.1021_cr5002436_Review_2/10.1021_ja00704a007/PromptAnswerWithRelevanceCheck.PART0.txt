The given scientific literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or their key industrial applications. The document focuses on a specific study of hydrogen-deuterium equilibration and parahydrogen conversion over different forms of chromium oxide catalysts, including ruby (chromium-doped alumina), pure α-chromia, and chromia supported on α-alumina. It does not discuss the broader history or industrial applications of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

The research presented in the paper primarily investigates the structure and nature of active sites on chromium oxide catalysts for hydrogen-deuterium equilibration. Key focus areas include:

1. The effect of pretreatment conditions (oxidation and reduction) on catalytic activity.
2. The role of chromium oxidation states in catalytic activity.
3. The nature of active sites and their accessibility to molecular hydrogen.
4. The influence of chromium concentration and distribution (isolated ions vs. clusters) on catalyst performance.
5. The mechanisms of catalytic activity and deactivation.

While this research contributes to the understanding of chromium oxide catalysts, it does not directly address their evolution since 1933 or their significance in industrial dehydrogenation processes.

给定的科学文献并不包含关于铬氧化物催化剂自1933年以来的历史演变或其主要工业应用的信息。该文档主要关注对不同形式的铬氧化物催化剂（包括红宝石（铬掺杂氧化铝）、纯α-氧化铬和负载在α-氧化铝上的氧化铬）进行氢-氘平衡和仲氢转化的具体研究。它没有讨论这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的更广泛历史或工业应用。

文中所呈现的研究主要调查了铬氧化物催化剂上用于氢-氘平衡的活性位点的结构和性质。主要研究重点包括：

1. 预处理条件（氧化和还原）对催化活性的影响。
2. 铬氧化态在催化活性中的作用。
3. 活性位点的性质及其对分子氢的可及性。
4. 铬浓度和分布（孤立离子与团簇）对催化剂性能的影响。
5. 催化活性和失活的机理。

虽然这项研究有助于理解铬氧化物催化剂，但它并未直接涉及其自1933年以来的演变或在工业脱氢过程中的重要性。

The paper does touch on some relevant research focus areas, such as the structure of active sites and reaction mechanisms for hydrogen-deuterium equilibration. It investigates the effects of different pretreatments on catalytic activity and proposes models for the active species on the catalyst surface. However, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of research trends or industrial applications for chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

To fully answer the question about the evolution and industrial significance of chromium oxide catalysts, additional sources focusing on the historical development and commercial applications of these materials would be needed.

The research described in the paper investigates the nature of active sites for hydrogen-deuterium equilibration, examining factors such as pretreatment conditions, surface structure, and oxidation states of chromium. While this contributes to the understanding of chromia catalysts, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of their historical development or industrial significance.

The study does touch on some aspects of structure, active sites, and support materials, but primarily in the context of this specific reaction rather than broader applications. It does not discuss promoters or provide a historical perspective on the development of these catalysts since their discovery.
