Abstract
Chromium catalysts, prepared with different chromium contents, supports and precursor compounds, were characterized
by O2 and CO chemisorption, in order to quantify the Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites, active species to dehydrogenation and ethylene
polymerization reactions. Both probe molecules, O2 and CO, showed to be selective to the chromium active species, Cr3+ and
Cr2+, respectively, and a valid method to quantify these sites. Distinct chromium species, Cr6+, amorphous Cr3+, crystalline
Cr3+ and Cr2+, were characterized by XRD, DRS, TPR, FT-IR and DRIFTS in the calcined and reduced catalysts. The
distribution of chromium species, which depends on the content, precursor compound and support, was related to the catalytic
activity in the dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions. The catalytic activity to cyclohexane dehydrogenation depends
on the dispersion of amorphous Cr3+ species. The activity in the ethylene polymerization is related to the amount of Cr2+
A
and Cr2+
B species. Both sites showed similar activities.

1. Introduction
Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on
alumina have industrial application in ethylene poly-
merization and dehydrogenation reactions [1–5]. The
active sites for these reactions are Cr2+ [6–9] and
Cr3+ [10–12], respectively. The chromium catalysts
for ethylene polymerization, Phillips-type, are pre-
pared by impregnation of an inorganic precursor on
silica of high speciﬁc surface and volume of pores,
yielding catalysts with 1 wt.% or less chromium con-
tent. The literature [13–16] suggests that, indepen-
dently of the precursor, there is not difference in the

oxidation state of the chromium with low Cr content,
after calcination, being observed mainly Cr6+. Oth-
erwise, in previous works [17,18], we showed that
the chromium content and the precursor compound
affected largely the chromium species distribution in
their calcined and reduced forms.
Chromium supported catalysts are used in the
ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutane dehydrogena-
tions to the corresponding oleﬁns, in the temperature
range of 623–773 K and atmospheric pressure, with
high selectivity to alkenes [19]. One of the dehydro-
genation reactions of largest commercial interest is
the dehydrogenation of isobutane to yield isobutene,
which is intermediary for methyl tert-butyl ether
(MTBE) production. MTBE is added to gasoline to
improve the octane number, yielding cleaner burning
fuel [20], but the contamination of drinking water and

groundwater by MTBE is causing its elimination as a
gasoline additive [21]. However, an important amount
of the isobutene is used to produce butyl rubber, poly-
isobutylene and other specialities [22]. Besides, the
oxidative and non-oxidative isobutane dehydrogena-
tion with chromium catalysts still deserve interest in
the literature as a model reaction [23–25].
Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have been used industrially in
dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are pre-
pared by impregnation of a chromium compound,
usually nitrate, and resulting catalysts with chromium
loading in the range of 3–13 wt.% Cr [3]. The
chromium is anchored on alumina through the basic
and neutral hydroxyls, observed by infrared spec-
troscopy at 3775 and 3730 cm−1 [19]. The additions
of potassium to reduce cracking reactions [3] and
other supports, such as zirconia [26], have also been
studied.
Several factors have inﬂuence in the catalytic activ-
ity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state,
the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates
or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium
species with the support. These variations depend
on the metallic content, the precursor compound of
chromium, the support characteristics and calcination
conditions [2,3]. In the calcined state, the presence
of Cr6+, with different interactions with the support,
and crystalline or amorphous Cr3+ have been stud-
ied by inﬂuencing in the formation of active species
in the polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions
[1–3,12–14,17–19]. The literature reports that the ac-
tive site in the dehydrogenation is the Cr3+ species
coordinated to the hydroxyls, coordinativelly un-
saturated [10–12]. This species can be obtained by
reduction of the calcined sample with H2 at 773 K.
On the other hand, the active site of chromium for
ethylene polymerization was reported to be the Cr2+

[2,6–9,27]. These sites can be obtained by reduction
of the calcined sample with carbon monoxide at 623 K
[28]. The reduction with carbon monoxide converts
Cr6+ toCr2+, while with H2 only Cr3+ is obtained.
Moreover, the Cr3+ originally present is not reduced
[17].
The characterization of the chromium sites of the
calcined and reduced states has been studied by us-
ing different spectroscopic techniques, like XPS, DRS
and FT-IR [2,8,17,29–31]. However, the presence of
different surface chromium species hinders the inter-
pretation of the spectra. Particularly, in the analysis
of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the pho-
toreduction of the Cr6+ species, induced by the ex-
position to the X-rays, requires the use of procedures
to minimize this effect in order to validate the results
[29–31]. The application of adsorption techniques of
probe molecules, that allows to quantify the chromium
sites, is not very explored and the methodology is not
consolidated [12,18,32,33].
The literature reports the use of the chemisorption
of O2 at low temperatures to quantify the Cr3+ sites in
the bulk or supported Cr2O3 [12,32]. Even so, the se-
lectivity of the chemisorption of O2 to the amorphous
sites Cr3+ requires more detailed studies. On the other
hand, the Cr2+ is reported as the active site for ethy-
lene polymerization in Cr/SiO2 catalysts, being char-
acterized by adsorption of carbon monoxide at room
temperature [33], followed by infrared spectroscopy
analysis. The Cr2+ sites are divided in Cr2+

species [6,7,27], in decreasing order of interac-
tion with the hydroxyls groups on the surface of the
support, according to the schematic representation of
Kim and Woo [27], as showed in Fig. 1. The Cr2+

ization, being Cr2+

does not. In a previous work [18], we showed that cat-
alysts with similar Cr2+
A
amount presented different
activities in the ethylene polymerization. Our results
suggested that not only Cr2+
A , but also Cr2+
B sites have
activity in the polymerization. The main problem in
the identiﬁcation of the Cr2+ sites is its oxidation
when in contact with very low concentration (ppm) of
oxygen and/or water [34]. Thus, the characterization
and the use of these catalysts in the polymerization
require the attainment and maintenance of the Cr2+
species during the process. Besides, just a small
amount of the Cr2+ sites can be considered active
to the polymerization (less than 1 wt.% Cr) [35,36].
Therefore, the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of
these species are important to explain the behavior of
chromium catalysts in the ethylene polymerization.
The objective of this work was to study the
chemisorption of O2 and CO to quantify the active
sites of chromium catalysts and to evaluate the cat-
alytic activity in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation
and in the ethylene polymerization in the light of
the chromium species characterization. The dehydro-
genation reaction was studied with chromium cata-
lysts prepared on silica and on alumina by varying
the chromium content. The polymerization reaction
was carried out with chromium catalysts prepared
with different precursors supported on silica, result-
ing 1 wt.% Cr. The catalysts were characterized by
X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR), diffuse reﬂectance Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), tempera-
ture programmed reduction (TPR) of H2 and diffuse
reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS). The active sites for
dehydrogenation and polymerization reactions were
quantiﬁed by O2 and CO chemisorption, after reduc-
tion with H2 or CO, respectively.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
The catalysts were prepared by impregnation of
aqueous solutions (15 ml/g support) with different
chromium contents and precursors added to the
-Al2O3 (Engelhard HARSHAW AL3916P, surface
area = 191 m2/g and pore volume = 0.46 cm3/g) and
SiO2 supports (Davison GRACE 955, surface area =
299 m2/g and pore volume = 1.6 cm3/g). The ethylene
polymerization was investigated with Cr/SiO2 cata-
lysts prepared with different chromium precursors. In
the preparation of these Cr/SiO2 catalysts, chromium
acetate(II), chromium chloride(II), chromium ox-
ide(VI), all obtained from Aldrich (99.9% purity),
and bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate, prepared according
to Baker and Carrick [37], were used, resulting sam-
ples with 1 wt.% Cr. The bis(triphenylsilyl)chromate
salt was solubilized in hexane (Merck) prior to the
catalyst preparation. Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 cata-
lysts prepared with different chromium contents were
studied in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Cr/SiO2
catalysts were prepared using chromium(III) nitrate
(Merck) resulting samples with 1.5, 3 and 5 wt.% Cr.
In the preparation of the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, an aque-
ous solution of chromium(III) nitrate (Merck) was
also used, with contents in the range of 1.5–9 wt.% Cr.
The catalysts were calcined at 773–823 K for 4 h un-
der dry air ﬂow. Physical mixtures were also prepared
mixing by careful grinding CrO3 or Cr2O3 (Aldrich,
99.9%) with silica in an agate mortar, resulting the
content of 3 wt.% Cr, and CrO3 with alumina, in the
contents of 2 and 13 wt.% Cr.
2.2. Characterization techniques
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were car-
ried out with the calcined samples, employing a
Rigaku Miniﬂex difractometer (voltage: 30 kV and
current: 15 mA), equipped with a copper tube (λ =
1.5417 Å) and a graphite monochromator, operated
in the step-scan mode 0.05◦2θ per step and counting
for 2 s per step.
Infrared spectroscopy experiments were performed
on a FT-IR Perkin-Elmer 2000 spectrometer with a
resolution of 4 cm−1, in order to observe the change
of the hydroxyls region of silica and alumina because
of the interaction with chromium. Self supported
wafers (∼10 mg/cm2) were pretreated in situ in a
cell equipped with CaF2 window. The samples were
submitted to vacuum at 773 K for 1 h before the
analyses. FT-IR spectra were obtained rationing the
experimental spectra by the background.
The Cr/SiO2 catalysts with 1 wt.% Cr were also
submitted to DRIFTS measurements on a NICOLET
Magna IR 760 instrument with a diffuse reﬂectance ac-
cessory equiped with a vacuum cell from Spectratech.

A.B. Gaspar et al. / Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 203 (2003) 251–266
This analysis was carried out to observe the bands
in the region at 2500–4000 cm−1 ascribed to the in-
teraction of Cr2+ species with the surface hydroxyls
of the support, after reduction of the samples with
carbon monoxide. The bands at 3725 and 3600 cm−1,
ascribed to Cr2+
B and Cr2+
C species, respectively, were
monitored [27]. The DRIFTS cell was ﬁlled with ap-
proximately 22 mg of the sample, and the following
activation treatment was carried out in situ: helium
ﬂow (AGA, 99.999%) at 773 K for 1 h and reduction
at 623 K with a 5% CO/He ﬂow (AGA, <2 ppm O2,
<3 ppm H2O and <1 ppm CO2) for 1 h. The spec-
tra were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm−1 with
a DTGS detector, and are presented as the subtrac-
tion of the reduced sample spectrum from the dried
sample spectrum in the 4000–2500 cm−1 region.
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) of H2
were performed in a Pyrex U-tube reactor with an
on line thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The cat-
alyst (0.5 g) was dried at 773 K for 1 h with argon
ﬂow (AGA, 99.99%) and reduced from 298 to 1023 K
(10 K/min) with 1.6% H2/Ar ﬂow. The TCD, con-
nected to a PC computer, allowed to study the reduc-
tion proﬁles of H2 with the temperature.
Diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS) analy-
ses were done on a Varian Cary 5 UV-Vis-NIR
spectrophotometer equipped with a Praying Man-
tis diffuse reﬂection device from Harrick. Spectra
were taken in the calcined Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, in the
range of 800–200 nm, in order to observe the distinct
Cr6+/Cr3+ species distribution. CrO3 and -Cr2O3
spectra were used as references.
The chemisorption analysis of carbon monoxide
in the Cr/SiO2 catalysts was accomplished in an
equipment ASAP 2000-C from Micromeritcs, af-
ter reduction of the samples with a mixture of 5%
CO/He at 623 K for 1 h. The procedure was fol-
lowed by chemisorption of carbon monoxide (static
method) at 298 K. The Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 (pre-
pared with chromium nitrate) catalysts were analyzed
by chemisorption of O2 at 193 K, after reduction with
pure H2 at 773 K for 1 h. The chemisorption temper-
ature was kept by using an isopropilic alcohol with
liquid N2 mixture. The static chemisorption were ob-
tained in the pressure range of 20–200 mmHg. In each
analysis, total and reversible adsorption isotherms
were obtained. After reduction of the catalyst and vac-
uum at the reduction temperature, the total isotherm
was obtained. Then, the sample was evacuated at the
adsorption temperature and the second isotherm was
determined, corresponding to the reversible isotherm.
The irreversible chemisorption was obtained by the
difference average between the total and reversible
isotherms or by the extrapolation of the total isotherm
to the null pressure.
2.3. Activity measurements
The 1 wt.% Cr/SiO2 catalysts (100 mg), prepared
with different chromium precursors, were submitted
to the ethylene polymerization in a Büchi glasuster
reactor (2 l) at 358 K and pressure of 22 bar, using
1 l of n-hexane (2–3 ppm H2O) and triethyl-aluminum
(molar TEA/Cr ratio = 6.0). Initially, 1 l of puriﬁed
n-hexane and triethyl-aluminum (TEA), just enough
to the elimination of residual humidity of the sys-
tem, were added to the reactor. After that, the catalyst,
previously reduced with CO at 623 K, was carefully
transferred to the reactor, using a glove bag with in-
ert atmosphere. Then, puriﬁed ethylene (<4 ppm H2O
and <2 ppm O2) was admitted up to the total pressure
of 22 bar. After 1 h of reaction, the polyethylene was
removed from the reactor, dried to elimination of the
solvent and weighed for determination of the activity.
The Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 catalysts (0.5 g), pre-
pared with chromium nitrate and different contents,
were studied in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation at
773 K and at atmospheric pressure. The reactional
mixture was obtained by passing H2 ﬂow into a sat-
urator maintained at 285 K (W/F = 0.016 g min/ml).
In these conditions, diffusional effects are neglected.
The tests were accomplished in differential reactor
conditions, with conversions about 10%. The reduc-
tion pretreatments were identical to the used before
the chemisorption analyses, in order to obtain the ac-
tive sites for dehydrogenation and polymerization.
3. Results and discussion
Chromium catalysts, prepared with different con-
tents supported on silica and on alumina, were
evaluated in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation. The
ethylene polymerization was studied with 1 wt.% Cr
on silica, using distinct chromium compounds. The

included.
3.1. Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 catalysts for
dehydrogenation
3.1.1. Characterization
The XRD results are presented in Figs. 2 and 3.
Comparing the X-ray diffractograms of the catalysts
with the one of the pure crystalline -Cr2O3, the char-
acteristic bands of this compound are observed in all
the Cr/SiO2, but not in the catalysts prepared on alu-
mina. This result indicates that the alumina hinders the
formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase or that it dis-
perses the crystals of -Cr2O3 turning them too small
to be detected. Such results suggest a better disper-
sion of the chromium on alumina than on silica. Ca-
vani et al. [1] observed the -Cr2O3 phase with 5 wt.%
of chromium on alumina. However, the authors used
a support composed by a mixture of three crystalline
phases, which may turn easier the formation of the
-Cr2O3. The intensity of the characteristic bands of
-Cr2O3 increases with the chromium loading in the
Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 3). This crystalline phase was
detected in the 1.5 wt.% Cr on silica (1.5CrNSi), on the
contrary of the reported by McDaniel and Welch [13],
that just observed this species starting from 2.9 wt.%
Cr. However, other authors have observed lower val-
ues for the chromium monolayer on silica, in the range
of 1.0–1.5 wt.% Cr [19,38,39].
The FT-IR results are presented in the Figs. 4 and 5.
The consumption of the surface hydroxyls decreases
as the chromium content increases. Such hydroxyls
are the isolated ones in the silica (3740 cm−1) and
the basic and neutral ones in the alumina (3775 and
3730 cm−1) [14,40–42]. In the Cr/SiO2 samples, a
signiﬁcant amount of isolated hydroxyls remains even
for the greater chromium content. This result agrees
with the work of Vuurman et. al. [19]. In the Cr/Al2O3
samples, the hydroxyls consumption is more evident.
In the 9CrNAl catalyst, prepared with chromium(III)
nitrate, the bands ascribed to the basic and neutral
hydroxyls are almost indistinguishable. This result

means an almost complete recovering of the surface
of the support. The 13CrAlP6 sample, prepared with
chromium oxide(VI), presented an unexpected result.
Despite of being a physical mixture, its spectrum did
not present the bands of the surface hydroxyls, show-
ing interaction between the support and the CrO3, as
well as a high covering degree. A spreading process

must be occurring in this sample. Our hypothesis is
based on low surface tension of the CrO3 and on the
hygroscopic characteristic of this oxide. The CrO3
absorb water from the atmosphere, solubilizes in it
and spreads in the surface of the support, as it occurs
in the preparation of the catalysts. The 3CrSiP6 sam-
ple presented a similar result, with consumption of

surface hydroxyls greater than would be expected for
a physical mixture.
Temperature programmed reduction with H2 was
done to study the chromium-support interaction and to
calculate the fraction of Cr6+ in the calcined catalysts.
Consumption of H2 was not observed for -Cr2O3.

The physical mixtures of CrO3 with SiO2 and with

theoretical reduction from Cr6+ to Cr3+, represented
by the reaction 2CrO3 + 3H2 →Cr2O3 + 3H2O.
These results permitted to use the hypothesis that the

conditions with H2 is Cr3+. Thus, it was obtained
the fraction of Cr6+ in the calcined samples, taking
into account the theoretical consumption of the re-
duction from Cr6+ to Cr3+ (29 mol H2/mg Cr) and
considering complete reduction of Cr6+.
Table 2 presents the results of H2 consumption for
the Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, the temperature
ascribed to the maximum consumption of H2 (Tmax)
and the initial percentage of Cr6+. It is observed that
the Cr/SiO2 catalysts presented a smaller H2 con-
sumption than the theoretical value. This fact can be

interpreted as being due to the existence of an initial
fraction of Cr3+ in the catalysts or as a high interaction
of the Cr6+ with the support, hindering its reduction
to Cr3+. The XRD results conﬁrm the ﬁrst hypothesis,
showing the existence of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase in
the three Cr/SiO2 catalysts after the calcination step,
as reported in Fig. 3 and indicated in Table 2. It is also
observed a similar H2 consumption for the 1.5CrNSi
and 3CrNSi catalysts, with a marked decrease for the
5CrNSi catalyst. This behavior can be ascribed to the
formation of a large fraction of Cr3+ in this catalyst
and therefore reducing the H2 consumption. Fig. 6 ex-
hibits the reduction proﬁles for the Cr/SiO2 catalysts.
It is observed a main peak, in the temperature around
750 K, ascribed to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. The
temperatures of maximum consumption of H2 (Tmax)
were similar, just increasing for the 5CrNSi catalyst.
This fact can be interpreted in the same way of the
consumption, relative to the formation of crystalline
-Cr2O3 phase, that would hinder the reduction of
the Cr6+ species. Nevertheless, the catalysts also pre-
sented H2 consumption at lower temperature, around
650 K. This behavior can be ascribed to the reduction
of Cr6+ with different interactions with the support.
According to Ellison et al. [43], reduction peaks in the
region of 628–678 K in Cr/SiO2 catalysts are ascribed

259
to CrO3 clusters with smaller interaction with the
support.
Concerning the Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, the Table 2
shows that for the sample with the lowest chromium
content the H2 consumption corresponds to the sto-
ichometric value for the total reduction of Cr6+ to
Cr3+. Thus, it was observed only Cr6+ in the 1.5Cr-
NAl calcined sample. As the chromium content in-
creases, the catalysts presented decrease in the H2
consumption. These results are in agreement with
the diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy (DRS) analyses,
shown in Fig. 7. The 1.5CrNAl and 3CrNAl catalysts
presented bands at 260 and 380 nm, ascribed to Cr6+,
as shown by the CrO3 spectrum and also reported
by Cavani et al. [1]. A shoulder at around 470 nm
is also shown, ascribed to Cr6+ in the chromate or
dichromate arrangement in contact with the support.
The increase of the chromium loading caused the
appearance of a shoulder at 600 nm in the 6CrNAl
and 9CrNAl catalysts, ascribed to Cr3+ species, as
shown in the -Cr2O3 spectrum. Cavani et al. [1] also
observed the initial formation of a fraction of Cr6+,
followed by a fraction of Cr3+ in Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.
In this study, the results indicated the initial formation
of Cr6+ and, later, a growing formation of Cr3+, with
increase of the chromium loading. Fig. 8 presents
Fig. 7. DRS spectra of the Cr/Al2O3 samples, -Cr2O3 and CrO3.
the reduction proﬁles obtained for the Cr/Al2O3 cat-
alysts. Distinctly from the Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 6),
there is only one peak ascribed to the reduction of
Cr6+ to Cr3+. Concerning the reduction temperature,
it is observed that Tmax shifts to lower values as the
chromium content increases. According to Cavani
et al. [1], two Cr6+ species, the graftized and the sol-
uble Cr6+, can be formed in Cr/Al2O3 catalysts by
varying the chromium loading. The observed species
in the lower contents is the graftized Cr6+, which
presents greater interaction with the support than the
soluble Cr6+, formed later. The interaction of the
graftized Cr6+ with the support would difﬁcult its re-
duction. As the chromium content increases, a larger
fraction of the other species, the soluble Cr6+, easier
to reduce, is formed.
Comparing the supports, it is noticed that the cat-
alysts on silica presented thoroughly smaller H2 con-
sumption than on alumina, besides larger reduction
temperature interval and higher maximum tempera-
ture (Tmax). Therefore, the alumina would be capable
to stabilize a larger fraction of chromium in the Cr6+
oxidation state, or the support would present a smaller
interaction with the Cr6+. Both arguments can explain
the chromium reduction. These results show that the
chromium reduction on silica is more difﬁcult than on

alumina, being consistent with the interpretation that
the Cr6+ interacts more strongly with silica than with
alumina.
In order to verify the selectivity of the chemisorp-
tion of O2 to the amorphous Cr3+ species, active
sites for dehydrogenation [10–12], previous tests
were carried out with crystalline Cr3+ (-Cr2O3) and
CrO3 in physical mixtures. The tests were carried out
after reduction treatment with ﬂow of H2 at 773 K.
The physical mixture with the highest CrO3 load-
ing (13CrAlP6) was used to verify the occurrence
of O2 chemisorption in the Cr6+ sites. In this case,
the pretreatment consisted only of drying the sample
under He ﬂow at 473 K to avoid the reduction of the
Cr6+. These tests are presented in the Table 3. The
results of the difference average among the total and
reversible values of O2 (Qmedium) of the supports and

the physical mixtures (13CrAlP6 and 3CrSiP3) pre-
sented deviations in relation to the values obtained for
the extrapolation of the total isotherm for null pres-
sure (QP0). The isotherms obtained for the 3CrSiP3
physical mixture are presented in the Fig. 9(A). It is
noticed that the difference between the total and the
reversible isotherms is not constant, increasing with
the pressure, phenomenon ascribed to the physisorp-
tion [44,45]. Thus, the value of the amount of O2
chemisorbed corresponds to the extrapolation to null
pressure. On the other hand, the isotherms for amor-
phous Cr3+ (2CrAlP6 physical mixture) presented
similar values for the total isotherm at null pressure
and the average of the difference among total and
reversible isotherms, 4585 and 4464 mol O2/g Cr,
respectively (deviation around 3%). In this case, the
discount of the reversible fraction of O2, guarantees

the reliability of the irreversible amount. The same
behavior was veriﬁed for all the catalysts, exempliﬁed
in the Fig. 9(B) for the 9CrNAl catalyst.
With the results of Table 3, it was possible to con-
ﬁrm that the Cr6+ practically does not chemisorb
O2 in comparison with the amorphous Cr3+. The
crystalline Cr3+, bulk or in physical mixture with
the support, chemisorb in small amount. How-
ever, -Cr2O3 chemisorbs seven times more oxy-
gen in physical mixture than in the bulk, 237 and
32 mol O2/g Cr, respectively, ascribed to the dis-
persion process of the chromium with the support.
The result found by Rama Rao et al. [12] for a bulk
-Cr2O3 (34 mol O2/g Cr) was similar to that found
in this study (32 mol O2/g Cr). Nevertheless, in
both cases the chemisorbed amount in the crystalline
Cr3+ is small in comparison with the amorphous
Cr3+. The chemisorbed amount in the amorphous
Cr3+ (2CrAlP6) is about 20 times greater than for
-Cr2O3 in physical mixture, what means that O2

chemisorption occurs predominantly in the amor-
phous Cr3+.
The Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were analyzed
by O2 chemisorption with the aim of study the effects
of the chromium content and of the support in the
active sites for dehydrogenation reaction. The Fig. 10
shows that both Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 catalysts pre-
sented a decrease of the O2 chemisorption as the
chromium content increases. It is also observed that
the physical mixtures of CrO3 on Al2O3 presented
values of O2 chemisorption with the same tendency
of the catalysts, depending on the chromium content
of the samples. This behavior is not the expected for
simple physical mixtures. The result of the 2CrAlP6
sample is signiﬁcant to analyze this subject. This sam-
ple presented a value for O2 chemisorption between
1.5CrNAl and 3CrNAl catalysts. As discussed for the
FT-IR analysis of the 13CrAlP6 physical mixture,
this result can also be ascribed to a spreading process
driven by the extremely hygroscopic characteristic
of CrO3. This spreading phenomenon can also be
inﬂuenced by the characteristics of the support. As
the CrO3 is an oxide with acidic character, it inter-
acts with the basic hydroxyls of the alumina and this
process is promoted by its low surface tension [46].
Table 4 presents the measurements of O2 chemisorp-
tion after the reduction treatment. The results show a
decrease of the amount of O2 chemisorbed with the
increase of the chromium content. The data were in-
terpreted as an increase of the aggregation of the par-
ticles of chromium for higher contents. For Cr/SiO2
catalysts, another factor is that the decrease of the
value of O2 chemisorption is consequence of the
formation of the crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, detected
by XRD (Fig. 3), which does not chemisorb O2 and
whose proportion would increase with the chromium
content [1].
It is also observed that the results of O2 chemisorp-
tion for the samples on alumina were systematically
greater than on silica, which suggests a better capac-
ity of the alumina to disperse the active phase. This
phenomenon is connected to the higher concentration
of the surface hydroxyls of alumina in comparison to
the silica. The concentration of the surface hydroxyls
is estimated to be about 6.7 OH/nm2 in the silica and
12.6 OH/nm2 in the alumina at 373 K [38,39]. The
chemisorption results were coherent with the XRD
analyses, which showed a crystalline -Cr2O3 phase
on silica whose intensity increased with the chromium
content. This fact, once the crystalline Cr3+ does not
chemisorb O2, provokes a decrease in the amount of
O2 chemisorbed by chromium loading. On the other
hand, crystalline phase was not found in the cata-
lysts supported on alumina, Fig. 2, justifying that the

results of chemisorption of the catalysts on alumina
were larger than on silica. Based on those results, the
O2 chemisorption analysis was considered consistent
and a valid method to quantify the amorphous Cr3+
sites and, therefore, its results were compared with
the catalytic tests.
3.1.2. Cyclohexane dehydrogenation
Table 4 presents the results of cyclohexane dehydro-
genation for the catalysts and physical mixtures. Ben-
zene was the main product of the reaction, followed
by traces of cyclohexene, as observed in the literature
[47]. It was also veriﬁed that the -Cr2O3 does not
have activity for the dehydrogenation. The turnover
number (TON) was calculated considering dissocia-
tive adsorption of O2 in the chromium sites, expressed
by the O2/Cr = 1 : 2 ratio [48]. The results show that
the TON is not constant, increasing as the chromium
content increases. Thus, for supported chromium ox-
ide catalysts the reaction is not structure-insensitive,
unlike the behavior observed for supported noble met-
als [49]. A 10-factor between the lowest and the high-
est activity for samples of chromium on alumina is
observed. The increase in the chromium particles ag-
gregation increases the activity of the amorphous Cr3+
sites. In the Cr/SiO2 catalysts, in spite of the detection
of the -Cr2O3 phase by XRD, the increase in the ac-
tivity was also observed, ascribed to the amorphous
Cr3+ aggregation.
The physical mixtures presented a typical behavior
of catalyst, with the activity shifting likewise the cat-
alysts in function of the chromium content. A TON
range of 20-times was obtained for the physical mix-
tures with 2 and 13 wt.% Cr. However, the catalytic
activity is mainly dependent of the dispersion of amor-
phous Cr3+ species.
3.2. Cr/SiO2 catalysts for polymerization
3.2.1. Characterization
The catalysts, prepared with 1 wt.% Cr using differ-
ent precursors (Table 1), were characterized by XRD,
CO chemisorption and DRIFTS. In these catalysts, the
-Cr2O3 phase was not observed by XRD, after the
calcination step, as it was for the Cr/SiO2 catalysts pre-
pared with chromium nitrate and loading of 1.5 wt.%
Cr and higher. In our previous work [17], a fraction
of amorphous Cr2O3 was observed in DR spectra for
the 1CrBSi and 1CrCSi catalysts, while 1CrASi and
1CrDSi presented only Cr6+ after calcination. There-
fore, distinct fractions of Cr6+ and Cr3+ were identi-
ﬁed in the calcined form, depending on the chromium
compound.
Preliminary tests with samples containing only
Cr3+ or Cr6+ species in physical mixture were car-
ried out in order to characterize the selectivity of CO
chemisorption on Cr2+, active sites for ethylene poly-
merization. The physical mixture of Cr2O3 in SiO2
(3CrSiP3) did not present CO chemisorption, as well
as the physical mixture of CrO3 in SiO2 (3CrSiP6),
without previous reduction, and therefore presenting
only Cr6+. These results show that the technique is
selective to characterize Cr2+, since Cr6+ and Cr3+
species do not chemisorb CO.

Table 5 presents the distribution of chromium
species after reduction with CO. The Cr2+ species
distribution was based on CO chemisorption and
DRIFTS analyses in the hydroxyls region of the spec-
trum. The bands at 3745, 3725 and 3600 cm−1 are
ascribed to the isolated hydroxyls group [41], the
Cr2+
B
and Cr2+
C
species interacting with the surface
hydroxyls of the support, respectively [27]. In the
calculation of the species distribution, we considered
that the extinction coefﬁcients of IR bands have the
same order of magnitude and that the adsorption stoi-
chometry ratio Cr2+:CO is 1:1 [33,36]. The catalysts
can be classiﬁed in decreasing order of Cr2+ (Cr2+
A
and Cr2+
B ) species: 1CrDSi > 1CrASi ≫1CrCSi >
1CrBSi, owing to its CO chemisorption results. These
results are also related to the percentage of Cr3+, ob-
tained in previous TPR and DRS analyses, and in the
complete reduction of the Cr6+ present for Cr2+ [17].
The 1CrASi and 1CrDSi catalysts, that presented
only Cr6+ after the calcination and total reduction to
Cr2+, showed the highest values of CO chemisorption,
presenting the largest fractions of Cr2+ active sites.
The 1CrBSi and 1CrCSi catalysts presented the low-
est amount of CO, also in agreement with the smaller
percentage of Cr6+ in the calcined state and, there-
fore, smaller amount of Cr2+ sites after reduction. The
largest chemisorption of CO in the 1CrDSi catalyst
compared with the 1CrASi is associated to the largest
fraction of Cr2+
A +Cr2+
B active species than Cr2+
C , that
does not adsorb CO and it is not active in the poly-
merization.
The 3CrSiP6 physical mixture presented low CO
chemisorption in contrast with the 1CrDSi catalyst,
that was also prepared with CrO3. However, the CO
chemisorption of the physical mixture was similar to
the obtained for the 1CrBSi catalyst, which presented
smaller Cr2+ fraction. The lower CO chemisorption
of the physical mixture can be ascribed to the largest
fraction of Cr2+
C .
Therefore, the 1CrASi and 1CrDSi catalysts pre-
sented the largest Cr2+
A + Cr2+
B fractions. The 1CrBSi
and 1CrCSi presented Cr2+ and Cr3+ species; this last
one cannot be reduced by carbon monoxide and does
not chemisorb CO. The fraction of Cr2+
A
was greater
than the fraction of Cr2+
B
for all the samples. Ac-
cording to the literature [7], Cr2+
A is transformed into
Cr2+
C at high temperatures under vacuum. This behav-
ior is believed to be connected to the greater amount
of Cr2+
B than Cr2+
A species for catalysts prepared with
chromium acetate (1 and 3 wt.% Cr) in our previous
work [18]. For these samples, we used a higher evac-
uation temperature (773 K) after reduction than in this
work. Therefore, another important point is to com-
pare the Cr2+ species distribution in the same treat-
ment conditions.
3.2.2. Ethylene polymerization
The catalysts presented activities in the ethylene
polymerization related to the amount of Cr2+
A
and
Cr2+
B
active sites (Table 5). A correlation is observed
between these parameters, resulting in two groups of
catalysts in according to its activities: 1CrDSi/1CrASi
and 1CrBSi/1CrCSi. The activity of the Cr2+
A
and
Cr2+
B
sites was similar, since samples with dis-
tinct Cr2+
A /(Cr2+
A
+ Cr2+
B ) ratios, between 64 and

93%, and total of active sites similar (Table 5) pre-
sented comparable polymerization activities, 320 and
376 kg PE/g Cr2+ (1CrASi and 1CrDSi, respectively).
Thus, the ethylene polymerization is proportional to
the total amount of Cr2+
A
and Cr2+
B
sites and the ac-
tivity of these species is equivalent, as observed in
Fig. 11. The CO chemisorption showed to be an im-
portant characterization technique to distinguish the
Cr/SiO2 catalysts in order to evaluate the activity in
the ethylene polymerization.
The determination of the chromium species distri-
bution and the activity of these species in the ethylene
polymerization are very difﬁcult due to the presence
of distincts Cr2+ (of the types A, B and C) and of
the Cr3+ species, which does not reduce and is inac-
tive in the polymerization (Table 5). The difﬁcult in
obtaining the supported pure species of Cr2+ (CrA,
CrB and CrC) as reference and the distinct character-
ization approaches hinder the results interpretations.
Also contribute for the complexity of this system,
the ease to oxidation of Cr2+ [34] and the change
in the Cr2+ species distribution, due to distinct con-
dition of preparation and pretreatment [7]. Besides,
chromium catalysts for polymerization have total
amount of metal around 1 wt.% Cr. This low content
makes difﬁcult the quantiﬁcation of chromium active
sites.
4. Conclusions
The selectivity of the O2 and CO chemisorption to
characterize the Cr2+ and amorphous Cr3+ sites, re-
spectively, was veriﬁed. It was observed correlation
between the O2 and CO chemisorptions and the activ-
ities for the dehydrogenation and polymerization re-
actions, respectively.
Alumina disperses chromium particles in its sur-
face better than silica. This phenomena is driven by
the surface hydroxyls distribution and, probably, by
the afﬁnity between the crystallographic orientation
of -Cr2O3 and of the support. Physical mixtures of
CrO3 with alumina present activity in the dehydro-
genation in the same extent to the obtained with the
catalysts, ascribed to a spontaneous spreading process
of the chromium oxide(VI).
The cyclohexane dehydrogenation reaction showed
to be structure-sensitive for chromium catalysts. The
activity was favored by the chromium particles ag-
glomeration. The activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalysts

amount of Cr2+

species. These chromium
species present similar activities in the polymeri-
zation.
