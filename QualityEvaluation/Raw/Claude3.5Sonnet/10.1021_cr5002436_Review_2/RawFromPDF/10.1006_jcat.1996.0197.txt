The initial activity of chromia/alumina catalyst (13 wt% Cr) in
n-butane dehydrogenation was studied in a ﬂow reactor at 853 K.
The initial activity was determined by on-line FT–IR gas analysis,
which enabled sampling of the gaseous product mixture at a time
resolution of seconds. The catalysts were processed in repeated cy-
cles of oxidation, reduction, and dehydrogenation using n-butane,
methane, hydrogen, or carbon monoxide as reducing agents. With
n-butane, methane, and hydrogen the dehydrogenation activity was
associated with Cr3+ species apparently formed in the reduction of
high-valence Cr species. The catalyst reduced with carbon mono-
xide at 853 K showed poor initial selectivity for butenes and, rela-
tive to the other catalysts, stronger formation of coke in dehydro-
genation. The initial selectivity for butenes increased with time on
stream, however, and within 2 min reached the level obtained with
the other catalysts. Simultaneous data relating the initial activity,
coke content, and some of the physicochemical properties of the
catalyst indicated that the surfaces of all catalysts were modiﬁed to
some extent by the successive reaction cycles.

INTRODUCTION
Light oleﬁns will be of growing importance in the pro-
duction of components for reformulated gasoline and city
diesel. One way to produce these light oleﬁns is in dehy-
drogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia.
Because of thermodynamic limitations, the dehydrogena-
tion is carried out at elevated temperatures, and the catalyst
is rapidly deactivated by coke deposition (1). The combi-
nation of the high endothermicity of dehydrogenation and
the deactivation of the catalyst represents a particularly
difﬁcult challenge for process and catalyst designers. One
approach to solving these problems is to run exothermic
reactions between moderately short dehydrogenation pe-
riods (cyclic reactor operation). The obvious exothermic
reaction is burning of the coke. Prereduction of the catalyst
can also be included in the operation, since high-valence
chromium, inactive in dehydrogenation (2), is produced
during the regeneration. In the design of optimal dehy-
drogenation catalysts and processes, understanding of the
origin of the dehydrogenation activity would be of great
value.
The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has
revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different ox-
idation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pre-
treatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4).
When supported by alumina, chromium mainly occurs in
its 3+ oxidation state on a reduced surface (3). Recently,
the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chro-
mia/zirconia catalysts with 0.04–2.55 wt% Cr has been at-
tributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (5–7),
although some earlier studies where the Cr content was be-
tween 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+
species as well (8–11). According to De Rossi et al. (5),
prereduction of the chromia/alumina catalyst with carbon
monoxide or hydrogen before propane dehydrogenation
does not inﬂuence the activity. In a study of the aroma-
tization activity of prereduced chromia/alumina catalysts
(10.5 wt% Cr), Gr¨
unert et al. (12) likewise found that the
nature of the reducing agent (H2, CH4, n-C6H14, or CO)
did not inﬂuence the activity. Gorriz et al. (2) nevertheless
found slight differences in the dehydrogenation activity de-
pending on the reducing agent (H2, C3H8, or CO). Follow-
ing the reaction for several hours, while determining the pro
duct distribution with a gas chromatograph, they suggested
that the main differences occured during the ﬁrst 10 min on
stream.
Since there is no general agreement about the effect of
reducing agent on the initial activity, the subject was stud-
ied further in this work using a FT–IR gas analyzer. Unlike
gas chromatography, the FT–IR technique allowed us to
continuously monitor the very ﬁrst stages of the reaction
and it thus provided a suitable way of studying the initial
dehydrogenation activity on a prereduced surface. The
catalysts were processed in repeated cycles of oxidation,
reduction, and dehydrogenation using n-butane, methane,
hydrogen, or carbon monoxide as reducing agents. The
origin of the dehydrogenation activity is discussed in light
of the initial activity and some physicochemical properties
of the catalyst.

EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
A γ -alumina layer (36 µm) carried by a metallic sheet of
cylindrical shape was used as support for the chromia cata-
lysts (13, 14). The weight of the alumina layer corresponded
to 26 wt% of the weight of the sheet. After heating at 1027 K
in air for 2 h, the alumina was impregnated with an aqueous
solution of Cr(NO3)3 · 9H2O. Before use, the samples were
dried at 400 K for 1 h and calcined in air at 873 K for 16 h.
The alumina layer contained 13 wt% chromium (instru-
mental neutron-activation analysis, INAA), corresponding
to the chromium content of commercial chromia/alumina
catalysts (15). The calcined catalysts contained Cr2O3 crys-
tallites (Siemens Diffrac 500/X-ray source CuKα). The sur-
face areas of the fresh and used catalysts were determined
by nitrogen adsorption and condensation (Micromeritics
ASAP 2400). The catalysts were not separated from the
metallic sheet for the analysis of BET areas and thus the
reported BET areas are quite low. The speciﬁc BET area
of alumina separated from the metallic sheet was 160 m2/g.
X-ray photoelectron spectra of the catalysts were
recorded with a Surface Science Instruments (S.S.I./Fisons)
X-probe model 101 spectrometer. The spectrometer was
equipped with a monochromatized AlKα X-ray source. The
catalyst samples for XPS analysis were reduced in the test
reactor and were inertly transferred to the glove box of the
spectrometer in a closed reactor tube. Reduction of Cr6+
by impinging X rays during XPS analysis was minimized
by using a short analysis time. The curve ﬁtting of Cr 2p3/2
spectra was accomplished with a standard peak synthesis
program. The Al 2p line of the alumina support assumed
to be at 74.5 eV was used as an internal binding energy
reference for the samples. The following assumptions were
introduced into the curve ﬁtting: (i) the distance and the in-
tensity ratio between the Cr 2p3/2 main and satellite lines for
Cr3+ species are 4.1 eV and 3.125, respectively (16), (ii) only
Cr3+ has a satellite line, (iii) peaks are symmetric Gaussian,
and (iv) the background is nonlinear Shirley. The relative
surface composition in atomic percent was calculated from
the spectra for chromium (Cr 2p3/2), aluminum (Al 2p), and
oxygen (O 1s) using atomic sensitivity factors provided by
the instrument manufacturer.
The quantitative analysis of the catalysts for Cr6+ species
was performed with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The
analysis was carried out by dissolving Cr6+ species from
the catalysts and by determining Cr6+ as chromate in alka-
line solution at 372 nm. The method is described in detail
elsewhere (17).
Test Reactor and FT–IR Gas Analyzer
The reactor setup consisted of an automated laboratory-
scale ﬂow reactor and an on-line FT–IR gas analyzer with
a program for the analysis of IR spectra (Gasmet, Temet
Instruments Ltd.). The FT–IR gas analyzer covered the
range 1000–4000 cm−1, with a resolution of 8 cm−1 and a
scanning rate of 12 scans/s. The temperature and pressure
of the continuous ﬂow IR cuvette (9 cm3) were maintained
constant at 448 K and 101 kPa, respectively, to ensure re-
liable gas-phase analysis. The analyzer was calibrated with
n-butane, 1-butene, cis-2-butene, trans-2-butene, i-butane,
i-butene, 1,3-butadiene, propane, propene, ethane, ethene,
methane, toluene, benzene, carbon dioxide, carbon monox-
ide, and water vapor. The purity of the calibration gases
was better than 99%, except for propane (98%) and cis-2-
butene (95%).
The measured IR spectra were interpreted by the method
of Saarinen and Kauppinen (18), which was earlier tested in
the analysis of a reference gas mixture of hydrocarbons typ-
ically produced in the dehydrogenation of n-butane (19). In
this method, the partial pressures of the gases in the sam-
ple are determined by searching for the linear combination
of calibration spectra best explaining the measured sam-
ple spectrum. All wavenumbers at which the absorbance
in the sample spectrum was smaller than 0.6 were used in
the ﬁts. The quality of the ﬁt was checked from the residual
spectrum obtained by subtracting the ﬁtted from the mea-
sured spectrum. Ideally, the residual spectrum is pure noise.
An example of a sample spectrum of the dehydrogenation
product mixture and the corresponding residual spectrum
is presented in Fig. 1. All the calibrated hydrocarbons were

detected in the product mixtures. When the number of car-
bon atoms from coke were considered, a value close to
100% was obtained for carbon mass balance. This indicates
thatnosigniﬁcantamountsofothercarbon-containingcom-
pounds were produced.
Experimental Procedure
Catalyst samples of 0.26 g (weight of the metallic car-
rier excluded) were used in the activity measurements.
First, the calcined catalysts were aged in 10 consecu-
tive dehydrogenation–oxidation cycles (reference cycles)
at 853 K. The dehydrogenation feed gas consisted of
n-butane diluted with nitrogen (50 vol%), with a total gas
ﬂow of 82 cm3/min (STP). The oxidation gas was 5 vol%
oxygen diluted with nitrogen with a gas ﬂow of 330 cm3/min
(STP). The dehydrogenation and oxidation periods were
2 and 40 min, respectively. After 10 reference cycles the
reduction of the catalyst with methane, hydrogen, or car-
bon monoxide at 853 K was included in the procedure,
and the catalysts were subjected to 15 or 16 reduction–
dehydrogenation–oxidation cycles. With carbon monoxide
the reduction was also performed at 673 K. The reduction
periods were 4 or 20 min using a total ﬂow rate of 330
cm3/min (STP) of CO, CH4, or H2 diluted with nitrogen
(10 vol%). The stability of the catalyst activity during the
cycling was probed by performing some reference cycles in
between. In some runs, the dehydrogenation was omitted
and the reduced catalyst was oxidized directly. From these
reduction–oxidation cycles, the amount of carbon or hydro-
gen retained in the catalyst solely from the reducing agent
was determined.
The product mixtures were sampled for 0.08–2 s at time
intervals of 1–8 s depending on the case. The measurement
time was 2 s if water was among the detected products;
water has low absorptivity and a longer measurement time
was required to obtain signal-to-noise ratios high enough
in the spectra.
RESULTS
Catalyst Activity and Stability in Consecutive
Reference Cycles
An example of the product distribution obtained in
the dehydrogenation of n-butane on unreduced catalyst
is presented in Fig. 2. The reduction of the high-valence
chromium species with n-butane at the beginning of the de-
hydrogenation was seen as a release of carbon dioxide. Car-
bon monoxide was released as well, but in a smaller amount.
In agreement with the results of Gr¨
unert et al. (12), a release
of water commensurate with the amount of carbon released
(as CO2 and CO) was not detected, even though water was
expected to be formed in the oxidation of n-butane.
After the reduction of the catalyst with n-butane, the
product distribution remained nearly constant during the

2-min dehydrogenation period. From this period of “con-
stant” activity, a mean conversion and selectivity for
butenes (1-, cis-2-, trans-2-, and i-butene) was calculated,
to allow the activity of the catalyst to be followed in sub-
sequent reference cycles (Fig. 3). The catalyst lost about
25% of its original activity during the reference cycles. At
the same time the selectivity for butenes increased slightly.
Although the data in Fig. 3 refer to the catalyst used in the
hydrogen reductions, they equally well describe the beha-
vior observed with the catalysts used in carbon monoxide

and methane reductions. During the ﬁrst 10 reference cy-
cles, the decay of the initial activity of the catalyst was ac-
companied by a signiﬁcant decrease in the amount of coke
deposited. The coke deposition then leveled off at a con-
stant level of about 0.65 wt% (Fig. 4).
The cycling of the catalyst under oxidizing and reduc-
ing conditions also affected its physicochemical properties.
The speciﬁc BET surface area of the used catalyst (24 m2/g)
was about 14% less than the speciﬁc BET surface area of
the fresh calcined catalyst (28 m2/g). In addition, the ratio
of the intensities of the crystalline chromia and alumina
peaks was higher in the used catalysts. The average size of
chromia crystallites in the samples was 40–50 ˚
A (from the
Scherrer equation) and the size did not change during the
cycling. The UV-VIS measurements showed the amount
of Cr6+ as determined in the oxidized catalyst to decrease
with the number of cycles (Table 1). In the calcined cata-

lyst 15% of the chromium was in the oxidation state 6+,
whereas after 25–26 cycles, the amount was 12.7 ± 0.3%.
Thus, part of the Cr6+ was irreversibly reduced to a lower
oxidation state in successive reaction cycles. The UV-VIS
results were supported by the temperature measurements
in the reactor: The temperature increase at the beginning
of the reference dehydrogenation cycle became smaller as
the number of cycles increased, since less Cr6+ was reduced
to lower valence with n-butane (1Hred. < 0; 1Hdehydr. > 0).
The Effect of Prereduction of the Catalyst on Activity
The conversion and selectivity for butenes of the cata-
lysts prereduced with methane, hydrogen, and carbon
monoxide are presented in Fig. 5. The prereduction of the
catalyst with methane did not inﬂuence the activity or the
selectivity. The effect of hydrogen prereduction was hardly
noticeable, since only a slightly lower initial activity and
a slightly higher initial selectivity were obtained. Distinct
and clearly different results were obtained with the catalyst
reduced with carbon monoxide: The formation of crack-
ing products (C1–C3) was increased during the ﬁrst 60 s
on stream and the initial selectivity for butenes was low.
However, the selectivity for butenes increased with the
reaction time and within 2 min reached 80%, which was
the selectivity obtained with methane-, hydrogen-, and n-
butane-reduced catalysts. The effect of the carbon monox-
ide prereduction depended on the reduction temperature;
the prereduction of the catalyst at 673 K did not affect the
activity or the selectivity. The prereduction time (4–20 min)

did not affect the initial activity or selectivity and Fig. 5 rep-
resents the results after 4-min reductions.
The observed differences in the initial activities were re-
ﬂected in the amounts of coke deposited on the catalysts
during the dehydrogenation. The total coke content of the
catalyst prereduced with carbon monoxide at 853 K was the
highest, at 2.0 ± 0.2 wt%. If the prereduction with carbon
monoxide was performed at the lower reduction tempera-
ture of 673 K, the coke content was at the same level as with
the catalysts reduced with methane or n-butane (0.65 ± 0.1
wt%). The hydrogen prereduction of the catalyst seemed to
slightly inhibit the coke formation, the coke content being
0.50 ± 0.1 wt%.
Catalyst Prereduction
The differences observed in the initial activities of cat-
alysts led us to determine the valences of the reduced
chromium species. With the FT–IR gas analyzer, the ex-
tent of the reduction with methane, hydrogen, and carbon
monoxide was estimated on the basis of the amount of oxy-
gen released in the reduction products (CO2, H2O). We
assumed in the calculation that initially all the reducible
chromium was in oxidation state 6+. This being the case,
1 and 2 mol of atomic oxygen released per mol of Cr6+
would indicate reduction to chromium 4+ and chromium
2+, respectively.
Methane.
Carbon dioxide was the only product de-
tected in methane reductions. No water was detected, but
it was released during the subsequent oxidation. The mo-
lar amount of hydrogen released as H2O during the oxida-
tion was 3.8 times the amount of carbon dioxide released
in the reduction (0.5 ± 0.1 mol CO2/mol Cr6+). This molar
ratio of hydrogen and carbon is close to the H/C ratio of
methane, suggesting that the hydrogen initially bonded in
methane was retained in the catalyst during the reduction.
In addition, a small amount of carbon from methane was
retained in the catalyst as indicated by the carbon dioxide
released during the subsequent oxidation (0.08 ± 0.02 mol
CO2/mol Cr6+). The retainment of hydrogen and a small
amount of carbon in the catalyst is in agreement with pre-
vious ﬁndings (12). Because of the retainment of hydrogen
in the catalyst, the amount of oxygen released during the
reduction does not reveal the true extent of reduction. Ac-
cordingly, an average oxidation state higher than 3+ was
obtained. The total amount of carbon dioxide and water
released corresponded, however, to a reduction to the 3+
oxidation state.
Hydrogen.
The reduction of the catalyst with hydro-
gen was seen as a release of water. In successive cycles, the
amount of water released decreased slightly but detectably
in parallel with Cr6+. As in the reductions with methane,
part of the hydrogen from the reducing agent was retained
in the catalyst. In agreement with De Rossi et al. (6) and
Gr¨
unert et al. (12), we found the amount of water released
during the reduction to be equal to the amount of water re-
leased during the subsequent oxidation, viz. 0.7 ± 0.2 mol
H2O/mol Cr6+. The amount of water released during the
oxidation did not depend on the duration of the nitrogen
ﬂush (5–20 min) between the reduction and oxidation. The
amount of oxygen released during the reduction and the
subsequent oxidation corresponded to an average oxida-
tion state of 3+.
Carbon monoxide.
The amount of oxygen released as
carbon dioxide during the reduction with carbon mono
xide decreased slightly but detectably in successive cycles.
A similar trend was observed with hydrogen, while with
methane the decrease was not so clear. Judging from the
amount of oxygen released, the reduced chromium was in
oxidation state 3+ (1.5 ± 0.2 mol/mol Cr6+). As in the re-
ductions with methane, part of the carbon (0.1 ± 0.01 mol
C/mol Cr6+) was retained in the catalyst during the reduc-
tion and was detected as a release of carbon dioxide when
the catalyst was exposed to oxygen. Reduction at the lower
temperature of 673 K indicated a lower extent of reduction,
and the amount of carbon dioxide released corresponded
to oxidation state 4+ (1.1 ± 0.02 mol/mol Cr6+).
XPS Measurements
To obtain supplementary information about the reduc-
tions, the extent of the reductions was determined by XPS.
Measurements were carried out on calcined, reduced, and
cycled samples (Table 2). The curve ﬁtting for the Cr 2p3/2
line showed the presence of Cr3+ and Cr6+ in the samples,

at 576.7–577.1 eV and 579.3–579.8 eV, respectively (Fig. 6).
These binding energies are close to the binding energies of
577.3 eV (Cr3+) and 579.9 eV (Cr6+) reported by Gr¨
unert
et al. (16). Independent of the reducing agent, more than
90% of the high-valence chromium was reduced to 3+ dur-
ing the 4-min reduction. No evidence of the presence of
oxidation states other than Cr3+ and Cr6+ was found on
either the reduced or oxidized surface.
When reduction was at 853 K, the XPS results regarding
the extent of the reductions were consistent with the results
obtained with the FT–IR gas analyzer, provided that in the
reductions with methane and hydrogen the amount of wa-
ter released during the subsequent oxidation was included.
After reduction with carbon monoxide at 673 K, the XPS
suggested a higher extent of reduction than the FT–IR gas
analyzer. Perhaps this was due to slightly different sam-
ple handling. In the reactor, part of the oxidized 6+ species
might have been reduced when the catalyst was cooled from
853 K to the reduction temperature of 673 K. During the
cooling the catalyst was kept under a nitrogen ﬂow, in which
the 6+ species might not be as stable as in oxygen (20) and
consequently a lower amount of carbon dioxide would be
released. The samples used in the XPS measurements were
oxidized at 673 K prior to the reduction.
In addition to determining the oxidation states of
chromium, we also used XPS to measure the atomic ratios
of the chromium and aluminum in the calcined, reduced, re-
oxidized, and cycled samples (Table 2). The reduction of the
catalyst with methane, hydrogen, or carbon monoxide pro-
duced a decrease in the chromium-to-aluminum concentra-
tion ratio. In the oxidized samples, even though these were
used in several reaction cycles, the chromium-to-aluminum
concentration ratio was restored. In XPS, a decrease in the
metal-to-support signal ratio indicates a decrease in disper-
sion, provided that the distribution of chromium in alumina
particles remained unchanged.
DISCUSSION
The Active Oxidation State of Chromium
The hydrogen precovered surface obtained in methane,
hydrogen, and n-butane reductions was more favorable
for the dehydrogenation reaction than the “hydrogen-
free” catalyst surface resulting from the carbon monoxide
reduction at 853 K. The catalyst reduced with carbon
monoxide at 853 K showed higher initial selectivity for
cracking products and a pronounced deposition of carbona-
ceous material, characteristic of catalytic cracking. How-
ever, when the reduction with carbon monoxide was per-
formedat673K,activitysimilartothatafterreductionswith
n-butane, methane, and hydrogen was observed. Hence, the
cracking activity of the surface reduced with carbon monox-
ide at 853 K could not be explained by the absence of the
“retained hydrogen” from the surface but could indicate
different oxidation state of chromium depending on the re-
ducing agent.
The water–gas equilibrium (CO+H2O ⇀
↽H2+CO2) and
experimental results (5, 21) suggest carbon monoxide to be
a slightly more powerful reducing agent than hydrogen. Ac-
cordingly, the cracking activity might have been due to the
presence of chromium in a lower oxidation state after car-
bon monoxide reduction at 853 K than after reductions with
hydrogen, methane, or n-butane at 853 K or with carbon
monoxide at 673 K. This proposal is supported by the mea-
surements of Niemi (22), who has shown silica-supported
chromia, which is easily reduced to 2+ (23, 24), to possess a
high selectivity for cracking products in n-butane dehydro-
genation.Althoughourexperimentalresultsdonotprovide
evidence for the existence of Cr2+ in the carbon monoxide-
reduced catalyst, we would note the difﬁculty of detecting
Cr2+ by XPS, especially if the Cr2+ is present in a small
amount (25). In fact, although its presence on alumina car-
rier has been conﬁrmed by IR and DRS studies in samples
with 0.07–4.8 wt% Cr (26, 27, 3), to our knowledge it has
never been detected by XPS.
Characteristic to the dehydrogenation activity on catalyst
reduced with carbon monoxide at 853 K was that the crack-
ing activity decayed quite rapidly. Within 60 s the catalyst
lost its cracking activity and became increasingly active in
dehydrogenation. The surface sites formed in the reduction
with carbon monoxide probably evolved to the same type of
sites formed in the methane, hydrogen, or n-butane reduc-
tions. The ﬁndings of De Rossi et al. (5), particularly the in-
stability of Cr2+ in the presence of propane, support our as-
sumption that Cr2+ species were present on the surface after
prereduction with carbon monoxide. Hence, the decaying
INITIAL DEHYDROGENATION ACTIVITY OF CrOx/Al2O3
399
of the cracking activity in the n-butane stream might have
been due to the transformation of Cr2+ to Cr3+, which
is assumed to be the active site in dehydrogenation. Pro-
bably, the use of gas chromatography in the analysis of the
product mixtures prevented De Rossi et al. (5) from observ-
ing the differences in the initial activities between catalysts
reduced with carbon monoxide and with hydrogen; we note,
however, that they found a higher extent of reduction af-
ter carbon monoxide than after hydrogen treatment in IR
measurements of adsorbed probe molecules (CO/NO).
Deactivation of the Catalyst
The aging of the catalyst in repeated cycles was seen as
decreased initial activity and decreased formation of coke.
In addition, the amount of Cr6+ determined in the oxidized
catalyst decreased with the number of cycles. In agreement
with Masson et al. (7), we suggest that the high-valence
chromium species were precursors of the active sites of
the catalyst, since the amount of Cr6+ decreased parallel
to the initial activity (Fig. 7). The suggestion is supported
bytheobservedinﬂuenceofthereducingagentontheselec-
tivity. If these high-valence species had nothing to do with
the active species of the catalyst, the reducing agent should
not have had the inﬂuence it did on the selectivity. Thus, the
deactivation of the catalyst in successive cycles was proba-
bly due to the decreasing number of active sites available
on the surface. It is noteworthy that the chemical quantita-
tion of Cr6+ species might also have included Cr5+ species if
these were present on the surface. We underline, therefore,
that our results do not exclude the possibility that active
Cr3+ species could arise from reduction of Cr5+ species. In-

deed, based on ESR measurements, De Rossi et al. (5, 6)
have concluded that Cr5+ species are the precursors of the
active Cr3+.
ItseemsthatthoseCr3+speciesthatcouldnotbeoxidized
to higher oxidation state were inactive in the dehydrogena-
tion reaction for the following reasons. First, many of these
Cr3+ atoms belonged to the bulk chromia phase and were
therefore not surface atoms. Second, there is evidence in
the literature that isolated Cr3+ species that resist oxidation
are stabilized in or on alumina (28). It is reasonable to as-
sume that these species, in strong interaction with alumina,
would not be active even if they were present on the sur-
face. The formation of Cr3+ species from the higher-valence
states, on the other hand, would give rise on the surface to
coordinatively unsaturated chromium species (6).
Judging from the stabilizing effect of alumina on Cr6+
(29), the decrease in the Cr6+ content with the aging of the
catalyst was related to the rearrangement of chromium on
the surface. The decrease of the surface area may be one
reason for the rearrangement. Other factors leading to dis-
appearance of Cr6+ sites may have been agglomeration of
chromium on the surface or diffusion of chromium species
into the alumina support. In both cases inactive material
that is not easily oxidized is formed (3). The XRD measure-
ments conﬁrmed the formation of chromia crystallites on
the surface during the processing. This is in agreement with
the literature, where the agglomeration of chromium at ele-
vated temperatures and especially in the presence of water
is widely reported (21, 24, 30, 31). The XPS results did not
reveal the agglomeration of chromium during the cycling,
but instead suggested a rearrangement of chromium on the
surface in the shorter term: The Cr-to-Al atomic ratio de-
creased considerably after one reduction treatment but was
then restored in the subsequent oxidation. Whether this is
related to changes in the dispersion of chromium induced
by pretreatment or to some other phenomena is not, so far,
established. In the literature, there is evidence for the for-
mation of chromia aggregates under reducing conditions
and the redispersion of these aggregates by oxidation (29,
32, 33). It is surprising, however, that the overall decrease
in the dispersion of chromium during aging, as suggested
by UV-VIS analysis of Cr6+ and XRD measurements, was
not detectable with XPS.
CONCLUSIONS
The multicomponent analysis of IR spectra allowed us to
exploit the rapidity of the FT–IR method in a study of the
initial activity of chromia/alumina catalyst. Besides the ini-
tial activity, the coke content and the extent of the reduction
of the catalyst with carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen,
and n-butane were monitored in situ. The catalyst reduced
with carbon monoxide at 853 K showed poor initial selectiv-
ity for butenes and, relative to the other catalysts, stronger
formation of coke. However, the selectivity for butenes

increased with the time on n-butane stream, and within
2 min reached the level obtained with n-butane, methane,
and hydrogen-reduced catalysts. This initial cracking
activity was attributed to a deeper reduction of chromium
with carbon monoxide at 853 K than with n-butane,
methane, or hydrogen. The surface of all the catalysts was
modiﬁed to some extent in successive oxidation–reduction–
dehydrogenation cycles, as seen in the decreasing amount
of Cr6+ in the oxidized catalyst. Furthermore, the initial
dehydrogenation activity and the amount of coke that
was deposited decreased with the number of reaction
cycles. On the basis of the initial activity and the XPS and
UV-VIS measurements, the dehydrogenation activity was
associated to Cr3+ species perhaps formed in the reduction
of high-valence chromium species.
