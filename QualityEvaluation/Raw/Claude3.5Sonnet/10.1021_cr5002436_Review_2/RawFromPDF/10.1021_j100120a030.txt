The diffuse reflectance spectra of chromium supported on alumina, on silica, and on silica-alumina have been 
investigated after calcination, CO 
reduction, and recalcination. A method for quantifying the Cr6+, 
Cr3+, 
and 
Cr2+ 
concentrations 
was developed. After calcination at 550 
OC, 
the chr0mate:dichromate ratio is m, 0.56, and 
2.18 
on respectively alumina, silica, and silica-alumina. Reduction results in the formation 
of three new species: 
octahedral Cr3+, octahedral Cr2+, 
and pseudotetrahedral Cr2+. On silica and silica-alumina, the relative 
proportions of these three species depend on the reduction temperature. On alumina, only octahedral Cr3+ and 
small amounts of octahedral Cr2+ 
were observed after reduction. Recalcination reestablishes the chromate: 
dichromate ratio; however, this regeneration is complete only on silica. On alumina and silica-alumina, about 
one-third and two-thirds respectively of the total Cr 
content remain as 
Cr3+. The sensitivity of Cr6+ 
to reduction 
is greater on silica than on alumina and silica-alumina. This is indicated by the increase of the Cr2+:Cr3+ 
ratio 
from alumina over silica-alumina to silica. 
Introduction 
Chromium on silica (Cr/SiOz) is the famous Phillips catalyst 
for the polymerizationof 
ethyleneunder relatively low pressures.] 
This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in 
the production of high-density polyethylene,2 
and the use has 
been extended 
to the production 
of linear low-density polyethylene3 
and the copolymerization 
of ethylene and butene- 
1 
.4 Chromium 
on silica-alumina (Cr/Si02*A1203) 
catalyses 
the polymerization 
of propylene5 
and chromium on alumina (Cr/A1203) 
catalysts 
are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocycliza- 
tion, and in catalytic reforming.6 
The Phillips catalyst is one of the most studied and yet most 
controversial systems,' while the studies of Cr/A1203 
and Cr/ 
Si02.Al203 are more limited. All these studies deal with the 
formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst 
surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence 
state 
of the species 
which are responsible for catalysis. Different 
techniques, 
such as 
infrared 
spectroscopy 
(IR)? diffuse 
reflectance 
spectroscopy 
(DRS)? X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 
(XPS),lo 
Raman spectroscopy,Il 
and electronspin resonance (ESR),12 
were 
used. There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation 
states are Cr6+, 
Cr5+, 
Cr3+, 
and Cr2+. 
However, the coordination 
geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polym- 
erization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate. 
After calcination, most of the Cr is stabilized as Cr6+ 
on the 
Si02 
and Alz03 
surfaces; 
only the exact 
mechanism 
of stabilization 
and the molecular structure of the stabilized Cr6+ 
species are 
points of discussion. According to Hogan and McDaniel, only 
chromate is formed on the Si02 
surface,I3J4 
while other research 
groups favor the formation of dichromate.15-19 Raman studies 
on Cr/Si02 
give evidence 
for mono-, 
di-, tri-, and tetramers under 
hydrated conditionsZo 
and highly distorted monochromate under 
dehydrated conditions.21 On A1203, 
mostly chromate is formed 
after calcination.17v22 
However, Raman studies 
reveal the presence 
of monomers and dimers under hydrated conditions20 and 
polymeric oxide species under dehydrated  condition^.^^ To our 
knowledge, the molecular structure of Cr on Si0yA1203 is not 
yet reported in the literature. 
Reduction of the calcined catalysts results in the formation of 
traces of Cr5+, 
Cr3+, 
and Cr2+, 
but the relative proportion of 
these species depends on the reduction temperature and on the

support. The coordination of the reduced species is unclear. 
Cr3+ 
is mostly thought of as octahedral, but according to Myers 
and Lunsford, a small part can be in a lower symmetry.24 Cr2+ 
can be unsaturated, tetrahedrally coordinated, and square- 
Table I give a survey of DRS absorption bands and proposed 
assignments. All these DRS studies are qualitative, describing 
the different oxidation states formed after calcination and 
reduction. However, 
the data of different groups 
cannot be easily 
compared because 
of differences 
in pretreatments and Cr loadings. 
Therefore, the purpose of this work is a quantitative study of 
chromium-supported catalysts by DRS. This technique allows 
the quantitative determination of Cr2+, 
Cr3+, and Cr6+ after 
calcination, 
reduction, 
and recalcination 
at least at small 
loadings. 
The redox behavior of Cr on Al203, SO2, 
and Si02.A1203 
will 
be discussed.

 Preparation. 
Si02 
and SiO2.A1203 were home-made. Si02 was prepared by 
mixing 2 
vol parts H20 at pH 2 
(adding HCl) and 1 vol part 
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) during 5 
h at room temperature. 
The mixture was titrated under stirring to pH 6 
with a NH40H 
solution of pH 9.5. After 16 
h of gelation, the gel was dried at 
130 
O C  
for 72 
h and calcined at 250 
and 550 
O
C
 for respectively 
3 
and 16 
h. The so-obtained 
cake was crushed. Si02.A1203 with 
40 wt 5

 Si02 
was prepared following 
a modified method of Chen 
et al.33 TEOS (35.5 
g) and aluminum triisoprop'xide (65.36 
g) 
were mixed in 128 mL of ethanol during 30 min at room 
temperature. After adding 35 
mL of 1 M HCl, the hydrolysis 
started and the solution was mixed for 1 h. Acid hydrolysis 
resulted in a sol and a flocculated phase, suggesting a hetero- 
geneous SiOyA1203. The gel was dried at 60 and 1

Pretreatment 
and Spectroscopy. 1. Pretreatment. 
The 
samples 
were dried at 50 O
C
 for 8 h and granulated. The size fraction 
of 0.16-0.25 mm was loaded in a quartz flow cell with Suprasil 
window for DRS and a side arm for ESR. With this cell, it was 
possible to take DRS and ESR spectra after the same pretreat- 
ment. The ESR spectra will be discussed in a following paper. 
The 
samples were subsequently 
dried 
at 
90 O
C
 during 16 
h followed 
by calcination at 550 O
C
 during 6 h in an oxygen stream. DRS 
spectra were recorded on these calcined samples. The samples 
were then reduced with CO at 200,300,400, and 600 O
C
 during 
30 min. After each reduction step, DRS spectra were taken. In 
the last step, the samples were recalcined in oxygen during 6 h 
at 550 O
C
 and DRSspectra were taken 
again. The 
same procedure 
was followed for the supports without chromium. Their spectra 
were used as reference. An oxygen flow of 3600 mL/h and a CO 
flow of 1800 mL/h were used for all the treatments. 
2. DiffuseReflectanceSpectroscopy. DRS spectra 
were taken 
on a Varian Cary 5 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer at room 
temperature. The spectra were recorded against a halon white 
reflectance 
standard in the range 2200-200 nm. The computer 
processing of the spectra consisted of the following steps: (1) 
subtraction of the baseline; (2) conversion to wavenumber; (3) 
calculation 
of the Kubelka-Munk (KM) funtion; (4) subtraction 
of the spectrum of the parent support 
from that of the chromium- 
supported catalysts measured after the same treatment. The 
spectra were deconvoluted with the Spectra Calc program of 
Galactic Industries Corp. into Gaussian bands. The values of 
the KM function 
at the band maxima were used for quantitative 
DRS. Spectra of the solutions of K2Cr04, 
K2Cr207, 
and Cr- 
(NO3)3-9H20 were taken at room temperature on a Cary 17, in 
the range of 800-210 nm. The spectra of the solids (K2Cr04, 
K2Cr207, Cr(N03)3.9H20, 
and Cr203) 
were taken on a Varian 
Cary 5 UV-vis-NIR at room temperature in the range 2200- 
200 nm. 
Results 
The absorption maxima of the spectra and the color of the 
reference compounds are shown in Table 11. The deconvoluted 
spectra of catalysts pretreated in an identical way contain the 
same 
number of bands. The 
positions 
and widths are independent 
of the Cr loading. The position of the maxima and widths are 
summarized 
in Table 111. The consistency of the deconvolution 
is an indication that the proposd deconvolution has physical

meaning. The fact that a consistent interpretation can be given 
is another strong point of the deconvolution. 
1. Calcined Samples. The color of the samples 
was yellow for 
Cr/A1203 and Cr/SiO**A1203 
and yellow-orange for Cr/Si02. 
The spectra of the calcined 0.2 wt ?

 loading are shown in Figure 
1, together with the proposed deconvolution in Gaussian bands. 
The 
spectra 
of Cr/A1203 are 
dominated 
by two bands 
at 27 500 
and 41 000 cm-I. By deconvolution, 
two low-frequency 
shoulders 
at 22 500 and 34 400 cm-l are resolved. Such a spectrum is 
typical for metallochr~mates.~~ 
The bands 
are 0 - 
Cr6+ 
charge- 
transfer bands with the following 
assignment? the band at 
22 500 
cm-I is the symmetry-forbidden 
transition (1 
tl - 
2e), while the 
otherbandsat 27 000(lt]-2e),34 400(lt,-7t2),and41 400 
cm-I (6t2 - 
2e) are symmetry-allowed. The first transition is 
partially allowed in solid salts, as is concluded by comparing 
the 
spectra of K2Cr04 
in solution and as a solid (Table 11). 
For Cr/SiOz, four 
bands 
at 15 500,22 000,30 500, 
and 40 500 
cm-I and a shoulder at 27 000 cm-I are visible by the eye. After 
deconvolution, 1 
1 
bands are 
resolved. Three 
weak bands at 15 500, 
21 500, and 33 900 cm-I with equal width and intensity are 
ascribed to octahedral Cr3+, 
in accordance with the literature.36 
The remaining eight bands are due to chromate (21 000,27 000, 
34 000, and 37 300cm-I) 
anddichromate (22 000,3 
1 
000,35 500, 
and 40 700 cm-'). The dichromate bands are systematically 
shifted to the blue with respect to the chromate bands. This in 
accordance with the solution spectra in Table I1 and literature 
data.37138 
The assignments 
are the same as previously given for 
Cr/A1203.

The DRS 
spectra of Cr/Si02.A1203 consist of two main bands 
at 27 000 and 41 000 cm-' and one shoulder at 22 000 cm-I. 
After deconvolution, eight bands are resolved. The bands at 
22 200, 27 300, 34 100, and 39 200 cm-I are due to chromate, 
while the bands at 23 100, 31 000,35 500, and 41 500 cm-' are 
those of dichromate. 
The 
ratio of the intensities 
of the 27 000-cm-I band of chromate 
and the 3 1 OOO-cm-' band of dichromate is taken as a measure 
of the chr0mate:dichromate ratio on 
the different supports. This 
ratio of intensities is -, 0.62, and 2.40 for Cr/A1203, Cr/SiO2, 
and Cr/Si02.A1203, 
respectively, with 0.2 
wt % and independent 
of the loading. If it is assumed that the ratio of the extinction 
coefficients 
of chromate and dichromate is the same in solution 
and on 
the the surface, then formula 1 allows the calculation of 
(1) 
thechr0mate:dichromate ratios on 
the surface with K 
= 1.1 (from 
solution spectra). These ratios are -, 0.56, and 2.18 for Cr/ 
A1203, Cr/Si02, and Cr/SiO2.A1203, respectively. All the 
deconvoluted spectra have a broad and intense shoulder near 
50 000 cm-I. It is more intense on 
Cr/Si02 
than on Cr/AI2O3 
and Cr/SiO*-A1203. It can only result from the interaction of 
Cr with the support. However, the band occurs in the limit of 
the working range of the integration sphere. As a consequence, 
both the intensity and the position are somewhat dubious, and 
we will not discuss it. 
2. ReducedSamples. In 
Figures 2-4, the deconvoluted 
spectra 
of the reduced samples with 0.2 wt % Cr loading are shown. The 
spectra for the other loadings 
are 
identical, 
except for the intensity 
of the bands. In 
each case, reduction starts above 200 O C  and 
is accompanied with typical color changes. 
2.1. Cr/A1203. After reduction at 300 
O C ,  the color changes 
to yellow-green 
and two new bands appear at 12 500 and 17 000 
cm-I. The band at 17 000 cm-I is due to Cr3+ in octahedral

coordination, 
while the weak 12 500-cm-I band can be ascribed 
to octahedral Cr2+. An octahedral complex of a high-spin 3d4 
ion such as CrZ+ 
would be expected to show only a single spin- 
allowed d-d transition, 5E, 
- 
5T~g, 
in the visible region of the 
spectrum.39 However, 
the band may be broadened due to a Jahn- 
Teller 
effe~t.3~ 
After reduction 
at 
400 OC, the samples 
turn white 
and the spectra are dominated by the three d-d transitions of 
octahedra Cr3+ at 15 300, 26 100, and 34 700 cm-I. The first 
band shifts by 1200 
cm-I to higher wavenumbers after reduction 
at 600 O C .  An intense band at 39 000 cm-' is always present. 
The Cr2+ 
band is weak at all reduction temperatures. 
2.2. Cr/SiOz. The color of the sample turns to green-blue 
after reduction at 300 OC, 
and the DRS 
spectrum changes 
drastically. The Cr6+ bands completely disappear. In the d-d 
region, two new bands at 10 000 and 12 500 cm-l appear. The 
intensities of these bands vary independently with the reduction 
temperature, suggesting the presence of two different species. 
The 12 500-cm-I band is ascribed to Cr2+ 
in octahedral coor- 
dination, while the band at IO 
000 cm-' suggests the presence of 
a Cr2+ 
ion in a lower symmetry. Similar band maxima are 
reported for distorted tetrahedral complexes of CrZ+ 
complexes 
like CrC142- 
and CrBrd2-

2.4. Chemiluminescence of Reduced Samples. Cr/Si02 
has a 
spectacular chemiluminescence, first described by Hogan after 
exposure of the reduced samples to oxygen.I3 The intensity of 
the yellow-orange light flash decreases with increasing reduction 
temperature. The chemiluminescence was more intense on 
Cr/ 
SiOz 
than on 
Cr/Si02.A1203, while no 
chemiluminescence was 
observed on 
Cr/A1203. 
3. Recalcined Samples. In Figure 5 ,  
the deconvoluted spectra 
of the 
recalcined samples are 
shown. On Cr/A1203, the 
chromate 
bands (22 500,27 000,34 400, and 41 400 cm-I) reappear in the 
spectrum, but the Cr3+ bands located at 17 000, 23 000, and 
33 000 cm-' do 
not completely disappear. As a consequence, the 
intensities of the chromate bands are 
lower than after the initial 
calcination, and the color of the recalcined samples was yellow- 
green. O
n
 
Cr/SiO2, the spectrum after recalcination was almost 
the same as before the reduction cycle and the sample color was 
orange, indicating complete oxidation. The slightly higher 
intensities for all the absorption bands in the spectrum are due 
to differences in light reflectance properties of the recalcined 
samples. Recalcination of Cr/Si02.A1203 
gives the samples a 
green-yellow color. The DRS spectrum reveals three bands 
(15 100, 23 100, and 33 100 cm-I) typical for octahedral Cr3+,

four chromate bands (22 200,27 300,34 100, and 39 200 cm-I), 
and four dichromate bands (23 100,31 000,35 600, and 41 800 
cm-I). However, only about one-third of the chromate and 
dichromate bands can be regenerated by recalcination. 
4. Quantitative Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy. 4.1. Cal- 
ibration. The KM function allows a quantitative determination 
of absorbing species according to 
where R, is the ratio of the light intensity reflected from the 
sample and the light reflected from the standard.40 K 
and S are 
respectively the 
KM absorption and 
scattering 
coefficients. When 
at a given wavelength S is constant, eq 1 gives a linear relation 
between F(R,) 
and the Cr concentration, Cc,. Conditions, 
inherent to the use of the KM function are (1) infinitely thick 
sample, (2) random distribution of particles which are much 
smaller than the layer thickness, (3) 
isotropic scattering and 
diffuse 
irradiation, and (4) samples with low absorption.41 
The first, second, and third conditions are fulfilled by using 
powdered samples, while the third condition suggests the use of 
low Cr loadings. It is also assumed that S does not change with 
loading and treatment. 
In the following procedure, calibration lines are obtained for 
Cr3+ 
and Cr6+. O
n
 
Cr/A1203, Cr6+ 
is present as chromate, and 
the Cr6+ calibration line is obtained by plotting the intensity of 
the 27 000-cm-1 band of chromate 
as Cr loading. From the ratio 
chr0mate:dichromate = 2.40, it is possible to obtain the Cr6+ 
calibration curve for CrlSiO2aA1203 
from 
the sum 
of the 
intensities 
of the 27 000-cm-I band (chromate) and 31 000-cm-1 (dichro- 
mate) bands. For Cr/SiO2, the same procedure was followed

after correction for small amounts of Cr3+. This correction was 
obtained from the Cr3+ calibration line, discussed below. 
The Cr3+-line 
for Cr/A1203 and Cr/SiO2*Al203 
was based on 
the spectra of the recalcined samples. These contain Cr3+ 
and 
Cr6+. The latter is determined with the Cr6+ 
calibration lines. 
The Cr3+ 
loadings are then easily obtained by subtracting the 
Cr6+ 
loadings from the total Cr loadings. The Cr3+ 
calibration 
lines for Cr/A1203 
and Cr/SiO2.Al2O3 
were obtained by plotting 
respectively the intensity of the 17 000-cm-I band and of the 
15 100-cm-1 band vs the calculated Cr3+ concentrations. The 
Cr3+ 
calibration 
line for Si02 
was 
obtained 
by relating the intensity 
of the 15 500-cm-I band with the Cr3+ 
concentration (36% 
of the 
total Cr loading) in the calcined samples of different chromium 
loadings. 
Thecalibration lines for Cr6+ 
and Cr3+ 
on thedifferent 
supports 
are shown in Figure 6. The calibration line for Cr6+ 
on A1203 
is almost linear, 
while that 
of Cfi+ 
on Si02 
and Si02-A1203 
deviates 
from linearity above 0.16 and 0.4 wt %
,
 respectively. The same 
holds for the Cr3+ 
calibration 
lines, but that of the Cr3+ 
on Si02 
cannot be called linear. Therefore, we restrict a quantitative 
analysis to samples with 0.1 wt % Cr. One can apply the method 
for 
high loadings too in the case of Cr/A1203 and Cr/Si02-A1203 
but not for Cr/SiOz. 
In any case, the slopes of the linear portions of the calibration 
lines increase from Cr/A1203 over Cr/Si02=A1203 
to Cr/SiOz. 
This 
is due 
to S 
in eq 
2 
which follow 
the order 
A1203 
> 
Si02.Al203 
> Si02. 
4.2. Results. Theconcentrations 
of Cr2+, 
Cr3+, 
and Cfi+ 
after 
different pretreatments are shown in Figure 7. Cr2+ is always 
determined 
by thedifference 
[Cr2+] 
= 
Crlolal- 
( 
[Cr6+] 
+ 
[Cr3+]). 
On Cr/A1203, the following observations are made: (a) The 
chromate 
loading 
decreases 
with increasing 
reduction temperature 
to reach zero after reduction at 400 OC. (2) About 96% 
of the 
reduced Cr species is Cr3+; the remaining is Cr2+. (3) The 
concentration of Cr2+ 
is low, and the variations are within the 
limits of experimental accuracy. (4) After recalcination, only 
58% of the total Cr content shows up as chromate; 
the remaining 
42% 
is Cr3+.

On Cr/SiOz, the method is less accurate because there are 
more species present on the surface. Nevertheless, the following 
trends are observed: (1) The Cr6+ 
concentration 
is quantitatively 
converted to Cr2+ and Cr3+ 
after reduction at 300 OC. (2) The 
CrZ+:Cr3+ 
ratio increases with increasing reduction temperature. 
(3) The maximum Cr2+ 
concentration of 74% 
was obtained after 
reduction 
at 600 OC. (4) After recalcination, the same 
chromate: 
dichromate ratio was established as after the initial calcination. 
On Cr/Si02*Al2O3, 
the following observations 
are made: (1) 
The Cfi+ 
concentration 
decreases 
slowly with increasing reduction 
temperature and was zero only after 600 O
C
 reduction. (2) 
Reduced Cr was Cr2+ 
and Cr3+. The amount of Cr3+ 
increases 
with increasing reduction temperature, while the Cr2+ concen- 
tration has a maximum of 44% 
after reduction at 400 O C .  (3) 
After recalcination, only 37% of the total chromium was 
regenerated as chromate or dichromate.

after reduction at 300,400, and 600 OC. This ratio 
increases from Cr/A1203 over Cr/SiO2*Al203 to Cr/SiO2, 
whatever the reduction 
temperature. Furthermore, 
while for Cr/ 
Si02 the Cr2+:Cr3+ 
ratio increases with reduction temperature, 
4762 
a maximum is found for Cr/Si02.A1203. On Cr/A1203, the 
variation of the Cr2+:Cr3+ ratio is insignificant because of the 
large errors on the Cr2+ concentrations.

with the support, 
because a-Cr203 
is not formed, 
yet it is reducible 
to Cr3+. Cr3+ 
on A1203 
and on SiO~A1203 
is-at 
the small 
loadings 
of the present investigations-substituting for octahedral 
A13+ 
in the surface layers of the supports. It cannot be reduced 
to Cr2+ to an appreciable extent for two reasons: (1) some Cr3+ 
migrates into the support, where it becomes unaccessible for 
reduction; (2) the majority of Cr3+, 
however, forms a-CrzO3 
particles 
at high reduction temperatures, which cannot 
be reduced 
and only slowly oxidized. The Cr ions in the A1203 
regions of 
Si02~A1203 
behave as these of A1203; those in the Si02 regions 
behave as those of 5 3 0 2 .  
Octahedral Cr2+ is a surface species on all supports. The 
tetrahedral Cr2+, 
always more difficult to make and always at 
lower concentration, 
may be Cr2+ 
in the surface 
of SO2, 
occupying 
empty sites Si4+. Because 
of the size 
difference of Si4+ 
and Cr2+, 
this can only be a distorted tetrahedral site. 
Summarizing, Cr is a surface species on Si02, fully available 
for reduction by CO and reoxidation with 0 2 .  On A1203, part 
of Cr3+ 
migrates in the support and part forms a-Cr203. Both 
types of Cr3+ 
cannot be reduced to Cr2+ 
and are only slowly 
reoxidizable 
to chromate. In this chemistry, the properties 
of the 
supports certainly play a role. In terms of hardness and softness 
principles, first introduced by Pears0n,4~ 
one can state 
that A1203 
is harder than Si02;4u6 Le., A1203 
is less polarizable or less 
susceptible 
to a change in number of electrons than on SO2. 
We 
suggest that is also one of the reasons for the difference in 
reducibility of Cr on alumina and silica. It implies that surface 
oxygens are actively involved in the reduction and reoxidation 
reactions. 
(ii) Interpretation of the Bands in the UV. In the UV region, 
two bands at 32 000 and 39 500 cm-I on reduced Cr/SiO2 were 
observed, while on reduced Cr/Si02.A1203 these bands were 
shifted to 32 500 and 41 000 cm-I. On reduced Cr/A1203, only 
the 39 lOO-cm-' band was found. Similar bands were observed 
on reduced Cr/Si02 by Zecchina et al.ls and Fubini et al.l* 
These bands may conveniently 
be explained as 0 - 
Cr2+,

 EduationoftheMetbod. It is possible toquantify supported 
Cr2+, 
Cr3+, 
and Cr6+ 
provided the following 
is fulfilled: (1) a low 
Cr content; (2) the absence of Cr3+ 
is calcined samples; and (3) 
the presence of Cr3+ 
in recalcined samples. All these factors are 
fulfilled for Cr/A1203 
and Cr/Si02-A1203, 
while the presence of 
Cr3+ complicates the quantification of the spectra of calcined 
Cr/SiOz. We have presented here the data of 0.1 
wt % Cr. 
Higher 
loadings are possible but with less accuracy. 
The best results were obtained for Cr/A1203 
because 
there are 
only two species: chromate and Cr3+. Thus, the calibration lines 
(Figure 6) 
are straight lines up to 0.4 wt % Cr, and our analysis 
is valid between 0 and 0.4 wt % Cr. Cr/Si02 has a multitude 
of species: chromate, dichromate, and Cr3+ 
on calcined samples 
and cr3+, 
Cr2+(Oh), 
Cr2+(Td) 
on reduced samples. Cr2+ 
could 
only be determined by difference, and Cr2+(Oh) 
and Cr2+(Td) 
cannot be determined separately in a quantitative way. Cr/ 
Si02.Al203 takes a position intermediate between Cr/A1203 and 
Cr/Si02. On the basis of Figure 6, 
quantitative determinations 
of Cr species are possible between 0 and 0.1 wt % for Cr/SiO2 
and in the range 0-0.2 wt % for Cr/Si02.A1203. 
2. Spectroscopy of the Chemistry of Supported 
Cr. With DRS 
spectroscopy in the UV-vis-NIR, we probe the charge-transfer 
and d-d transitions of Cr. The charge-transfer transitions are 
of the type 0 - 
Cr and are typical for Cr6+ 
in chromate and 
dichromate form. Cr2+ and Cr3+ have characteristic d-d 
transitions, which are much weaker than the charge transfers. In 
any case, both charge transfers and d-d transitions are charac- 
teristicfor theoxidation stateof Cr 
andofthenature 
andgeometry 
of the atoms in the coordination sphere, in our case oxygens. 
Long-range effects, for instance the distinction between mono- 
mericchromate and polymeric 
chromate, 
cannot be madedirectly. 
So our results do not allow us to make firm conclusions on the 
degree of polymerization of Cr on the various supports. 
2.1. Calcined Samples. The chr0mate:dichromate ratio de- 
pends on the type of support, both before and after calcination. 
Two explanations 
can be advanced: (1) The 
chr0mate:dichromate 
ratio only depends on the surface properties of the supports. (2) 
The chromate:dichromate ratio expresses the degree of polym- 
erization of Cr: the more dichromate, the more polymerized Cr 
is present on the surface. 
Both 
hypotheses 
have their merits. Indeed, 
the 
surface 
of A1203 
(pHzc = 7-8)42 is a neutral-to-basic surface, and only chromate 
is stable on this surface. Dichromate occurs on Si02 with ~ H Z C  
= 1-2,42 Le., an acidic surface. Our Si02nA1203 
is an interesting 
case. The chr0mate:dichromate ratio can be explained within 
5% of the true value (2.18) if it is assumed that it consists 
of 40% 
of the Si02 regions with a chr0mate:dichromate ratio of pure 
Si02 
(0.56) and of 60% 
of the A1203 regions 
which carry chromate 
only. This means that the SiOz.AlzO3 region can be visualized 
by a zoned material. The second hypothesis is indicative of the 
fact that Cr6+ 
is better dispersed on A l 2 0 3  than on Si02.25 
2.2. Reduced Samples. (i) Formation 
and Coordination of 
Cr3+ and Cr2+. The reduction of Cr with CO starts above 200 
O
C
 and leads to the formation of Cr2+ 
and Cr3+, 
with relative 
amounts depending on reduction temperature and support. 
The Cr3+ 
species have characteristic octahedral spectra, and 
the energy of the first transition is equal to 10 
Dq, the ligand field 
strength.36 This is at 15 500 cm-I for Cr/SiO2, at 17 100 cm-I 
for Cr/Si02.A1203, and initially at 17 000 cm-1 for Cr/A1203, 
decreasing to 15 300 cm-' at 
intermediate reduction 
temperatures 
and increasing again to 17 000 cm-1 after reduction. The 
15 500-cm-I value for octahedral Cr3+ 
on silica must be ascribed 
to the surface 
phaseof Cr3+. 
On one hand, it is strongly 
interacting 
dCT 
(cm-') = 30 000 (xop,(02-) 
- 
xOpt(Cr2+,Cr3+)) 
(3) 
where x,,,(02-) and xopt(Cr2+,Cr3+) 
are respectively the optical 
electronegativity of the surface oxygen and of Cr2+ and Cr3+. 
With xopt(Cr3+) 
= 
and xopt(02-) 
= 3.5 (Si02)49 
or 3.3 
(A1203),49 
one has v c ~ ( 0  
- 
Cr3+) 
= 
45 000 and 39 000 cm-l for 
Si02 
and A1203, 
respectively. The latter is in agreement with the 
39 500-41 000-cm-l band. Weascribethen the 32 500-cm-I band 
to an 0 
- 
Cr2+(Td) 
transition on silica. The shift to lower 
frequencies is in the right direction because tetrahedral species 
have smaller ligand field strengths than octahedral c~mplexes.~~ 
This interpretation follows that of Zecchina et al.15 and Fubini 
et 
However, it is also clear that the situation is more 
complicated because three bands have been reported and that 
each band may encompass several components. However, our 
results do not allow a more detailed discussion. 
(iii) Chemiluminescence of Reduced Cr. The chemilumines- 
cence of reduced Cr/SiOz is described by several authors in the 
literat~re.~3~'**~~~SO 
Our observations suggest that only the Cr2+ 
species, corresponding 
to the absorption band at 10 000 cm-I, is 
responsible for the light flash. Octahedral Cr2+ is excluded, 
because it was observed on Cr/A1203 in small amounts, while no 
chemiluminescence 
was observed on these samples. The more 
intense chemiluminescence 
of Cr/SiO2 than of Cr/Si02.A1203 
can be explained 
by the higher intensity 
of the 10 000-cm-l band. 
Further, the intensity of chemiluminescence is decreasing with 
decreasing 
intensity of the CTI 
,red. on Cr/Si02 and Cr/Si02.A1203, 
while no chemiluminescence 
occurred 
when the C T I , ~ ~  
was absent, 
as for reduced Cr/A1203.

Conclusions 
The deconvolution of the DRS 
spectra of Cr catalysts allows 
a quantitative estimation of the amount of Cr6+, the chromate: 
dichromate ratio, and the Cr3+ 
and Cr2+ 
concentrations at any 
treatment temperature provided the loading is small, typically 
0.2 wt % for alumina and silica-alumina and 0.1 wt % for silica. 
The 
chr0mate:dichromateratio 
increases 
from silica over silica- 
alumina and alumina, and this is due to the surface properties 
of the supports and differences 
in dispersion. On alumina, CO 
reduction gives only Cr3+ 
with traces of Crz+, 
and the amount 
of Cr2+ 
increases 
over silica-alumina to silica. In the latter case, 
(pseud0)tetrahedral and (pseud0)octahedral Cr2+ 
are formed. 
Theintensechemiluminescenceisdueto 
(pseud0)tetrahedral 
Cr2+. 
On silica, Cr2+/3+ 
is completely reoxidizable to Cr6+. This is 
only partially the case 
for A1203 
and Si02.Al203, because formed 
cr-CrzO3 is only slowly oxidizable. The supports take an active 
part in the redox chemistry 
of Cr: the harder A1203 
only allows 
reduction to Cr3+, the softer Si02 to Cr2+.
