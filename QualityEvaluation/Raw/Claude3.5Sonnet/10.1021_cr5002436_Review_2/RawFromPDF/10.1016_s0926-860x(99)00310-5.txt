Abstract
Atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), a technique relying on saturating gas–solid reactions, was applied in the preparation of
CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts using Cr(acac)3 vapor and air as source materials for CrOx. Vaporized Cr(acac)3 was reacted with
preheated Al2O3, and the surface complex formed was treated with air to remove the ligand residues. The Cr loading
increased from 1.3 to 12.5 wt.% as the number of saturating Cr(acac)3 and air reactions was increased from one to 10.
CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were also prepared from solution by incipient wetness impregnation (0.3–21 wt.%). XPS and UV–VIS
measurements of the catalysts revealed the presence of both Cr6+ and Cr3+. Although the oxidation state distribution was
similar, H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and solubility measurements indicated that Cr6+ surface sites were in
stronger interaction with Al2O3 and more uniformly distributed in the catalysts prepared by ALE than by impregnation. On
the basis of the activity of the catalysts in the dehydrogenation of i-butane, we propose that the dehydrogenation reaction uses
both reduced Cr6+, i.e. redox Cr3+, and exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites. Furthermore, the dehydrogenation reaction must be
insensitive to the size of the CrOx ensembles since activities were similar for the catalysts prepared by ALE and impregnation.
The decay of the dehydrogenation activity in successive prereduction–reaction–regeneration cycles was attributed to a decrease
in the number of redox Cr3+ sites. ©2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 cata-
lysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts
are used on a commercial scale to produce propene
and i-butene from the corresponding parafﬁns [2]. The
surface chemistry and characterization of chromium in
inorganic oxides were recently reviewed by Weckhuy-
sen et al. [3]. There is now a general consensus that
the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present

depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and
catalyst support. It is generally accepted that, on cal-
cined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored
on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,3–11].
At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+,
which resists oxidation [1,3,5,7–11]. The occurrence
of Cr3+ is related to the formation of Cr2O3 clusters,
and in part, to the presence of highly dispersed Cr3+
species [5,8].
Reduction of Cr6+ (and Cr5+) under dehydro-
genation conditions or during the prereduction of
CrOx/Al2O3 has been concluded to result mainly in the

formation of Cr3+, i.e. redox Cr3+ [3,4,7,8,10,12–14].
Al2O3 support appears to stabilize Cr3+ against re-
duction below the 3+ state [1,15], although some
papers also describe the formation of Cr2+ [16–20].
Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that re-
dox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3
serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reac-
tion [7,8,10,12–14]. Some earlier papers [16,18,19],
and Slovetskaya et al. [20], nevertheless, propose
Cr2+ on Al2O3 to be active as well. In our work [21],
we showed that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ by hydrogen,
methane, or n-butane at 580◦C [21], and in accor-
dance with others [7,8,10,12–14], we proposed that
the redox Cr3+ sites are active in dehydrogenation.
Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared
from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation.
New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless,
constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining
well-deﬁned structures of active sites on the support
surface [22,23]. In a favorable situation, the activity
and selectivity of the catalyst can be improved by
selecting an appropriate precursor and conditions for
catalyst preparation [24]. One approach to obtain-
ing well-deﬁned supported oxide catalysts is the use
of atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) [25,26], which is a
solvent-free technique relying on saturating gas–solid
reactions. Kytökivi et al. [27] have recently described
the preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts by ALE,
where chromium acetyl acetonate (Cr(acac)3) vapor
and air were used as source materials for CrOx. The
C/Cr ratio of the sample measured after the ﬁrst sat-
urating reaction of Cr(acac)3 at 200◦C indicted that
one acac ligand was released from Cr(acac)3 in the
surface reaction, leaving two ligands bound to the
surface Cr complex. The sterical effect of these re-
maining two ligands results in a high dispersion of the
chromium species. The Cr loading can be increased
by removing the remaining ligands by air treatment
and repeating the saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3
and air. CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with Cr loading up to
8.8 wt.% (seven cycles) have been prepared [27].
In the present study, the saturating reaction of
Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3 was investigated in detail by
recording FT-IR spectra of the surface Cr complex.
Furthermore, catalysts were prepared by ALE with a
Cr loading up to 12.5 wt.% Cr (10 cycles). The ALE
catalysts, together with catalysts prepared by incipient
wetness impregnation were examined for oxidation
state distribution of chromium (XPS and wet-chemical
method), dispersion of CrOx (H2-TPR, solubility of
Cr6+ surface species, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and
IR), and activity in the dehydrogenation of i-butane.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of CrOx/Al2O3
2.1.1. Support
The catalyst support was g-Al2O3 (AKZO Alu-
mina 000-1.5 E) with a particle size of 0.2–0.4 mm,
a surface area of 195 m2 g−1, and a pore volume of
0.49 cm3 g−1. Al2O3 was preheated at 600◦C for 16 h
in a mufﬂe furnace before the Cr precursor was intro-
duced by using ALE or the impregnation technique.
2.1.2. ALE
The preheat treatment of Al2O3 was continued
at 450◦C for 3 h in a ﬁxed-bed ﬂow-type reactor
[25–27] (F-120 Microchemistry Ltd.) under a pres-
sure of 5–10 kPa in nitrogen ﬂow (99.995%, AGA).
Solid Cr(acac)3, i.e. Cr(C5O2H7)3 (99%, Riedel-de
Häen) was vaporized at 190◦C and then transported,
in nitrogen, downwards through the Al2O3 bed. The
reaction of Cr(acac)3 was carried out at 200◦C fol-
lowed by a nitrogen purge for at least 2 h at the
reaction temperature [27]. The amount of Cr(acac)3
vapor was kept high enough to ensure surface satura-
tion. To remove the ligand residues from the samples,
air treatment was started at 200◦C and continued at
600◦C for 3–4 h. To increase the Cr concentration of
the samples, Cr(acac)3, nitrogen, and air sequences
were repeated between one and 10 times. To decrease
the Cr concentration, dipivaloylmethane (C11H20O2,
Fluka) was reacted with Al2O3 at 200◦C before the
introduction of Cr(acac)3 to the reactor [27].
2.1.3. Impregnation
The preheat treatment of Al2O3 was continued
at 200◦C for 2 h under a pressure of 0.4 kPa. A
pore volume amount of the aqueous solution of
Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (>97%, Fluka) was added to the
support to yield catalysts with 0.3, 1.4, 3.4, 7.9, 8.8,
11, 14, 15, 16, and 21 wt.% Cr. The samples were
stored overnight at room temperature and dried under

221
0.4 kPa in a rotavapor for 2 h at 60◦C. Calcination was
performed in a ﬁxed bed ﬂow reactor with synthetic
air at 600◦C for 3 h. The highest Cr loadings were
obtained by repeating the impregnation step. Between
the steps, the catalyst was calcined at 600◦C for 3 h
under a ﬂow of synthetic air.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
In the ALE catalysts, the carbon concentration after
Cr(acac)3 adsorption was analyzed with a Leco CR12
carbon analyzer. Cr concentration was measured by
instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) [28].
After the catalysts were heated in a mufﬂe furnace for
13 h at 600◦C, the Cr6+ concentration was measured
by dissolving as a chromate in NaOH solution and de-
termining the concentration by UV–VIS spectropho-
tometry [28]. The experiment was also performed by
using water as a dissolving agent.
Speciﬁc surface areas were determined by means of
nitrogen adsorption and condensation (BET method)
using Micromeritics ASAP 2400 equipment. XRD
measurements were done with a Siemens Diffrac 500
diffractometer and Cu Ka radiation. For scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) examination (Jeol JSM
840 A ﬁtted with a PGT IMIX III energy dispersive
X-ray (EDS)), the catalyst particles were embedded
in epoxy resin and the cured block was cut with a
microtome [27].
X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were measured
with an X-probe model 101 spectrometer (Surface
Science Instruments, VG Fisons) equipped with a
monochromatized Al Ka X-ray source, as has been
described earlier [21,27]. All binding energies were
referenced to the Al 2p signal of Al2O3 at 74.5 eV.
The relative surface concentrations for the elements
of interest were calculated from the Cr 2 p3/2, Al 2p,
and O 1s signal intensities, using atomic sensitivity
factors provided by the instrument manufacturer. The
following assumptions were made in the curve ﬁtting
of the Cr 2p3/2 region: (i) the distance and the inten-
sity ratio between the Cr 2p3/2 main and satellite lines
for Cr3+ species are 4.1 eV and 3.125, respectively
[44], (ii) only Cr3+ has a satellite line, (iii) peaks
are symmetric Gaussian, and (iv) the background is
nonlinear Shirley.
A Nicolet Impact 400D FT-IR spectrometer was
used for the diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy measure-
ments. The measurements were performed in an acces-
sory kept in a glove-box under nitrogen atmosphere.
The catalysts were measured as such after transfer-
ring them inertly from the calcination treatment into
the measurement chamber. Spectra were recorded at a
resolution of 2 cm−1 by signal averaging of 50 scans.
The reference spectra were recorded from Cr(acac)3
(Riedel-deHaën, 99%), Al(acac)3 (Merck, >99%), and
Cr(acetate) (Aldrich). The spectrum of bulk a-Cr2O3
(99%, Riedel-deHaën) was measured with a Nicolet
Magna-IR 560 spectrometer equipped with an in-situ
chamber (Harrick HVC-DR2). Spectra were recorded
at room temperature (2 cm−1, 300 scans) after treat-
ment of a-Cr2O3 in-situ at 500◦C for 1 h under a pres-
sure of 10−5 kPa.
TPR measurements with H2 as reducing agent
(H2-TPR) were carried out in a down ﬂow quartz
tubular microreactor connected to a Balzars QMG
420 quadruple mass spectrometer. Before the re-
duction step, the samples (300 mg) were calcined
in-situ at 600◦C with synthetic air for 30 min. The
H2-TPR measurement was performed with a heat-
ing rate of 10◦C min−1 from 30 to 600◦C under a
ﬂow of a 3 vol.% H2/Ar mixture using a ﬂow rate of
30 cm3 min−1. The H2-TPR measurements, in which
the H2 consumption was measured quantitatively,
were carried out in the apparatus and under the con-
ditions described earlier [29].
2.3. Activity measurements
The activities of the catalysts were studied in the
dehydrogenation of i-butane at 540◦C in a ﬁxed
bed ﬂow reactor (di = 7 mm). The feed was 10 vol.%
i-butane/N2 (99.5%), the ﬂow rate was 330 cm3 min−1
(STP), and the sample charge was 100 mg. Before
the measurement, the catalysts were calcined in-situ
with synthetic air at 600◦C for 13 h, and reduced
under 10 vol.% H2/N2 ﬂow at 540◦C for 30 min
(200 cm3 min−1 (STP)). The stabilities of the catalysts
were studied at 580◦C in 30 cycles of 15 min of H2
prereduction, 15 min of dehydrogenation, and 30 min
of regeneration. The regeneration was performed with
a 3 vol.% O2/N2 mixture (300 cm3 min−1 (STP)). The
product distribution was monitored with an on-line
FT-IR gas analyzer (GASMET, Temet Instruments
Ltd.) [21,27,30]. The sample spectra were measured

for 1–5 s at time intervals of 8 s. The calibration of the
analyzer and the computation of the sample spectra
(Calcmet Software Package) are described elsewhere
[30,31]. In addition to unreacted i-butane, the prod-
uct ﬂow contained i-butene, propene, traces of 1-,
cis-2-, and trans-2-butene, 1,3-butadiene, propane,
and methane. The carbon balances calculated for the
activity measurements were >99%.
3. Results
3.1. Preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 from Cr(acac)3
3.1.1. First saturating reaction of Cr(acac)3
After the ﬁrst saturating reaction between Cr(acac)3
and Al2O3 at 200◦C, the Cr loading and C/Cr ratio of
the supported samples were 1.3 wt.% and 11 mol/mol,
respectively [27]. The structure of the surface Cr
complex was studied by FT-IR spectroscopy by com-
paring the spectrum of the supported sample with the
spectra of Cr(acac)3, Cr(III)acetate, acetate/Al2O3
[31], and Al(acac)3 (Fig. 1). The reference spectra of
Cr(acac)3 and Cr(III)acetate were included to deter-
minate whether the acac ligands preserved their ring
structure in the surface Cr complex, and the reference
spectra of acetate/Al2O3 and Al(acac)3 were included
to evaluate the secondary reactions of Hacac released
in the reaction of Cr(acac)3 with the reactive sites of
Al2O3 [25–27,32–35]. At 200◦C, Hacac may react
with Al2O3, forming Al(acac)x or surface acetate and
acetone [31,33,34].
In
the
region
1700–1000 cm−1,
characteristic
bands arising from C=O and C=C vibrations of
the Cr(acac)3 structure are observed in the spec-
trum of Cr(acac)3/Al2O3 at 1580, 1524, 1389, and
1282 cm−1 (Fig. 1a). Likewise, in the region around
3000 cm−1, the bands assigned to different CH and
CH3 vibrations of the Cr(acac)3 structure [36,37]
are observed for the supported sample. The only dif-
ference in the supported sample is that the relative
intensities of the bands are changed and the bands
are shifted 4–10 cm−1 towards higher wavenum-
bers. In the range of the CH3 vibration in the region
around 1400 cm−1, on the other hand, the spectrum
of Cr(acac)3/Al2O3 exhibits a band at 1450–60 cm−1,
whereas in the spectrum of Cr(acac)3, there is a band
at 1427 cm−1 (Fig. 1a–b). Furthermore, in the spec-
trum of Cr(acac)3/Al2O3, increased absorptions are
observed above 1600, at 1330, and at 1050 cm−1,
none of which is characteristic for Cr(acac)3. In these
features, the spectrum of Cr(acac)/Al2O3 is similar to
the reference spectra of Cr(III)acetate, acetate/Al2O3,
and Al(acac)3 (Fig. 1c–e).
3.1.2. Sequential reactions of Cr(acac)3 and air
To increase the Cr loading, the ligand-terminated
sample was subjected to air treatment at 600◦C, and
to a second saturating reaction of Cr(acac)3 at 200◦C.
During the oxidation, the carbonaceous material was
burned from the sample, and part of the Cr3+ was oxi-
dized to Cr6+. When the reactions of Cr(acac)3 and air
were repeated 10 times, the Cr loading was increased
from 1.3 to 12.5 wt.%. The loading increased linearly
with the number of reaction cycles (Fig. 2). To obtain
an understanding about binding mechanism(s) during
the reactions of Cr(acac)3 and air, the C/Cr ratios were
determined from samples, before air treatment, after
two, four, six, and 10 Cr(acac)3 reactions. The val-
ues ranged between 14 and 15 mol/mol. The IR spec-
trum of the sample after two saturating reactions of
Cr(acac)3 was similar to that after the ﬁrst reaction.

Fig. 2. Cr loading with increasing number of saturating reactions
of Cr(acac)3 at 200◦C and air at 600◦C.
Analysis of the series of ALE catalysts by
SEM-EDS suggested that Cr was evenly distributed
through the Al2O3 particles [27]. Furthermore, the
catalysts did not show any sign of the diffraction
pattern of crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the XRD measure-
ments. In spite of increased Cr loading, the speciﬁc
BET surface areas remained within 93% of the area
of Al2O3.
3.1.3. IR spectra of calcined catalysts
The IR spectra of the ALE catalysts together with
the spectra of Al2O3 and bulk a-Cr2O3 are shown in
Fig. 3. All the OH groups of 600◦C Al2O3 [38–40]
are observed after the ﬁrst cycle of Cr(acac)3 and air
(1.3 wt.% Cr). The band at 3770 cm−1 is diminished
markedly, together with the shoulder at 3670 cm−1.
With increased Cr loading, the OH groups disappear
gradually. More speciﬁcally, the band at 3770 cm−1
disappears permanently above 2.4 wt.% Cr (two cy-
cles). Absorption also decreases at 3790, 3730, 3690,
and 3670 cm−1, although the bands at 3790 and
3730 cm−1 can be observed even at 12.5 wt.% Cr (10
cycles). The band at 3690 cm−1 is discernible up to
10 wt.% Cr (eight cycles). Thereafter, it disappears or
is left in the shadow of the band dominating at high
Cr loadings at 3615 cm−1.
To distinguish between the Al–OH and Cr–OH
groups, the spectrum of bulk a-Cr2O3 calcined at
500◦C was recorded (see Fig. 3h). Bulk a-Cr2O3 ex-
hibits a broad band in the OH region with maxima at
3720, 3650, 3615, and 3410 cm−1. The bands coin-

cide, in part, with those reported in [41,42]. Compar-
ison of the spectra of bulk a-Cr2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3
catalysts suggested the presence of Cr–OH groups
(at 3615 cm−1) on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts containing
more than 5 wt.% Cr (more than four cycles).
3.2. Preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 from Cr(NO3)3
For comparison, a series of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts
(0.3–21 wt.% Cr) were prepared by the incipient
wetness impregnation technique. SEM-EDS mea-
surements indicated that Cr was evenly distributed
through the Al2O3 particles. The catalysts were XRD
amorphous until 16 wt.% Cr, at which loading, a
diffraction pattern of crystalline a-Cr2O3 appeared.
The BET surface areas remained within 87% of the
area of Al2O3 with increased Cr loading.
3.2.1. IR spectra of calcined catalysts
As with the ALE catalysts, the adsorption of CrOx
onto Al2O3 was followed by IR spectroscopy. As

depicted in Fig. 4, the bands in the OH region di-
minish gradually with the deposition of CrOx. In the
spectrum of 1.4 wt.% Cr, all Al–OH bands, except
that at 3770 cm−1 are observed. This same band was
observed to disappear in the ALE catalysts. Unreacted
Al–OH groups still existed at 7.9 wt.% Cr, although
the band at 3670 cm−1 disappeared permanently, and
the spectrum was dominated by a broad band at
3600 cm−1. At 15 wt.% Cr, on the other hand, only a
broad band centered at 3500 cm−1 is observed, with
shoulders at 3730 and 3630 cm−1. The presence of H
bonding interactions complicates the interpretation of
the spectra of the impregnated catalysts. The intensity
of the absorption at 1605–1610 cm−1, assigned to
physisorbed water [41], increases with Cr loading.
3.3. Oxidation state distribution and characterization
of Cr6+ in catalysts prepared by ALE and
impregnation
3.3.1. Oxidation state distribution
The curve ﬁtting for the Cr 2p3/2 line in the
XPS spectra of the calcined catalysts prepared by
ALE and impregnation (0.3–8.8 wt.% Cr) showed
the presence of Cr6+ and Cr3+ at 579.8 ± 0.3 and
Fig. 5. Concentrations of Cr6+ (s, d) and Cr3+ (h, j) in
catalysts prepared by ALE (open symbols) and impregnation (full
symbols).
577.2 ± 0.2 eV, respectively, in agreement with ear-
lier work [6,21,27,43,44]. The concentrations of Cr6+
and Cr3+ in the calcined catalysts were determined
quantitatively by a wet-chemical method by dissolv-
ing Cr6+ as chromate in alkaline solution. Calcined
CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts also contained a few weight
percent of Cr5+ species, but due to the small amount
[8,45], it cannot be distinguished by the XPS method.
In the chemical method, on the other hand, Cr5+
species are determined together with Cr6+ [45]. The
concentrations of Cr6+ and Cr3+ in the calcined cata-
lysts prepared by ALE and impregnation were similar
at corresponding Cr loadings. At 0.3 wt.% Cr, 80% of
Cr3+ was oxidized to Cr6+ in the both ALE and the
impregnated catalysts, respectively. With increased Cr
loading, the concentrations of Cr6+ ﬁrst increased to-
gether with the concentration of Cr3+, but leveled off
at about 8 wt.% Cr to a value of 2.8 ± 0.1 wt.% Cr6+
(1.8 at nm−2) (Fig. 5). The concentration of Cr3+, on
the other hand, continued to increase with Cr loading.
To examine the inﬂuence of the calcination temper-
ature on the concentration of Cr6+ species [11,46],
some of the catalysts were calcined at 500 as well as
600◦C. At 1.4 and 1.3 wt.% Cr, the calcination of the
impregnated and ALE catalysts at 500◦C did not affect
the concentration of Cr6+ relative to the treatment at
600◦C (Fig. 6). However, it was observed, upon using
the impregnated catalysts, that at higher loadings of
7.9 and 15 wt.% Cr, calcination at 500◦C increased the
concentration of Cr6+ from 2.76 ± 0.05 (1.8 at nm−2)

(ALE/impregnation) are indicated in the ﬁgure.
to 3.47 ± 0.05 wt.% (2.2 at nm−2). The effect of the
calcination temperature on the concentration of Cr6+
was, thus, dependent on the Cr loading of the catalyst.
3.3.2. Solubility of Cr6+
The concentration of Cr6+ in the calcined catalysts
was determined by dissolving Cr6+ as a chromate in
alkaline solution. Part of the Cr6+ was readily soluble
in water, however, suggesting the presence of Cr6+
sites with varying strength of interaction with Al2O3.
Depending on the method of preparation, the frac-
tion of water-soluble Cr6+ increased from 25–35 to
50–55%, with increased Cr loading (Fig. 7). The frac-
tion was higher in the impregnated catalysts, particu-
larly at low Cr loadings. Above 7 wt.% Cr, the fraction
leveled off at 50–60% and was systematically higher
for the impregnated catalysts.
3.3.3. Reduction of Cr6+ (H2-TPR)
The reduction of Cr6+ in the ALE and impregnated
catalysts was studied by H2-TPR. Only one broad peak
was resolved in the reduction of Cr6+, in agreement
with the literature [15,47]. Independent of the prepara-
tion method, the maximum in H2 consumption shifted
towards lower temperature with increased Cr loading
(Table 1). It is noteworthy that, at the Cr loadings of
0.3 and 1.3 wt.%, the maximum was observed at a
higher temperature for the ALE than for the impreg-
nated catalysts.

The ratio of Cr6+, determined in the calcined cata-
lysts prior to H2-TPR measurement, to H2 consump-
tion was measured for some of the catalysts (0.3, 2.4,
and 12.5 wt.% Cr, prepared by ALE). On the assump-
tion that hydrogen was consumed only in the reduction
of Cr6+ species, the values between 1.5 and 1.6 mol
H2/mol Cr6+ suggest a reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+, a
ﬁnding in accordance with our previous results regard-
ing the reduction of Cr6+ by hydrogen or n-butane in
catalysts prepared by impregnation [21].
3.4. Dehydrogenation activity
3.4.1. Initial activity
The initial dehydrogenation activities of the H2
prereduced CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were measured at
540◦C with i-butane as a reactant. By initial dehy-
drogenation activity, we refer to the constant yield of
226

butenes that was measured during the ﬁrst 10 min on
stream. The dehydrogenation activities of catalysts
prepared by ALE and impregnation and containing
0.3–12.5 wt.% Cr were similar at corresponding Cr
loadings and increased linearly (R2 = 0.97) with the
loading (Fig. 8). Catalysts containing a loading higher
than 12.5 wt.% were prepared by the impregnation
technique and the maximum in the dehydrogenation
activity was observed at loadings between 14 and
16 wt.%.
The selectivities of catalysts with 1.3–21 wt.% Cr
to butenes were 98 ± 1%. The main side product was
propene. Selectivities were similar for the catalysts
prepared by ALE and impregnation. At a loading of
0.3 wt.% Cr, the selectivities were only 86 ± 1%, but
still higher than the selectivity of Al2O3 preheated at
600◦C, which was only 74%. The selectivities lower
than 98% were due to the formation of cracking prod-
ucts.
3.4.2. Deactivation in successive
reaction–regeneration cycles
The stability of the catalysts prepared by ALE and
impregnation with 8.8 wt.% Cr was studied by pro-
cessing the samples in successive cycles of 15 min of
reduction, 15 min of dehydrogenation, and 30 min of
oxidation at 580◦C. The dehydrogenation activities of
the two catalysts in 30 reaction cycles were similar:
activities decreased by 55% from the initial values
during the 30 reaction cycles (Fig. 9). Parallel to the
dehydrogenation activities, the concentrations of Cr6+

in the ALE and impregnated catalysts decreased from
the initial value of 2.8 to 2.3 wt.% after 11 cycles and
1.9 wt.% after 30 cycles.
4. Discussion
4.1. Preparation of CrOx/Al2O3 by ALE
4.1.1. Saturating reaction of Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3
After the ﬁrst saturating reaction, the Cr loading was
1.3 wt.% (0.8 Cr nm−2). The C/Cr ratio of 11 suggests
a release of one ligand in the reaction of Cr(acac)3
leaving two of the ligands in the surface Cr complex
Eq. (1) [27]. Moreover, a comparison of the IR spec-
tra of Cr(acac)3 and Cr(acac)3/Al2O3 suggests that
the supported sample contained surface Cr complexes
with the ring structure of the acac ligands intact.
The IR spectra of Cr(acac)3/Al2O3 exhibit some
additional features that need to be discussed. The
increased absorptions above 1600 cm−1
and the
bands at 1450, 1330, and 1052 cm−1 were not ob-
served for Cr(acac)3. In these features, the spec-
trum of Cr(acac)3/Al2O3 was similar to the spec-
tra of Cr(III)acetate, acetate/Al2O3, and Al(acac)3,
making
unambiguous
assignment
difﬁcult.
The
band at 1450 cm−1 and the increased absorption
above 1600 cm−1 could arise from Cr(III)acetate,
acetate/Al2O3, or Al(acac)3. The bands at 1330 and
A. Hakuli et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 190 (2000) 219–232
227
1052 cm−1, on the other hand, could arise from
Cr(III)acetate or acetate/Al2O3. Cr(III)acetate species
might form via water assisted partial decomposition of
the acac ligands in the surface Cr complex (Eq. (2)),
as proposed earlier for Cr(acac)3/SiO2 samples pre-
pared by the ALE technique at 220–240◦C [48]. Wa-
ter for the partial decomposition of the acac ligands
could originate from the reaction of released Hacac
with Al–OH groups of Al2O3 [31]. Acetate/Al2O3
species, on the other hand, could feasibly be formed
in the reactions of Hacac with the reactive sites of
Al2O3 [31,33,34]. Furthermore, the occurrence of
dissociative adsorption of Cr(acac)3 on coordinatively
unsaturated sites of Al2O3 (Eq. (3)) cannot be ruled
out [49]. The spectrum of Cr(acac)3/Al2O3 did not
exhibit clear evidence for an occurrence of Al(acac)x
groups, however, perhaps because they had decom-
posed to acetate species.

The reaction of Cr(acac)3 vapor with Al2O3 was
studied recently by Babich et al. [50]. To our surprise,
they concluded that, at 190◦C, Cr(acac)3 is adsorbed
on Al2O3 in a molecular form, owing to the interac-
tion of the acac ligands with surface OH groups and
coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ ions. Köhler and Ter-
math et al. [33,34], on the other hand, concluded that
the acac ligands are split from Cr(acac)3 in the adsorp-
tion to Al2O3 already at 127◦C. Our results, accord-
ing to which Cr(acac)3 reacts with Al2O3 at 200◦C,
are, therefore, in line with Köhler and Termath et al.
[33,34]. We would like to add here that SiO2, which is
generally considered to be less reactive than Al2O3 as
a support, reacts with Cr(acac)3 even at 170◦C [48].
On the whole, our spectra of Cr(acac)3/Al2O3 sug-
gested that at least one acac ligand in the surface Cr
complex remained intact in the surface Cr complex. In
view of the C/Cr ratio of 11, and the low intensity of
the additional bands, not observed for bulk Cr(acac)3,
the preservation of two ligands in most complexes
seems likely.
4.1.2. Sequential cycles of Cr(acac) and air
The Cr loading increased linearly with the num-
ber of Cr(acac)3 and air reaction cycles, from 1.3 to
12.5 wt.%, in agreement with previous results (from
1.3 to 8.8 wt.%) [27]. This is not a self-evident result
of the ALE method, and implies that the number of Cr
atoms added per reaction cycle is controlled not by the
number of reactive sites on the surface but by the ster-
ical hindrance asserted by the surface Cr complexes
[27]. The C/Cr ratio determined after two, four, six,
and 10 Cr(acac)3 reactions was 15, which is higher
than the C/Cr ratio of 11 determined after the ﬁrst sat-
urating reaction on Al2O3. A feasible explanation for
the higher value could be a more efﬁcient dehydrox-
ylation of the sample, treated at 600◦C in-situ in the
ALE reactor before the Cr(acac)3 reaction. Before the
ﬁrst saturation reaction of Cr(acac)3, the preheating
was carried out at 450◦C. The greater dehydroxyla-
tion of Al2O3 presumably resulted in some dissocia-
tive adsorption of Cr(acac)3 or consecutive reactions
of Hacac, and thus, in a higher C/Cr ratio.
4.2. Monolayer model for growth of CrOx on Al2O3
CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the ALE tech-
nique were studied earlier by low energy ion scattering
(LEIS), which showed a linear increase in the Cr sig-
nal up to a Cr concentration of 7.4 wt.% (4.5 Cr nm−2)
[27]. The linear increase between 0.3 and 7.4 wt.% Cr
was interpreted as the formation of a monolayer cat-
alyst, consistent with the model according to which
CrOx forms a two-dimensional overlayer on Al2O3.
In other words, during six consecutive reaction cy-
cles, Cr(acac)3 reacted with bare Al2O3. The pro-
posed monolayer coverage (4.5 Cr nm−2) is slightly
higher than that observed by Wachs and Vuurman et
al. [9,51] for CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by incip-
ient wetness impregnation (4 Cr nm−2). In their work,
the evidence for monolayer growth of CrOx came from
Raman spectra, which showed the presence of Cr6+
surface species below 4 Cr nm−2 and the formation
of Cr2O3 crystallites at higher loadings. The increase
in the Cr loading has also been observed to be simul-
taneous with the consumption of Al–OH groups, fur-
228
A. Hakuli et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 190 (2000) 219–232
ther supporting the conclusion that there is monolayer
growth of CrOx onto Al2O3 [52].
The consumption of Al–OH groups with the number
of reaction cycles in the ALE catalysts was followed
by IR (see Fig. 3). In agreement with earlier work
[52,53], the absorption in the OH region decreased
with increased Cr loading, suggesting that Al–OH
groups are used in the binding of CrOx surface species.
We note that our spectra of the ALE catalysts exhib-
ited more structure than the literature spectra, however.
Furthermore, the consumption of Al–OH groups con-
tinued above the monolayer coverage of 7.4 wt.% Cr.
The band at 3615 cm−1 in the spectra of 5–12.5 wt.%
Cr evidently belongs to Cr–OH groups, but the pres-
ence of unreacted Al–OH groups is seen at 3790 and
3730 cm−1. These bands disappeared gradually with
further Cr loading. Our interpretation of the IR and
LEIS measurements is, therefore, as follows: below
the proposed monolayer coverage, CrOx was anchored
to Al–OH groups in a two-dimensional array, whereas
above this, the two-dimensional growth of CrOx pre-
sumably continued by means of OH reaction, yield-
ing surface CrOx species, with a simultaneous growth
of three-dimensional Cr2O3 clusters. Accordingly, the
threshold for the formation of three-dimensional ox-
ide phase at about 7.4 wt.% Cr does not necessarily
coincide with the completion of the highest achiev-
able coverage of CrOx on Al2O3. Thus, by ‘mono-
layer coverage at about 7.4 wt.% Cr’ we refer to a
loading above which CrOx has not only stabilized as
a two-dimensional array anymore, but has also started
to grow in three-dimensional clusters.
According to earlier work [5,45,51,53,54], a nec-
essary condition for the formation of dispersed metal
oxide overlayer is the presence of reactive surface sites
on the oxide support. Formation of dispersed CrOx
species on Al2O3 has been suggested to be determined
by surface hydroxyl chemistry and should not be de-
pendent on the method of preparing the catalyst [5,51].
In view of the important role of the OH groups, we
wish to propose that CrOx also forms a dispersed sur-
face layer in the catalysts we prepared by impregna-
tion. Indeed, according to IR, the Al–OH groups were
consumed upon deposition of CrOx, and XRD did not
reveal crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the impregnated catalysts
until 16 wt.%. Note that we do not exclude the use of
reactive sites of Al2O3 other than the OH groups for
adsorption of CrOx. For, in fact, the monolayer cover-
age measured for the ALE catalysts (4.5 Cr nm−2) is
clearly higher than the concentration of OH groups on
Al2O3 dehydroxylated at 600◦C (2 OH nm−2) [55].
4.3. Characterization of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts
prepared by ALE and impregnation methods
4.3.1. Oxidation state distribution
Both ALE and impregnated catalysts contained
Cr6+ and Cr3+ species. The oxidation state distribu-
tion was independent of the method of preparation. In
both catalysts, Cr6+ was the predominant species at
low loadings of Cr, and the concentration increased
with the Cr loading until it stabilized at a constant
level above 8 wt.% Cr. The concentration of Cr3+
increased continuously and dramatically with Cr con-
tent. Although the exposed surface Cr3+ ions on
amorphous and crystalline Cr2O3 can also be oxidized
to Cr6+ [1,29,47,56,57], we assume that most Cr6+
in our catalyst were stabilized by Al2O3 [5]. This is
so because the concentration of Cr6+ did not increase
above 8 wt.% once the formation of amorphous or
micro-crystalline Cr2O3 started.
Although Al2O3 has a stabilizing effect on Cr6+,
we never observed the oxidation of all Cr3+ to Cr6+.
The presence of Cr3+ at low loadings in the calcined
catalysts was evidently due to its incorporation into
the Al2O3 lattice [8,45]. The incorporation is facili-
tated by the presence of vacant octahedral sites in the
structure of Al2O3 and the similar size and charge
of Cr3+ and Al3+ [45]. That Cr3+ is stabilized in or
on the Al2O3 lattice is supported by the observation
that the concentration of Cr3+ in catalysts containing
1.3–1.4 wt.% Cr, whether prepared by ALE or impreg-
nation, was not affected by the calcination tempera-
ture, i.e. 600 or 500◦C. If the occurrence of Cr3+ was
somehow related to the OH population of Al2O3, cal-
cination at 500◦C would be expected to result in less
dehydroxylated Al2O3, and thus, lower concentration
of Cr3+.
At higher Cr loadings, the decrease in the calcina-
tion temperature of the impregnated samples from 600
to 500◦C resulted in a greater concentration of Cr6+,
evidently, in part, due to a limiting number of OH
groups. We note that the concentration of OH groups
was 1 OH nm−2 greater on 500◦C than on 600◦C
Al2O3 [55], and the value observed for the concentra-

229
tion of Cr6+ after calcination at 500◦C was higher by
0.4 Cr nm−2. Opinions about the oxidation distribu-
tion at moderate Cr loadings are divided. Vuurman et
al. [9] propose that, as the Cr loading increases, stabi-
lization of Cr in the 6+ oxidation state occurs up to the
monolayer coverage of 4 Cr nm−2. In accordance with
this, Cavani [7] and Scierca et al. [6] concluded that
Cr6+ alone occurs at the relatively high loadings of 3
and 1.7 Cr nm−2. Our ﬁnding of 60% of the chromium
in the oxidation state 3+ even at 4.5 at nm−2 is in ac-
cordance with Kozlowski et al. [58] and Rahman et
al. [11]. Kozlowski reports the presence of 40% of
chromium in the oxidation state 3+ at 3.9 Cr nm−2,
and Rahman et al. the presence of Cr3+ in catalysts
with 1.3–5 Cr nm−2. In both cases, the calcination was
at 500–800◦C.
In
spite
of
the
high
concentration
of
Cr3+
and Cr–OH groups in the ALE catalysts at 4.5
Cr nm−2, the LEIS measurements suggested that the
two-dimensional array of CrOx was preserved [27].
The proposal for the presence of dispersed Cr3+ in
the catalysts is compatible with the absence of large
a-Cr2O3 crystallites. Furthermore, there is evidence
in the literature that Cr3+ can be highly dispersed on
CrOx/Al2O3 even at moderate Cr loadings [5].
4.3.2. Interaction of Cr6+ with the support
The structure of Cr6+ on CrOx/Al2O3 has been a
point of discussion. Raman and DRS measurements
of dehydrated catalysts have indicated the presence of
monomers and dimers of Cr6+ [3–5,59], with dimers
being the major species especially at high loadings [3].
Furthermore, Cr6+ can be differentiated according to
solubility in water [7,60,61]: monomers and dimers of
Cr6+ are proposed to be tightly anchored to Al2O3,
and thus, non-soluble in water [7], whereas polymers
of Cr6+ are water-soluble due to a lack of direct chemi-
cal interaction with Al2O3 [7]. This being the case, the
Cr6+ species must have been more isolated in the ALE
than the impregnated catalysts because the fraction
of water-soluble Cr6+ was smaller for the ALE cata-
lysts, especially at low loadings of Cr. With increased
Cr loading, the fraction of water-soluble species in-
creased, independent of the method of preparation.
Above 7 wt.% Cr, the fraction of water-soluble Cr6+
remained almost at a constant level, and was slightly
higher for the impregnated than the ALE catalysts.
The increased solubility of Cr6+ with Cr loading was
evidently due to the polymerization of Cr6+, and the
weaker interaction with Al2O3.
H2-TPR measurements supported the solubility re-
sults: the temperature of the reduction of Cr6+ in ALE
and impregnated catalysts decreased with increased Cr
loading, again evidently due to the polymerization of
Cr6+ [15,62]. Accordingly, the higher temperature of
the maximum in the reduction of ALE catalysts with
0.3–1.3 wt.% Cr is interpreted as the presence of more
isolated Cr6+ in stronger interaction with Al2O3. At
higher Cr loadings (8.8 wt.%), the temperature of re-
duction is independent of the method of preparation.
In summary, although the oxidation state distribu-
tion was similar in the ALE and impregnated catalysts,
the characterization of Cr6+ by solubility and H2-TPR
measurements suggested that there were more isolated
Cr6+ species in the ALE catalysts, in stronger interac-
tion with Al2O3. The better lateral dispersion of CrOx
in the ALE catalysts is attributed to control of the
bonding sites in the ALE technique by the size of the
ligands in the surface Cr complex, the precursor for
CrOx.
4.4. Dehydrogenation activity
4.4.1. Active site(s)
Dehydrogenation occurs under reducing conditions,
where Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+. Earlier, we proposed
that redox Cr3+ formed in the reduction of Cr6+ serve
as active sites in the dehydrogenation (12 Cr nm−2)
[21]. The proposal was made on the basis of the de-
crease in the activity and the decrease in the concentra-
tion of redox Cr3+ in successive reaction–regeneration
cycles. The present study of the dehydrogenation ac-
tivities of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with a wide range of
Cr loadings has now revealed that the activity cannot
be explained by redox Cr3+ alone (see Fig. 10). Be-
low 8 wt.% Cr, a correlation was observed between re-
dox Cr3+ and dehydrogenation activity, but at higher
loadings, the activity continued to increase while the
concentration of redox Cr3+ leveled off. This behavior
could require the formation of additional active sites
with increasing Cr loading, and since the concentration
of redox Cr3+ did not increase above 8 wt.% Cr, we
suggest that the additional active sites were exposed
non-redox Cr3+ sites. The paradox of the presence of
230

Cr3+ in CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by ALE (s) and impreg-
nation (d).
non-redox Cr3+ without dehydrogenation activity at
low loadings of Cr can be understood in terms of the
strong interaction with Al2O3.
The proposed model for active sites can explain
the similar dehydrogenation activities of the ALE and
impregnated catalysts at low loadings of Cr because
the catalysts contained equal numbers of redox Cr3+.
Our interpretation implies that dehydrogenation is not
sensitive to the size of the CrOx ensembles because
redox Cr3+ species were evidently more isolated in
the ALE than in the impregnated catalysts. At higher
loadings, where exposed non-redox Cr3+ is proposed
to form additional dehydrogenation sites, the similar
activity of the catalysts can tentatively be attributed
to the equal number of active non-redox Cr3+ sites.
Increase in the Cr loading above 14 wt.% (measured
for the impregnated catalysts), on the other hand, ev-
idently caused a decrease in the concentration of ex-
posed non-redox Cr3+ sites because the dehydrogena-
tion activity exhibited a maximum at 14–16 wt.% Cr.
Indeed, formation of XRD-detectable a-Cr2O3 was
observed above 16 wt.%. Our proposal for the activity
of redox and exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in dehydro-
genation is in accordance with earlier reports [7,8,12].
4.4.2. Deactivation of CrOx/Al2O3
The stabilities of the ALE and impregnated cata-
lysts (5.5 at nm−2) were compared in consecutive cy-
cles of H2 prereduction, reaction, and regeneration.
In both cases, the activities decreased dramatically in
30 reaction cycles, parallel to the concentration of re-
dox Cr3+ sites. If, as proposed, the redox Cr3+ sites,
the predominant active sites in the catalysts, are in-
teracting directly with Al2O3, a plausible deactivation
mechanism could be a migration of Cr3+ to the Al2O3
lattice [45,19]. A migration of Cr3+ to octahedral Al
sites was, in fact, observed by 27Al MAS-NMR in the
CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst after just one reduction and re-
calcination cycle at 550◦C [45]. Furthermore, redox
Cr3+ sites were evidently lost during the formation of
Cr2O3 clusters. Previously, we reported a decrease in
the Cr/Al XPS signal ratio recorded from CrOx/Al2O3
after dehydrogenation at 580◦C, and an increase in
the signal ratio after regeneration of the catalyst in
air [21]. The lower signal ratios were interpreted as
a decrease in the dispersion of CrOx under the reac-
tion conditions, and the higher values as redispersion
of CrOx during the air treatment [63,64]. Accordingly,
the continuous dramatic deactivation of the catalysts
means that the oxidation treatment was not sufﬁcient
to redisperse the clusters formed.
5. Conclusions
The objective of this work was to study the effect
of the preparation method for CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts
on the nature of the surface species, and thereby, on
the activity. Judging the concentrations of Cr6+ and
Cr3+, similar catalysts were obtained by the ALE and
impregnation techniques. The similarity is attributed
to the dominant effect of Al2O3 on the structure of
the supported phase. A closer study of the catalysts by
H2-TPR and solubility measurements suggested that
the CrOx sites in the catalysts prepared by ALE were
in stronger interaction with Al2O3, and were more uni-
formly distributed. This was attributed to control of the
distance of neighboring CrOx sites in the ALE method
by the size of the surface Cr complex formed during
preparation of the catalyst from the saturating reaction
of Cr(acac)3 with Al2O3. The activities of the catalysts
prepared by ALE and impregnation techniques were
the same in the test reaction of the dehydrogenation
of i-butane, however. Evidently, the dehydrogenation
reaction is insensitive to the size of the CrOx ensem-
bles. The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 cat-
alysts was attributed to redox Cr3+ at low loadings of
Cr, and to both redox and non-redox Cr3+ at higher

231
loadings of Cr. Decay of the dehydrogenation activity
in successive reaction–regeneration–reduction cycles
was attributed to a decrease in the number of redox
sites.
