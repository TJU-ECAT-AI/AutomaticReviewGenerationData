The dehydrogenation 
of isobutane to isobutene over a series of chromia-alumina 
solid solutions was studied. The catalytic activity 
and stability 
to drartivation 
were 
determined. 
Intrinsic 
activities, 
defined as the molar conversion to isobutene per unit area 
of catalyst, were compared. Thr curve shows a marked maximum 
for Cr?Ol-rich 
solid solutions. Concerning A1203-rich samples, e-phases are nearly inactive, whereas 
y-phases exhibit 
relatively 
high activities. 
Stability 
decreases from Alz03-rich to 
C&-rich 
solid solutions. 
This rt=sult suggests, rather unexpectedly, 
that the substitution 
of phases with a 
low content of chromia for the rich phases detected in usunl dehydrogenation 
catalysts would be beneficial. 
The mechanism of dehydrogenation 
and deactivation 
is discussed in terms of the 
chromium ions of various charges present in the solid solutions. It is concluded 
that C?+ ions are probably 
responsible for the initial 
high activity; 
this activity 
is very rapidly 
inhibited. 
The useful dehydrogenating 
centers are the Cr’+ ions. 
The slow deactivation 
process is probably initiated 
by ion pairs containing at least 
one Cr”’ ion. In AIZOI-rich a solid solutions, substantially 
no surface Cr ions are 
present, because of the strongly covalent character of a-phases. They arp practically 
inactive. 
y-Phaws 
probably 
exhibit 
1~s covalent 
character, 
exljlaining 
their 
higher 
activity. 
INTRODUCTION 
The 
chromium 
oxide-aluminum 
oxide 
system 
has been known 
for many 
years 
to 
catalyze 
dehydrogenation. 
It has been used 
in commercial 
processes. 
In 
the dehydro- 
genation 
of hydrocarbons, 
rapid 
deactiva- 
tion 
of the 
catalyst 
takes 
place, 
and 
the 
process 
is carried 
out 
in cycles, 
with 
the 
dehydrogenation 
run being 
followed 
by re- 
activation 
in 
an 
oxidizing 
atmosphere. 
Typical 
cycles 
last 
from 
15 min 
(Houdry 
process) 
to 2 hr (Phillips 
process). 
Usual 
chromia-alumina 
dehydrogenation 
catalysts, 
prepared 
either 
by gel precipita- 
tion, 
wet 
mixing, 
or 
impregnation, 
are 
treated 
at 
high 
temperatures, 
currently 
600°C 
or above. 
It 
can be expected 
that, 
under 
these 
conditions, 
chromia 
and 
alu- 
mina 
are 
partially 
transformed 
to 
solid 
solutions. 
Some results 
on supported 
Cr,Os 
catalysts 
substantiate 
this 
hypothesis 
(1-S). 
Dehydrogenations 
are 
relatively 
simple 
reactions. 
If deactivation 
is overlooked, 
it 
can 
be considered 
that 
the 
catalyst 
acts 
as a mono-functional 
one. If this

substances would 
just impair 
the overall 
activity, 
selectivity, 
and resistance to foul- 
ing. Because the catalytic 
properties 
of 
the simple oxides, chromia 
and alumina, 
are very unsatisfactory, 
it may be assumed 
that 
some combination 
of them, for ex- 
ample some solid 
solut.ion 
with 
a given 
composition 
and structure, 
is the ideal 
catalytic 
agent. 
Numerous 
investigations 
have been dc- 
voted to chromia-containing 
catalysts 
(4). 
But few fundamental 
studies of the cata- 
lytic 
properties of A120a-CrZ03 solid solu- 
t.ions have been performed 
(5-8)) probably 
because it is very difficult 
to produce these 
solutions 
in a sufficiently 
dispersed form 
for measurable action. 
The 
present 
investigation 
was an at- 
tempt to make such a study. 
Dehydrogenation 
of isobutane was cho- 
sen as a test reaction. 
It might become a 
really 
important 
industrial 
process. As a 
test, reaction it has the advantage of giv- 
ing rise t,o practically 
no side reaction, con- 
trary to dehydrogenation 
of normal butane, 
where several olefin isomers, or even di- 
ol~fins, are produced. 
EXPERIMENTAL 
METHODS 
I. Preparation 
of fhe Samples 
As mentioned 
above, the main experi- 
mental 
difficulty 
is to prepare 
chromia- 
alumina 
solid 
solutions 
having 
both 
a 
well-defined 
structure 
and a sufficiently 
large surface area. These requirements 
are 
somewhat 
contradictory. 
The purity 
and 
homogeneity 
of the solid solut’ions depend 
strongly on the synthesis temperatures 
and 
starting 
materials. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt 
presently 
that 
the phase diagram 
in the 
a-Al,O,-Cr?O, 
system exhibits 
a continu- 
ous series of solid solutions 
(9-15). 
But 
obtaining 
such solid solutions 
requires the 
use of high synt,hesis temperatures, 
espe- 
cially 
when 
starting 
from 
heterogeneous 
reagents 
as mechanical 
mixtures 
of the 
simple oxides. Low temperature 
(less than 
800-900°C) 
decomposition 
of the hydrox- 
ides produces samples with 
large surface 
area. Such a preparation 
method led some 
authors to believe that the system exhibited 
an immiscibility 
gap (16’). Our own results 
(17) show that solid solutions 
with 
com- 
positions 
ranging 
from low Cr,Os content 
to over 50% mol Cr,O, 
form only 
with 
difficulty 
at low temperatures. 
We succeeded in meet.ing both require- 
ments simultaneously 
(14, 17, 18) by using 
a method very similar to that of Paris and 
Paris 
(19), 
namely 
the thermal 
decom- 
position 
of 
mixed 
oxalato-complexes, 
(NH,) 3 
[ (GO,) ,Al,-,Cr,] 
, 3H,O. It turned 
out that, 
for some compositions, 
partial 
segregations 
occurred 
when the tempera- 
ture of calcination 
was too low. This led 
us to synthesize three series of solid solu- 
tions by the nearly 
instantaneous 
decom- 
position 
of the mixed salts at 900, 1050, 
and 12OO”C, with the last series covering 
only 
a limited 
composition 
range. 
The 
start’ing 
oxalato-complexes, 
of 
suitable 
composition 
and contained 
in flat 
silica 
crucibles, were introduced 
rapidly 
into the 
oven previously 
heated to the decomposi- 
tion 
temperature. 
Decomposition 
times 
were respectively 
2, 2, and 1 hr. The 
powdery product was crumbled and passed 
through 
a 30 mesh sieve (grain 
diameter 
less than 0.5 mm). All samples were sub- 
jected to X-ray 
diffractomctry 
and BET 
surface area measurement. The results are 
summed up in Table 1. Our values for the 
lattice parameters of the a solid solutions 
have already 
been published 
(14). They 
arc in excellent agreement with the recent 
data of Stone and Vickerman 
(15). 
ZZ. Apparatus 
The apparat,us is of the flow type. It 
consists of two identical 
independent 
cir- 
cuits. Two 
quartz 
reactors, 
one in each 
circuit, 
are located 
horizontally, 
side by 
side, in a tubular 
furnace. One reactor con- 
tains the catalyst bed; the other one, with- 
out catalyst, 
is for reference. The furnace 
temperature 
is 588 + 2°C. Each reactor is 
fed with 
isobutane 
at a constant 
rate of 
300 cm” min-‘. 
The volumes of gases flowing out during 
unit 
time spans arc measured in water- 
sealed tanks. Product gases are sampled in 
glass bulbs and analyzed 
chromatographi- 
tally.

UI. Experimental Procedure 
The oxide samples, in powder form, are 
thoroughly 
mixed with 
14 g of powdered 
fused silica with a grain size between 0.08 
and 0.5 mm. This mixture 
const,itutes the 
catalytic 
bed. The reference reactor merely 
contains 14 g of silica. The powdered bed 
is pressed gently to avoid channeling 
dur- 
ing the catalytic 
test and the remaining 
space in the reactors 
is filled 
up with 
coarse-grained 
Carborundum. 
Fused silica 
and Carborundum 
turned 
out to be com- 
pletely inert under working 
conditions. Be- 
cause of this inert filling, 
thermal 
crack- 
ing and dehydrogenating 
side reactions in 
the gas phase are kept at a very low level; 
the extent 
to which 
these reactions 
take 
place is checked in the reference circuit. 
Valid 
activity 
measurements can be ob- 
tained only if all impurities 
from the cata- 
lyst surface, in particular 
water and car- 
bon, are carefully 
removed. Satisfactorily 
reproducible 
measurements 
(about’ 
5%) 
are obtained if the following 
pretreatment 
is performed: 
heating in air during 6 hr at 
77O”C, followed 
by gradual 
cooling 
from 
770 to 588°C for 1 hr in nitrogen. Catalytic 
tests began immediately 
after this cooling. 
IV. Initial Intrinsic Activity and 
Stability 
Since a carbon deposit forms on the sur- 
face of the catalyst 
during 
the dehydro- 
genation run and progressively 
inhibits 
the 
reaction, 
the activity 
must be measured 
near the beginning. 
The isobutene 
yield 
after 2 min is taken as the initial 
activity. 
It is necessary here to define the various 
quantities 
used for expressing the results. 
Let c be the conversion 
of isobutane, i.e., 
the ratio of the number of moles of iso- 
butane converted to the number of moles 
in the feed. Let, p be the isobutene yield, 
i.e., the proportion 
of the feed converted 
to isobutene, and S selectivity. 
Then: 
p = c*s. 
(1) 
The initial 
act’ivity 
A” of the catalyst 
is the difference between the overall yields 
in the reactor containing 
the catalytic 
bed 
and in the reference reactor: 
A0 = PO - 
PO,. 
(2) 
In order to compare exactly 
the initial 
activities 
of the various oxides, differences 
in specific surface area must be taken into 
account. A contact factor ri has to be de- 
fined. It is the ratio of the total 
surface 
area St of the catalyst sample (m’) to the 
isobutane flow D (moles set-I) : 
St 
Ti = -. 
D 
The reverse ratio corresponds to the num- 
ber of isobutane moles coming into contact 
with a unit surface area during unit time. 
Except 
for solid solutions 
prepared 
at 
900°C with a high Crz03 content, the sam- 
ple weight was chosen so t,hat the isobutene 
yield was less than 20%. Under these con- 
ditions, 
the activity 
A0 is nearly 
propor- 
tional 
(less than 10% error) 
to the total 
surface area St, and consequently 
to 7ir 
since D remains 
constant 
in all experi- 
ments. 
It is thus possible to define a new quan- 
tity, the initial 
intrinsic 
activity 
A” : 
The stability 
of the catalyst, 
i.e., its 
resistance to deactivation 
during 
the de- 
hydrogenation 
run, is represented 
by the 
time t14 
needed for the catalyst to lose one 
third of its initial 
activity 
A”. 
The initial 
intrinsic 
activity 
A” and the 
stability 
t3$ will 
be the kinetic 
quantities 
used for characterizing 
the different Al&- 
Cr?O, solid solutions. 
RESVLTS 
I. Overall Picture 
The experimental 
results obtained 
with 
the oxides synthesized 
at 900°C are pre- 
sented in Fig. 3. The same trends are also 
observed with 
the other series of oxides. 
All

samples deactivate 
during 
the reaction, 
at different 
rates according 
to composition. 
The higher the chromium 
content, the quicker the deactivation. 
For 
chromium-rich 
oxides, the deactivation 
is 
particularly 
rapid during the first minutes.

It should be noted that, as a consequence, 
a considerable 
error is introduced 
in the 
estimation of the initial 
activity. 
A chromatographic 
analysis 
shows that, 
except for isobutene, all reaction products 
are formed at identical 
rates in the refer- 
ence reactor and in the reactor containing 
the catalyst. They are probably 
formed by 
homogeneous reactions, since, to the accu- 
racy of our measurements, the amount of 
reaction products increases with the empty 
space in the reference reactor (18). These 
by-products 
are: methane 
(<O.S%) ; et.h- 
ane (traces) ; propane 
( <0.4%) 
; propene 
(<1.57&b). (The values in parentheses in- 
dicate the maximum 
yield obtained, under 
experimental 
conditions, with reactors filled 
with inert material.) 
The proportion 
of the 
by-products, 
which could not be accounted 
for by the homogeneous reactions, 
is less 
than 0.4% of the isobutene feed.

CY 
solid solutions. 
The curve for CY 
solid 
solution 
has been obtained 
by excluding 
the results corresponding 
to samples with 
a relatively 
high surface area (more than 
12 m2 g-l) and by using only those with a 
surface area between 4.3 and 8.3 rn? g-‘. 
The curves imply 
two important 
facts. 
First, 
a-phases with 
a low Cr,O, 
content 
are completely 
inactive, 
whereas y-phases 
exhibit 
a marked 
activity. 
Secondly, 
the 
activity 
of 
(Y solid 
solutions 
increases 
rapidly 
beyond 
mole 
10% Cr,Os. Inac- 
curacy due to rapid fouling 
of the catalyst 
for high 
Cr,Oj 
contents 
prevents 
precise 
conclusions 
from 
being drawn. 
It 
seems, 
however, that the activity 
increases up to 
pure Cr,O,. 
ZZZ. Stability 
The stabilities 
Lr, of all the samples used 
in our experiments 
are plotted 
in Fig. 4. 
Taking 
only the y solid solutions 
and the 
pure (Y solid solutions 
having 
low surface 
area, the curve in Fig. 5 is obtained 
(99). 
A steady increase in stability 
is observed 
when the Cr,Oa content decreases. 
nISCUSSION 
Our 
results, 
obtained 
with 
catalysts 
quite different 
from those investigated 
by 
most previous researchers, can be used for 
a more precise identification 
of the active 
component 
in chromia-alumina 
dehydro- 
genation catalysts and for a better analysis 
of the various catalytic 
processes involved. 
Since our catalytic 
system, namely 
solid 
solutions, is different 
from industrial 
cata- 
lysts, valid conclusions may be drawn only 
if the reactions taking place on both sys- 
tems are identical 
in quality 
and similar in 
velocity. 
The fulfillment 
of this condition 
means that we do not measure any irrele- 
vant 
phenomenon.

and stabilities 
tg do not differ enormously. 
The differences are not much greater than 
between two industrial 
catalysts. 
Specific 
(per unit mass) or intrinsic 
(per unit sur- 
face area) 
activities 
are similar 
to, or 
greater than, those of industrial 
catalysts. 
Industrial 
catalysts always contain a small 
amount of alkali 
metals. The presence of 
potassium in our solid solutions 
markedly 
improves their catalytic 
properties 
(Table 
2), as it does in industrial 
systems. An 
analysis 
of the gas products 
gives the 
same result 
on all 
catalysts, 
i.e., prac- 
tically 
only isobutene is formed. 
We now proceed to the discussion. The 
conclusions drawn by the different 
authors 
concerning 
the active species in dehydro- 
genation tind the mechanism of this proc- 
ess disagree in many respects (1, al-3%‘). 
Some authors 
(al, dd) are of the opinion 
that the catalytic 
process is related to the 
presence of defects created in the lattice 
by the reduction 
of CP+ ions at the be- 
ginning of the dehydrogenation 
cycle. This 
would confirm hypotheses made by Dow- 
den (34). Other authors, like Slovetskaya 
and Rubinshtein 
(33) 
and 
Slovetskaya 
et al. (55) ascribe the catalytic 
activity 
to the Crz+ ions. Several authors consider 
that the incompletely 
coordinated Cr3+ ions 
are the true active centers (1, 32, 36-42). 
In typical 
experiments 
reported by nu- 
merous authors, 
the olefin yield 
first 
in- 
creases, goes through 
a maximum 
after a 
few minutes, 
then decreases (39, 4.3, 4). 
During 
the first 
minutes, 
a marked 
in- 
crease in the temperature 
(often 
nearly 
50°C) 
of the catalyst 
is observed. Thib 
phenomenon is attributed 
to the reduction 
of hexavalent 
to trivalent 
chromium 
(43, 
4-4-c). 
The reduction 
of chromium 
ions by the 
hydrocarbon 
produces water 
and carbon 
dioxide. These products desorb only slowly 
from the catalyst. 
Their 
progressive 
de- 
sorption 
is assumed to set free the active 
sites and to cause the activity 
increase (38, 
39, 43, 45). As a matter of fact, a certain 
parallelism 
is observed between 
the hy+ 
drated state of the surface and the tim$ 
necessary to reach the maximum 
activity; 
In particular, 
this time is reduced at higher 
temperature, 
because of the quicker 
de+ 
sorption of water (38,45). 
The loss of catalytic 
activity 
during the 
dehydrogenation 
run is generally 
believed 
to be caused by the covering of the surface 
with carbonaceous material, 
often referred 
to as “coke,” which probably 
is a more or 
less dehydrogenated 
polymeric 
material. 
Most authors think that the acid sites are 
responsible 
for olefin 
polymerization 
[see 
for example, Ref. (46) 1. This 
process is 
believed to occur by an acidic carbonium 
ion 
mechanism. 
However, 
it 
should 
be 
mentioned that in opposition 
to this, Shen-

ON cr&&o~ 
343 
Irik et al. (43, 45) found 
that 
the forma- 
ion 
of coke 
is the 
result 
of a reaction 
toncurrent 
to 
dehydrogenation, 
i.e., 
the 
ldsorhed 
activated 
complex 
might 
either 
lesorh 
and 
form 
an 
olefin 
molecule 
or 
jolymerize 
into carbonaceous 
material. 
Taking 
advantage 
of the use of our wcll- 
defined 
solid 
solutions 
without 
a carrier, 
se shall 
try 
to give additional 
arguments 
ior the identification 
of the active 
sites for 
dehydrogenation 
and 
coke 
formation 
and 
for 
the 
elucidation 
of the 
mechanism 
of 
these reactions. 
We will first discuss 
the dehydrogenating 
Qctivity. 
It is known 
that, Cr,O, 
is a scmi- 
lconductor 
of type 
p in oxidizing, 
and 
of 
#ype n in reducing 
atmosphere 
(27). When 
contacted 
with a hydrocarbon, 
c.g., butane, 
at high temperature 
(48O”C), 
the p eemi- 
conductor 
instantaneously 
becomes 
n (47). 
When 
supcrfirially 
reduced 
by 
hydrocgen. 
Cr.& 
adsorbs 
much 
oxygen 
and 
little 
hydrogen; 
the rcvcrse 
is observed 
on oxi- 
dized 
Cr,O:, (40). The 
adsorption 
of oxy- 
gen 
causing 
the 
formation 
of chromium 
ions 
with 
a valency 
higher 
than 
3 is re- 
sponsible 
for p type scmiconductivity. 
The 
n type 
semiconductivity 
in the 
reducing 
atmosphere 
is caused 
by the formation 
of 
ions with low valency, 
namely 
Cr2+. on the 
surface. 
The 
catalytic 
properties 
of rcduccd 
or 
oxidized 
Cr,O,, in reactions 
other 
than 
de- 
hydrogenation 
are dissimilar, 
i.e., reduced 
Cr,O,, 
is 
highly 
act,ive 
in 
hydrogen- 
deutrrium 
exchange, 
and 
in ethylene 
hy- 
drogenation 
at 
-78°C 
; whcrca:: 
oxidized 
Cr,O,, 
is totally 
inactive 
(48). This 
in- 
activity 
is probably 
C~~JFC~ by the chemi- 
sorbed 
oxygen 
layer, 
which 
obscures 
the 
active 
chromium 
ions. 
At 
-78°C. 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
oxidized 
catalyst 
is 
not, 
altered 
by the reducing 
atmosphere. 
Voltz 
and Weller 
(48) observed 
that 
the excess 
oxygen 
can be removed 
near 
5OO”C, after 
which 
treatment 
the catalyst 
begins 
to be 
act’ive in the hydrogen-deuterium 
exchange. 
Very 
little 
1s known 
concerning 
Al&- 
Cr,O, 
solid 
solutions. 
Nevertheless, 
one 
important 
result 
(49) 
is mentioned 
here 
because 
it is essential 
for our discussion. 
It 
was 
obtained 
by 
Hensler 
and 
Henry 
(50) 
and 
Eremenko 
and 
Be’nish 
(51) 
on 
(Y solid-solutions 
and 
by Chapman 
et al. 
(52) 
and 
Bremer 
and 
Stach 
(53) 
on co- 
precipitated 
chromia-alumina 
catalysts. 
The 
semiconductivity, 
of 
type 
p 
or 
n 
according 
to 
the 
atmosphere, 
decreases 
when 
the chromium 
content 
decreases. 
It 
thus 
appears 
that 
the tendency 
of super- 
ficial oxygen 
to leave the surface 
of Cr,OZi 
tlccrea~c~ in the solid solutions. 
Pure 
alumina 
has 
no scmiconduct’ivity. 
The 
adsorption 
of oxygen 
and 
hydrogen 
on superficially 
reduced 
or oxidized 
r-am- 
mina 
is much 
smaller 
than 
on Cr,O,, (40). 
The desorption 
of the surface 
oxygen 
being 
very small, the surface 
is much thr same in 
the reducing 
or in the oxidizing 
atmosphere. 
The 
scm:conductivity 
rc*ults 
indicate 
that, two types 
of cations

on 
the 
surfarc 
of 
rcduccd 
AlJJ:,-CrO, 
solid 
solutions, 
i.e., 
CY+ and 
Crs+. But 
these 
results 
do not, suggeqt 
which 
one is 
the most 
active 
in dehydrogenation. 
Two 
phenomena 
contribute 
to the 
overall 
de- 
crease 
of the activity 
when 
the chromium 
content 
of the 
solid 
solutions 
decreases. 
First, 
urogrcssive 
dilutions 
of the chromium 
ions 
tliminishc~ 
the number 
of chromium 
sites on the surface. 
Secondly, 
the oxygen 
layer 
is more firmlv 
attached 
on the sur- 
face. The 
surface 
is more 
similar 
to that 
of alumina, 
which is irreducible. 
When 
the 
Cr,O,, 
content. 
goes below 
mole 
lo%,, 
the 
catalytic 
activity 
falls to zero, because 
no 
chromium 
ions remain 
available. 
The situ- 
ation is sketched 
in Fig. Gb,c,d. 
The higher 
activity 
of a y solid solution 
could be explained 
by the difference 
in the 
lattice 
energy 
of the y and 
(Y forms 
and 
t’hr correlative 
difference 
in bond 
energy 
between 
the surface 
and 
the 
chemisorbed 
oxygen. 
The y form is a metastable 
oxide 
of 
a spine1 
type, 
with 
a marked 
ionic 
character, 
while the cy form is stable 
at all 
temperatures 
and 
possesses 
a strong 
co- 
valent 
character. 
Oxygen 
is 
necessarily 
less strongly 
bonded 
on the surface 
of the 
y form. More 
chromium 
ions are probably 
available 
(Fig. 6e). 
We now come to a discussion 
of activity 
variations 
during 
a 
run 
and, 
more 
precisely,

which

(Fig. 6g). This 
could ac- 
count for the extremely 
rapid deactivation 
observed for Cr,O,-rich 
samples and for 
initial 
rapid, but only partial, 
deactivation 
observed in the first minutes of the run for 
AlzOJ-rich 
samples 
(Fig. 
1). The 
active 
couples 
could 
be the 
Cr2+-Cr4+ couples 
mentioned 
by Stone for Cr?03-rich 
solid 
solutions 
(56). 
The 
slow 
deactivation 
process in 
the 
experiments 
with 
Al,O,-rich 
samples may 
be ascribed to the Cr3+ ions and, especially, 
to Cr3+ or equivalent 
pairs on which 
the 
surface complexes cert.ainly 
have a longer 
lifetime. 
The deactivation 
rate on y or on 
N solid solutions 
would decrease with 
the 
concentration 
of these ion pairs, t’hus ex- 
plaining 
the overall 
trend observed 
(Fig. 
6f,h). 
Thus, Cr2+ would be responsible 
for the 
high initial 
activity 
and the rapid initial 
deactivation 
of all catalysts. 
The normal 
act,ive species, especially 
in the Al,O, 
rich 
domain, 
would 
be the C?+ ion, which 
is 
slowly deactivated. 
The increase in activity 
usually observed 
with 
supported 
catalysts 
during 
the first 
minutes 
of the dehydrogenation 
run still 
has t.o be discussed. The first, point 
con- 
cerns the presence of ions with 
valency 
higher than 3 on the surface of the rata- 
lysts 
regenerat.ed in an oxidizing 
atmo- 
sphere. We measured the temperature 
rise 
during 
the first, minute 
after the hydro- 
carbon 
was 
introduced. 
Pratically 
no 
temperature 
rise (less than 1°C) was ob- 
served with 
a (Y solid solution 
regenerated 
tither 
under 
standard 
conditions 
or at 
lower temperatures 
(650°C). 
Temperature 
rises of 67°C 
were always observed with 
the industrial 
catalysts as well as with our 
y solid solutions. It thus seems that a sub- 
stantial 
amount 
of chromium 
with 
high 
valencics 
is present 
only 
in 
the 
latter 
catalyst,. It is known 
t’hat, CY+ ions are 
selectively 
stabilized 
by y- or r-related 
phases containing 
alumina, 
but not by or- 
alumina 
(57). 
The 
EPR 
measurements 
on our solid 
solutions 
show that, 
after 
regenerat.ion, t’he only signal observed with 
(Y solutions 
is the wide line of Cr3+ (g = 
1.975, band 
width 
20&750 G). 
With 
y 
solutions, 
an intense sharp line (g = 1.97, 
band width 
50 G) characteristic 
(25, 49, 
58-60) 
of Cr5+ is observed. The thermal 
effect must therefore be attributed, 
at least 
most of it, to the reduction of the Cr”+ ions 
present after the regeneration 
of catalysts 
containing 
a y-phase. 
In our experiments, relatively 
little 
high 
valency 
chromium 
is expected to be pre- 
sent, because the calcination 
temperature 
is high 
(49). Therefore, 
the temperature 
rise is markedly 
less than mentioned 
by 
other workers 
(who have observed values 
up to 50°C). 
Water 
and carbon 
oxide 
formation 
are correspondingly 
lower, and 
the inhibition 
they produce could be ex- 
pected to be small. This is consistent with 
the fact that we never noticed any increase 
in activity 
during the initial 
period of the 
dehydrogenation 
run. 
CONCLUSION 
The measurement of the catalytic 
~activ- 
ity 
of A&O,-Cr,O,, 
solid 
solutions 
with 
various 
chemical 
and 
crystallographic 
compositions, 
together 
with 
literature 
results 
concerning 
semiconductivity, 
lead 
us to the following 
conclusions. 
Besides 
Cr3+, which 
is 
certainly 
active, 
Cr2+ 
probably 
contributes 
to the overall 
activ- 
ity. Both are active in the processes lead- 
ing to the deactivation 
of the catalysts. It’ 
is likely 
that the Cr?+ ion is responsible 
for 
the initial 
superactivity 
and initial 
superdeactivation 
of 
Al,O,-Cr,O, 
solid 
solutions. Results on r solid solutions 
and 
on chromia-poor 
CY 
solid solutions 
suggest 
that’ the normal 
active 
species is Cr”+. 
Normal deactivation 
is probably 
originated 
by ion pairs containing 
at least one Cr.?+ 
ion, 
particularly 
Cr”+ 
pairs. 
Stability 
increases more rapidly 
than 
activity 
dc- 
creases when chromium 
is more and more 
diluted 
in y solid solutions, 
because ion 
pairs are correlatively 
held apart. We can- 
not, conclude RR 
to the exact nature of the 
active CT”+ ions. The recent, interpretation 
suggesting 
they 
would 
be incompletely 
coordinated 
ions 
(36, 41, 42, 56, 61) is 
quite 
ucrcptahlc. 
Concerning 
the 
effects 
346 
JIARCILLY 
AND 
DELhION 
observed on freshly regenerated catalysts 
during the initial period of the dehydrogen- 
ation run, it seems well established that 
they are caused by the Cr5+ ions, which 
are stabilized by r-phases. 
Our results suggest that the activity and 
stability 
of industrial 
catalysts could be 
improved. It has been shown (Table 2) 
that 
our unsupported low-surface solid 
solution sometimes has properties parallel- 
ing those of industrial 
catalysts. Actual 
practice is far from being adapted to 
synthesize the substances showing the best 
compromise between activity 
and stabil- 
ity, which seems to be the y-phases with 
about mole 10% chromia. In particular, 
impregnation 
is likely 
to form mainly 
chromium-rich 
solutions and coprecipita- 
tion to form phases in too large a com- 
position range. This is substantiated by 
X-ray measurements. When the presence 
of chromia is ascertained, the only form 
is a-Crz03, which is no good as a catalyst.
