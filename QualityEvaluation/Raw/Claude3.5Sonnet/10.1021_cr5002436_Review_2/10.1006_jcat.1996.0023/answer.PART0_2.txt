[1] "Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts find industrial application for different reactions, such as polymerization of ethylene (1, 2) and dehydrogenation of paraffins (3). In addition, they are known to be active in the selective oxidation of alcohols (4)."

[2] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene (5). Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis,"

[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene (3), some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst; a dopant, consisting of an alkali metal, is also added to promote activity and/or selectivity to the olefin."

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports (628). Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, finding applications in various industrial processes. Key applications include polymerization of ethylene, dehydrogenation of paraffins, and selective oxidation of alcohols. The dehydrogenation of n-butane for butenes and butadiene synthesis was an early focus area, while recent interest has shifted towards isobutene production for MTBE synthesis.

Industrial processes like Catofin, Linde, and Snamprogetti Yarsintez use supported chromium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation. Research has focused on several key areas:

1. Structure and active sites: Numerous studies have characterized the nature of chromium species on different supports.

2. Support materials: Alumina is the preferred support for industrial applications, but other materials like zirconia have also been investigated.

3. Promoters: Alkali metals are often added as dopants to enhance activity and selectivity.

4. Characterization techniques: Various methods such as UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been employed to study these catalysts.

5. Reaction mechanisms: While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, understanding reaction mechanisms is likely a focus area in research.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by industrial needs and advancements in characterization techniques, leading to improved catalyst performance and a deeper understanding of their properties.
