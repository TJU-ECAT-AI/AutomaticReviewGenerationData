[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene"

[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, but also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications, such as the synthesis of high-purity propylene and butenes for the polymer industry."

[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene (3), some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst; a dopant, consisting of an alkali metal, is also added to promote activity and/or selectivity to the olefin."

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports (628). Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

[5] "The effects of the type of support and of some preparation parameters (calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading) on the nature of the chromium species have been the object of most of these investigations."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Initially, they gained wide interest for the dehydrogenation of n-butane to produce butenes and butadiene. In recent years, there has been renewed interest due to the increased demand for isobutene in MTBE synthesis and the potential to compete with steam cracking for producing pure light olefins.

Key industrial applications include several processes for isobutane dehydrogenation, such as the Catofin, Linde, and Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes. These use supported chromium oxide catalysts, often with alkali metal dopants to enhance activity and selectivity.

Research focus areas have included:

1. Characterization of chromium species on different supports using various techniques like UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.

2. Investigation of support materials and their effects on chromium species.

3. Study of preparation parameters such as calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading.

4. Understanding the nature and role of active sites.

5. Exploring the use of promoters, particularly alkali metals.

While not explicitly mentioned in the given text, it's likely that reaction mechanisms have also been a significant area of study, given their importance in understanding and optimizing catalytic processes.

自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变。最初，它们因用于正丁烷脱氢生产丁烯和丁二烯而受到广泛关注。近年来，由于异丁烯在MTBE合成中需求的增加，以及有可能与高资本投资的蒸汽裂解工艺竞争生产纯轻烯烃，因此重新引起了人们的兴趣。

主要工业应用包括几种异丁烷脱氢工艺，如Catofin、Linde和Snamprogetti Yarsintez工艺。这些工艺使用负载型氧化铬催化剂，通常添加碱金属掺杂剂以提高活性和选择性。

研究重点领域包括：

1. 使用各种技术如UV-Vis漫反射光谱、激光拉曼光谱和X射线光电子能谱来表征不同载体上的铬物种。

2. 研究载体材料及其对铬物种的影响。

3. 研究制备参数如焙烧温度和氧化铬负载量。

4. 理解活性位的性质和作用。

5. 探索促进剂的使用，特别是碱金属。

虽然在给定的文本中没有明确提到，但考虑到反应机理在理解和优化催化过程中的重要性，它很可能也是一个重要的研究领域。
