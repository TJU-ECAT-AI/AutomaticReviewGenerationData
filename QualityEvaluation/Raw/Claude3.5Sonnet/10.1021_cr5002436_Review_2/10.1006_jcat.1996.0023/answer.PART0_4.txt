[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene"

[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, but also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications"

[3] "Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts find industrial application for different reactions, such as polymerization of ethylene (1, 2) and dehydrogenation of paraffins (3). In addition, they are known to be active in the selective oxidation of alcohols (4)."

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports (628). Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

[5] "The effects of the type of support and of some preparation parameters (calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading) on the nature of the chromium species have been the object of most of these investigations."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initially, they gained wide interest for n-butane dehydrogenation to produce butenes and butadiene.

2. In recent years, renewed interest has developed due to the increased need for isobutene in MTBE synthesis and as a competitive alternative to steam-cracking for light olefin production.

3. Key industrial applications now include ethylene polymerization, paraffin dehydrogenation, and selective alcohol oxidation.

4. Research focus areas have included:
   - Characterization of chromium oxide on different supports using various techniques (e.g., UV-Vis DRS, Raman spectroscopy, XPS)
   - Study of catalyst structure and active sites
   - Investigation of support materials
   - Effects of preparation parameters like calcination temperature and chromium oxide loading
   - Examination of promoters (e.g., alkali metals)
   - Understanding reaction mechanisms

5. The development of these catalysts has led to their use in several industrial processes for isobutane dehydrogenation, including the Catofin, Linde, and Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes.

This evolution reflects the ongoing importance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes and the continuous efforts to improve their performance and understand their fundamental properties.
