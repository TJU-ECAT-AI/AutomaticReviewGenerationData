[1] "Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts find industrial application for different reactions, such as polymerization of ethylene (1, 2) and dehydrogenation of paraffins (3). In addition, they are known to be active in the selective oxidation of alcohols (4)."

[2] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene (5). Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis,"

[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene (3), some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst; a dopant, consisting of an alkali metal, is also added to promote activity and/or selectivity to the olefin."

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports (628). Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery, finding widespread industrial applications in various processes. Key developments include:

1. Industrial applications: These catalysts are used in ethylene polymerization, paraffin dehydrogenation, and selective oxidation of alcohols. They were initially important for n-butane dehydrogenation to produce butenes and butadiene.

2. Research focus areas:
- Structure and active sites: Extensive research has been conducted on characterizing chromium oxide species on different supports using techniques like UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
- Support materials: While alumina is the preferred support for industrial applications, other materials like zirconia have also been studied.
- Promoters: Alkali metals are added as dopants to promote activity and/or selectivity to olefins.
- Reaction mechanisms: Studies have focused on understanding the dehydrogenation process, particularly for isobutane to isobutene conversion.

3. Recent developments: There has been renewed interest in these catalysts due to the increased demand for isobutene in MTBE synthesis. They are also being explored as a potential alternative to steam-cracking for producing high-purity light olefins.

4. Industrial processes: Several processes (e.g., Catofin, Linde, and Snamprogetti Yarsintez) use supported chromium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by the need to improve their performance in dehydrogenation processes, leading to ongoing research into their structure, composition, and reaction mechanisms.
