[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene"

[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, but also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications"

[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst"

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports"

[5] "Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial focus: They were first widely used for n-butane dehydrogenation to produce butenes and butadiene.

2. Recent developments: Renewed interest has emerged due to increased demand for isobutene in MTBE synthesis and as an alternative to steam cracking for light olefin production.

3. Industrial applications: Several processes (Catofin, Linde, Snamprogetti Yarsintez) use supported chromium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.

4. Research focus areas:
   a) Characterization of chromium oxide on various supports
   b) Structure and active sites investigation
   c) Support materials optimization
   d) Use of promoters (e.g., alkali metals)
   e) Reaction mechanisms studies

5. Key characterization techniques: UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been extensively used to study these catalysts.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by industrial needs and advances in characterization techniques, leading to improved understanding of their structure-activity relationships and optimization for various dehydrogenation processes.
