Chromium oxide-based catalysts have undergone significant evolution since their discovery in 1933, becoming crucial in various industrial dehydrogenation processes. The development of these catalysts has been driven by ongoing research into their structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms.

Initially, chromia-alumina catalysts were developed and commercialized for butane dehydrogenation in Germany, the United States, and England in the late 1930s and early 1940s [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. During World War II, these catalysts were used to produce high-octane aviation fuel through butane dehydrogenation [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. The first UOP-designed plant using chromia-alumina catalysts began operation in England in 1940 [Placeholder_Of_DOI].

Industrial applications expanded over time. In the late 1980s, Houdry extended the use of chromia-alumina catalysts to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation, introducing the Catofin process [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. Currently, chromium oxide-based catalysts are widely used for the production of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. The Catofin process has become a world leader in producing propene and isobutene, with an installed capacity of 600,000 and 2,600,000 metric tons per year, respectively [Placeholder_Of_DOI].

Research has focused on understanding the structure and nature of active sites in these catalysts. Studies have identified various chromium species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, with their distribution depending on factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, and support material [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. Recent research suggests that Cr3+ species, either redox or exposed non-redox sites, serve as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions [Placeholder_Of_DOI].

Support materials have been a key area of investigation. While alumina remains the most common support for industrial applications, research has explored alternatives such as zirconia, silica, and mesoporous materials [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. These studies aim to improve catalyst performance by enhancing chromium dispersion and stability.

Preparation methods have evolved from simple impregnation techniques to more advanced approaches like atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. These newer methods aim to create well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface, optimizing catalyst performance.

The use of promoters, particularly alkali metals like potassium, has been found to enhance olefin selectivity and improve catalyst stability against deactivation [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. This has become an important aspect of industrial catalyst formulations.

Recent research has also explored the use of CO2 as a co-feed in dehydrogenation processes, which has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [Placeholder_Of_DOI]. This development not only improves process efficiency but also contributes to CO2 utilization, addressing environmental concerns.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 has been marked by significant advancements in understanding their structure-function relationships and optimizing their performance for various dehydrogenation processes. Looking forward, several key areas emerge as potential focal points for future research and development:

1. Nano-engineered catalysts: With the increasing sophistication of synthesis methods, there is potential to develop highly tailored nano-structured catalysts with precisely controlled chromium species distribution and support interactions.

2. In-situ characterization: Advanced in-situ spectroscopic techniques could provide deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of active sites under reaction conditions, potentially resolving ongoing debates about the nature of active species.

3. Computational modeling: The application of advanced computational methods could help predict optimal catalyst compositions and structures, accelerating the discovery of more efficient catalysts.

4. Green chemistry integration: Further research into CO2-assisted dehydrogenation could lead to more environmentally friendly processes, combining efficient olefin production with carbon utilization.

5. Novel support materials: The exploration of new support materials, such as metal-organic frameworks or 2D materials, could open up new possibilities for catalyst design and performance enhancement.

6. Process intensification: Research into novel reactor designs and process configurations could lead to more efficient and economical dehydrogenation processes, potentially expanding the industrial applications of these catalysts.

These future directions could not only enhance the performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in existing applications but also potentially open up new areas of use, further cementing their importance in the chemical industry.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂经历了显著的演变，在各种工业脱氢过程中变得至关重要。这些催化剂的发展一直受到对其结构、活性位点、载体材料和反应机理的持续研究推动。

最初，铬氧化铝催化剂在20世纪30年代末和40年代初在德国、美国和英国开发并商业化用于丁烷脱氢 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。第二次世界大战期间，这些催化剂被用于通过丁烷脱氢生产高辛烷值航空燃料 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。1940年，第一个使用铬氧化铝催化剂的UOP设计工厂在英国开始运营 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。

工业应用随时间不断扩大。20世纪80年代末，Houdry将铬氧化铝催化剂的使用扩展到丙烷和异丁烷脱氢，引入了Catofin工艺 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。目前，铬氧化物基催化剂广泛用于通过相应烷烃的脱氢生产乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低级烯烃 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。Catofin工艺已成为生产丙烯和异丁烯的世界领导者，安装产能分别为每年60万和260万公吨 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。

研究集中在理解这些催化剂中活性位点的结构和性质。研究已经识别出各种铬物种，包括Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+，它们的分布取决于铬负载量、制备条件和载体材料等因素 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。最新研究表明，Cr3+物种，无论是氧化还原型还是暴露的非氧化还原型位点，都作为脱氢反应的活性位点 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。

载体材料一直是研究的一个关键领域。虽然氧化铝仍然是工业应用中最常见的载体，但研究已探索了诸如氧化锆、二氧化硅和介孔材料等替代品 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。这些研究旨在通过提高铬的分散度和稳定性来改善催化剂性能。

制备方法已从简单的浸渍技术发展到更先进的方法，如原子层外延（ALE）[Placeholder_Of_DOI]。这些较新的方法旨在在载体表面创建明确定义的活性位点结构，优化催化剂性能。

使用促进剂，特别是钾等碱金属，已被发现可以提高烯烃选择性并改善催化剂对失活的稳定性 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。这已成为工业催化剂配方的一个重要方面。

最近的研究还探索了在脱氢过程中使用CO2作为共进料，这被发现可以增强Cr基催化剂对低级烷烃和乙苯的脱氢 [Placeholder_Of_DOI]。这一发展不仅提高了工艺效率，还有助于CO2利用，解决了环境问题。
