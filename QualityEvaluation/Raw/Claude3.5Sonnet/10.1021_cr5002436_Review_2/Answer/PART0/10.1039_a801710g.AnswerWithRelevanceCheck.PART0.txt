          Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved to become crucial in chemical industries for producing important commodity chemicals. Key industrial applications include:

1. Polymerization: Chromium-on-silica is used as the Philips catalyst, responsible for about one-third of global high-density polyethylene (HDPE) production.

2. Dehydrogenation: Chromium-on-alumina is employed in light paraffin dehydrogenation processes like the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes.

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Molecular structure: Elucidating the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relationship with catalytic performance.

2. Active sites: Investigating the role of different chromium oxidation states (Cr6+, Cr3+, and Cr2+) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Studying the effects of different support compositions (e.g., silica, alumina, and silica-alumina) on catalyst performance.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Understanding the catalytic action of supported metal oxide catalysts through in situ spectroscopic studies combined with on-line activity/selectivity measurements.

These research efforts have led to a better understanding of the structure-activity relationships in chromium oxide-based catalysts, enabling their optimization for various industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes.
