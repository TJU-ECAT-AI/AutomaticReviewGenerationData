          [1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

          [2] "chromium-based catalysts employed in industrial plants possess higher concentrations of chromium, generally supported on alumina with alkali oxides as promoters [7]. The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

          [3] "Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading."

          [4] "Several Cr species were identied, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR g-signal), CrIII (ESR d-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters (ESR b-signal) and a-chromia."

          [5] "Previous work on dilute ZC, AC and SC systems [13] indicated that: (i) the catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation was proportional to the Cr content; (ii) the dehydrogenation rate per Cr atom (i.e. the turnover frequency per Cr atom) was substantially higher for ZC than either AC or SC;"

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, it offers insights into their evolution and current research focus areas:

          1. Support materials: Research has extensively studied chromium oxide catalysts on various supports, including zirconia, alumina, and silica, for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly propane and isobutane.

          2. Industrial applications: The main applications are:
             a) Propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization
             b) Isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene

          3. Structure and active sites: Studies have identified various chromium species present in these catalysts, including CrVI, CrV, CrIII, small CrIII oxide clusters, and α-chromia. The research focuses on understanding the role of these species and their interactions with support materials.

          4. Promoters: Industrial catalysts typically use alumina as a support with alkali oxide promoters.

          5. Catalyst performance: Research has shown that:
             a) Catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation is proportional to the Cr content
             b) Zirconia-supported chromium catalysts exhibit higher turnover frequencies compared to alumina and silica supports

          6. Research focus: Current studies aim to:
             a) Understand the role of support materials and supported species, especially when chromium loading exceeds monolayer capacity
             b) Compare the activity of chromia catalysts on different supports (zirconia, alumina, silica)
             c) Investigate the impact of chromium loading, support type, and preparation methods on catalyst performance

          While not providing a complete historical evolution, the literature demonstrates ongoing efforts to optimize chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes through a deeper understanding of their structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms.

          虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它提供了有关其演变和当前研究重点领域的见解：

          1. 载体材料：研究已广泛研究了各种载体上的铬氧化物催化剂，包括氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化硅，用于烷烃脱氢过程，特别是丙烷和异丁烷。
