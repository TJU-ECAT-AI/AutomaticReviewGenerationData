          [1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."

[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."

[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques."

[5] "Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, as well as a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been all proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions."

[6] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."

[7] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."

[8] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[9] "The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Industrial applications: Initially used in the 1940s by UOP for dehydrogenating butane to produce high-octane aviation fuels. They have since been applied to various light olefin dehydrogenation processes.

2. Research focus areas:

a) Structure: Studies have identified various surface species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, Cr2+) and forms (chromates, polychromates, crystalline and amorphous chromia) on freshly prepared catalysts.

b) Active sites: Research has proposed Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, or a mixture of both as active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

c) Support materials: Alumina remains the most common support, but alternatives like zirconia have been investigated to improve catalyst performance and stability.

d) Promoters: Alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) have been found to promote both activity and selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

e) Reaction mechanisms: Intensive studies have been conducted on the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism over these catalysts.

3. Technological advancements: The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques has allowed for studying catalysts under reaction conditions, providing deeper insights into their behavior and properties.

These research areas and technological advancements have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes by improving their performance, understanding their behavior, and expanding their applications.
