          [1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation [1-3]. Among the various supported chromia materials, a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been used on a commercial scale for years [1]."

[2] "The catalytic activity is related to the nature of surface chromium, whose speciation is strongly dependent on the nature of oxide support and the chromium content [4,5]."

[3] "Depending on the loading, surface chromium may be present as isolated monomeric species, polymeric species or a combination thereof."

[4] "Previous studies reported that supported chromia catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation reaction, most likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous material [10,11]."

[5] "The present contribution deals with light hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over novel chromia-alumina catalysts with well-developed mesoporosity and relatively high surface area."

[6] "Nowadays, dehydrogenation of ethane, propane and iso-butane has become an important route to meet the increasing demand for light olefins."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming widely used for alkane dehydrogenation. Key developments and research focus areas include:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have examined how the nature of surface chromium species affects catalytic activity. This has been found to depend strongly on the support material and chromium content. Research has focused on understanding chromium speciation, including isolated monomeric and polymeric species.

2. Support materials: Alumina has been an important support, but research has also looked at other oxides. Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have been used commercially for years.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Work has been done to understand how alkanes adsorb and react on the catalyst surface.

4. Deactivation and regeneration: A major focus has been understanding catalyst deactivation, which occurs mainly due to carbon deposition during the reaction. Research has examined how to regenerate deactivated catalysts through oxidative treatments.

5. Novel catalysts: Development of new catalysts, such as mesoporous chromia-alumina catalysts with high surface area.

Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and iso-butane to meet the increasing demand for light olefins. The evolution of these catalysts has involved optimizing the chromium species, support interactions, and stability to improve their industrial performance in dehydrogenation processes.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变，被广泛用于烷烃脱氢。主要发展和研究重点领域包括：

1. 结构和活性位点：研究了表面铬物种的性质如何影响催化活性。这被发现强烈依赖于载体材料和铬含量。研究集中在理解铬物种，包括孤立的单体和聚合物种。

2. 载体材料：氧化铝一直是重要的载体，但研究也关注了其他氧化物。Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂已商业化使用多年。

3. 反应机理：开展了工作以了解烷烃如何在催化剂表面吸附和反应。

4. 失活和再生：一个主要焦点是了解催化剂失活，这主要是由于反应过程中碳沉积造成的。研究了如何通过氧化处理再生失活的催化剂。

5. 新型催化剂：开发新型催化剂，如具有高比表面积的介孔铬-氧化铝催化剂。

主要工业应用包括乙烷、丙烷和异丁烷的脱氢，以满足不断增长的轻烯烃需求。这些催化剂的演变涉及优化铬物种、载体相互作用和稳定性，以提高它们在脱氢过程中的工业性能。
