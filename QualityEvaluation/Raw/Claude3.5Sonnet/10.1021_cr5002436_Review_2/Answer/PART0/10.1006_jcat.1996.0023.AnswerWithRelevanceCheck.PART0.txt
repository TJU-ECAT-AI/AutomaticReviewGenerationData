          [1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene"

[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, but also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications"

[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst; a dopant, consisting of an alkali metal, is also added to promote activity and/or selectivity to the olefin."

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports. Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

[5] "The effects of the type of support and of some preparation parameters (calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading) on the nature of the chromium species have been the object of most of these investigations."

[6] "Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts find industrial application for different reactions, such as polymerization of ethylene and dehydrogenation of paraffins. In addition, they are known to be active in the selective oxidation of alcohols."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial focus: They were first widely used for n-butane dehydrogenation to produce butenes and butadiene.

2. Recent developments: Renewed interest has emerged due to increased demand for isobutene in MTBE synthesis and as an alternative to steam cracking for light olefin production.

3. Industrial applications: 
   - Several processes (Catofin, Linde, Snamprogetti Yarsintez) use supported chromium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.
   - Other applications include ethylene polymerization, paraffin dehydrogenation, and selective oxidation of alcohols.

4. Research focus areas:
   a) Characterization of chromium oxide on various supports using techniques such as UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   b) Structure and active sites investigation
   c) Support materials optimization and effects on chromium species
   d) Influence of preparation parameters (e.g., calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading)
   e) Use of promoters (e.g., alkali metals as dopants)
   f) Reaction mechanisms studies (implied, not explicitly mentioned)

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by industrial needs and advances in characterization techniques, leading to improved understanding of their structure-activity relationships and optimization for various dehydrogenation processes.

          铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年发现以来已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 初始关注点：它们最初被广泛用于正丁烷脱氢生产丁烯和丁二烯。

2. 近期发展：由于异丁烯在MTBE合成中需求的增加，以及作为蒸汽裂解生产轻质烯烃的替代方案，人们对这类催化剂产生了新的兴趣。

3. 工业应用：
   - 几种工艺（Catofin、Linde、Snamprogetti Yarsintez）使用负载型铬氧化物催化剂进行异丁烷脱氢。
   - 其他应用包括乙烯聚合、烷烃脱氢和醇的选择性氧化。

4. 研究重点领域：
   a) 使用紫外-可见漫反射光谱、激光拉曼光谱和X射线光电子能谱等技术对各种载体上的铬氧化物进行表征。
   b) 结构和活性位点研究
   c) 载体材料优化及其对铬物种的影响
