          [1] "The activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been known for many decades [1,2]."

[2] "Gamma-alumina is widely employed since it is a refractory high surface area material, but it presents the undesired feature of catalyzing side reactions (cracking and coking), leading to catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The acidic sites responsible for the side reactions can be poisoned with alkali ions (very often potassium) with satisfactory results."

[4] "Indeed, zirconia has recently received increasing attention in connection with its possible use as a catalyst support [6]."

[5] "The present paper deals with the results concerning catalysts with low chromium loading (up to 0.8 wt.%, corresponding to a surface concentration of 1.8 at. nm-2) in which all chromium ions are actually accessible to the reactant."

[6] "With this background, a study of propane dehydrogenation has been undertaken with the aim of investigating: (i) the parameters influencing the activity and the deactivation, (ii) the regeneration of the deactivated catalyst, and (iii) the nature of the active sites."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Industrial applications: They have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation for decades.

2. Support materials: Initially, gamma-alumina was commonly used as a support due to its high surface area and refractory properties. However, it catalyzes undesirable side reactions like cracking and coking. More recently, zirconia has gained attention as a potential support material.

3. Promoters: Alkali ions, particularly potassium, have been used to poison acidic sites on the support, reducing side reactions and improving catalyst performance.

4. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active sites and optimizing catalyst structure. Recent studies have examined catalysts with low chromium loading (up to 0.8 wt%) where all chromium ions are accessible to reactants.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms of both the desired dehydrogenation reactions and undesired side reactions to improve catalyst design.

6. Deactivation and regeneration: Studies have investigated factors affecting catalyst deactivation and methods for regenerating spent catalysts.

Key research focus areas have included developing supports with improved properties, understanding the role of promoters, optimizing chromium loading and dispersion, elucidating reaction mechanisms, and improving catalyst stability and regeneration to enhance overall performance and longevity.

          自1933年发现以来，用于脱氢过程的氧化铬基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 工业应用：几十年来，它们被广泛用于烷烃脱氢。

2. 载体材料：最初，伽马氧化铝因其高比表面积和耐火性能而被普遍用作载体。然而，它会催化不希望的副反应，如裂解和结焦。最近，氧化锆作为潜在的载体材料引起了关注。

3. 助剂：碱金属离子，特别是钾，被用来毒化载体上的酸性位点，减少副反应并提高催化剂性能。

4. 活性位点和结构：研究重点集中在理解活性位点的性质和优化催化剂结构上。最近的研究考察了低铬负载（最高0.8 wt%）的催化剂，其中所有铬离子都能被反应物接触到。

5. 反应机理：为了改进催化剂设计，人们努力理解所需脱氢反应和不希望的副反应的机理。

6. 失活和再生：研究了影响催化剂失活的因素以及再生失活催化剂的方法。

主要研究重点领域包括开发具有改进性能的载体、理解助剂的作用、优化铬的负载量和分散度、阐明反应机理，以及改善催化剂的稳定性和再生能力，以提高整体性能和寿命。
