          [1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by Süd-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."

[6] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."

[7] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the former Soviet Union. This process avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor configuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries [6]."

[8] "In addition, two Catofin units were built for the production of propylene, but it is understood that only one is operational with a nameplate dehydrogenation capacity of about 250,000 MTA propylene, but usually operating only on a seasonal basis."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial development: Chromia-alumina catalysts were first developed and commercialized for butane dehydrogenation in Germany, the United States, and England in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

2. Early industrial applications: The first UOP-designed plant using chromia-alumina catalysts began operation in England in 1940, followed by two more units in 1941.

3. Process expansion: In the late 1980s, Houdry extended the application of chromia-alumina catalysts to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation, introducing the Catofin process.

4. Industrial scale-up: By 2000, eight Catofin units were in operation for isobutylene production, with a total capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum. Two additional units were built for propylene production, with one operational at 250,000 MTA capacity.

5. Alternative processes: In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process using a fluidized bed reactor was developed in the Soviet Union.

6. Technology ownership: The Catofin process technology is now owned by Süd-Chemie and licensed by ABB Lummus.

Key industrial applications include the production of butenes, propylene, and isobutylene. Research focus areas have included:

1. Reactor design: Fixed shallow beds, fluidized beds, and various reactor shapes (spherical, vertical cylinder, horizontal cylinder).
2. Process improvements: Cyclic operation principles and continuous regeneration.
3. Support materials: Primarily alumina.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, research on catalyst structure, active sites, promoters, and reaction mechanisms has likely been ongoing to further improve these catalysts and processes.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变：

1. 初期开发：铬-氧化铝催化剂最初于20世纪30年代末和40年代初在德国、美国和英国开发并商业化，用于丁烷脱氢。

2. 早期工业应用：第一个使用铬-氧化铝催化剂的UOP设计工厂于1940年在英国投产，随后1941年又有两个装置投产。

3. 工艺扩展：20世纪80年代末，Houdry将铬-氧化铝催化剂的应用扩展到丙烷和异丁烷脱氢，推出了Catofin工艺。

4. 工业规模扩大：到2000年，已有8个Catofin装置用于异丁烯生产，总产能约为280万吨/年。另外还建造了两个用于丙烯生产的装置，其中一个运行中，产能为25万吨/年。

5. 替代工艺：1959年，苏联开发了一种使用流化床反应器的替代性铬-氧化铝催化脱氢工艺。

6. 技术所有权：Catofin工艺技术现在由Süd-Chemie拥有，由ABB Lummus授权。

主要工业应用包括生产丁烯、丙烯和异丁烯。研究重点领域包括：

1. 反应器设计：固定浅层床、流化床，以及各种反应器形状（球形、竖直圆筒、卧式圆筒）。
2. 工艺改进：循环操作原理和连续再生。
3. 载体材料：主要是氧化铝。

虽然在给定的文本中没有明确说明，但对催化剂结构、活性位点、助剂和反应机理的研究可能一直在进行，以进一步改进这些催化剂和工艺。
