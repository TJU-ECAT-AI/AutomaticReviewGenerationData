Key industrial applications include the production of butenes, propylene, and isobutylene. Research focus areas have included:

1. Reactor design: Fixed shallow beds, fluidized beds, and various reactor shapes (spherical, vertical cylinder, horizontal cylinder).
2. Process improvements: Cyclic operation principles and continuous regeneration.
3. Support materials: Primarily alumina.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, research on catalyst structure, active sites, promoters, and reaction mechanisms has likely been ongoing to further improve these catalysts and processes.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming widely used for alkane dehydrogenation. Key developments and research focus areas include:

1. Structure and active sites: Studies have examined how the nature of surface chromium species affects catalytic activity. This has been found to depend strongly on the support material and chromium content. Research has focused on understanding chromium speciation, including isolated monomeric and polymeric species.

2. Support materials: Alumina has been an important support, but research has also looked at other oxides. Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts have been used commercially for years.

3. Reaction mechanisms: Work has been done to understand how alkanes adsorb and react on the catalyst surface.

4. Deactivation and regeneration: A major focus has been understanding catalyst deactivation, which occurs mainly due to carbon deposition during the reaction. Research has examined how to regenerate deactivated catalysts through oxidative treatments.

5. Novel catalysts: Development of new catalysts, such as mesoporous chromia-alumina catalysts with high surface area.

Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, and iso-butane to meet the increasing demand for light olefins. The evolution of these catalysts has involved optimizing the chromium species, support interactions, and stability to improve their industrial performance in dehydrogenation processes.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant developments in various areas:

1. Expansion of active species: While chromium remains a primary focus, research has expanded to include other active species like gallium, zinc, iron, vanadium, indium, and manganese for dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

2. Understanding of catalyst structure and active sites: Research has revealed that multiple oxidation states of chromium (3+, 5+, and 6+) coexist on catalyst surfaces, with Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates believed to be the active sites or precursors. The structure of Cr species and their interaction with the support material have become important areas of study.

3. Support materials: There has been a shift towards using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports, which offer 2-4 times larger surface areas than commercial silica gels and have uniform pore structures. This allows for better dispersion of chromium species and improved catalytic performance.

4. Preparation methods and influencing factors: Research has focused on understanding how factors such as the type of Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point) influence catalytic activity.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have explored the role of CO2 in dehydrogenation processes, investigating both oxidative and non-oxidative pathways. CO2-assisted dehydrogenation has been found to yield higher amounts of valuable alkenes compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, particularly propane to propene, which is an important petrochemical used in the production of various polymers and chemical intermediates. The use of CO2 in these processes also contributes to chemical CO2 utilization, addressing environmental concerns.

Research continues to focus on improving catalyst performance, understanding reaction mechanisms, and developing more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Initial focus: They were first widely used for n-butane dehydrogenation to produce butenes and butadiene.

2. Recent developments: Renewed interest has emerged due to increased demand for isobutene in MTBE synthesis and as an alternative to steam cracking for light olefin production.

3. Industrial applications: 
   - Several processes (Catofin, Linde, Snamprogetti Yarsintez) use supported chromium oxide catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation.
   - Other applications include ethylene polymerization, paraffin dehydrogenation, and selective oxidation of alcohols.

4. Research focus areas:
   a) Characterization of chromium oxide on various supports using techniques such as UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, laser Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   b) Structure and active sites investigation
   c) Support materials optimization and effects on chromium species
   d) Influence of preparation parameters (e.g., calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading)
   e) Use of promoters (e.g., alkali metals as dopants)
   f) Reaction mechanisms studies (implied, not explicitly mentioned)

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by industrial needs and advances in characterization techniques, leading to improved understanding of their structure-activity relationships and optimization for various dehydrogenation processes.

Since their discovery in 1933, chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved to become crucial in chemical industries for producing important commodity chemicals. Key industrial applications include:

1. Polymerization: Chromium-on-silica is used as the Philips catalyst, responsible for about one-third of global high-density polyethylene (HDPE) production.

2. Dehydrogenation: Chromium-on-alumina is employed in light paraffin dehydrogenation processes like the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes.

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance in dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Molecular structure: Elucidating the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relationship with catalytic performance.

2. Active sites: Investigating the role of different chromium oxidation states (Cr6+, Cr3+, and Cr2+) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Studying the effects of different support compositions (e.g., silica, alumina, and silica-alumina) on catalyst performance.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Understanding the catalytic action of supported metal oxide catalysts through in situ spectroscopic studies combined with on-line activity/selectivity measurements.

These research efforts have led to a better understanding of the structure-activity relationships in chromium oxide-based catalysts, enabling their optimization for various industrial applications, particularly in dehydrogenation processes.

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery, with decades of research contributing to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the commercial-scale production of propene and i-butene from corresponding paraffins.

Key research focus areas that have contributed to their significance include:

1. Structure and oxidation states: Studies have shown that Cr can exist in 6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+ states, depending on pretreatment, concentration, and support material. At low loadings, chromium is mainly anchored as Cr6+ surface species, while higher loadings also contain Cr3+.

2. Active sites: Recent research concludes that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has been extensively studied as a support, with research showing how chromium interacts with it at different loadings.

4. Preparation methods: Conventionally, catalysts are prepared by impregnation using Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solutions. However, new techniques are being explored to create well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Understanding the role of different chromium species in the dehydrogenation process has been a key focus area, with studies examining the behavior of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species during reactions.

These areas of study have driven improvements in catalyst performance and efficiency, contributing to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.
