[1] "Catalysts based on chromia have received much attention due to their favorable properties in various important processes. Examples are numerous and include catalytic oxidation of organic compounds [13], large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene over Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts [4], potential use of chromia supported catalysts in the processes of chlorinated carbon removal [5], and others."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane [6, 7]."

[3] "Widespread application of chromia supported catalysts and the rich chemistry of chromium compounds laid ground for a steady interest towards the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions [6, 7, 9, 10]."

[4] "However, despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17]."

[5] "There are quite a few approaches to prepare chromia-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes including impregnation, coprecipitation and atomic layer epitaxy. The need to achieve high dispersion dictates the necessity of anchoring chromia species onto the surface of the support."

[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[4] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."

[5] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

[1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]."

[2] "Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support [2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia [5-12]."

[3] "Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium. Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst."

[4] "The overall picture shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is concluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent O2- ion of the support."

[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2·Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."

[5] "There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation states are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. However, the coordination geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polymerization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate."

[6] "Different techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance (ESR), were used."

[7] "The Phillips catalyst is one of the most studied and yet most controversial systems, while the studies of Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2·Al2O3 are more limited."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. 1-9 Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene."

[2] "The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides."

[3] "These characterization studies revealed that under hydrated conditions the molecular structure of the surface chromium oxide species is only determined by the isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC) of the support."

[4] "Upon calcination, dehydrated surface chromium oxide molecular structures are formed by reaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of the support."

[5] "Previous Raman studies concluded that this chromium oxide species is predominantly present as a monochromate species."

[6] "We have demonstrated for the first time by Raman spectroscopy that two types of surface chromium oxide species are present on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species, which is difficult to reduce, and a polymeric species, which is more easily reducible on the same support."

[7] "The objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to study the feasibility of in situ Raman spectroscopy for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions and (2) to probe the reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation."

"Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          
          "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(II) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (1-3), although Cr(III) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."
          
          "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts."
          
          "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiO2, Cr/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."
          
          "The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium supported on silica gel has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, together with kinetic measurements."

[1] "Currently, propylene is primarily produced by the high temperature cracking of hydrocarbons; however, the controlled dehydrogenation of propane provides a useful alternative process [3147]."

[2] "The endothermic dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, currently employed on an industrial scale, utilizes Cr-based catalysts with Al2O3 as a support and alkali metal promoters [32]."

[3] "In studies on various chromium-based catalysts, DeRossi and co-workers found that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited increased activity over similarly prepared Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 materials [4245]."

[4] "Given the reported efficiency of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts, it was of interest to utilize the TMP cothermolysis method for the generation of such materials with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites."

[5] "For Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, it has been shown that coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species are formed under typical propane DH conditions (upon reduction of Cr6+ species), and that these species are active sites [32,45]. Additionally, Cr3+ species in small amorphous clusters have been proposed as active DH sites [32]."

[6] "An important goal in the synthesis of new heterogeneous catalysts is the generation of materials containing well-dispersed catalytic centers within a support matrix."

[7] "Many of the best propane ODH catalysts are based on vanadium [4851], and TMP-derived V/Zr/O catalysts perform at levels among the very best of these [29,30]."

[8] "Use of the TMP-cothermolysis method has resulted in nCrSiZr materials with high surface areas after calcination at temperatures above those required for the propane DH reaction."

[9] "Difficulties in obtaining high surface area and thermally stable zirconia supports were cited as being a large reason for limited use of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts for large-scale propane DH reactions"

[10] "Chromium XANES spectra of 2.5CrSiAl and 5CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K are similar to that for 10CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K, in that they exhibit significant amounts of tetrahedral Cr6+ species (Fig. 4)."

[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale."

[3] "dd transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm."

[4] "Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive."

[5] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts."

[6] "High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[7] "The catalyst consists of 20 wt% Cr (a mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+) and 1 wt% Na on an alumina support."

[8] "Here, we present the design, construction and use of a novel pilot-scale reactor, in which specially developed UV-Vis probes are inserted to characterize a catalyst material under reaction conditions."

[9] "The showcase example is the dehydrogenation of propane into propylene over an industrial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, shaped in the form of 3 mm-sized catalyst bodies."

[1] "The chromium oxide-aluminum oxide system has been known for many years to catalyze dehydrogenation. It has been used in commercial processes."

[2] "Usual chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, prepared either by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, are treated at high temperatures, currently 600C or above."

[3] "Numerous investigations have been devoted to chromia-containing catalysts (4). But few fundamental studies of the catalytic properties of Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions have been performed (5-8), probably because it is very difficult to produce these solutions in a sufficiently dispersed form for measurable action."

[4] "The mechanism of dehydrogenation and deactivation is discussed in terms of the chromium ions of various charges present in the solid solutions. It is concluded that Cr2+ ions are probably responsible for the initial high activity; this activity is very rapidly inhibited. The useful dehydrogenating centers are the Cr3+ ions."

[5] "Some authors (21, 24) are of the opinion that the catalytic process is related to the presence of defects created in the lattice by the reduction of Cr6+ ions at the beginning of the dehydrogenation cycle."

[6] "Other authors, like Slovetskaya and Rubinshtein (33) and Slovetskaya et al. (35) ascribe the catalytic activity to the Cr2+ ions."

[7] "Several authors consider that the incompletely coordinated Cr3+ ions are the true active centers"

[8] "It thus appears that the tendency of superficial oxygen to leave the surface of Cr2O3 decreases in the solid solutions."

[9] "Besides Cr3+, which is certainly active, Cr2+ probably contributes to the overall activity. Both are active in the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. CrOx/Al2O3 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and i-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2 in ethene polymerisation."

[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods"

[3] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr3+, also some non-redox Cr3+ could be responsible for the catalytic activity."

[5] "Irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase have been proposed as potential causes for the long-term deactivation of the CrOx catalysts."

[6] "Two processes have been postulated [6] as possible explanations for this: 1) some of the chromium sites could migrate into the alumina lattice becoming inactive, or 2) deactivation could occur due to irreversible clustering of the active chromium species."

"The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great importance as an effective route for the production of propene and other light alkenes (14). Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially used for this process, and much recent research has been devoted to elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide (524)."

"Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."

"Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1)."

"When used under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solutions of chromiaalumina (1, 3)."

[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

          [2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

          [3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

          [4] "A program has been started to study the supported chromium oxide system as a function of surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, and presence of moisture"

[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

[4] "Since there is no general agreement about the effect of reducing agent on the initial activity, the subject was studied further in this work using a FTIR gas analyzer."

[1] "Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years [10]. Currently, this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation [11]."

[2] "It is well known that the nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content and calcination treatment [1,2,1215]."

[3] "Besides, the researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability. It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation [2,6,1622]."

[4] "Many preparation methods for the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts described in the literatures, such as incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation method and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) strategy, have been explored over the alkanes dehydrogenation [2,7,15,23,24]."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K"

[5] "A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent [9] has the following make-up, ~20% Cr, ~1% Zr as ZrO2, ~0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at ~0.75%."

[6] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) [10-12], UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) [11, 12], Raman spectroscopy [10, 11, 14-17], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [11, 12, 18], electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [12, 19], infrared spectroscopy [10, 20] and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) [16, 21]."

[7] "Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V) and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as-prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species."

[8] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers [28]. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence [12, 24, 25, 29]. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair [18]."

[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium : Cr203 + H2 2 CrO + H2O"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."

[4] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."

[5] "It is clearly possible, as seen from the trend of the results in fig- 3, that at the lowest chromium concentrations essentially all of the chromium ions have been reduced to Cr2+. On the other hand, at higher chromia concentrations bulk chromia (P-phase) is formed on the surface where the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+ may be affected by a stabilizing influence exerted by the alumina lattice."

[6] "The oxidation, reduction and water treatments of chromia-alumina catalysts of different chromia concentrations have been investigated by e.s.r. and the surface composition, with respect to Cr2+ and Cr3+, was evaluated."

[7] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."

[8] "The rate of ethane dehydrogenation was followed by measuring the pressure change in a constant volume reaction vessel. The product, ethylene, was identified by mass analysis using an A.E.I. type MSlO mass spectrometer."

[9] "Preliminary studies showed that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation depends on the initial pressure of ethane which suggested first-order kinetics."

[10] "The results depicted in fig. 4 show that the rate of dehydrogenation proceeds much faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions."

[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[2] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

[3] "The CATOFIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane."

[4] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail [7]."

[5] "To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%."

[1] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [15]."

[2] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have been used industrially in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by impregnation of a chromium compound, usually nitrate, and resulting catalysts with chromium loading in the range of 313 wt.% Cr [3]."

[3] "Several factors have influence in the catalytic activity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state, the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium species with the support. These variations depend on the metallic content, the precursor compound of chromium, the support characteristics and calcination conditions [2,3]."

[4] "The literature reports that the active site in the dehydrogenation is the Cr3+ species coordinated to the hydroxyls, coordinativelly unsaturated [1012]."

[5] "Chromium supported catalysts are used in the ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutane dehydrogenations to the corresponding olefins, in the temperature range of 623773 K and atmospheric pressure, with high selectivity to alkenes [19]."

[1] "The activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been known for many decades [1,2]."

[2] "Gamma-alumina is widely employed since it is a refractory high surface area material, but it presents the undesired feature of catalyzing side reactions (cracking and coking), leading to catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The acidic sites responsible for the side reactions can be poisoned with alkali ions (very often potassium) with satisfactory results."

[4] "Indeed, zirconia has recently received increasing attention in connection with its possible use as a catalyst support [6]."

[5] "The present paper deals with the results concerning catalysts with low chromium loading (up to 0.8 wt.%, corresponding to a surface concentration of 1.8 at. nm-2) in which all chromium ions are actually accessible to the reactant."

[6] "With this background, a study of propane dehydrogenation has been undertaken with the aim of investigating: (i) the parameters influencing the activity and the deactivation, (ii) the regeneration of the deactivated catalyst, and (iii) the nature of the active sites."

[1] "High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have shown to be very active and selective in this reaction and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all over the world"

[2] "The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market, the related use of this catalytic system as well as the catalyst complexity have initiated many research activities in both academia and chemical industries."

[3] "In the last decade a significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long-term deactivation routes"

[4] "Surprisingly, not much studies have been devoted to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system."

[5] "In all these catalyst systems, a CrO moiety with chromium in its tri- or divalent state is envisaged as the active site for CH activation."

[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."

[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."

[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques."

[5] "Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, as well as a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been all proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions."

[6] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."

[7] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."

[8] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[9] "The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions."

No relevant quotes are provided in the given answers.

[1] "The activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation alkanes have been known for many decades, 2,3 and a recent investigation of the catalytic activity of CrOx/ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been reported."

[2] "This work concluded that Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."

[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using chromium oxide supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) has been widely studied."

[4] "Very recently, it has been shown that chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate displays rather high ethylene selectivities 24,25 in the ODH of ethane."

[5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has great industrial importance because it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes for the polymerization and other organic syntheses from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[6] "Metals deposited on different supports and supported chromium oxide have been used as heterogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[1] "Up to the present supported chromia catalysts have been used for this purpose, 1-3 but this nonoxidative reaction presents some disadvantages."

          [2] "An alternative method for dehydrogenation is the reaction of alkane with oxygen, that is, to carry out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH). This provides great advantages over a nonoxidative process due to engineering and economic considerations."

          [3] "The goal of this work is to study the performance of two sets of catalysts based on chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, prepared by two colloidal methods, in the dehydrogenation of propane in inert and oxidative conditions."

          [4] "Chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate materials show activity values for the ODH of propane similar to or higher than other catalysts reported in the literature, but working at lower temperatures."

[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor. In contrast to this, the chromia/alumina catalysts of the present work were prepared by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) with the use of sequential saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "The work of Haukka et al. (25) has shown that the adsorption of Cr(acac)3 on silica occurs selectively through reaction with OH groups. Probably OH groups behave as bonding sites on alumina as well, at least during the first sequences of Cr(acac)3."

[1] "Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [13], oxidation of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [35] and to a lesser degree in many other processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]."

[2] "Recently, it has been found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane [811], propane [1221], isobutane [22], and ethylbenzene [23,24]."

[3] "Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+ [8,10,13], Cr5+/Cr3+ [9], and Cr3+/Cr2+ [18,23,24] have been proposed."

[4] "Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts. Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 [12,13,15,1720,22,23]."

[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."

[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [39], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10]"

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant"

[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [1525]."

[1] "Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2]. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [3,4]."

[2] "The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5,8]."

[3] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes from 2 to 10 nm as well as a high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) [26], and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

[6] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [511] or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [12,13]."

[7] "Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane [1618], propane [1924], and isobutane [25] over supported chromium oxide."

[1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[3] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane [31, 40]."

[4] "Indeed, the reduction of the Cr6+ to Cr3+ was demonstrated by the above TPR analysis. At the same time, the reduced Cr3+ species was also reoxygenated to Cr6+ species by CO2 which will be proven by the following TPR, as a result, the high dehydrogenation activity Cr6+ species can be obtained by the Cr redox cycle during the ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2."

[5] "Ge et al. [32] had used ESR and UV-DRS to probe the active site for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst, and found that species with high oxidation state (Cr5+ or Cr6+) are important for the reaction."

[6] "Mimura et al. [39] used FTIR and XAFS to probe the active species and role of CO2 for the ODH of ethane over Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. They found that there existed a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr3+ species in which a Cr6+ species was reduced to Cr3+ by ethane treatment, and CO2 treatment led to reoxidation to Cr6+ species."

[1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

          [2] "chromium-based catalysts employed in industrial plants possess higher concentrations of chromium, generally supported on alumina with alkali oxides as promoters [7]. The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

          [3] "Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading."

          [4] "Several Cr species were identied, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR g-signal), CrIII (ESR d-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters (ESR b-signal) and a-chromia."

          [5] "Previous work on dilute ZC, AC and SC systems [13] indicated that: (i) the catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation was proportional to the Cr content; (ii) the dehydrogenation rate per Cr atom (i.e. the turnover frequency per Cr atom) was substantially higher for ZC than either AC or SC;"

[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by Süd-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."

[6] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."

[7] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the former Soviet Union. This process avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor configuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries [6]."

[8] "In addition, two Catofin units were built for the production of propylene, but it is understood that only one is operational with a nameplate dehydrogenation capacity of about 250,000 MTA propylene, but usually operating only on a seasonal basis."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation [1-3]. Among the various supported chromia materials, a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been used on a commercial scale for years [1]."

[2] "The catalytic activity is related to the nature of surface chromium, whose speciation is strongly dependent on the nature of oxide support and the chromium content [4,5]."

[3] "Depending on the loading, surface chromium may be present as isolated monomeric species, polymeric species or a combination thereof."

[4] "Previous studies reported that supported chromia catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation reaction, most likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous material [10,11]."

[5] "The present contribution deals with light hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over novel chromia-alumina catalysts with well-developed mesoporosity and relatively high surface area."

[6] "Nowadays, dehydrogenation of ethane, propane and iso-butane has become an important route to meet the increasing demand for light olefins."

[1] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point  IEP) [2931]."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[4] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

[5] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is considered to be one of the alternative methods of obtaining valuable alkenes with a higher yield than in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation variation, as well as a method of chemical CO2 utilization."

[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene"

[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, but also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications"

[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst; a dopant, consisting of an alkali metal, is also added to promote activity and/or selectivity to the olefin."

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports. Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

[5] "The effects of the type of support and of some preparation parameters (calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading) on the nature of the chromium species have been the object of most of these investigations."

[6] "Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts find industrial application for different reactions, such as polymerization of ethylene and dehydrogenation of paraffins. In addition, they are known to be active in the selective oxidation of alcohols."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in chemical industries for the production of important commodity chemicals. Indeed, several large volume industrial processes rely on supported chromium oxides as a heterogeneous catalyst."

[2] "Chromium-on-silica is the famous Philips polymerization catalyst, responsible for about one third of the world production of high density polyethylene (HDPE)."

[3] "Similarly, chromium-on-alumina is used as a light paraffin dehydrogenation catalyst employed in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes."

[4] "The industrial importance of supported chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research towards the elucidation of the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relation with catalytic performances."

[5] "The goal of this study is then to address the role of Crn (with n = 6, 3 and 2) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."

[4] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[5] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation. New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

[1] "Catalysts based on chromia have received much attention due to their favorable properties in various important processes. Examples are numerous and include catalytic oxidation of organic compounds [13], large-scale polymerization of ethylene into polyethylene over Phillips CrOx/SiO2 catalysts [4], potential use of chromia supported catalysts in the processes of chlorinated carbon removal [5], and others."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is an important industrial process for producing propylene from propane [6, 7]."

[3] "Widespread application of chromia supported catalysts and the rich chemistry of chromium compounds laid ground for a steady interest towards the structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of active sites and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions [6, 7, 9, 10]."

[4] "However, despite extensive studies of non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the oxidation state of active chromium species remains under debate with some early studies favoring Cr2+ species [11] and more recent work advocating the importance of Cr3+ sites [1215] or both [16, 17]."

[5] "There are quite a few approaches to prepare chromia-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes including impregnation, coprecipitation and atomic layer epitaxy. The need to achieve high dispersion dictates the necessity of anchoring chromia species onto the surface of the support."

[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[4] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."

[5] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

[1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]."

[2] "Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support [2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia [5-12]."

[3] "Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium. Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst."

[4] "The overall picture shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is concluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent O2- ion of the support."

[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2·Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."

[5] "There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation states are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. However, the coordination geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polymerization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate."

[6] "Different techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance (ESR), were used."

[7] "The Phillips catalyst is one of the most studied and yet most controversial systems, while the studies of Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2·Al2O3 are more limited."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. 1-9 Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene."

[2] "The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides."

[3] "These characterization studies revealed that under hydrated conditions the molecular structure of the surface chromium oxide species is only determined by the isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC) of the support."

[4] "Upon calcination, dehydrated surface chromium oxide molecular structures are formed by reaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of the support."

[5] "Previous Raman studies concluded that this chromium oxide species is predominantly present as a monochromate species."

[6] "We have demonstrated for the first time by Raman spectroscopy that two types of surface chromium oxide species are present on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species, which is difficult to reduce, and a polymeric species, which is more easily reducible on the same support."

[7] "The objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to study the feasibility of in situ Raman spectroscopy for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions and (2) to probe the reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation."

"Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are known to be active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes."
          
          "Numerous attempts have been made to identify the active site. Chromium(II) appears to be the oxidation state favored by several investigators (1-3), although Cr(III) has also been proposed (2, 4-6)."
          
          "Low nuclearity A-type chromium(II) ions are believed to be the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation on Cr/SiO2 catalysts."
          
          "Turnover frequencies, based on the calculated number of surface chromium atoms, were similar for Cr/SiO2, Cr/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3, but a CrY zeolite was essentially inactive since chromium ions remain in the +3 oxidation state."
          
          "The nature of the active sites for ethane dehydrogenation over chromium supported on silica gel has been studied by infrared spectroscopy, together with kinetic measurements."

[1] "Currently, propylene is primarily produced by the high temperature cracking of hydrocarbons; however, the controlled dehydrogenation of propane provides a useful alternative process [3147]."

[2] "The endothermic dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, currently employed on an industrial scale, utilizes Cr-based catalysts with Al2O3 as a support and alkali metal promoters [32]."

[3] "In studies on various chromium-based catalysts, DeRossi and co-workers found that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited increased activity over similarly prepared Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 materials [4245]."

[4] "Given the reported efficiency of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts, it was of interest to utilize the TMP cothermolysis method for the generation of such materials with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites."

[5] "For Cr/Al2O3 catalysts, it has been shown that coordinatively unsaturated and isolated Cr3+ species are formed under typical propane DH conditions (upon reduction of Cr6+ species), and that these species are active sites [32,45]. Additionally, Cr3+ species in small amorphous clusters have been proposed as active DH sites [32]."

[6] "An important goal in the synthesis of new heterogeneous catalysts is the generation of materials containing well-dispersed catalytic centers within a support matrix."

[7] "Many of the best propane ODH catalysts are based on vanadium [4851], and TMP-derived V/Zr/O catalysts perform at levels among the very best of these [29,30]."

[8] "Use of the TMP-cothermolysis method has resulted in nCrSiZr materials with high surface areas after calcination at temperatures above those required for the propane DH reaction."

[9] "Difficulties in obtaining high surface area and thermally stable zirconia supports were cited as being a large reason for limited use of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts for large-scale propane DH reactions"

[10] "Chromium XANES spectra of 2.5CrSiAl and 5CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K are similar to that for 10CrSiAl after calcination at 773 K, in that they exhibit significant amounts of tetrahedral Cr6+ species (Fig. 4)."

[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale."

[3] "dd transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm."

[4] "Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive."

[5] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts."

[6] "High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[7] "The catalyst consists of 20 wt% Cr (a mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+) and 1 wt% Na on an alumina support."

[8] "Here, we present the design, construction and use of a novel pilot-scale reactor, in which specially developed UV-Vis probes are inserted to characterize a catalyst material under reaction conditions."

[9] "The showcase example is the dehydrogenation of propane into propylene over an industrial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, shaped in the form of 3 mm-sized catalyst bodies."

[1] "The chromium oxide-aluminum oxide system has been known for many years to catalyze dehydrogenation. It has been used in commercial processes."

[2] "Usual chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, prepared either by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, are treated at high temperatures, currently 600C or above."

[3] "Numerous investigations have been devoted to chromia-containing catalysts (4). But few fundamental studies of the catalytic properties of Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions have been performed (5-8), probably because it is very difficult to produce these solutions in a sufficiently dispersed form for measurable action."

[4] "The mechanism of dehydrogenation and deactivation is discussed in terms of the chromium ions of various charges present in the solid solutions. It is concluded that Cr2+ ions are probably responsible for the initial high activity; this activity is very rapidly inhibited. The useful dehydrogenating centers are the Cr3+ ions."

[5] "Some authors (21, 24) are of the opinion that the catalytic process is related to the presence of defects created in the lattice by the reduction of Cr6+ ions at the beginning of the dehydrogenation cycle."

[6] "Other authors, like Slovetskaya and Rubinshtein (33) and Slovetskaya et al. (35) ascribe the catalytic activity to the Cr2+ ions."

[7] "Several authors consider that the incompletely coordinated Cr3+ ions are the true active centers"

[8] "It thus appears that the tendency of superficial oxygen to leave the surface of Cr2O3 decreases in the solid solutions."

[9] "Besides Cr3+, which is certainly active, Cr2+ probably contributes to the overall activity. Both are active in the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are widely used in various industrial processes. CrOx/Al2O3 is effective in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and i-butane, and the Phillips catalyst CrOx/SiO2 in ethene polymerisation."

[2] "Because of their industrial importance, these catalysts have been extensively studied with different characterisation methods"

[3] "However, there are still unanswered questions related to the structure of the catalyst under dehydrogenation conditions and thus to the nature of the catalytic site(s), the reaction mechanism and the catalyst deactivation."

[4] "It has been suggested [4,7] that in addition to the redox Cr3+, also some non-redox Cr3+ could be responsible for the catalytic activity."

[5] "Irreversible alterations in the structure of the active phase have been proposed as potential causes for the long-term deactivation of the CrOx catalysts."

[6] "Two processes have been postulated [6] as possible explanations for this: 1) some of the chromium sites could migrate into the alumina lattice becoming inactive, or 2) deactivation could occur due to irreversible clustering of the active chromium species."

"The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great importance as an effective route for the production of propene and other light alkenes (14). Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially used for this process, and much recent research has been devoted to elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide (524)."

"Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."

"Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1)."

"When used under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solutions of chromiaalumina (1, 3)."

[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

          [2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

          [3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

          [4] "A program has been started to study the supported chromium oxide system as a function of surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, and presence of moisture"

[1] "Light olefins will be of growing importance in the production of components for reformulated gasoline and city diesel. One way to produce these light olefins is in dehydrogenation processes using catalysts based on chromia."

[2] "The characterization of supported chromia catalysts has revealed that Cr may exist on the surface in different oxidation state (6+, 5+, 3+, or 2+) depending on the pretreatment, Cr content, and nature of the support (3, 4)."

[3] "Recently, the dehydrogenation activity of chromia/alumina or chromia/zirconia catalysts with 0.042.55 wt% Cr has been attributed to coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species (57), although some earlier studies where the Cr content was between 0.1 and 7.3 wt% have suggested the activity of Cr2+ species as well (811)."

[4] "Since there is no general agreement about the effect of reducing agent on the initial activity, the subject was studied further in this work using a FTIR gas analyzer."

[1] "Supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been applied for the isobutane dehydrogenation on a commercial scale for years [10]. Currently, this catalyst system occupies more than half of the world market of the commercial catalysts for paraffin dehydrogenation [11]."

[2] "It is well known that the nature of surface chromia is related to the catalytic activity and selectivity. The speciation of surface chromia is strongly depended on the type of the support, the chromium content and calcination treatment [1,2,1215]."

[3] "Besides, the researchers have been devoted to improving the catalytic dehydrogenation activity and selectivity as well as the catalyst stability. It has been reported that the addition of alkali metal, such as potassium, to the oxide catalyst system usually promotes the catalytic selectivity of olefins and improves the resistance of the catalyst to deactivation [2,6,1622]."

[4] "Many preparation methods for the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts described in the literatures, such as incipient wetness impregnation, atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), co-precipitation method and evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) strategy, have been explored over the alkanes dehydrogenation [2,7,15,23,24]."

[1] "The dehydrogenation of light alkanes over chromia systems has been known as a catalytic process since the early 1930s"

[2] "Commercial processes based on chromia catalysts have been operational for over 60 years."

[3] "During the Second World War chromia/alumina catalysts were used for the dehydrogenation of butane to give butenes, which were then dimerized and hydrogenated to produce high-octane aviation fuel."

[4] "Houdry made a significant process development by using a less than atmospheric pressure system, a highly innovative move in an industry where high pressure is the norm. In this way it was possible to achieve a higher per-pass conversion and, indeed, typical operating conditions for current commercial reactors are 0.3-0.5 atm and 823-923 K"

[5] "A catalyst formulation taken from a recent patent [9] has the following make-up, ~20% Cr, ~1% Zr as ZrO2, ~0.75% Mg as MgO, supported on alumina with an alkali metal oxide promoter such as Na2O at ~0.75%."

[6] "A wide range of techniques has been used on both fresh and used catalysts to characterize the nature of the oxide surface, for example X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) [10-12], UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) [11, 12], Raman spectroscopy [10, 11, 14-17], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [11, 12, 18], electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [12, 19], infrared spectroscopy [10, 20] and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) [16, 21]."

[7] "Chromium can exist in the (II), (III), (V) and (VI) oxidation states; however, in an as-prepared catalyst the (III) and (VI) oxidation states are the predominant species."

[8] "The active species was initially suggested to be Cr(II) by Sachtler and coworkers [28]. In more recent studies, Cr(III) as the active species has gained prominence [12, 24, 25, 29]. However, it has not been possible to definitively state that Cr(III) is the active site. Other groups have suggested a Cr(II)/Cr(III) pair [18]."

[1] "One of the most important salient features of the surface chemistry of chromia-alumina is the ability of chromium ions to undergo oxidation-reduction reactions."

[2] "It has been suggested that the surface chromium ions are either Cr2+ or Cr3+ depending on the equilibrium : Cr203 + H2 2 CrO + H2O"

[3] "Preliminary kinetic studies show that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation is higher on Cr2+ than on Cr3+ sites."

[4] "The extent of reduction to Cr2+ depends on the concentrations of chromia present on the surface."

[5] "It is clearly possible, as seen from the trend of the results in fig- 3, that at the lowest chromium concentrations essentially all of the chromium ions have been reduced to Cr2+. On the other hand, at higher chromia concentrations bulk chromia (P-phase) is formed on the surface where the degree and ease of reduction to Cr2+ may be affected by a stabilizing influence exerted by the alumina lattice."

[6] "The oxidation, reduction and water treatments of chromia-alumina catalysts of different chromia concentrations have been investigated by e.s.r. and the surface composition, with respect to Cr2+ and Cr3+, was evaluated."

[7] "Preliminary kinetic results of ethane dehydrogenation on these catalysts have also been reported."

[8] "The rate of ethane dehydrogenation was followed by measuring the pressure change in a constant volume reaction vessel. The product, ethylene, was identified by mass analysis using an A.E.I. type MSlO mass spectrometer."

[9] "Preliminary studies showed that the rate of ethane dehydrogenation depends on the initial pressure of ethane which suggested first-order kinetics."

[10] "The results depicted in fig. 4 show that the rate of dehydrogenation proceeds much faster on catalysts containing Cr2+ ions."

[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[2] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

[3] "The CATOFIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane."

[4] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail [7]."

[5] "To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%."

[1] "Chromium catalysts supported on silica and on alumina have industrial application in ethylene polymerization and dehydrogenation reactions [15]."

[2] "Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have been used industrially in dehydrogenation reactions. These catalysts are prepared by impregnation of a chromium compound, usually nitrate, and resulting catalysts with chromium loading in the range of 313 wt.% Cr [3]."

[3] "Several factors have influence in the catalytic activity of the chromium catalysts, as the oxidation state, the structure (amorphous or crystalline, chromates or dichromates) and the interaction of the chromium species with the support. These variations depend on the metallic content, the precursor compound of chromium, the support characteristics and calcination conditions [2,3]."

[4] "The literature reports that the active site in the dehydrogenation is the Cr3+ species coordinated to the hydroxyls, coordinativelly unsaturated [1012]."

[5] "Chromium supported catalysts are used in the ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutane dehydrogenations to the corresponding olefins, in the temperature range of 623773 K and atmospheric pressure, with high selectivity to alkenes [19]."

[1] "The activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been known for many decades [1,2]."

[2] "Gamma-alumina is widely employed since it is a refractory high surface area material, but it presents the undesired feature of catalyzing side reactions (cracking and coking), leading to catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The acidic sites responsible for the side reactions can be poisoned with alkali ions (very often potassium) with satisfactory results."

[4] "Indeed, zirconia has recently received increasing attention in connection with its possible use as a catalyst support [6]."

[5] "The present paper deals with the results concerning catalysts with low chromium loading (up to 0.8 wt.%, corresponding to a surface concentration of 1.8 at. nm-2) in which all chromium ions are actually accessible to the reactant."

[6] "With this background, a study of propane dehydrogenation has been undertaken with the aim of investigating: (i) the parameters influencing the activity and the deactivation, (ii) the regeneration of the deactivated catalyst, and (iii) the nature of the active sites."

[1] "High-loaded Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have shown to be very active and selective in this reaction and are industrially used at dehydrogenation plants all over the world"

[2] "The increasing demand for propene due to the growing polypropylene market, the related use of this catalytic system as well as the catalyst complexity have initiated many research activities in both academia and chemical industries."

[3] "In the last decade a significant amount of knowledge has been gathered regarding the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides, the nature of the active chromium oxide site and the possible short- and long-term deactivation routes"

[4] "Surprisingly, not much studies have been devoted to the elucidation of the reaction mechanism of this industrially important catalytic system."

[5] "In all these catalyst systems, a CrO moiety with chromium in its tri- or divalent state is envisaged as the active site for CH activation."

[1] "Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933."

[2] "During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels."

[3] "Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied."

[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques."

[5] "Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, as well as a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been all proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions."

[6] "Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated."

[7] "The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated."

[8] "Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[9] "The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions."

No relevant quotes are provided in the given answers.

[1] "The activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation alkanes have been known for many decades, 2,3 and a recent investigation of the catalytic activity of CrOx/ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been reported."

[2] "This work concluded that Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."

[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using chromium oxide supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) has been widely studied."

[4] "Very recently, it has been shown that chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate displays rather high ethylene selectivities 24,25 in the ODH of ethane."

[5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has great industrial importance because it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes for the polymerization and other organic syntheses from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[6] "Metals deposited on different supports and supported chromium oxide have been used as heterogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[1] "Up to the present supported chromia catalysts have been used for this purpose, 1-3 but this nonoxidative reaction presents some disadvantages."

          [2] "An alternative method for dehydrogenation is the reaction of alkane with oxygen, that is, to carry out the catalytic process under oxidative conditions (ODH). This provides great advantages over a nonoxidative process due to engineering and economic considerations."

          [3] "The goal of this work is to study the performance of two sets of catalysts based on chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, prepared by two colloidal methods, in the dehydrogenation of propane in inert and oxidative conditions."

          [4] "Chromia-pillared zirconium phosphate materials show activity values for the ODH of propane similar to or higher than other catalysts reported in the literature, but working at lower temperatures."

[1] "Chromia/alumina catalysts possess high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane (1). The catalysts were studied intensively in the 1950s and 1960s (1) and recent studies show that the interest continues (219)."

[2] "In most of these studies the catalysts have been prepared by impregnation using CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 as precursor. In contrast to this, the chromia/alumina catalysts of the present work were prepared by atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) with the use of sequential saturating reactions of Cr(acac)3 vapor and air."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, the chromium is anchored on the alumina surface as Cr6+ (e.g., 3, 8, 12, 19, 35). For higher loadings, opinions about the valence state distribution of the chromia are divided, probably because samples are not always prepared in the same way and possibly also because different characterization techniques are employed in the determination of oxidation states."

[4] "The measured increase in initial activity with chromium loading is in agreement with the findings of De Rossi et al. (13) and Gorritz et al. (18) in studies on the dehydrogenation of propane."

[5] "The work of Haukka et al. (25) has shown that the adsorption of Cr(acac)3 on silica occurs selectively through reaction with OH groups. Probably OH groups behave as bonding sites on alumina as well, at least during the first sequences of Cr(acac)3."

[1] "Supported-chromium oxide materials are widely applied as the catalysts in ethene polymerization (Phillips process) [13], oxidation of various organic compounds [3], hydrogenation-dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [35] and to a lesser degree in many other processes such as: dehydroisomerization of n-butane [6], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia [7]."

[2] "Recently, it has been found that chromium oxide-based catalysts also exhibit excellent catalytic performances in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of various hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, including ethane [811], propane [1221], isobutane [22], and ethylbenzene [23,24]."

[3] "Up to now several cycles between various redox Cr species including Cr6+/Cr3+ [8,10,13], Cr5+/Cr3+ [9], and Cr3+/Cr2+ [18,23,24] have been proposed."

[4] "Therefore, more attention has been recently dedicated to various Cr-containing mesoporous catalysts. Up to now, a number of mesoporous catalysts with different pore architecture prepared by one-pot and post synthesis techniques have been investigated as the potential catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 [12,13,15,1720,22,23]."

[1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."

[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [39], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10]"

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant"

[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [1525]."

[1] "Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2]. Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [3,4]."

[2] "The reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5,8]."

[3] "MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, possesses uniform and well-ordered mesoporous channels with controllable pore sizes from 2 to 10 nm as well as a high surface area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) [26], and thus could be used as a promising catalyst support."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

[6] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [511] or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [12,13]."

[7] "Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of ethane [1618], propane [1924], and isobutane [25] over supported chromium oxide."

[1] "Many research results [1, 3, 4] showed the supported Cr-based catalysts exhibited excellent performances for the ODH reaction."

[2] "Ceria used as a reducible oxide support, can enhance the catalytic activity via metal-support interaction and/or improved dispersion of the active metal component [10, 11]."

[3] "Chromium species with the high oxidation state were the key to higher catalytic activity during the ODH of ethane [31, 40]."

[4] "Indeed, the reduction of the Cr6+ to Cr3+ was demonstrated by the above TPR analysis. At the same time, the reduced Cr3+ species was also reoxygenated to Cr6+ species by CO2 which will be proven by the following TPR, as a result, the high dehydrogenation activity Cr6+ species can be obtained by the Cr redox cycle during the ODH of ethane in the presence of CO2."

[5] "Ge et al. [32] had used ESR and UV-DRS to probe the active site for the ODH of ethane with CO2 over silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst, and found that species with high oxidation state (Cr5+ or Cr6+) are important for the reaction."

[6] "Mimura et al. [39] used FTIR and XAFS to probe the active species and role of CO2 for the ODH of ethane over Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. They found that there existed a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr3+ species in which a Cr6+ species was reduced to Cr3+ by ethane treatment, and CO2 treatment led to reoxidation to Cr6+ species."

[1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

          [2] "chromium-based catalysts employed in industrial plants possess higher concentrations of chromium, generally supported on alumina with alkali oxides as promoters [7]. The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

          [3] "Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading."

          [4] "Several Cr species were identied, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR g-signal), CrIII (ESR d-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters (ESR b-signal) and a-chromia."

          [5] "Previous work on dilute ZC, AC and SC systems [13] indicated that: (i) the catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation was proportional to the Cr content; (ii) the dehydrogenation rate per Cr atom (i.e. the turnover frequency per Cr atom) was substantially higher for ZC than either AC or SC;"

[1] "Dehydrogenation of butanes over a chromia-alumina catalyst was first developed and commercialized at Leuna in Germany and was also independently developed by UOP (then Universal Oil Products) in the United States, together with ICI in England."

[2] "The first UOP-designed plant came on stream in Billingham, England, in 1940 and was soon followed by two other units in Heysham, England, in 1941"

[3] "In the late 1980s, the application of chromia-alumina catalysts was extended by Houdry to the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and isobutane to isobutylene. The new process application called CatofinTM [4,5] operates on the same cyclic principle as in the former Catadiene process."

[4] "As of late 2000, a total of eight Catofin units exist for the production of isobutylene (including two converted older Catadiene units) with an aggregate capacity of about 2.8 million metric tons per annum (MTA) isobutylene."

[5] "The Catofin process technology is currently owned by Süd-Chemie and is offered for license by ABB Lummus."

[6] "In the dehydrogenation process using chromia-alumina catalysts, the catalyst is contained in a fixed shallow bed located inside a reactor that may be either a sphere, a squat vertical cylinder, or a horizontal cylinder."

[7] "In 1959, an alternative chromia-alumina catalytic dehydrogenation process was developed in the former Soviet Union. This process avoided the use of the cyclic operation by using a fluidized bed reactor configuration similar to the fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) process used in refineries [6]."

[8] "In addition, two Catofin units were built for the production of propylene, but it is understood that only one is operational with a nameplate dehydrogenation capacity of about 250,000 MTA propylene, but usually operating only on a seasonal basis."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts have been widely used for alkane dehydrogenation [1-3]. Among the various supported chromia materials, a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been used on a commercial scale for years [1]."

[2] "The catalytic activity is related to the nature of surface chromium, whose speciation is strongly dependent on the nature of oxide support and the chromium content [4,5]."

[3] "Depending on the loading, surface chromium may be present as isolated monomeric species, polymeric species or a combination thereof."

[4] "Previous studies reported that supported chromia catalysts deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation reaction, most likely due to the deposition of carbonaceous material [10,11]."

[5] "The present contribution deals with light hydrocarbon dehydrogenation over novel chromia-alumina catalysts with well-developed mesoporosity and relatively high surface area."

[6] "Nowadays, dehydrogenation of ethane, propane and iso-butane has become an important route to meet the increasing demand for light olefins."

[1] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point  IEP) [2931]."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[4] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

[5] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is considered to be one of the alternative methods of obtaining valuable alkenes with a higher yield than in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation variation, as well as a method of chemical CO2 utilization."

[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene"

[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, but also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications"

[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst; a dopant, consisting of an alkali metal, is also added to promote activity and/or selectivity to the olefin."

[4] "Numerous papers have been published in the literature regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports. Many works have dealt with the use of a specific technique (e.g., UVVis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), laser Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)) to characterize supported-chromium oxide catalysts."

[5] "The effects of the type of support and of some preparation parameters (calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading) on the nature of the chromium species have been the object of most of these investigations."

[6] "Supported chromium oxide-based catalysts find industrial application for different reactions, such as polymerization of ethylene and dehydrogenation of paraffins. In addition, they are known to be active in the selective oxidation of alcohols."

[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in chemical industries for the production of important commodity chemicals. Indeed, several large volume industrial processes rely on supported chromium oxides as a heterogeneous catalyst."

[2] "Chromium-on-silica is the famous Philips polymerization catalyst, responsible for about one third of the world production of high density polyethylene (HDPE)."

[3] "Similarly, chromium-on-alumina is used as a light paraffin dehydrogenation catalyst employed in the Houdry CATOFIN and CATADIENE processes."

[4] "The industrial importance of supported chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research towards the elucidation of the molecular structure of chromium oxides and their relation with catalytic performances."

[5] "The goal of this study is then to address the role of Crn (with n = 6, 3 and 2) in alkane dehydrogenation reactions."

[1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."

[4] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[5] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation. New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."
