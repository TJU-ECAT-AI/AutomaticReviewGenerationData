          [1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[4] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."

[5] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, it does highlight key developments and research focus areas in recent years:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as among the most active, selective, and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

2. Research has focused on understanding the promoting effect of CO2 on these catalysts, with findings suggesting that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

3. The redox mechanism involving Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) has been a key area of study. The concentration of these species depends on factors like chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and support materials.

4. Recent efforts have aimed at achieving high dispersion of chromium oxide species to improve catalyst activity. This has led to increased interest in mesoporous supports, particularly mesoporous sieves.

5. Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have shown excellent catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation both with and without CO2.

6. The development of new support materials, such as SBA-1 mesoporous silica, has been an area of interest due to their unique textural properties and potential for improving catalyst performance.

Key industrial applications and research focus areas include:
- Propane dehydrogenation to produce propene
- Structure optimization of catalysts
- Study of active sites
- Development of support materials
- Understanding of reaction mechanisms

While the document doesn't explicitly mention all industrial applications, it implies that propane dehydrogenation to produce propene is a key application area for chromium oxide-based catalysts.

          虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实突出了近年来的一些关键发展和研究重点领域：

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂已经成为CO2存在下丙烷脱氢反应中最活跃、选择性最高和最稳定的催化剂之一。

2. 研究重点在于了解CO2对这些催化剂的促进作用，研究结果表明CO2在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程中充当氧化剂。

3. 涉及Cr物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+）的氧化还原机制一直是一个重要的研究领域。这些物种的浓度取决于铬负载量、制备条件、前驱体化合物和载体材料等因素。

4. 最近的努力旨在实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散，以提高催化剂活性。这导致了对介孔载体，特别是介孔筛的兴趣增加。

5. 含铬介孔筛在有无CO2存在的情况下都表现出优异的丙烷脱氢催化活性。

6. 新型载体材料的开发，如SBA-1介孔二氧化硅，因其独特的纹理特性和提高催化剂性能的潜力而成为研究的兴趣领域。

主要工业应用和研究重点领域包括：
- 丙烷脱氢生产丙烯
- 催化剂结构优化
- 活性位点研究
- 载体材料开发
- 反应机理理解

虽然文献没有明确提及所有工业应用，但它暗示丙烷脱氢生产丙烯是铬氧化物基催化剂的一个关键应用领域。
