          [1] "The activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation alkanes have been known for many decades, 2,3 and a recent investigation of the catalytic activity of CrOx/ZrO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been reported."

[2] "This work concluded that Cr(III) species are the active sites with a possible role of the oxide ions adjacent to Cr(III)."

[3] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using chromium oxide supported on alumina (CrOx/Al2O3) has been widely studied."

[4] "Very recently, it has been shown that chromium oxide supported on zirconia or incorporated into layered zirconium phosphate displays rather high ethylene selectivities 24,25 in the ODH of ethane."

[5] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has great industrial importance because it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes for the polymerization and other organic syntheses from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[6] "Metals deposited on different supports and supported chromium oxide have been used as heterogeneous catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Industrial applications: They have become important for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to produce alkenes, which are valuable for polymerization and other organic syntheses.

2. Support materials: Research has focused on various supports for chromium oxide, including alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), zirconia (CrOx/ZrO2), and layered zirconium phosphate. These supports help improve catalyst performance and stability.

3. Active sites: Studies have identified Cr(III) species as the primary active sites, with adjacent oxide ions potentially playing a role in the catalytic process.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Research has explored both traditional dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, with recent work showing high ethylene selectivities in ODH of ethane using chromium oxide catalysts.

5. Structure: The development of supported chromium oxide catalysts has allowed for better dispersion and accessibility of active sites, improving overall catalytic performance.

6. Performance improvements: Over time, research has led to catalysts with higher activity and selectivity, capable of operating at temperatures between 723-823 K for propane dehydrogenation.

Key research focus areas have included optimizing support materials, understanding the nature of active sites, improving catalyst selectivity and stability, and developing more efficient supports to enhance the overall performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.
