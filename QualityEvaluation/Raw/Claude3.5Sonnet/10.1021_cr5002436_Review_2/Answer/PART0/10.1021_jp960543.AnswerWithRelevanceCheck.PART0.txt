          [1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. 1-9 Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene."

[2] "The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides."

[3] "These characterization studies revealed that under hydrated conditions the molecular structure of the surface chromium oxide species is only determined by the isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC) of the support."

[4] "Upon calcination, dehydrated surface chromium oxide molecular structures are formed by reaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of the support."

[5] "Previous Raman studies concluded that this chromium oxide species is predominantly present as a monochromate species."

[6] "We have demonstrated for the first time by Raman spectroscopy that two types of surface chromium oxide species are present on inorganic oxides: a monomeric species, which is difficult to reduce, and a polymeric species, which is more easily reducible on the same support."

[7] "The objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to study the feasibility of in situ Raman spectroscopy for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions and (2) to probe the reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation."

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, it does highlight significant developments and current applications:

1. Industrial applications:
   - Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Phillips catalyst) are used for producing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE).
   - Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Molecular structure: Significant research has been conducted to elucidate the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides.
   b) Active sites: Recent studies have identified two types of surface chromium oxide species - a monomeric species that is difficult to reduce, and a polymeric species that is more easily reducible.
   c) Support materials: Various support materials have been studied, including SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and mixed oxide supports. The isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC) of the support determines the molecular structure of surface chromium oxide species under hydrated conditions.
   d) Reaction mechanisms: Research has focused on understanding the redox behavior of supported chromium oxides and their reactivity during processes such as methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation.
   e) Characterization techniques: In situ Raman spectroscopy has been developed as a valuable tool for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions.

These research areas have contributed to a deeper understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts, enabling their optimization for various industrial dehydrogenation processes. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the evolution of these catalysts since 1933 or mention specific promoters, it showcases the ongoing research efforts to better understand and improve chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial applications.

          虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实突出了重要的发展和当前的应用：

1. 工业应用：
   - Cr/SiO2催化剂（菲利普斯催化剂）用于生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE）。
   - Cr/Al2O3催化剂用于丁烷脱氢制丁烯。

2. 研究重点领域：
   a) 分子结构：已经进行了大量研究以阐明负载型铬氧化物的分子结构。
   b) 活性位点：最近的研究已经确定了两种类型的表面铬氧化物物种 - 一种难以还原的单体物种和一种更容易还原的聚合物种。
   c) 载体材料：研究了各种载体材料，包括SiO2、Al2O3、ZrO2、TiO2和混合氧化物载体。在水合条件下，载体的等电点（IEP）或零电荷点的净pH值决定了表面铬氧化物物种的分子结构。
   d) 反应机理：研究重点是了解负载型铬氧化物的氧化还原行为以及它们在甲醇氧化和丁烷脱氢/氧化等过程中的反应性。
   e) 表征技术：原位拉曼光谱已被开发为在催化条件下研究负载型铬氧化物催化剂的有价值工具。

这些研究领域为深入理解铬氧化物基催化剂做出了贡献，使其在各种工业脱氢过程中得到优化。虽然文献没有明确讨论自1933年以来这些催化剂的演变或提到具体的助剂，但它确实展示了持续的研究努力，以更好地理解和改进工业应用中的铬氧化物基催化剂。
