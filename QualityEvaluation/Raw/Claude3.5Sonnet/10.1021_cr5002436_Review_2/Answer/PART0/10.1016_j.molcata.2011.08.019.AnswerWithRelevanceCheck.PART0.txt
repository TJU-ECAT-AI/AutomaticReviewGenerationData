          [1] "So far, different bulk and supported oxide-based materials containing active species, such as: Cr [114], Ga [6,1420], Zn [21], Fe [22], V [10,23,24], In [25,26] and Mn [27,28] have been investigated as catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2."

[2] "The catalytic activity of silica-supported chromium oxide materials (Cr/silica) depends on several factors including oxidation states, the structure of the Cr species and chromiumsilica interaction. These factors are influenced by the type of the Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content and the properties of the silica support (e.g. iso-electric point  IEP) [2931]."

[3] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states, mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates, dominate. These highly dispersed and fully accessible for reactants species are believed to be the active sites or the precursors of the active sites [2,4,3235]."

[4] "Therefore, more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."

[5] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is considered to be one of the alternative methods of obtaining valuable alkenes with a higher yield than in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation variation, as well as a method of chemical CO2 utilization."

          The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has been marked by significant developments in various areas:

1. Expansion of active species: While chromium remains a primary focus, research has expanded to include other active species like gallium, zinc, iron, vanadium, indium, and manganese for dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

2. Understanding of catalyst structure and active sites: Research has revealed that multiple oxidation states of chromium (3+, 5+, and 6+) coexist on catalyst surfaces, with Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates believed to be the active sites or precursors. The structure of Cr species and their interaction with the support material have become important areas of study.

3. Support materials: There has been a shift towards using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports, which offer 2-4 times larger surface areas than commercial silica gels and have uniform pore structures. This allows for better dispersion of chromium species and improved catalytic performance.

4. Preparation methods and influencing factors: Research has focused on understanding how factors such as the type of Cr precursor, preparation conditions (e.g., calcination temperature), Cr content, and properties of the silica support (e.g., iso-electric point) influence catalytic activity.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have explored the role of CO2 in dehydrogenation processes, investigating both oxidative and non-oxidative pathways. CO2-assisted dehydrogenation has been found to yield higher amounts of valuable alkenes compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation.

Key industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, particularly propane to propene, which is an important petrochemical used in the production of various polymers and chemical intermediates. The use of CO2 in these processes also contributes to chemical CO2 utilization, addressing environmental concerns.

Research continues to focus on improving catalyst performance, understanding reaction mechanisms, and developing more efficient and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂的发展在多个领域取得了显著进展：

1. 活性物种的扩展：虽然铬仍然是主要研究对象，但研究已扩展到包括镓、锌、铁、钒、铟和锰等其他活性物种，用于脱氢过程，特别是在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢。

2. 对催化剂结构和活性位点的理解：研究表明，催化剂表面存在多种氧化态的铬（3+、5+和6+），其中以单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐形式存在的Cr6+物种被认为是活性位点或前体。Cr物种的结构及其与载体材料的相互作用已成为重要的研究领域。

3. 载体材料：研究转向使用高比表面积的介孔材料作为载体，这些材料比商业二氧化硅凝胶的表面积大2-4倍，并具有均匀的孔结构。这允许铬物种更好地分散，提高催化性能。

4. 制备方法和影响因素：研究集中在理解Cr前体的类型、制备条件（如焙烧温度）、Cr含量以及硅载体的性质（如等电点）等因素如何影响催化活性。

5. 反应机理：研究探索了CO2在脱氢过程中的作用，调查了氧化和非氧化途径。发现CO2辅助脱氢与非氧化脱氢相比，可以产生更高产率的有价值烯烃。

主要工业应用包括轻烷烃的脱氢，特别是丙烷到丙烯的转化，这是生产各种聚合物和化学中间体的重要石油化工产品。在这些过程中使用CO2还有助于化学CO2利用，解决环境问题。

研究继续关注改善催化剂性能、理解反应机理以及开发更高效和稳定的脱氢过程催化剂。
