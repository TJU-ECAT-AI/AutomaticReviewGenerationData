          [1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

          [2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

          [3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

          [4] "A program has been started to study the supported chromium oxide system as a function of surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, and presence of moisture"

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933, it highlights several key aspects of their development and significance:

          1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become well-known for their high catalytic activity in important industrial processes, including:
             - Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
             - Dehydrocyclization of paraffins
             - Polymerization of olefins

          2. Research has focused on understanding the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide species, as these are now believed to be responsible for the catalytic properties, rather than bulk chromium oxide phases.

          3. Key areas of investigation include:
             - Factors determining chromium oxide surface structures
             - Influence of support materials
             - Effects of surface coverage and calcination temperature
             - Presence of moisture

          4. Characterization techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, and BET surface area measurements have been employed to investigate these catalysts.

          5. While not explicitly stated, the text implies ongoing research into optimizing these catalysts through better understanding of their structure-function relationships.

          The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has involved increased focus on studying the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide phases and the factors that influence these structures. While the document doesn't mention specific promoters, the emphasis on studying various factors affecting catalyst performance suggests this may also be an area of interest.

          虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史，但它强调了它们发展和重要性的几个关键方面：

          1. 铬氧化物基催化剂在几个重要的工业过程中因其高催化活性而闻名，包括：
             - 碳氢化合物的氢化和脱氢
             - 石蜡的脱氢环化
             - 烯烃的聚合

          2. 研究集中在理解表面铬氧化物物种的分子结构，因为现在认为这些结构是催化性能的原因，而不是块状铬氧化物相。

          3. 主要研究领域包括：
             - 决定铬氧化物表面结构的因素
             - 载体材料的影响
             - 表面覆盖率和煅烧温度的影响
             - 水分的存在

          4. 使用拉曼光谱、XPS、XRD和BET比表面积测量等表征技术来研究这些催化剂。

          5. 虽然没有明确说明，但文本暗示正在进行优化这些催化剂的持续研究，通过更好地理解它们的结构-功能关系。

          铬氧化物基催化剂的发展涉及更加关注研究表面铬氧化物相的分子结构及影响这些结构的因素。虽然文献中没有提到具体的助剂，但对影响催化剂性能的各种因素的研究强调表明，这可能也是一个感兴趣的领域。
