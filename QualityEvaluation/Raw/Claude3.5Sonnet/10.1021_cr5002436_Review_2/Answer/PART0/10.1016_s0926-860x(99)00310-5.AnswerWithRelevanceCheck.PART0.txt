          [1] "The dehydrogenation activity of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts has been studied for decades [1] and the catalysts are used on a commercial scale to produce propene and i-butene from the corresponding paraffins [2]."

[2] "There is now a general consensus that the oxidation states 6+, 5+, 3+ and 2+ may be present depending on the pretreatment, Cr concentration, and catalyst support."

[3] "It is generally accepted that, on calcined catalysts at low loadings, chromium is anchored on Al2O3 mainly as Cr6+ surface species [1,311]. At higher loadings, the catalysts also contain Cr3+, which resists oxidation [1,3,5,711]."

[4] "Accordingly, the most recent papers conclude that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites in the dehydrogenation reaction [7,8,10,1214]."

[5] "Conventionally, CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared from Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solution by impregnation. New ways of preparing catalysts are, nevertheless, constantly being sought with the aim of obtaining well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface [22,23]."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery, with decades of research contributing to their importance in dehydrogenation processes. Key industrial applications include the commercial-scale production of propene and i-butene from corresponding paraffins.

Key research focus areas that have contributed to their significance include:

1. Structure and oxidation states: Studies have shown that Cr can exist in 6+, 5+, 3+, and 2+ states, depending on pretreatment, concentration, and support material. At low loadings, chromium is mainly anchored as Cr6+ surface species, while higher loadings also contain Cr3+.

2. Active sites: Recent research concludes that redox or exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites in CrOx/Al2O3 serve as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

3. Support materials: Alumina (Al2O3) has been extensively studied as a support, with research showing how chromium interacts with it at different loadings.

4. Preparation methods: Conventionally, catalysts are prepared by impregnation using Cr(NO3)3 or CrO3 solutions. However, new techniques are being explored to create well-defined structures of active sites on the support surface.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Understanding the role of different chromium species in the dehydrogenation process has been a key focus area, with studies examining the behavior of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species during reactions.

These areas of study have driven improvements in catalyst performance and efficiency, contributing to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

          自发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经经历了显著的演变，几十年的研究为它们在脱氢过程中的重要性做出了贡献。主要工业应用包括从相应的烷烃商业规模生产丙烯和异丁烯。

对其重要性有贡献的关键研究重点领域包括：

1. 结构和氧化态：研究表明，根据预处理、浓度和载体材料的不同，Cr可以存在于6+、5+、3+和2+状态。在低载量时，铬主要以Cr6+表面物种锚定，而高载量时还含有Cr3+。

2. 活性位点：最新研究认为，CrOx/Al2O3中的氧化还原或暴露的非氧化还原Cr3+位点是脱氢反应的活性位点。

3. 载体材料：Al2O3作为载体已被广泛研究，研究表明了不同载量下铬与之的相互作用。

4. 制备方法：传统上，催化剂是通过使用Cr(NO3)3或CrO3溶液进行浸渍法制备的。然而，正在探索新的技术，以在载体表面创建明确定义的活性位点结构。

5. 反应机理：理解不同铬物种在脱氢过程中的作用一直是一个关键的研究重点，研究人员对Cr6+和Cr3+物种在反应过程中的行为进行了研究。

这些研究领域推动了催化剂性能和效率的改进，为铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续重要性做出了贡献。
