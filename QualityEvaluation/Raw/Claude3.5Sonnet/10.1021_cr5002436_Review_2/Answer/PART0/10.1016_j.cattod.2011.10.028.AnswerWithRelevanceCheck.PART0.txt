          [1] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the productions of lower alkenes such as ethene, propene, and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [1,2]."

[2] "Cr-based catalysts have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [39], or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [10]"

[3] "Recently, CO2 has received much attention as a co-feed gas for the dehydrogenation, because CO2 can also act as a mild oxidant"

[4] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts [1525]."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it highlights several key developments and applications:

1. Industrial use: Chromium oxides supported on silica and alumina have been industrially used for dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce lower alkenes like ethene, propene, and isobutene.

2. Research focus areas:
   - Oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes
   - Oxidation of organic compounds with oxygen
   - Use of CO2 as a co-feed gas for dehydrogenation

3. Recent developments: CO2 has gained attention as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation processes. It has been found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over Cr-based catalysts.

4. Key areas of focus appear to include:
   - Support materials (silica and alumina mentioned)
   - Oxidation states of chromium
   - Use of different oxidants (oxygen, CO2) to enhance reactions
   - Reaction mechanisms, particularly with the addition of CO2

The document does not provide specific information on the evolution of catalyst structure, active sites, promoters, or detailed reaction mechanisms over time. It also does not mention the original discovery date of 1933 or trace the full evolution of these catalysts since then.

          该文献并未提供自1933年发现铬氧化物基催化剂以来的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了几个关键的发展和应用：

1. 工业应用：以二氧化硅和氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物已在工业上用于烷烃脱氢生产乙烯、丙烯和异丁烯等低级烯烃。

2. 研究重点领域：
   - 低级烷烃的氧化脱氢
   - 有机化合物的氧气氧化
   - 使用CO2作为脱氢反应的共进料气体

3. 近期发展：CO2作为一种温和的氧化剂在脱氢过程中受到关注。研究发现，它可以增强铬基催化剂上低级烷烃和乙苯的脱氢反应。

4. 关键研究领域似乎包括：
   - 载体材料（提到了二氧化硅和氧化铝）
   - 铬的氧化态
   - 使用不同氧化剂（氧气、二氧化碳）来增强反应
   - 反应机理，特别是在添加CO2的情况下

该文档未提供关于催化剂结构、活性位点、助剂或详细反应机理随时间演变的具体信息。它也没有提到1933年的原始发现日期，或追溯这些催化剂自那时以来的完整演变过程。
