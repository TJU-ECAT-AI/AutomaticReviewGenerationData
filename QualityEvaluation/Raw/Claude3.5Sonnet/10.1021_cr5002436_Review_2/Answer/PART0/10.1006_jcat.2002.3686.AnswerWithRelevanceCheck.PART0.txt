          "The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great importance as an effective route for the production of propene and other light alkenes (14). Chromia/alumina catalysts are industrially used for this process, and much recent research has been devoted to elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide (524)."

"Despite these efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic activity or on the deactivation mechanisms."

"Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1)."

"When used under cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solutions of chromiaalumina (1, 3)."

          The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it highlights several key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas:

1. Industrial Applications:
   - Chromia/alumina catalysts are widely used in the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes.
   - They are particularly important for the production of propene and other light alkenes.

2. Research Focus Areas:
   a) Structure: Recent research has focused on elucidating the structures of alumina-supported chromium oxide.
   b) Active Sites: Although not explicitly mentioned, the lack of consensus on catalytic activity origin implies ongoing research in this area.
   c) Support Materials: Alumina is mentioned as the primary support material.
   d) Reaction Mechanisms: The origin of catalytic activity is still under investigation, suggesting ongoing research into reaction mechanisms.
   e) Deactivation Mechanisms: There is no consensus on deactivation mechanisms, indicating this as an active area of research.

3. Catalyst Composition:
   - Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts typically have a high chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2.

4. Challenges:
   - Long-term industrial use under severe oxidizing and reducing conditions leads to catalyst deactivation.
   - Deactivation occurs through the formation of solid solutions of chromia-alumina.

The ongoing research efforts aim to improve understanding of these catalysts' fundamental aspects, enhance their performance, and address deactivation issues for industrial applications.

          该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它强调了它们当前的重要性和研究重点领域的几个关键方面：

1. 工业应用：
   - 铬/氧化铝催化剂广泛用于烷烃的催化脱氢。
   - 它们对于丙烯和其他轻烯烃的生产特别重要。

2. 研究重点领域：
   a) 结构：近期研究集中在阐明氧化铝负载的铬氧化物的结构。
   b) 活性位点：虽然没有明确提及，但对催化活性来源缺乏共识暗示了这一领域的持续研究。
   c) 载体材料：氧化铝被提到作为主要的载体材料。
   d) 反应机理：催化活性的来源仍在研究中，表明对反应机理的研究仍在进行。
   e) 失活机理：对失活机理尚无共识，表明这是一个活跃的研究领域。

3. 催化剂组成：
   - 工业用铬/氧化铝催化剂通常具有高铬负载量，约为15 atCr/nm2。

4. 挑战：
   - 在严苛的氧化和还原条件下长期工业使用会导致催化剂失活。
   - 失活是通过形成铬-氧化铝固溶体而发生的。

正在进行的研究努力旨在提高对这些催化剂基本方面的理解，提升其性能，并解决工业应用中的失活问题。
