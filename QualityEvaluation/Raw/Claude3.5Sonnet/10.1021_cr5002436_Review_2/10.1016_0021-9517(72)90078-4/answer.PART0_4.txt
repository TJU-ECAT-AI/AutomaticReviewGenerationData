Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation have been known and used commercially for many years. Their evolution has involved several key areas:

1. Preparation methods: Catalysts have been prepared by gel precipitation, wet mixing, and impregnation, typically treated at high temperatures (600°C or above).

2. Structure and composition: Research has focused on chromia-alumina systems, including supported Cr2O3 catalysts and Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions.

3. Active sites: There is ongoing debate about the nature of the active species in dehydrogenation, with various hypotheses proposed by different researchers.

4. Support materials: Alumina has been a key support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have aimed to understand the dehydrogenation process mechanisms, though there is still disagreement among researchers.

The industrial applications have primarily been in dehydrogenation processes. However, fundamental studies on the catalytic properties of Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions have been relatively limited, indicating an area for further research focus.

铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢领域已知并商业应用多年。它们的发展涉及几个关键领域：

1. 制备方法：催化剂通过凝胶沉淀、湿法混合和浸渍法制备，通常在高温（600°C或以上）下处理。

2. 结构和组成：研究重点集中在铬氧化铝系统，包括负载型Cr2O3催化剂和Al2O3-Cr2O3固溶体。

3. 活性位点：关于脱氢中活性物种的本质仍存在争议，不同研究者提出了各种假说。

4. 载体材料：氧化铝一直是铬氧化物催化剂的重要载体材料。

5. 反应机理：研究旨在理解脱氢过程的机理，尽管研究者之间仍存在分歧。

工业应用主要集中在脱氢过程。然而，关于Al2O3-Cr2O3固溶体催化性能的基础研究相对有限，表明这是一个值得进一步研究的领域。
