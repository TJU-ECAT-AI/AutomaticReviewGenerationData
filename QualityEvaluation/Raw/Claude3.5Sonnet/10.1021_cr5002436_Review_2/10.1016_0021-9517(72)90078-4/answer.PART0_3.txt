Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been known to catalyze dehydrogenation for many years and have been used in commercial processes. Their evolution since 1933 has involved several key developments:

1. Preparation methods: Catalysts are typically prepared by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, followed by high-temperature treatment (600°C or above).

2. Structure: The high-temperature treatment leads to the partial transformation of chromia and alumina into solid solutions.

3. Active sites: There is significant disagreement among researchers about the nature of the active species. Different theories propose:
   - Defects created by the reduction of Cr6+ ions
   - Cr2+ ions
   - Incompletely coordinated Cr3+ ions

4. Support materials: Aluminum oxide is commonly used as a support material, forming chromia-alumina catalysts.

5. Reaction mechanisms: The exact mechanism of dehydrogenation is still debated, with different theories focusing on various chromium ion species and their roles in the catalytic process.

Research focus areas have included understanding the nature of the active sites, the role of different chromium ion species, and the formation and properties of chromia-alumina solid solutions. The industrial significance of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes has driven continued research to improve their activity, selectivity, and stability.

铬氧化物基催化剂多年来一直被用于催化脱氢反应，并已在商业过程中使用。自1933年以来，它们的发展涉及几个关键方面：

1. 制备方法：催化剂通常通过凝胶沉淀、湿法混合或浸渍法制备，然后进行高温处理（600°C或以上）。

2. 结构：高温处理导致铬氧化物和氧化铝部分转化为固溶体。

3. 活性位点：研究人员对活性物种的本质存在重大分歧。不同的理论提出：
   - 由Cr6+离子还原产生的缺陷
   - Cr2+离子
   - 不完全配位的Cr3+离子

4. 载体材料：氧化铝常被用作载体材料，形成铬氧化物-氧化铝催化剂。

5. 反应机理：脱氢的确切机理仍有争议，不同的理论关注各种铬离子物种及其在催化过程中的作用。

研究重点领域包括理解活性位点的本质、不同铬离子物种的作用，以及铬氧化物-氧化铝固溶体的形成和性质。这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的工业重要性推动了持续的研究，以提高它们的活性、选择性和稳定性。
