[1] "The chromium oxide-aluminum oxide system has been known for many years to catalyze dehydrogenation. It has been used in commercial processes."

[2] "Usual chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, prepared either by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, are treated at high temperatures, currently 600C or above."

[3] "Our results, obtained with catalysts quite different from those investigated by most previous researchers, can be used for a more precise identification of the active component in chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts and for a better analysis of the various catalytic processes involved."

[4] "The conclusions drawn by the different authors concerning the active species in dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this process disagree in many respects"

[5] "Some authors are of the opinion that the catalytic process is related to the presence of defects created in the lattice by the reduction of Cr6+ ions at the beginning of the dehydrogenation cycle."

[6] "Other authors, like Slovetskaya and Rubinshtein and Slovetskaya et al. ascribe the catalytic activity to the Cr2+ ions. Several authors consider that the incompletely coordinated Cr3+ ions are the true active centers"
