[1] "The chromium oxide-aluminum oxide system has been known for many years to catalyze dehydrogenation. It has been used in commercial processes."

[2] "Usual chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, prepared either by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, are treated at high temperatures, currently 600C or above."

[3] "Numerous investigations have been devoted to chromia-containing catalysts (4). But few fundamental studies of the catalytic properties of Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions have been performed (5-8), probably because it is very difficult to produce these solutions in a sufficiently dispersed form for measurable action."

[4] "The mechanism of dehydrogenation and deactivation is discussed in terms of the chromium ions of various charges present in the solid solutions. It is concluded that Cr2+ ions are probably responsible for the initial high activity; this activity is very rapidly inhibited. The useful dehydrogenating centers are the Cr3+ ions."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been known to catalyze dehydrogenation for many years and have been used in commercial processes. The key developments in their evolution include:

1. Preparation methods: Gel precipitation, wet mixing, and impregnation have been used to prepare chromia-alumina catalysts, typically treated at high temperatures (600°C or above).

2. Structural studies: Research has focused on understanding the properties of Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions, though these studies have been challenging due to difficulties in producing sufficiently dispersed forms for measurable action.

3. Active sites: Investigations have revealed that different chromium ion species play distinct roles in the catalytic process. Cr2+ ions are believed to be responsible for initial high activity, while Cr3+ ions are considered the useful dehydrogenating centers.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have explored the mechanisms of dehydrogenation and deactivation in terms of the various chromium ion charges present in the solid solutions.

5. Support materials: Alumina has been a key support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

While the literature doesn't provide a comprehensive timeline of evolution since 1933, it highlights the ongoing research into understanding and improving these catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂多年来一直被认为能够催化脱氢反应，并已在商业过程中使用。其演变的关键发展包括：

1. 制备方法：凝胶沉淀、湿法混合和浸渍法已被用于制备铬-氧化铝催化剂，通常在高温下处理（600°C或以上）。

2. 结构研究：研究重点是了解Al2O3-Cr2O3固溶体的性质，尽管由于难以生产足够分散的形式以进行可测量的作用，这些研究具有挑战性。

3. 活性位点：研究表明，不同的铬离子物种在催化过程中扮演着不同的角色。Cr2+离子被认为负责初始高活性，而Cr3+离子被认为是有用的脱氢中心。

4. 反应机理：研究探讨了固溶体中存在的各种铬离子电荷在脱氢和失活机理方面的作用。

5. 载体材料：氧化铝一直是铬氧化物催化剂的关键载体材料。

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来演变的全面时间线，但它强调了对这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的理解和改进的持续研究。
