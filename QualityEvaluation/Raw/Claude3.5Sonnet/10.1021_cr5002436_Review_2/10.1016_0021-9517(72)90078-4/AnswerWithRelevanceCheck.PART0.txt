          [1] "The chromium oxide-aluminum oxide system has been known for many years to catalyze dehydrogenation. It has been used in commercial processes."

[2] "Usual chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, prepared either by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, are treated at high temperatures, currently 600C or above."

[3] "Numerous investigations have been devoted to chromia-containing catalysts (4). But few fundamental studies of the catalytic properties of Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions have been performed (5-8), probably because it is very difficult to produce these solutions in a sufficiently dispersed form for measurable action."

[4] "The mechanism of dehydrogenation and deactivation is discussed in terms of the chromium ions of various charges present in the solid solutions. It is concluded that Cr2+ ions are probably responsible for the initial high activity; this activity is very rapidly inhibited. The useful dehydrogenating centers are the Cr3+ ions."

[5] "Some authors (21, 24) are of the opinion that the catalytic process is related to the presence of defects created in the lattice by the reduction of Cr6+ ions at the beginning of the dehydrogenation cycle."

[6] "Other authors, like Slovetskaya and Rubinshtein (33) and Slovetskaya et al. (35) ascribe the catalytic activity to the Cr2+ ions."

[7] "Several authors consider that the incompletely coordinated Cr3+ ions are the true active centers"

[8] "It thus appears that the tendency of superficial oxygen to leave the surface of Cr2O3 decreases in the solid solutions."

[9] "Besides Cr3+, which is certainly active, Cr2+ probably contributes to the overall activity. Both are active in the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933. Key developments and research focus areas include:

1. Industrial applications: These catalysts have been used in commercial dehydrogenation processes for many years.

2. Preparation methods: Common techniques include gel precipitation, wet mixing, and impregnation, followed by high-temperature treatment (usually above 600°C).

3. Structure: Research has focused on chromia-alumina systems, including supported Cr2O3 catalysts and Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions. The high-temperature treatment leads to the partial transformation of chromia and alumina into solid solutions.

4. Active sites: There is ongoing debate about the nature of active species. Different theories propose:
   - Defects created by the reduction of Cr6+ ions
   - Cr2+ ions responsible for initial high activity
   - Incompletely coordinated Cr3+ ions as the primary active centers
   - Both Cr3+ and Cr2+ ions contributing to overall activity

5. Support materials: Aluminum oxide has been a key support material, forming chromia-alumina catalysts.

6. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have explored dehydrogenation and deactivation mechanisms, focusing on the role of different chromium ion species and surface oxygen mobility.

7. Challenges: Producing sufficiently dispersed Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions for measurable catalytic action has been difficult, limiting fundamental studies in this area.

8. Recent developments: New research using well-defined solid solutions has provided insights into active components and catalytic processes, potentially leading to more precise identification of active sites and improved understanding of reaction mechanisms.

Overall, the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has involved a multifaceted approach, combining studies of preparation methods, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms to enhance their performance in dehydrogenation processes. Despite years of research, there is still disagreement among researchers about the exact nature of active species and reaction mechanisms, indicating that this remains an active area of investigation and development.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变。主要发展和研究重点领域包括：

1. 工业应用：这些催化剂多年来一直用于商业脱氢过程。

2. 制备方法：常见技术包括凝胶沉淀、湿法混合和浸渍，随后进行高温处理（通常高于600°C）。

3. 结构：研究重点集中在铬氧化铝系统，包括负载型Cr2O3催化剂和Al2O3-Cr2O3固溶体。高温处理导致铬氧化物和氧化铝部分转化为固溶体。

4. 活性位点：关于活性物种的本质仍存在争议。不同的理论提出：
   - 由Cr6+离子还原产生的缺陷
   - Cr2+离子负责初始高活性
   - 不完全配位的Cr3+离子是主要活性中心
   - Cr3+和Cr2+离子都对整体活性有贡献

5. 载体材料：氧化铝一直是重要的载体材料，形成铬氧化铝催化剂。

6. 反应机理：研究探讨了脱氢和失活机理，重点关注不同铬离子物种的作用和表面氧的移动性。

7. 挑战：产生足够分散的Al2O3-Cr2O3固溶体以进行可测量的催化作用一直很困难，限制了这一领域的基础研究。

8. 最新进展：使用明确定义的固溶体进行的新研究为活性成分和催化过程提供了新见解，可能导致对活性位点的更精确识别和对反应机理的改进理解。

总的来说，铬氧化物基催化剂的演变涉及多方面的方法，结合了制备方法、活性位点、载体材料和反应机理的研究，以提高它们在脱氢过程中的性能。尽管经过多年研究，研究人员对活性物种的确切性质和反应机理仍存在分歧，表明这仍然是一个活跃的研究和发展领域。
