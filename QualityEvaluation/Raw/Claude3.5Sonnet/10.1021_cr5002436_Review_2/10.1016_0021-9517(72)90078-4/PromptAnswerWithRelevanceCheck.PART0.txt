[1] "The chromium oxide-aluminum oxide system has been known for many years to catalyze dehydrogenation. It has been used in commercial processes."

[2] "Usual chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, prepared either by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, are treated at high temperatures, currently 600C or above."

[3] "Numerous investigations have been devoted to chromia-containing catalysts (4). But few fundamental studies of the catalytic properties of Al2O3-Cr2O3 solid solutions have been performed (5-8), probably because it is very difficult to produce these solutions in a sufficiently dispersed form for measurable action."

[4] "The mechanism of dehydrogenation and deactivation is discussed in terms of the chromium ions of various charges present in the solid solutions. It is concluded that Cr2+ ions are probably responsible for the initial high activity; this activity is very rapidly inhibited. The useful dehydrogenating centers are the Cr3+ ions."
