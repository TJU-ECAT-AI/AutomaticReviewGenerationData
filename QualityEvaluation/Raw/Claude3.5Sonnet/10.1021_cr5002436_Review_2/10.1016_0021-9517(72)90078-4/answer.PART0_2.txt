[1] "The chromium oxide-aluminum oxide system has been known for many years to catalyze dehydrogenation. It has been used in commercial processes."

[2] "Usual chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts, prepared either by gel precipitation, wet mixing, or impregnation, are treated at high temperatures, currently 600C or above."

[3] "Our results, obtained with catalysts quite different from those investigated by most previous researchers, can be used for a more precise identification of the active component in chromia-alumina dehydrogenation catalysts and for a better analysis of the various catalytic processes involved."

[4] "It thus appears that the tendency of superficial oxygen to leave the surface of Cr2O3 decreases in the solid solutions."

[5] "Besides Cr3+, which is certainly active, Cr2+ probably contributes to the overall activity. Both are active in the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts."
