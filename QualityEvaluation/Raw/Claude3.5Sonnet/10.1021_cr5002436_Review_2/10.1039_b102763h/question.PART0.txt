Zr0.10(Ce12xPrx)0.90O2 mixed oxides (x between 0 and 0.75) were prepared by coprecipitation (nitrates) or by
the solgel route. Zirconium n-propoxide and cerium and/or praseodymium nitrates were used as precursors.
Solgel oxides calcined at 900 uC were shown to be cubic with a fluorite-type structure. Coprecipated oxides
could not be obtained as solid solutions. The BET surface area of these samples rapidly decreases when
xw0.50. A Raman study confirmed that all oxides were cubic and evidenced the presence of oxygen vacancies.
The optimum oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was obtained for Zr0.10(Ce0.50Pr0.50)0.90O2. It appears that the
substitution of cerium by praseodymium in Zr0.10Ce0.90O2 mixed oxides leads to a material with improved
redox properties. The presence of vacancies, associated with Pr3z/Pr4z ions, is thought to be responsible for
these enhanced OSCs.
Introduction
Ceria (CeO2) is a crucial component of modern automotive
pollution control catalysts.1 This oxide is a promoter in the
watergas shift reaction and prevents the sintering of the noble
metals used as active centers. More important is the ability of
this oxide to store oxygen. This phenomenon is associated with
a fast Ce4z/Ce3z redox process in the solid, also involving
anionic vacancies.24 It was shown that up to 50% zirconium
could be substituted for cerium into the ceria lattice to form
solid solutions with face-centered cubic structures. In a
previous work, we have evidenced that among the ZrCeO
mixed oxides, the compound Zr0.1Ce0.9O2 prepared by the sol
gel procedure displays the highest oxygen storage capacity.5,6
Praseodymium is one of the possible new additives, which
today attracts increasing attention. In fact, it was demonstrated
that the oxygen exchange occurs at lower temperature on
ceriumpraseodymium mixed oxides than on ceria.7 Further-
more, high temperature pretreatment does not affect the
oxygen exchange capacity (OSC) of the mixed oxides. More-
over, high surface area PrOyZrO2 materials with a fluorite-
type structure have also been prepared by the solgel
procedure.7,8
The main objective of our study was to modify the
composition of CeO2 and Zr0.10Ce0.90O2 samples, in order to
follow the influence of cerium substitution by praseodymium
and to enhance both thermal stability and oxygen storage
capacity. The results will be discussed on the basis of DTA
(differential
thermal
analysis),
XRD
(X-ray
diffraction),
Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area and OSC data.
Experimental
1 Preparation
Two series of samples were prepared. Series 1 consists of
Zr0.10(Ce12xPrx)0.90O2 samples while, in the second series
(Ce12xPrxO2), the oxide samples do not contain any zirconium.
Preparation methods have been described earlier.5 Solution
concentrations were adjusted in order to synthesize 3 g of solid
in each batch. All reactants were Aldrich products of 99%
purity and were used without any further purification.
Solgel method (series 1). After dissolution in 20 cm3 of
isopropyl alcohol (Rho
nePoulenc, H2O0.5%), zirconium
n-propoxide Zr(OC3H7)4 (70% in propan-1-ol) precursor
was slowly added (1 cm3 min21, ambient temperature) to
an
aqueous
solution
containing
Ce(NO3)3?6H2O
and
Pr(NO3)3?6H2O (20 cm3, stirring speed: 500 rpm). A pseudo-
gel forms immediately as the reactant mixture undergoes
hydrolysis.
Coprecipitation method (series 2). Ceriumpraseodymium
oxides were prepared by co-precipitation. 12 cm3 aqueous
ammonia (14.7 mol L21) was slowly added to a mixture of
Ce(NO3)3?6H2O and Pr(NO3)3?6H2O (both 20 cm3 in distilled
water). The precipitates were filtered off, re-dispersed in
100 cm3 aqueous ammonia (0.25 mol L21) and filtered again.
The synthesized materials were dried in air at 60 uC for 1 h
and at 120 uC overnight before further calcination in air at
900 uC for four hours.
Compared to coprecipitation, the major advantage of the
solgel method is the possibility to prepare homogenous
materials with a controlled composition at a nanometer scale.
In this method, the structuring of the oxide proceeds by
polymerization of molecular precursor entities. Small amounts
of molecular precursor are sufficient to initiate polymerization.
As a result, colloidal particles with 3D-structure are formed
and further reticulation leads to the formation of the final gel.
By contrast, precipitation upon addition of ammonia is more
difficult to control; depending on the pKa and solubility of the
corresponding hydroxides and oxides, this method may lead to
precipitates of various ill-defined compositions. Heterogeneous
solids, in terms of both particle size and local composition, are
finally obtained.9
2 Characterization
Differential thermal analysis (DTA) experiments were carried
out in dry air (Air Liquide, 5 ppm impurities) between 25 and
500 uC using a Thermal Analyst 2100 TA apparatus. Samples

Preliminary experiments showed that no DTA peak was
observed above 500 uC.
Specific surface areas were determined by N2 (Air Liquide,

with a Micromeritics Flow Sorb II.

with ICDD files [Pr6O11: 42-1121 (cubic); CeO2: 34-394
(cubic)]. Standard diffractogram recording parameters were:
dwell time1 s, step0.05u, 2h range1090u, divergence
slit1u; for precise
cell parameter
determination: dwell
time10 s, step0.02u. The diffraction peaks were fitted
using the Profile program (Socabim, France) assuming a split
pseudo-Voigt profile for peak fitting. U-Fit, a program
developed by Evain (Institut des Mate
riaux de Nantes,
France), was used for the determination of the precise cell
parameters.10
Raman
spectra
were
recorded
using
a

spectrometer: Nd-YAG laser (1064.4 nm, 100 mW), dwell
time120 s, number of scans20.
Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was measured at 400 uC
under atmospheric pressure. A 20 mg sample was continuously
purged with helium (30 cm3 min21). Successive or alternate
pulses (0.265 cm3) of O2 (Air Liquide, 5 ppm total impu-
rities) and CO (Air Liquide, N20) were injected every minute
in order to simulate lean and rich operating conditions as those
encountered in an Otto engine coupled with a three-way
catalytic converter. The OSC was calculated from the CO
consumption after stabilization of the sample in alternate
pulses condition. A complete experiment on the Zr0.10(Ce0.50-
Pr0.50)0.90O2 sample of series 1 is described in Table 1.
Successive CO injections induce the formation of CO2 and
the first CO pulse displays a good balance between consump-
tion of CO and formation of CO2. During subsequent CO
pulses, a small part of the carbon monoxide molecules are
trapped into the material and mole balance no longer applies.
This carbon leftover is partially eliminated as CO2 during the
oxidizing treatment. Under alternate CO or O2 pulses, CO2
production and CO consumption are in good agreement.
Furthermore, the O2 uptake corresponds to a complete re-
oxidation of the surface as is shown by eqns. (1) and (2):
2CeO2(s)z2yCO(g)?2CeO2{y(s)z2yCO2(g)
(1)
2CeO2{y(s)zyO2(g)?2CeO2(s)
(2)
The non-stoichiometric phase CeO22y can be better described
as:
CeIV
1{2yCeIII
2y O2{y(V00
O)y
where VOuu represents oxygen vacancies. Taking into account
only the Ce ions reduced by CO, eqn. (1) can be rewritten in a
more stoichiometric manner:
2CeIVz4O{IIzCO(g)?2CeIIIz3O{IIzV00
OzCO2(g)
(3)
Therefore, eqn. (3) clearly evidences that the OSC involves only
one oxygen atom out of four.
Results
1 Structural characterizations (DTA, XRD, Raman)
DTA and XRD. After the drying step at 120 uC, all the
samples correspond to complex mixtures containing mainly
MIII (precursor oxidation state) with minor amounts of MIV
oxides and hydroxides (MCe or Pr) and no well-defined
phase could be evidenced from the XRD results. Fig. 1 shows
the thermograms obtained under air of all series 1 samples and
of one series 2 sample (x1). All thermograms consist of
endothermic peaks due mainly to the elimination of a weak
quantity of the residual water molecules and to the transfor-
mation of hydroxide ions into oxide ions. Therefore, possible
exothermic reactions such as the formation of a crystallized
phase or the oxidation of CeIII or PrIII atoms are hidden by the
endothermal events.
For x0 in series 1, the peak at 250 uC is characteristic of the
appearance of a fluorite-type solid solution Zr0.1Ce0.9O2.6 For
the other samples, this peak is shifted to higher temperature
and additional endothermic peaks appear at lower tempera-
tures.

To understand these endothermic transformations, sample
Zr0.10(Ce0.75Pr0.25)0.90O2 was studied in more detail using XRD
measurements. This sample was successively calcined at 265,
370 (below and above the temperature at the maximum of
the major endothermic peak) and at 900 uC for 4 h. The
corresponding diffractograms are shown in Fig. 2(a). The
particle sizes, determined from the FWHM (full width at half
maximum) using the Scherrer relation are also reported. After
calcination at 265 uC, the diffractogram is characteristic of a
solid showing a fluorite-type structure.5 Nevertheless, the line
broadening indicates that the sample is not very well crystal-
lized with the crystallite size being 6 nm. Calcination at 370 uC
did not improve the degree of crystallization (Fig. 2(a)). After
calcination at 900 uC, the peak width decreases, indicating a
much higher crystallinity with a mean crystallite size of 16 nm.
Consequently, the strongest endothermic peak can be asso-
ciated with the formation of the fluorite-type solid solution.
The increase in crystallite size occurs only between 400 and
900 uC
and
corresponds
to
a
slow
continuous
process
displaying no thermal event as the temperature increases.
This process parallels a slow oxidation of the remaining CeIII
and PrIII atoms as the cubic cell parameter decreases slightly
from 5.424 to 5.392 A
 (Fig. 2(a)); this small parameter change
can be explained by two opposite effects: (i) a decrease in ionic
radii when going from M3z to M4z cations (about 15 pm);11
(ii) a concomitant increase of oxygen anions into the oxygen
vacancies (see eqn. (4)):
4M3zz6O2{z2V00
OzO2(g)?4M4zz8O2{
(4)
From our results, the first effect is predominant in agreement
with the value of the cubic cell parameter of the praseodymium
and cerium oxides (vide infra).
Therefore, for the series 1 samples with x in the range 00.75
(Fig. 1): the crystallization occurs in two steps:
(1) transformation of the initial mixture into a solid solution
with fcc structure, small crystallite size and endothermic events;
(2) slow increase of crystallinity with no visible thermal
event.
The temperature range of the transformation is shifted
toward higher temperatures as the number of praseodymium
atoms in the lattice increases (Fig. 1).
Diffractograms of the samples after calcination at 900 uC are
displayed in Fig. 2(b) in the range 2h 2636u, including the
calculated crystallite size. The series 1 samples (with x between
0 and 0.75) present only symmetrical diffraction peaks in
agreement with the presence of one phase identical to
Zr0.10Ce0.90O2 (x0) described in a previous paper.5 This
mixed oxide has been shown to be a solid solution with a
fluorite-type structure and lattice parameter a5.3962 A
 . The
lattice parameters of some samples are given in Table 2 and we
observe a slight contraction of the cell as praseodymium atoms
substitute for cerium atoms, in agreement with a smaller ionic
radius for Pr4z.11 For the sample Zr0.10Pr0.90O2 (Fig. 2(b),
x1, series 1) the distortion of the diffraction peaks indicates
the presence of two phases: a major Pr6O11 phase and a
fluorite-type structure solid solution, in agreement with Sinevs
work.12
In series 2, the oxides CeO2 (x0) and Pr6O11 (x1) appear
to be single phase stable after air calcination at 900 uC.
The non-stoichiometric praseodymium oxide can be better
formulated:
PrIV
4 PrIII
2 O{II
11 (V00
O)1
which displays the importance of the vacancies.
For sample Ce0.50Pr0.50O2 (series 2), a close look in the range
2h 2634u clearly evidences the presence of Pr6O11 (Fig. 2(c)).
Therefore, this sample prepared by coprecipitation, could not
be obtained as a single phase mixed oxide as also found by
Logan and Shelef using oxalate precursors.13 By contrast, in
the case of Ce0.75Pr0.25O2, the presence of Pr6O11 can be
excluded on the basis of the XRD data.
For both series, the samples containing no cerium (x1)

display different DTA profiles in comparison with the single
phased samples (Fig. 1) and this behavior agrees well with the
final presence of the praseodymium oxide phase Pr6O11 and the
successive formation of intermediate phases.14
Raman spectroscopy. Four Raman spectra only are pre-
sented in Fig. 3. For samples with x higher than 0.25,
fluorescence effects due to praseodymium were so dominant
that no spectra could be recorded. The band at ca. 460 cm21 is
attributed to the T2g vibration mode of the metaloxygen bond
in the fluorite-type structure.1517 In the case of series 1
samples, the presence of this band confirms that these oxides
are solid solutions. In order to explain the shift of this band as a
function of x, samples were analyzed again after calcination at
different temperatures (Fig. 4). This band is shifted towards
higher frequencies as the calcination temperature increases
(200, 400, 900 uC). This phenomenon could be related to
structural ordering. By contrast, a shift towards lower fre-
quencies can be observed as zirconium or praseodymium atoms
substitute for cerium atoms. This shift indicates that the
incorporation of Zr or Pr atoms induces a perturbation of the
MO bond involving some kind of disordering or structural
distortion. McBride et al.18 gave two reasons for the observed
frequency shift: (i) an increase in the oxygen vacancy density
and (ii) an expansion or contraction of the cell. In fact the
presence of oxygen vacancies in this material could be
explained by the presence of reducible praseodymium atoms
(Pr4z/Pr3z). Moreover, in the case of Ce0.75Pr0.25O2 (Fig. 3), a
small and broad band appears at about 570 cm21. The same
authors have tentatively attributed this band to the presence of
oxygen vacancies in the material. In the other samples, this
small band could not be observed. This fact can be linked either
to the very weak intensity of the recorded spectra or to the
absence of praseodymium in the oxide samples.
Particle sizes. To compare XRD and Raman spectroscopic
data, particle sizes were deduced from both types of measure-
ments (Table 3). Particle sizes could be deduced from XRD
patterns using the Scherrer relation,19 and from Raman spectra
using eqn. (5) established by Weber et al.:16
C5z 518
D
(5)
with:
Dparticle size (A
 )
Cfull width at half maximum (FWHM) assuming a
lorentzian profile for the Raman bands (cm21).
A good agreement is obtained between both sets of results.
Nevertheless it remains difficult to discuss the effect on particle
size of the introduction of both Zr and/or Pr atoms. We can
remark, however, that the presence of zirconium leads to
smaller
size
whereas
the
substitution
of
Ce
by
Pr
is
characterized only by minor effects.
2 Surface characterization and oxygen storage capacity
All BET surface areas are reported in Fig. 5. Whatever the
series, introduction of Pr results in a decrease of the BET
surface area. For series 1 samples, this decrease is even more
pronounced for xw0.5. It seems that the presence of Pr6O11
could be responsible for this decrease of surface area.
Furthermore, the presence of zirconium remains crucial to
stabilize ceriumpraseodymium oxides: BET surface areas of
series 1 samples are much higher than those of series 2, except
for x1. Praseodymium can stabilize the texture of ceria but its
influence in obtaining high surface area oxides appears to be
much weaker than in the case of zirconium addition.24,20

The evolution of the oxygen storage capacity (OSC/
mmol CO g21) is presented in Fig. 6 as a function of the
amount of praseodymium in the solids. For both series, the
introduction of praseodymium induces an increase of the OSC
up to x0.50, whereas above x0.50 a decrease is observed.
Therefore, an excess of praseodymium has a negative effect on
the OSC.2123 In order to understand how praseodymium can
influence the oxygen storage capacity, calculated OSC values
were obtained as follows:
OSCcal bS
Na2
(6)
with:
SBET surface area (m2 g21)
alattice parameter (m)
NAvogadro number
bfraction of reducible elements (CezPr) in the unit cell
(0.9 for series 1, 1 for series 2)
This calculation is based on the following assumptions:
(1) all the CeIV or PrIV atoms of the surface monolayer are
reduced to oxidation state III;
(2) the surface faces are {100} faces and contain 2 metal
atoms and 4 oxygen atoms per unit surface area a2 (acubic
parameter); therefore one oxygen atom out of four participates
in the OSC process as indicated by equation (3);
(3) oxygen atoms bonded to reducible elements are the only
ones participating in the OSC.
Calculated
and
experimental
values,
expressed
in
mmol CO g21, are collected in Table 2. The ratio of these two
values may represent the number of oxygen layers involved in
the redox process. In all cases, calculated values are lower than
the experimental ones. This observation shows that 2 to 3
layers are involved in the redox process. The increase of the
OSC along with the amount of Pr shows that the presence of
this element induces the creation of anionic vacancies. In fact,
upon substituting for cerium cations, Pr ions may undergo a
redox process (Pr3z/Pr4z) whereas this is not possible for
zirconium cations.
3 Thermodynamic considerations
In order to understand why praseodymium increases the OSC,
the thermodynamics of CO reduction of the oxides present in
our materials was investigated. The thermodynamic calcula-
tions were performed using the HSC code.24 The Gibbs
energies of the different cerium and praseodymium oxides,
calculated at 673 K, are given in Table 4. For cerium oxides,
the Gibbs energy of formation DfGu displays a continuous
decrease as the oxidation state increases, thus showing that the
stable phase at 673 K and 1 bar pressure of oxygen is clearly
CeO2. By contrast, for the praseodymium oxides a minimum is
observed for PrO1.72 and the more stable phases are therefore
PrO1.72 and PrO1.83. The last oxide corresponds to the Pr6O11
phase (11/61.833), in agreement with our results.
For cerium oxides samples, the first CO reduction step to
CeO1.83 can be written:
5:882CeO(s)zCO(g)?CO2(g)z5:882CeO1:83(s)
(7)
At 673 K, this reaction is endothermic (DrHu40.80 kJ mol21)
while the Gibbs energy change is slightly positive (DrGu
z10.37 kJ mol21) which leads to an equilibrium constant:
Kp P(CO2)
P(CO) 0:157
This pressure ratio corresponds to an extent of oxidation of
14% for CO during the pulse. The reduction of CeO2 into the
defined CeO1.83 phase is thus possible for a single CO pulse. It
must be emphasized, however, that the energy changes for the
real surface reactions could be slightly different from the energy
changes calculated for bulk phases; nevertheless the formation
of ordered oxygen vacancies on the solid surface could favor
the surface reduction of the oxide.
If we consider the reduction reaction of the praseodymium
oxide (Pr6O11 or PrO1.833), we obtain eqn. (8), which leads to a
very negative Gibbs energy (DrGu2172.08 kJ mol21).
3:003PrO1:833(s)zCO(g)?CO2(g)z1:502Pr2O3(s)
(8)
These results show
clearly that praseodymium
addition
improves the cerium oxide reducibility as long as the solid
solution is the sole phase. Nevertheless, excess praseodymium
leads to the formation of a second praseodymium oxide phase
Pr6O11 and to a concomitant decrease of the reducibility which
parallels the substantial reduction of the surface area (Fig. 5).
Conclusions
We prepared by the solgel route some thermally stable
Zr0.10(Ce12xPrx)0.90O2 mixed oxides (x between 0 and 0.75)
with a fluorite-type structure. This structure was confirmed by
the presence, in the Raman spectrum, of a single band
at ca. 460 cm21, characteristic of the MO vibration in the

fluorite-type structure. Moreover, the band position and the
shoulder at 570 cm21 indicate the presence of oxygen vacancies
probably associated with praseodymium cations. Consequently,
high OSCs appear to be the result of the presence of both
cerium and praseodymium atoms. Thus, addition of praseo-
dymium atoms into zirconiaceria oxides appears to be very
promising for the design of new automotive catalysts.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
