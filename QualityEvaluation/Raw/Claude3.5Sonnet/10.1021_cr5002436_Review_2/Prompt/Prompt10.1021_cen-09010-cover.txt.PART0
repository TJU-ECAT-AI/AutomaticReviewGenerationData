COVER STORY
SHALE IS FORCING North American 
petrochemical executives to unlearn much 
of what they thought they knew about their 
industry. And given that they are near the 
beginning of what is likely to be a long, 
prosperous period, they are more than 
happy to change their outlook.
Experiences early in the previous decade 
taught the regions executives that their 
reliance on raw materials derived from 
natural gas to make ethylene put them at a 
cost disadvantage to the many other areas 
of the world that use petroleum-derived 
naphtha. Now ethane is so cheap that only 
the Middle East can produce ethylene more 
cost-effectively than North America can. 
And while petrochemical companies in 
other regions, notably Europe, are strug
gling to turn a profit, North American firms 
are raking in substantial returns.
Executives are learning to invest in 
North America again. A decade ago, ex
ecutives thought that the investment of 
capital in domestic petrochemical plants 
would be limited mostly to maintenance. 
But since last spring, five companies
Chevron Phillips Chemical, Dow Chemi
cal, Formosa Plastics, Sasol, and Shell 
Chemicalshave disclosed plans for new 
multi-billion-dollar complexes making 
ethylene and derivatives such as ethylene 
oxide and polyethylene. Theres a good 
possibility that more companies will un
veil such plans in 2012.
Beyond large projects, nearly every 
producer of ethylene or derivatives is con
templating expansions to take advantage 
of low raw material costs. Shale is also 
beginning to underpin chemical deals. For 
example, the rosy North American outlook 
was important to Indoramas $795 million 
purchase of an ethylene glycol plant in 
Clear Lake, Texas, from Old World Indus
tries last month.
Chemical executives can be forgiven for 
having to get up to speed in short order. 
Until 2005, shale depositswhich lie be
neath a wide swath of the countrywere 
an eccentric source of natural gas. That 
was about the time that exploration com
panies perfected horizontal drilling and 
hydraulic fracturing techniques to liberate 
gas that was tightly locked into shale. Shale 
has since become the source of more than 
one-quarter of the natural gas produced in 
the U.S.
The new output has driven U.S. natural 
gas prices below $3.00 per million Btu for 
the first time in more than a decade. At 
more than $100 per barrel, oil is more than 
five times as expensive as natural gas on an 
energy content basis.

petrochemical facilities is natural gas liq
uids, a mixture of ethane, propane, butane, 
and other hydrocarbons that is extracted 
from natural gas and then usually sepa
rated into its components. The remaining 
dry natural gas, primarily methane, is 
then piped to the industrial and home 
heating market. Cheap natural gas liquids 
put U.S. producers at a big advantage over 
European and Asian chemical producers 
that primarily use petroleum-derived feed
stocks such as naphtha.
This advantage of natural gas liquids 
over naphtha is enormous. According to 
Carlo Barrasa, director of natural gas liq
uids and cracker economics at the consult
ing group IHS Chemical, the cash cost of 
making ethylene from ethane is 18 cents 
per lb. The cash cost of using light naph
tha as a feedstock, in contrast, is about 
46.5 cents per lb. Ethylene sells for about 
68.5 cents per lb, IHS says.
ETHYLENE CRACKERS normally have 
some latitude to change feedstock slates to 
react to changing market conditions. In re
cent years, they have been cracking as much 
ethane as they possibly can. Many crackers 
originally set up to take in heavier feed
stocks such as naphtha have been retrofitted 
to allow them to crack more ethane. Dow, 
LyondellBasell Industries, Nova Chemicals, 
and Shell have undertaken such initiatives.
In 2004, Barrasa notes, only about 45% 
of U.S. ethylene production was based on 
ethane. Today, that figure stands at about 
70%. That just speaks to the fact that the 
cost advantage is so great, he says.
Cracking ethane instead of heavier 
feedstocks does mean that ethylene plants 
arent making as much propylene, butadi
ene, and aromatics as they used to. Those 
cracker coproducts are in short supply and 
are becoming increasingly costly. 
Although cheap shale gas is now the 
dominant driver of the U.S. petrochemical 
industry, the global financial turmoil is still 
making itself known. In particular, the pos
sibility of a Greek debt default last summer 
caused uncertainty in financial markets 
and economic slowing.
North American producers felt the im
pact through some slippage in prices and 
volumes at a time when ethane costs were 
temporarily spiking. In the second half of 
the year we saw things slow down a little 
bit, says Grant Thomson, president of ole
fins and feedstocks at Nova. The second 
half of the year was still pretty good, but it 
wasnt as good as the first half.
According to John Stekla, director of 
olefins studies at IHS Chemical, U.S. pro
duction of ethylene increased 2.0% in 2011, 
including a large buildup of inventories at 
the end of the year. However, exports of 
derivatives fell by 10%, Stekla says, as sup
pliers kept product at home to serve local 
customers. Overall, the net effect was a 
0.4% increase in derivative demand for U.S. 
producersnot bad considering the U.S. 
doesnt have a lot of spare ethylene capacity.
Profitability is now bouncing back. Brian 
Ames, Dows vice president of olefins, 
aromatics, and alternatives, says prices 
reached a low point in December. Since 
then, he has observed continual improve
ment as sales volumes crept back up and 
feedstock costs plummeted.

Stekla notes that profit margins for eth
ylene on the spot market are now the high
est they have been since 1988. Spot prices 
have been extremely high, even though 
demand is relatively tepid, he says.
Observers expect the growth in North 
American output to be similar this year 
to what it was in 2011. Novas Thomson 
expects North American output of polyeth
ylene, the largest-volume ethylene deriva
tive, to rise 1.52.0%.
Although North American companies 
have been enjoying good profits for some 
time, the rest of the world is still near the 
trough of the petrochemical business 
cycle. In North America, the industrys 
nameplate 
operating 
ratethe 
percentage 
of overall ethylene capacity that is up and 
runningstands at about 90%, according 
to IHSs Stekla. The global average, in con
trast, is about 87%.
If you look at the global industry op
erating rate in 2011, were pretty much in 
the trough, Dows Ames says. Yet with its 
higher relative profitability, the U.S. indus
try looks to be further along in the upswing 
of the business cycle. 
Trough conditions are particularly evi
dent in Europe, which must contend with 
a relatively high cost structure, economic 
woes over sovereign debt, and proximity 
to plants that opened in the Middle East in 
2009 and 2010. According to IHS, Western 
European operating rates are about 84%.
During a conference call with analysts 
last month, LyondellBasell Chief Executive 
Officer James L. Gallogly disclosed that his 
companys European olefins output fell by 
13% during the fourth quarter while profit 
margins slipped to nearly break-even levels.
We continue to aggressively pursue 
restructuring in this region, he told in
vestors, noting that the company plans to 
close two small polypropylene production 
lines in Wesseling, Germany. Similarly, 
Ineos is evaluating the future of the smaller 
of its two ethylene crackers in Grange
mouth, Scotland.
Gerd Lbbert, executive vice president 
of polyolefins at Austrian petrochemical 
maker Borealis, acknowledges that the sit
uation in Europe is dire. Profitability has 
eroded in line with demand and has been 
below sustainable levels, he says. Lbbert 
adds that the benefits European crackers 
enjoy from producing lucrative coproducts 
such as propylene dont sufficiently offset 
the increasing European disadvantage ver
sus gas-based production in the U.S. and 
Middle East.
EUROPES 
WOES are a 180-degree change 
from a decade ago, when U.S. executives 
thought that the disadvantages they faced 
versus naphtha-cracking counterparts in 
Europe and Asia would last forever. Now 
they believe that their relative advantage, 
if it isnt permanent, will at least endure a 
number of years. The reason for their opti
mism is a so-called virtuous cycle that will 
secure a reliable supply of feedstocks.
Low natural gas prices have caused gas 
exploration companies to cut back on drill
ing. That might seem like bad news. How
ever, high oil prices ensure that natural gas 
liquids sell at a healthy premium above nat
ural gas, although at enough of a discount to 
oil to make them economical chemical raw 
materials. IHSs Barrasa says drillers can 
charge as much as $11 per million Btu more 
for natural gas liquids than for natural gas.
The composition of hydrocarbon re
sources varies considerably from region to 
region. Exploration companies preferen
tially develop wells in places that will yield 
a large amount of natural gas liquids rather 
than in locations with mainly dry gas.
In a presentation at Decembers Gulf 
Petrochemicals & Chemicals Association 
meeting in Dubai, Chevron Phillips Chemi
cal CEO Peter L. Cella outlined the eco
nomics at play that promise to yield ethane 
for the petrochemical industry.
To earn a 10% return on the cost of capi
tal for a new dry gas well, a driller needs nat
ural gas prices of $2.00 to $5.00 per million

Btu, he noted. However, for wells focused 
on natural gas liquids, 
the 10% return price 
needed for the natural gas production is ac
tually zero because the driller earns its en
tire return on the liquids production, which 
tends to be priced off crude oil, Cella said.
THIS IS THE REASON why the gas com
panies that are pulling back on natural gas 
drilling are also reassuring investors that 
they are increasing exploration for natural 
gas liquids, Barrasa observes. The only 
thing that can meaningfully affect the drill
ing for gas liquids is if we get a sharp cor
rection in oil prices, he says.
It really shows how much things have 
changed, where exploration companies 
actually talk about going after liquids and 
almost treating the gas as the coproduct, 
Novas Thomson says. It wasnt long ago 
that they just went after the natural gas and 
the liquids were just by-products that you 
wanted to get rid of.
Ethane oversupply is hitting the market 
from all this drilling. According to IHS, the 
U.S. will see more than 400,000 bbl per day 
of new ethane supply by 2020, a more than 
40% increase from todays levels. Since the 
beginning of the year, ethane prices have 
dropped from 84 cents per gal to 54 cents, 
Barrasa says.
With its success tied to petrochemical 
makers that buy natural gas liquids, the 
gas industry needs chemical companies to 
build more capacity. Given their own mo
tivation to boost profits, chemical produc
ers are willing to oblige. But it takes three 
or four years to build an ethylene cracker. 
Thus, the market will see only incremental 
capacity additions until 2016.
These projects will cap an enormous 
spate of capacity additions. North Ameri
can firms will add about 8.4 million metric 
tons per year of new ethylene capacity by 
2017, IHSs Stekla says, a 35% expansion of 
the regions output.
Of the companies that announced new 
ethylene crackers over the past year, Chev
ron Phillips was the first out of the gate with 
an announcement last spring. It intends to 
build a 1.5 million-metric-ton ethylene crack
er at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, 
Texas, and downstream polyethylene plants.
Dow was the second company with a 
cracker announcement. Its planned Gulf 
Coast unit is part of a comprehensive plan 
to integrate downstream ethylene deriva
tives into shale-based feedstocks. The 
initiative involves restarting a cracker in 
Hahnville, La., that the company idled in 
2009 plus upgrades to other crackers.
Propylene is an important part of Dows 
plan. The company recently inked a licens
ing agreement with Honeywells UOP 
engineering unit for a propane dehydroge
nation unit that would add 750,000 tons of 
propylene capacity in Texas by 2015. Dow 
plans a second propylene unit that would 
use its own technology.
Ames points out that Dows acrylic, 
propylene oxide, and epoxy operations are 
large consumers of propylene. But with 
the propylene supply becoming tighter, 
the cost of buying propylene relative to the 
cost of buying propane and converting it 
into propylene is such that we are better off 
buying propane, he says.

oxo chemicals business has a large ap
petite for propylene. When asked during 
a recent conference call whether the firm 
will restart a cracker at its Longview, Texas, 
complex, CEO James P. Rogers mentioned 
that the company is instead considering 
an olefins conversion unit, which likely 
refers to a metathesis unit that makes 
propylene from ethylene via a butylene 
intermediate. Similarly, LyondellBasell 
is building another metathesis unit at its 
Channelview, Texas, complex.
Sasol is studying a cracker at its Lake 
Charles, La., complex that would have up to 
1.4 million metric tons of capacity. A spokes
man says the company is in discussions with 
a potential partner for the project. If we 
build an ethylene cracker, there will be some 
derivatives that will be Sasol only, and some 
partner derivatives, the spokesman says.
Shell is also planning a cracker, but un
like the other projects, its plant is planned 
for the Northeast to tap into the Marcellus 
Shale, a geological formation extending 
from New York state through West Virginia. 
The company hasnt yet selected a site for 
the project.
Formosa Plastics is 
the latest firm to an
nounce a new ethylene 
cracker. Last week, the 
company disclosed 
plans to build an 
800,000-metric-ton-
per-year ethylene crack
er at its Point Comfort, 
Texas, site. The $1.7 bil
lion project, to be com
pleted in 2016, will also 
include a low-density 
polyethylene plant and 
a 600,000-metric-ton 
propane dehydrogena
tion unit.
Occidental Petro
leum has hinted that it 
is considering building 
an ethylene plant. Last 
June, the firm signed 
a transport agreement with pipeline firm 
DCP Midstream so it can ship natural gas 
liquids from the Eagle Ford Shale basin in 
Texas to a proposed gas processing plant 
in Ingleside, Texas, where  Oxy makes vinyl 
chloride. At the time, the company 
said the processing plant would al
low it to explore various options 
for the future supply of ethylene at 
the plant.
Beyond those that have been an
nounced, one or two more crackers 
could be proposed for the U.S., IHSs Stekla 
says. One could be a second project in the 
Northeast to take advantage of the Mar
cellus Shale. There might also be another 
cracker on the Gulf Coast, although he notes 
that even with the flood of ethane due to hit 
the market, an additional cracker in the re
gion might run into feedstock constraints.
MANY FIRMS that arent building new 
crackers are expanding existing facilities to 
leverage the shale boom. Nova is perhaps 
the most ambitious of these companies. It 
has inked agreements to bring ethane from 
the Marcellus Shale up to its complex in Co
runna, Ontario, and from oil fields in North 
Dakota to its plants in Joffre, Alberta. The 
company is also conducting studies, due for 
completion later this year, about expanding 
the Corunna cracker and perhaps building 
polyethylene plants in Corunna and Joffre.
When all the new capacity hits the mar
ket around 2017, the U.S. could very well see 
a downturn in the petrochemical business 
cycle. Yet Novas Thomson notes that the 
North American industry seems to have 
missed the current petrochemical trough 
entirely, a phenomenon that has caused 
him 
to 
doubt 
what 
he 
long 
thought 
he 
knew.
The longer Im in the industry, the less 
I believe in the cycle, he says. When I 
first came into the industry in the late 80s, 
everybody talked about how its a seven-
year cycle, and were going to have two 
good years, and everybody is going to build 
capacity, and well have five bad years. I just 
dont believe that anymore. Shale gas, he 
says, has turned all of that upside down.
