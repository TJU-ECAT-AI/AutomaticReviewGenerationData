Irreversible deactivation of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation
catalysts was investigated by deactivating the catalysts (4 wt% Cr)
through prolonged calcination in air at temperatures up to
1200C. Nitrogen physisorption, X-ray diffraction, diffuse re-
flectance spectroscopy in the UVvisible region, X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and cata-
lytic measurements revealed that two deactivation mechanisms
were responsible for the formation of catalytically inactive alumina-
incorporated Cr3+ species: (i) entrapment of Cr3+ ions inside the
alumina support during sintering of the alumina support and
(ii) migration of Cr3+ ions into the alumina support. Chromia that
had been impregnated on alumina inhibited the phase transforma-
tion from γ- to α-alumina. The presence of γ-alumina, in turn,
hindered the migration of Cr3+ ions into alumina. The turnover
frequency was higher for multinuclear Cr3+ than for isolated Cr3+
sites. The phase of the alumina support did not appear to affect the
activity of the surface Cr3+ species.

INTRODUCTION
The catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is of great im-
portance as an effective route for the production of propene
and other light alkenes (14). Chromia/alumina catalysts
are industrially used for this process, and much recent re-
search has been devoted to elucidating the structures of
alumina-supported chromium oxide (524). Despite these
efforts, there is no consensus on the origin of the catalytic
activity or on the deactivation mechanisms. In the following
we first summarize qualitatively the structures of chromium
known to be present in chromia/alumina catalysts and then
we define some unanswered questions regarding this com-
plex catalyst system.

Oxidized chromia/alumina catalysts contain chromium
in oxidation states Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+ (523). Cr6+ and
Cr5+ are reduced by alkanes, hydrogen, and carbon monox-
ide under typical dehydrogenation conditions (500600C)
(58, 1013, 16, 19, 21, 23). Oxidation state Cr3+ has most
often been proposed as the state existing after reduction
(58, 1013, 16, 19, 21, 23); some Cr5+ may remain after
reduction with hydrogen (25) and part of the chromium
may reduce to Cr2+ (13). Figure 1a shows one way of clas-
sifying the different types of Cr3+ species that are present
in reduced chromia/alumina catalysts. Type 1 sites are sur-
face Cr3+ sites, with subclasses type 1 and type 1, which
are presumably catalytically active. A type 1 site is an iso-
lated (i.e., mononuclear) Cr3+ ion that does not interact
with other chromium sites; it is sometimes referred to as dis-
persed Cr3+ (18). A type 1 site is a Cr3+ ion that has one or
more neighboring Cr3+ ions and thus is called multinuclear
Cr3+. Type 1 sites are also called Cr3+ clusters. In ad-
dition there are type 2 and type 3 sites, where the Cr3+
is not a surface ion but is buried inside chromia crystallites
(type 2) or the alumina support (type 3). Since types 2 and 3
are not surface species, they are not catalytically active.
Chromia crystallites consist of type 1 and type 2 sites to-
gether and may grow in size so that they become visible in
X-ray diffraction (XRD).
The Cr3+ species have also been classified in terms of
origin (7, 1012). Those Cr3+ ions that have been formed
through reduction of chromium in high oxidation states
(Cr6+ and Cr5+) in a reducing atmosphere are referred to as
redox Cr3+, whereas those Cr3+ ions that have been sta-
bilized as Cr3+ are referred to as nonredox Cr3+. Redox
Cr3+ is exposed on the surface and thus can be catalytically
active. Nonredox Cr3+ may be exposed and catalytically ac-
tive, but it may also be buried inside chromia crystallites or
insidethealuminasupportandthusbecatalyticallyinactive.
Redox Cr3+ is abundant in chromia/alumina catalysts with
low chromium loading, whereas nonredox is Cr3+ mostly
present in catalysts with higher loadings (10).
Figure 1b shows how the classifications in terms of type
and origin overlap. Since Cr6+ and Cr5+ sites are often iso-
lated on the alumina surface, type 1 sites and redox Cr3+

are largely the same. However, UVvisible near-infrared
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVvis NIR DRS), elec-
tron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR), and Raman spec-
troscopy have shown that Cr6+ and Cr5+ ions present
on oxidized chromia/alumina catalysts may have neigh-
boring chromium ions (26, 27). Thus, some redox Cr3+
probably falls in the category of type 1 sites. Exposed
nonredox Cr3+ should be mostly classified as type 1 with
minor contributions from type 1 sites, and nonexposed
nonredox Cr3+ should be classified as type 2 or type
3 sites.
Several questions need to be addressed in regard to the
chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts. Do the cat-
alytic activity and rate of deactivation of the various Cr3+
sites differ (7, 10, 12, 25)? Is Cr2+ present in chromia/
alumina dehydrogenation catalysts (13)? Does the phase
of the alumina support affect the catalytic activity of chro-
mia (19)? Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts have a high
chromium loading of about 15 atCr/nm2 (1). Can relevant in-
formation on the active sites be gained by studying catalysts
with low chromium loadings (6, 12, 13)? When used under
cycling of severe oxidizing and reducing conditions over a
period of years in industrial operations, chromia/alumina
catalysts deactivate through the formation of solid solu-
tions of chromiaalumina (1, 3). How does the irreversible
deactivation occur?
The main interest in the present work is the physico-
chemical processes leading to irreversible deactivation of
chromia/alumina catalysts. For this purpose, chromia was
supported on alumina containing various amounts of γ-, θ-,
or α-alumina. The catalysts were calcined at different tem-
peratures (600, 900, 1000, 1100, and 1200C) in order to
generate catalytically inactive Cr3+ species (21). On the
basis of studies by nitrogen physisorption, XRD, UVvis
DRS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ESR,
we propose a model describing the deactivation process
in terms of catalyst-support sintering and chromium mi-
gration. In addition, we discuss the effect of the alumina
support on the deactivation and the catalytic activity of the
various Cr3+ species.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst Preparation
Chromia/alumina samples with 4 wt% Cr were chosen to
evaluate the effect of alumina precalcination temperature
and catalyst calcination temperature on dehydrogenation
activity. At this loading, high dehydrogenation selectivities
should be obtained (10), and at the same time spectroscopic
characterization of the samples should be feasible. The sam-
ples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of
CrO3 (UCB chemicals, p.a.) from an aqueous solution onto
a commercial alumina support (AKZO 001-1.5E) that had
been pulverized with a ball mill. Alumina was precalcined
in ambient air at 800, 1000, and 1200C for 24 h to pro-
duce supports with different surface areas and crystalline
phases. After impregnation, the samples were aged for 4 h
and dried for 4 h at 60 and 120C, respectively. The whole
catalyst batch was then calcined at 600C for 24 h; after
this, part of it was removed, calcination was continued at
900C for 24 h, part was removed, and so on, until the final
part of the catalyst batch had been calcined at 1200C for
24 h.
The samples are described in Table 1. In the following
they are referred to with one- or two-numbered sample
codes: the first number of the sample code indicates the
alumina precalcination temperature and the second num-
ber the catalyst calcination temperature. Thus, sample 8 is a
