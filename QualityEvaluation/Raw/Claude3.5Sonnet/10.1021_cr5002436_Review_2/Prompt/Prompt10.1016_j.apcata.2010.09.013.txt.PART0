Light alkane dehydrogenation was investigated over a series of mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts con-
taining 215 wt.% chromia, synthesized via the supramolecular templating technique. The catalysts
were characterized by N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, Fourier transform infrared spec-
troscopy (FTIR), UVvis (ultra violet visible), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature
programmed reduction (TPR). Depending on chromia loading, chromium was found to be present essen-
tially as two surface species, each possessing one short terminal Cr
O bond and polymeric species. UVvis
and XPS studies revealed that the surface chromium occurs in two chemical states as Cr(III) and Cr(VI)
species. Investigation of ethane and propane adsorption by in situ diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy
(DRIFT) revealed the formation of adsorbed acetaldehyde, acetone, formate and acetate. During the dehy-
drogenation reaction, acetate/carboxylate and hydrocarbon species were detected. Under otherwise the
same conditions, the alkane dehydrogenation activity increased with increasing chromia loading. The
activity of regenerated catalysts was found to be lower than the corresponding fresh catalysts, suggest-
ing that the deactivation is partly permanent. Detailed characterization studies of spent and regenerated
catalysts indicated that the formation of subsurface Cr(III) species during dehydrogenation may be the
reason for the permanently lost activity.

1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes has a significant
industrial impact because it upgrades low cost feedstock into valu-
able olefins [13]. Nowadays, dehydrogenation of ethane, propane
and iso-butane has become an important route to meet the increas-
ing demand for light olefins. Dehydrogenation of alkane is an
endothermic process which requires high temperature and low
pressure to obtain high olefin yield [1]. However, high reaction
temperature leads to thermal cracking of the feedstock and the
formation of coke. It is thus important to develop catalysts with
high activity, selectivity as well as the ability to suppress thermal
cracking reactions during light hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.
Supported chromium oxide catalysts have been widely used
for alkane dehydrogenation [13]. Among the various supported
chromia materials, a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been used on a com-
mercial scale for years [1]. The catalytic activity is related to the
nature of surface chromium, whose speciation is strongly depen-
dent on the nature of oxide support and the chromium content
[4,5]. Depending on the loading, surface chromium may be present
as isolated monomeric species, polymeric species or a combination
thereof. Air-calcined chromia-alumina catalysts possess chromium
species with different oxidation states and coordinations [6]. At

relatively high loading, a heterogeneous distribution of various
chromium species is expected [49]. Thus, definite knowledge
regarding the nature of active sites is important to better under-
stand the structure-reactivity relationship.
Previous studies reported that supported chromia catalysts
deactivate during alkane dehydrogenation reaction, most likely
due to the deposition of carbonaceous material [10,11]. Ibarra
et al. [11] studied the process of coke deposition during the
dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene over chromia-alumina
catalysts using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.
They concluded that the carbon-containing deposits were com-
prised of both aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Using in
situ UV (ultra violet) Raman spectroscopy, during propane dehy-
drogenation over chromia-alumina, Sullivan et al. [12] observed
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and polyenes at relatively low
reaction temperature (400 C), and mainly conjugated olefins at
high reaction temperature (>500 C). Our group monitored the sur-
face composition of silica-supported chromia catalysts during the
dehydrogenation of ethane and identified carbon deposit as the
main source of catalyst deactivation [13,14]. It was also found
that regenerated catalysts exhibited the same activity vs. time-on-
stream (TOS) behavior as the corresponding fresh materials. The
present contribution deals with light hydrocarbon dehydrogena-
tion over novel chromia-alumina catalysts with well-developed
mesoporosity and relatively high surface area. Ethane and propane
dehydrogenation reactions were investigated by in situ diffuse
reflectance FTIR spectroscopy (DRIFT) to determine the nature

of species formed. The effect of temperature and TOS was also
evaluated. Contrary to chromia-silica catalysts [13,14], the cur-
rent chromia-alumina materials did not fully recover their activity
upon oxidative regeneration. The reason for partial, irreversible
deactivation of the catalysts was delineated based on comparative
characterization of fresh, spent and regenerated catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of mesoporous chromium and aluminum mixed
oxide catalysts
Mesoporous mixed oxide catalysts with different chromia con-
tents were synthesized using the procedure reported by Morris
et al. [15]. An amount of 2.0 g (EO)20(PO)70(EO)20 triblock copoly-
mer (Pluronic P123) and the required quantity of chromium nitrate
nonahydrate [Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, Aldrich] were dissolved in 20 mL of
anhydrous ethanol and allowed to stir for 4 h. The required amount
of aluminum isopropoxide was dissolved separately in 3.2 mL
of 6870 wt.% HNO3 and 10 mL of anhydrous ethanol. The total
amount of metal (aluminum and chromium) species (20 mmol) was
kept constant and the ratio of chromium to aluminum was adjusted
to obtain a final chromium oxide content in the range of 215 wt.%.
Once dissolved, the aluminum isopropoxide solution was trans-
ferred to the chromium-containing solution using an additional
10 mL of ethanol. The combined mixture was stirred for another
5 h. Solvent evaporation was carried out at 60 C for 48 h in air with-
out stirring. The resulting samples were calcined in air for 6 h at
700 C in a furnace using a heating rate of 1 C/min. The obtained
catalysts were denoted as xCrAl (x = 215), where x represents the
wt.% of chromium oxide considered to be Cr2O3. Similarly, spent
and regenerated catalysts were referred to as xCrAl-S and xCrAl-R,
respectively.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorptiondesorption
measurements at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 adsorp-
tion analyzer. Before adsorption measurements, all samples were
degassed under vacuum (1 × 105 Torr) at 150 C for 3 h. The BET
surface areas were calculated from the adsorption isotherm in the
relative pressure range from 0.06 to 0.2. The pore size distributions
(PSD) were calculated from the nitrogen adsorption data using the
BarrettJoynerHalenda (BJH) method with KrukJaroniecSayari
(KJS) correction [16], and the maximum of the PSD was considered
as the average pore size. The pore volume was considered as the
volume of liquid nitrogen adsorbed at P/P0 = ca. 1.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were
obtained on a Philips PW3710 diffractometer using CuK radiation
( = 1.5418 
A) from 1.4to 70with a scan speed of 1/min.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of represen-
tative samples were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission
electron microscope operated at 200 kV. Samples were dispersed in
ethanol by moderate sonication. Then, a carbon-coated Cu TEM grid
was dipped in the sample suspension and dried overnight under
vacuum at 80 C before analysis.
In situ FTIR spectra for all dehydrated samples were collected
with a Nicolet Magna IRTM-550 spectrometer coupled with dif-
fuse reflectance accessory and a high temperature IR cell (Thermo
Spectra-Tech). Before acquiring the spectra, all samples were
heated to 500 C in flowing 10% O2He (30 mL/min) and held at this
temperature for 1 h. The spectra were collected using 256 scans at a
resolution of 4 cm1. To eliminate the effect of support, each spec-
trum was subtracted by the spectrum of pure alumina acquired
separately under similar condition.
In situ FTIR studies of alkane adsorption over chromia-alumina
catalysts were performed in the same setup as mentioned above.
Prior to the measurements, all catalysts were pretreated in flow-
ing 10% O2He (30 mL/min) at 500 C for 1 h. Subsequently, the
IR cell was cooled down to room temperature and purged with
pure helium for 30 min to remove traces of oxygen that may be
present. The feed gas containing 10% C2H6He (or 5% C3H8He)
was introduced into the IR cell at a total flow rate of 30 mL/min.
The flow rate of each gas stream was adjusted by separate mass
flow controllers (Bronkhorst). The cell temperature was increased
at an increment of 25 C up to 200 C, then at 50 C increments up
to 600 C (580 C for propane). Spectra were collected at different
temperatures using the background KBr + He and KBr + He + ethane
or propane. The latter background was chosen to eliminate the gas
phase contribution of ethane/propane in the overall spectra. The
spectra were collected using 256 scans at 4 cm1 resolution.
For time-dependent FTIR, fresh catalysts were loaded in the IR
cell and pretreated at 600 C (500 C for propane dehydrogenation)
for 1 h in flowing 10% O2 in He. The cell was then purged with
pure helium (30 mL/min) for 30 min. The feed gas 10% C2H6He
(or 5% C3H8 in He) was introduced in the cell at a total flow rate of
30 mL/min. For propane dehydrogenation, the temperature of the
cell was raised to 580 C after flushing with helium. Spectra were
collected after 7 min of time-on-stream (TOS) and every 10 min
thereafter, up to 1 h. Before collecting the spectra, the cell was
purged with helium and the alkane flow was resumed after col-
lecting the spectra.
Raman spectra for dehydrated chromia-alumina catalysts were
obtained with a Horiba-Yvon LabRam-HR spectrometer equipped
with a confocal microscope (Olympus-BX41), notch filter, and
a 1800 grooves/mm grating. The catalysts were excited with
514.5 nm Ar-laser in the 2001200 cm1 region. Typically, the
material was loaded in the reaction cell (Linkam-CCR 1000) heated
to 500 C in flowing 10% O2He (30 mL/min) and held at this tem-
perature for 1 h before acquiring the spectra. The temperature of
the cell was held constant using a temperature controller (Linkam-
TMS94). A spectral acquisition time of 10 s/20 scan was used.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were
performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD (delay-line detector)
spectrometer using a focused monochromatized AlK radiation
(1486.6 eV). The material was spread on a sample holder using
double-sided tape and introduced into the treatment chamber. The
sample was maintained under high vacuum (ca. 108 Torr) prior
to transferring it to the XPS analysis chamber, which was main-
tained at ca. 109 Torr. A low energy electron gun was employed
to minimize the charging effect. XPS survey scan spectra were col-
lected using 160 eV analyzer electron pass energy in ca. 2 min, while
the high resolution XPS region scan spectra were obtained at 20 eV
pass energy within a short period of time (ca. 12 min) to avoid or
minimize the photo-reduction of surface chromium species that
may be induced by X-rays [1719]. The binding energies were cali-
brated using the peak of adventitious carbon (C 1s) at 284.6 eV [19].
Quantitative calculations of the surface atomic concentrations of
different elements present in the samples and the composition of
different chemical states of surface chromium were obtained by
peak fitting of XPS spectra using Vision 2.0 software, provided by
Kratos Analytical Ltd., UK.
The UVvis spectra of fresh, spent and regenerated catalysts
were collected on a Varian Cary 300 UVvis spectrophotometer
coupled with a diffuse reflectance accessory.
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) measurements for
xCrAl catalysts were performed on a Zeton-Altamira instru-
ment (AMI-200) using hydrogen as reducing agent. The sample
(60120 mg) was loaded in a U-shaped quartz reactor. Prior to the
TPR measurements, samples were pretreated at 200 C for 1 h in
flowing Ar (30 mL/min) to remove any moisture and other impuri-

ties that may be present. After cooling the reactor to 40 C, a 10%
H2Ar (30 mL/min) gas mixture was introduced. The catalyst was
then heated to 900 C at a rate of 10 C/min, and the hydrogen
consumption was measured using a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD). Hydrogen pulse calibration was performed after each TPR
experiment to quantify the hydrogen consumption.
2.3. Reaction studies
Dehydrogenation of ethane and propane over xCrAl catalysts
was performed in an isothermally operated fixed bed U-shaped
quartz reactor mounted in a tubular furnace. A measured quan-
tity of catalyst was loaded in the reactor between two layers of
quartz wool. A K-type thermocouple placed in a quartz tube was
inserted in the catalyst bed to measure and control the temperature
of the catalyst using a PID controller. The flow rates of reactant and
pretreatment gases were adjusted by mass flow controllers (MKS).
Prior to activity measurements, the catalyst was heated to 480 C in
flowing N2 and calcined at the same temperature for 1 h in flowing
air. Subsequently, the reactor was purged with N2 (50 mL/min) for
30 min and the bed temperature was raised to 580 C. The feed gas
containing 5% C3H8He was introduced into the reactor at a total
flow rate of 50 mL/min. The product gases were directed through a
heated transfer line for analysis using a Agilent 6890N GC equipped
with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a GS-GasPro PLOT capil-
lary column (60 m × 0.32 mm ID). The product gases were analyzed
after 7 min TOS, then at 10 min intervals up to 1 h. The reactor
was purged with nitrogen for 30 min and the temperature brought
down to 480 C. The gas flow was switched to air to regenerate the
catalyst. The reactor was then purged with nitrogen for 30 min and
the temperature was raised to 580 C. Another set of reaction data
were collected as describe above.

The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area, pore volume and
average pore sizes for all samples are listed in Table 1. All isotherms
exhibited a hysteresis loop with sharp nitrogen evaporation and
condensation steps suggesting the presence of mesopores with nar-
row PSDs. As shown in Table 1, the pore size, pore volume and
surface area of xCrAl samples exhibited a decreasing tendency as
the chromia loading increased. Nonetheless, the pore sizes of all
samples were particularly large (710 nm). Moreover, considering
the average molecular weight of the materials (102152 g/mol),
the BET surface areas and pore volumes were also relatively high.
The powder XRD patterns for xCrAl catalysts are shown in Fig. 2.
All samples exhibited a prominent single peak in the low angle
region (2 2.0) characteristic of mesoporous materials [15]. The
absence of additional XRD peaks is indicative of the occurrence
of a non ordered wormhole pore structure. Samples with chro-
mia loading up to 9 wt.% did not reveal features associated with
crystalline Cr2O3, whereas 15CrAl sample showed the occurrence
of bulk Cr2O3 crystalline phase [13]. These results suggest that
chromium oxide is highly dispersed at least up to 9 wt.% loading.
A typical TEM image of 9CrAl (Fig. 3) shows clearly the meso-
porosity of the material. Consistent with XRD data, the pore
structure exhibited no order. Furthermore, although difficult to
measure, the pores appear to be of the order of 10 nm, which is
consistent with N2 adsorption measurements.
3.2. Raman and FTIR spectroscopy of dehydrated materials
Raman spectra for dehydrated xCrAl catalysts are shown in Fig. 4.
The spectra revealed bands at 1018, 890, 655, 560 and 380 cm1.
While the band at 890 cm1 was weak for 2CrAl, its intensity
increased and leveled off for all other samples. This band was
assigned to the asymmetric stretching mode of bridging CrOCr

wavenumber band at 1018 cm1 is attributable to the symmet-
ric stretching mode of CrO2 units associated with a very short
chromiumoxygen bond [9,20]. The broad band at ca. 655 cm1
belongs to the symmetric stretching vibration of CrOCr units, and
the 380 cm1 band to the bending vibration of CrO2 units [9,20]. The
appearance of CrOCr bridging bond vibration at high wavenum-
ber (890 cm1) suggests that the surface chromium oxide species
consisted of chromate in a polymeric structure [9,20]. Consistent

with XRD data, only the 15CrAl sample showed a Raman band at
560 cm1, characteristic of crystalline Cr2O3 [9].
The IR spectra for dehydrated xCrAl catalysts are shown in Fig. 5.
In the overtone region, two IR bands at 2045 and 2015 cm1 were
observed for samples with chromia loadings of 7 wt.% and higher.
For the 5CrAl sample, only the 2015 cm1 band was observed,
whereas no overtone bands were detected below 5 wt.%. Literature
data indicated that at low chromium loading, these overtone bands
are too weak to be observed [5]. These two high wavenumber bands
are the overtone of the 1020 and 1005 cm1 bands, respectively
[5]. In the present study, the bands at 1020 and 1005 cm1 were
obscured by the strong absorption of alumina. These bands were
assigned to two surface species, each associated with short terminal
Cr O bond (mono-oxo) [5]. As discussed above, the presence of very
high wavenumber Raman band at ca. 1018 cm1 (Fig. 4.) also sug-
gests the occurrence of a very short chromium-oxygen bond [9,20].
Thus, IR and Raman spectra indicate the occurrence in dehydrated
xCrAl catalysts, of two surface species each possessing one short
terminal Cr O (mono oxo) bond along with polymeric species.
3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
The XPS spectra for fresh xCrAl (x = 215 wt.%) catalysts are
shown in Fig. 6. The binding energy values corresponding to Cr 2p3/2
and atomic concentration for chromium are summarized in Table 2.
The Cr 2p3/2 binding energy values of ca. 579.5 and ca. 577.5 eV were
attributed to Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively [13,21,22]. The Cr(III)
peak relative intensity increased with increasing chromia loading.
However, it was difficult to assign binding energy position for Cr(III)
species in samples with low loadings, although UVvis data (vide
infra) indicate the presence of Cr(III) species. In chromia supported

on silica, minor amounts of surface Cr(II) species were observed
by XPS [13,14,23], whereas Cr(II) species were not observed in the
current materials. It has also been proposed that the formation of
Cr(II) on Al2O3 is difficult as Al2O3 stabilizes the Cr(III) species [24].

charge transfer of chromate species [6,25]. Raman spectra also
revealed a band at 890 cm1 due to the chromate species as dis-
cussed above. A weak shoulder at 452 nm was assigned to the
d-d transition (A2g T1g) of Cr(III) in octahedral symmetry [25].
This band may also originate from dichromate/polychromate [6].
It is symmetry forbidden in the Td coordination and its detection
depends upon the distortion of the chromate local symmetry [25].
The intensity of this band increased with increasing chromia load-
ing. An additional band at 588 nm observed only for 15CrAl, may
be due to another d-d transition (A2g T2g) of Cr(III) in octahedral
symmetry [25]. The UVvis and XPS spectra of xCrAl catalysts sug-
gest that chromium is present primarily in two oxidation states as
Cr(VI) and Cr(III). Depending on the chromia loading, Cr(III) may be
present as surface accessible sites or buried as subsurface species.
The latter type of Cr(III) is not accessible, thus catalytically inac-
tive [26]. The presence of dd transition band position of Cr(III) in
the spectrum of 15CrAl at high wavelength (ca. 616 nm) suggest the
presence of Cr(III) species buried inside the chromia crystallite or in
the alumina support [26]. This assignment will be further supported
by the characterization of spent and regenerated catalysts.
3.5. Temperature programmed reduction using hydrogen (TPR)
As seen in Fig. 8, all samples with up to 9 wt.% chromia showed
a single hydrogen consumption peak at 348387 C, correspond-
ing to the reduction of dispersed chromia species. Moreover, the
Tmax values listed in Table 1 indicate that there is a downward shift
in Tmax with increasing chromia loading. Earlier studies revealed
that bulk Cr2O3 exhibits two reduction peaks at 244 and 518 C
(broad) [13]. Comparison of TPR results indicate that the reduction
temperature approached that of bulk Cr2O3 species as the load-
ing increased. However, Rao et al. [13] reported that the maximum
reduction temperature, Tmax for silica supported chromia catalysts
(ca. 404415 C) was relatively independent of chromia loading.
Thus, the reducibility of dispersed chromia species depends on the
nature of oxide support. The hydrogen consumption calculated per
gram of catalyst increased with chromia loading, whereas, the H/Cr
ratio decreased. The H/Cr ratio of ca. 2.0 was obtained for low chro-
mia loading (2 wt.%) whereas the H/Cr ratio for 9CrAl was ca. 1.5.
Hence, the extent of reduction in H2 decreases at higher chromia
loading. Previous studies revealed that bulk Cr2O3 is less reducible
than supported chromia catalysts [13,27].
3.6. Alkane dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation was performed over xCrAl catalysts
at an iso-contact time of 0.001 g min/mL and 580 C using propane
mole fraction of 0.05 in nitrogen at atmospheric pressure. The
products observed were mainly propylene and trace amounts of
methane, ethane and ethylene. The latter three products were also
detected during thermal dehydrogenation of propane under similar
reaction condition. The propane conversion and propylene selec-
tivity were calculated at different TOS but only values at 7 min
and 67 min are presented in Table 3. The selectivities were calcu-
lated based on the products detected without taking into account
the coke deposited on the catalysts. The selectivities of methane,
ethane and ethylene were combined together and presented as
C1C2 selectivity. From Table 3, it is observed that the propane
conversion at a particular TOS increases with increasing chromia
loading up to 9 wt.%, then levels off. As discussed earlier, Raman and
XRD data for 15CrAl revealed the presence of bulk Cr2O3 species.
The activity of crystalline Cr2O3 was reported to be lower than dis-
persed chromia species [14]. These results suggest that the propane
dehydrogenation activity increases with increasing chromia load-
ing up to the monolayer coverage (ca. 4 Cr/nm2 [1]) and level off
or decreases thereafter. The propylene selectivity was consistently
above 95% for all samples up to a conversion level of 15%. After
the first cycle of reaction, all catalysts were regenerated in flowing
air at 480 C for 1 h and tested again for propane dehydrogenation.
Table 3 shows that under similar condition, the regenerated cat-
alysts exhibited lower propane dehydrogenation activity than the
corresponding fresh catalysts, suggesting that a portion of active
sites were deactivated irreversibly (vide infra).
All the catalysts were also tested for ethane dehydrogenation
and the activity data are presented in Table 4. The reaction was
carried out at iso-contact time of 0.0032 g-min/mL and 600 C using
ethane mole fraction of 0.5. Similar to propane dehydrogenation,
the ethane conversion increased with increasing chromia loading
up to 9 wt.%. The ethylene selectivity was above 99% at all con-
versions (up to 13.35%) for all catalysts. The main other product

dehydrogenation, all used catalysts showed lower activity (Table 4)
for ethane dehydrogenation after regeneration at 480 C in flowing
air (50 mL/min) for 1 h. The spent and regenerated catalysts were
characterized by a number of techniques to delineate the deactiva-
tion process.
3.6.1. DRIFT study of alkane adsorption
DRIFT measurements of adsorbed ethane and propane were car-
ried out on 9CrAl catalyst between 25 and 600 C using 10 mol%
alkane in helium. The spectra were recorded at temperature incre-
ments of 25 C up to 200 C, then at 50 C increments up to 600 C.
Selected spectra collected using KBr + alkane + He background are
shown in Figs. 9 and 10Figs. 9A, B and 10A, B. The background was
chosen to suppress the strong CH stretching band of alkane allow-
ing changes in the 3100 and 2800 cm1 region to be observed. The
IR band at ca. 1615 cm1 was attributed to adsorbed moisture.
Adsorption of ethane on 9CrAl revealed IR bands at 1670, 1320
and 1250 cm1 attributable to (C O), as(CH3) and as(CC) vibra-
tions of adsorbed acetaldehyde, respectively [28]. In the case of
propane adsorption, the IR bands at 1680 and 1370 cm1 are typical
of adsorbed acetone species. They were assigned to the (C O) and
s(CH3)) bond vibrations [28]. These bands disappeared completely
at 200 C, indicating that adsorbed acetaldehyde/acetone species
are not stable above this temperature. The formation of acetalde-
hyde/acetone suggests that the gas phase alkane adsorbed on the
catalyst through formation of alkoxide (ethoxide and isopropox-
ide) species, which are readily converted to acetaldehyde/acetone
(Fig. S1, Supplementary Material) [29]. Thus, the formation of
alkoxide species which were not detected in the present study is
the first step for the alkane dehydrogenation reaction. The IR bands
at 2967, ca. 2880, 14401450, 1380 and 1350 were assigned to the
formate species ((CH), as(COO), (CH) and s(COO), respectively)
[2931]. The bands at 2967 and 1380 cm1 were not observed
during ethane adsorption. The IR band at ca. 2880 cm1 gradually
disappeared at increasing temperature suggesting that the formate
species is not stable at high temperature. The bands at 15601570
(as shoulder), 1450 and 1350 cm1 are typical of adsorbed acetate
or carboxylate species (as(COO), s(COO) and s(CH3), respec-
tively) [3133]. Adsorption of propane on chromium-free Al2O3
revealed IR bands due to the presence of acetate or carboxylate
species only (Fig. S2, Supplementary Material). The absence of
acetaldehyde or acetone bands suggests that pure alumina has no
active sites for light alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Two other
bands at 3771 and 3730 cm1 (Figs. 9B and 10B) were attributed
to the basic and neutral AlOH bond vibration [5]. The former
band was not observed at low temperature. The band at 2985 cm1
together with the band at 2940 cm1 (Figs. 9B and 10B) were

a broad band at 3060 and a shoulder at ca. 1590 cm1 devel-
oped. They are generally attributed to unsaturated and/or aromatic
species strongly bonded to the catalyst surface [11,34,35]. These
may be the precursors for the carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst
surface.
3.6.2. Time-dependent DRIFT of alkane dehydrogenation
The DRIFT spectra were collected at different TOS, under reac-
tion conditions for ethane and propane dehydrogenation at 600 C
and 580 C, respectively. The main IR bands observed during
propane dehydrogenation appeared at 3066, 2985 (weak), 2945,
2888 and 2830 cm1 (Fig. 11). Several of these bands have already
been observed in DRIFT spectra recorded during propane adsorp-
tion at different temperatures. The bands at 2985 (weak) and
2945 cm1, observed since the beginning of the reaction, were
assigned to CH bond vibrations of aliphatic groups [34]. The
band at 2888 cm1 was attributed to formate species. A band
at 3066 cm1, which has generally been attributed to unsatu-
rated and/or aromatic species strongly bonded to the catalyst
surface [11,34,35], developed at 17 min of TOS. A band at ca.
15901580 cm1 as shoulder (not shown) attributed to the same
species [34] was also observed. Moreover as the TOS increased, the

intensity of these bands increased. Similar results were obtained
for ethane dehydrogenation reaction.
3.7. Characterization of spent and regenerated catalysts
As discussed above (Tables 3 and 4), the activity of the xCrAl cat-
alysts was not restored completely after the first cycle of operation
suggesting that a fraction of the active sites deactivated irreversibly.
To understand the loss of activity of chromia-alumina catalysts, the
spent and regenerated materials were characterized. For this par-
ticular study four catalysts with chromia loading 2, 5, 7 and 9 wt.%
were chosen. The catalysts were regenerated at 480 C in flowing
air (50 mL/min).
The N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms for regenerated cata-
lysts are depicted in Fig. 12. All isotherms showed a hysteresis loop
with sharp nitrogen evaporation and condensation steps character-
istics of mesopores with narrow PSDs, similar to the corresponding
fresh catalysts. These findings suggest that the regenerated cat-
alysts retained their mesoporous structure. Moreover, as seen in
Table 5, the BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter were
found to be comparable to the corresponding fresh catalysts.
To determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts after
1 h of propane dehydrogenation, the spent catalysts were analyzed
thermogravimetrically (TGA). Typically, a known amount of spent
catalyst was heated to 800 C in flowing of N2 and from 800 to
1000 C in flowing air at 10 C/min. The amount of coke (ca. 16 wt.%)
determined by TGA was relatively independent of chromia loading.
UVvis spectra of spent catalysts are shown in Fig. 13. All spec-
tra revealed bands due to the presence of surface chromate in the
charge transfer region (260 and 360 nm). However, the intensity
of such bands was found to be lower than the fresh catalysts sug-
gesting that the Cr species at higher oxidation states were reduced
during dehydrogenation reaction.
The presence of a band due to the Cr(VI) at 260 and 360 nm
suggests that the surface chromate species were not reduced
completely during dehydrogenation reaction. Interestingly, an
additional band at 616 nm attributable to a pseudo-octahedral
Cr(III) species [6,25] was also observed. Moreover, the intensity of
616 nm band increased with increasing chromia loading. This band
was also observed during alkane dehydrogenation over chromia-
silica catalysts [14,23]. The fresh catalysts were reduced using 10%
H2 in argon under similar condition used for propane dehydrogena-
tion to confirm appearance of this band in reducing environment.
The band was also observed in a fresh catalyst after reduction
with H2 indicated that it is associated with a reduced species
(Fig. S3, Supplementary Material). After propane dehydrogena-
tion, the catalysts were regenerated in flowing air at 480 C for
1 h. As depicted in Fig. 14, UVvis spectra of regenerated catalysts
revealed that the intensity of chromate bands at 275 and 370 nm
recovered to a certain extent. The occurrence of a band at 608 nm
typical of Cr(III) coordinated in octahedral symmetry suggests that
a fraction of surface chromia species has not recovered. Previous
studies reported that the high wavelength dd transition band at
ca. 600 nm may be due to coordinatively saturated Cr(III) species
[6,25] or Cr(III) species buried in the alumina matrix [26].

The XPS spectra of spent catalysts as shown in Fig. 15 revealed
only a single peak centered at ca. 577 eV (Table 2) due to the
presence of Cr(III) species. However, UV-vis spectra showed bands
due to Cr(VI), in addition to Cr(III) species. The XPS spectra of
regenerated catalysts revealed two peaks centered at ca. 579 and
577 eV (Table 2) due to the presence of the Cr(VI) and Cr(III)
species. Moreover, the peak intensity of Cr(III) species was higher
in the regenerated catalysts than the corresponding fresh catalysts.
These results suggest that catalytically inactive Cr(III) species have
formed which cannot be converted to the higher oxidation state
Cr(VI) during the oxidative regeneration. De Rossi et al. [23] also

reported that Cr(III) species in reduced chromia alumina catalysts
cannot be converted completely to the higher oxidation state. In
contrast, the Cr(III) species in spent chromia-silica catalysts were
completely converted to Cr(VI) species during oxidative regener-
ation [14] and the activity recovered completely. Thus, the lower
activity of regenerated vs. fresh chromia-alumina catalysts is asso-
ciated with the formation of inaccessible, catalytically inactive
Cr(III) species.

4. Conclusions
Mesoporous chromia-alumina catalysts with up to 15 wt.%
Cr2O3 were synthesized via a supramolecular templating tech-
nique. Depending on loading, chromium species occurred as
two surface species each possessing one short terminal Cr O
(mono oxo) bond and polymeric species. Furthermore, the surface
chromium species occurred in two chemical states as Cr(VI) and
Cr(III). The relative amount of surface Cr(III) species increased with
chromia loading.
Adsorption of ethane and propane on 9CrAl catalyst revealed the
presence of various surface species such as acetaldehyde/acetone,
acetate and formate. The occurrence of acetaldehyde and acetone
was consistent with the prior formation of alkoxide species (ethox-
ide and isopropoxide) by abstraction of hydrogen from ethane or
propane as the first step for the dehydrogenation reaction. Under
reaction condition, unsaturated and/or aromatic species strongly
bonded to the catalyst surface, which are possible precursors for
carbon deposits, were formed and the amount of these species
increased with increasing TOS.
Regenerated catalysts exhibited lower activity than the corre-
sponding fresh catalysts. Detailed characterization studies of spent
and regenerated catalysts indicate that during alkane dehydro-
genation a portion of chromium species is converted to inaccessible
Cr(III) species. These inactive Cr(III) could not be converted to
higher oxidation states during the regeneration process. It is thus
inferred that the partial irreversible loss of activity is associated
with the formation of such species.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
