Supported chromium catalysts with different support composition are studied by electron spin resonance 
spectroscopy (ESR), thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA), and 27Al 
magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic 
resonance (MAS-NMR). With ESR, the presence of C?+ (y-signal) and two types of Cr3+ 
(6- and B-signals) 
are observed; however, their concentrations are support-, loading-, and pretreatment-dependent. The C?+ 
loading increases with the alumina content of the support and can be maximized after moderate reduction 
temperatures and by using relatively low Cr loadings. Dispersed C13+ (6-signal) is formed by reduction, and 
its amount increases with A1 content of the support, Cr loading, and reduction temperature. On silica- 
alumina and alumina it is stable against recalcination. CrzO3-like clusters @-signal) are observed only on 
Cr/alumina after reduction and recalcination. TGA analysis indicates an increasing interaction strength between 
Cr and the support from silica over silica-alumina to alumina. The quenchiiig of the 27Al 
lines by paramagnetic 
Cr3+ 
was observed by 27Al 
MAS-NMR measurements on the recalcined samples. This quenching effect was 
stronger on the Crlalumina sample than on the Crlsilica-alumina samples, indicating C13+ substitution in 
octahedral A1 sites. The observed differences in redox behavior and dispersion of Cr between the catalysts 
are discussed in terms of the support properties and in relation with previous results obtained by diffuse 
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). 
Introduction 
Supported chromium catalysts are known to possess interest- 
ing catalytic 
The most important industrial 
application is in the production of polyethylene, 
known as the 
Phillips Particle Form Process.6 These catalysts are usually 
activated by a high-temperature oxidative pretreatment, followed 
by reduction using ethylene or CO.' Our knowledge of these 
catalysts is-despite large efforts-largely qualitative: different 
oxidation states (Crzf, Cr3+, Cr5+, and C#'+) and different 
molecular structures (chromate, dichromate, etc.) have been 
identified with infrared spectroscopy* 
(IR), X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopyg (XPS), 
Raman spectroscopy1 (RS), diffuse 
reflectance spectroscopy" (DRS), and electron spin resonance12 
(ESR). However, if one ever wants to relate these species with 
catalytic performances, quantitative measurements are necessary. 
Therefore, a research program has been set up for the 
development of methods to quantify CP+ species (with n 
between 2 and 6) and to elucidate the molecular structure of Cr 
in inorganic oxides. In previous studies,13-15 
we have reported 
(1) the quantification of Cr2+, Cr3+, and Cfi+ by diffuse 
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) after calcination, reduction, and 
recalcination, (2) the elucidation of the molecular structure of 
Cfi+ by DRS, and (3) the interaction between different probe 
molecules and supported Cr. Under hydrated conditions, the 
molecular structure is determined by the pH at zero point of 
charge (zpc) of the support and by the Cr loading. At low Cr 
loading, the chromate:dichromate ratio increases with increasing 
alumina content of the support or pH at ZPC of the support. At 
higher loadings, Cr is more polymerized, even on an alumina 
suport.' 
On calcined surfaces, the molecular structure is 
support and loading dependent. At relatively low Cr loadings, 
the dichr0mate:chromate ratio is highest for silica, zero for

alumina, and in between for silica-aluminas. Upon reduction, 
octahedral C P  
and octahedral and tetrahedral Cr2+ 
are formed. 
The ratio tetrahedral:octahedral CrZ+ 
at constant loading and 
reduction temperature depends on the support and follows the 
order silica > silica-alumina > alumina. The ratio Crz+:Cr3+ 
increases with reduction temperature 
for all supports, but at the 
same reduction temperature, the ratio follows the sequence silica 
> silica-alumina > alumina. 
Complementary results obtained by electron spin resonance 
(ESR), 27Al 
magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance 
(MAS-NMR), and thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) are 
presented in this paper. The ESR spectra are quantified and 
related to the previously published quantitative DRS data. The 
link between silica and alumina is made through the investiga- 
tion of a series of silica-aluminas with different silica contents. 
The results will be discussed in terms of redox behavior and 
dispersion of Cr. An overall picture of the relative concentra- 
tions of Cr2+, 
Cr3+, 
C$+, and CI6+ on amorphous supports after 
different pretreatments emerges. 
Methods 
1. Sample Preparation and Characterization. The prepa- 
ration of Si02 (SA100) and SiOyA1203 with 20,40, and 60 wt 
% Si02 (SA20, 
SA40, and SA60) and the characteristics of these 
supports are described elewhere.'' 
Two A1203 supports, one 
(SAO(1)) from Rh6ne-Poulenc and the other homemade (SAO- 
(HM)), were used. Their preparation and physical properties 
were published elsewhere.13J4 The supported Cr catalysts were 
prepared by the incipient wetness technique with aqueous 
solutions of chromium(V1) trioxide ( 0 0 3 ) .  The chromium 
loadings were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, and 8 wt % Cr. The 
impregnated samples were dried at 50 "C for 8 h and granulated. 
The selected size fraction was 0.25-0.40 mm.

quartz flow cell with Suprasil window for diffuse reflectance 
spectroscopy (DRS) and a side arm 
for electron spin resonance 
spectroscopy (ESR). With this cell, it was possible to take DRS 
and ESR spectra after the same pretreatment. The DRS spectra 
were discussed in previous papers.13-16 All the samples were 
calcined at 550 "C. The catalysts with a Cr loading between 0 
and 0.8 wt % were subsequently reduced in a flow of CO at 
200, 300, 400, and 600 "C during 0.5 h and recalcined at 550 
"C. After each treatment ESR spectra were recorded between 
120 and 370 K. The ESR spectra were taken using a Bruker 
ER 200 D-SRC instrument in X-band at a microwave power of 
200 pW with a double rectangular TE1w mode cavity. Quan- 
titative measurements were performed with a Bruker ESP 300E 
instrument in X band. Absolute spin concentrations were 
determined after double integration of the obtained spectra by 
using Cu(acac)flCl (acac = acetylacetonate) mixtures as 
standards (number of spins: 1016-1019/g). 
2.2. Thermogravimetrical Analysis. Thermogravimetrical 
analyses were performed on powdered samples, typically 20- 
40 mg, using the TG-DTA 92 of Setaram. All samples were 
measured in a dynamic atmosphere of dry oxygen in helium. 
The supports, the Cr catalysts, and CrO3 were dried at 100 "C 
calcination for 1 h, followed by calcining for 0.5 h at 550 "C 
(heating rate of 10 "Umin) in situ in the thermobalance. 
2.3. 27Al 
MAS-NMR Spectroscopy. 27Al 
MAS-NMR mea- 
surements were performed using a Bruker MSL 400 spectrom- 
eter at 104.2 MHz in a magnetic field of 9.4 T, with a tipping 
angle of about 15" and a spinning frequency of 14.5 kHz. 
Approximately 2000 scans were accumulated. The spectra were 
deconvoluted into Gaussian bands, the individual bands were 
integrated, and the integrated areas were expressed per unit 
weight of dry catalysts. 
2.4. X-ray Diffraction. X-ray diffraction pattems were 
recorded using an automated Siemens diffractometer, equipped 
with a Kristalloflex K710 rontgengenerator and a position- 
sensitive detector of Inel.

proposed in the literatre.',* 
This signal is formed on all 
supports. It attains its maximum intensity after reduction in 
the range 200-300 "C, the exact temperature depending on 
support and loading. Severe reduction pretreatments result in 
a total disappearance of this signal, while recalcination re- 
establishes it. The @-signal 
is ascribed to CrzOs-like clusters 
and is only formed on alumina after reduction and recalcination. 
Its amount increases with increasing Cr loading. The 8-signal, 
usually assigned to magnetically isolated or dispersed Cr3+ 
specie,J,* 
is formed on all supports after reduction. Its 
amount increases with increasing reduction temperature and Cr 
loading and remains in the spectra after recalcination on silica- 
alumina and alumina.

y-Signal. The shape of the y-signal depends on the support as 
shown in Figure 2 for Cr/SAO(HM) and Cr/SA100. The 
y-signals of the Cr/SAn catalysts with n = 
20, 40, and 60 are 
similar to those of Cr/SAO, suggesting C P  
in Al-rich phases. 
The g values were obtained by simulation with an axially 
symmetric Hamiltonian. The signals are usually interpreted as 
due to axially symmetric [Cr04l3- species with g l  = 1.975- 
1.895 and gll= 1.895 and an axially distorted tetrahedral species 
with g l  
= 
1.980 and gll= 1.950, the latter signal being resolved 
on Si02 only. The increase of the line width in going from 
silica to alumina is probably due to interaction of the unpaired 
electron of Cr5+ with the 27Al 
nuclei (
Z
 
= 
5/2). In any case, all 
CP+ are surface species, because line broadening is observed 
in the presence of 0 2  
at room temperature. 
The intensities of the y-signal follow the Curie-Weiss law, 
independently of the pretreatment and Cr loading. As an 
example, the reciprocal of the ESR intensities is plotted as a 
function of temperature (Z-l-T plots) for Cr/SA100 in Figure 
3. It is clear that the plots are almost linear, after linear 
extrapolation, and intersect the abscissa at 100-110 K. This 
is in accordance with Curie-Weiss behavior22 
where C is the Curie constant, x the molar susceptibility, T the 
absolute temperature, and B the Weiss constant. B depends on 
the support composition. For Cr/SAO and Cr/SA40 8 is 
respectively around 35-45 and 0-10 K. The latter numbers 
are obtained by linear extrapolation from ESR intensity mea-

surements above 110 K. The validity of this extensive 
extrapolation was not verified. In any case, the data do show 
that the magnetic behavior of C F  
is strongly support dependent. 
The extent to which 8 deviates from zero is a measure of the 
extent of CrS+-CI5+ interaction. Small 8 
values mean magneti- 
cally dilute c$+ 
systems, and high 8 
values mean magnetically 
concentrated CrS+ systems. If this is taken as an indication of 
dispersion of Cr over the supports, then Cr dispersion increases 
in the order Si02 <
<
 A1203 < SiO*Al203. 
1.2.2. ,&Signal. In our experiments, the #I-signal is only 
visible after reduction and recalcination of Cr/Al2O3 and can 
be easily studied after strong reduction and recalcination. The 
dependence of the &signal on pretreatment is shown in Figure 
4. It is observed that the ,&signal is broad and weak during 
the first reduction cycle. The peak-to-peak line widths (ppw) 
are in the range 1200-2000 G, while the g values are around 
2.45-2.09. 
Both parameters have a tendency to decrease with 
increasing reduction temperature. The signal becomes pro- 
nounced after recalcination with g = 
2.2 and a ppw of 900 G. 
Furthermore, the ppw decreases with increasing Cr loading. 
Above 320 K, the /3-signal follows the Curie-Weiss law, 
but its thermal behavior changes in the region 280-310 K, while 
lower temperatures broaden the signal. The NCel temperature 
(7") of a-CrzO3 is around 307 K,23 close to the 320 K, the 
limiting temperature for Curie-Weiss behavior of our samples. 
This indicates that the P-signal on alumina is due to CrzOs-like 
clusters, which are, however, too small in size or too small in 
number to be detected by XRD. The decrease of the ppw and 
the g value with reduction temperature suggests growing cluster 
sizes, the line w

being determined by exchange coupling 
and dipolar interaction between the Cr3+ 
ions. The first results

in an exchange narrowing of the resonance line; the second 
phenomenon gives line broadening." Therefore, smaller ppw's 
suggest larger Cr203-like clusters. Our results indicate 
that these 
clusters grow in size by increasing the reduction temperature, 
by increasing the Cr loading, and especially by recalcination. 
It is remarkable that no ,!%signal is observed on Cr/SiO*A1203 
clusters and on Cr/SiOz, but it does not mean that CrzO3-like 
clusters are absent. The /?-signals on these supports may be 
broadened beyond detection. 
1.2.3. &Signal. The d-signal of dispersed Cr3+ 
ions appears 
on all the supports after reduction (Figure 5
)
.
 The intensity of 
this signal increases with increasing Cr loading and reduction 
temperature. For the same reduction temperature it increases 
with the alumina content of the support. The position of the 
signal is also a function of the support: the maximum of the 
d-signal is at higher fields for Cr/SA100 (g around 4.4) than 
for the other supports ( g  around 5.0-5.5). 
After recalcination 
the signal is absent in the Cr/SA100 samples but remains on 
the other supports. This suggests that isolated C$+ ions are 
stabilized in or on A1203 and SiOyA1203 in such a way that 
they resist oxidation.
