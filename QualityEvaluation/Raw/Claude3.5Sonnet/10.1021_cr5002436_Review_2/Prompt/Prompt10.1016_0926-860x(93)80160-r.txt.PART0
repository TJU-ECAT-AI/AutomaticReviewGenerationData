Abstract
Isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on CrO.lZr02 (ZC) catalysts (0.04 to 1.9% chromium by
weight) in a flow apparatus at 673-873 K. Up to 823 K, molar selectivity to isobutenewas 95%,while
the only gaseous by-products were propene, methane and traces of propane. No skeletal isomerization
occurred up to 873 K. A deactivation was observed due to the formation of coke. The activity decay was
considerably delayed by adding a few percent hydrogen to the reactant mixture. In all cases, catalytic
activitywas completely recoveredby treatingthe catalyst with flowingoxygen at 773Kover 22 reaction-
regeneration cycles. The catalyst surface was conditioned mainly by the reaction atmosphere, so that
sample reduction with carbon monoxide at 623 K before catalysis did not influence the activity above
773 K. The turnover frequency per total surface chromium atom was found to be independent of surface
chromium concentration at all given temperatures, which indicated a mononuclear active site. A com-
parison with chromia/silica and chromia/j-alumina samples of similar chromium content revealed a
higher activity for the zirconia-based catalysts. The overall picture shows close similarities with that of
propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is con-
cluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity
in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear Criispecies with two coordinative
vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent 0 2- ion of the support.

INTRODUCTION
A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic
dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to
more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of
chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]. Zirco-
nium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support

[2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of
the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zir-
conia [5-12].
In a recent paper [13], we reported a study of the dehydrogenation of pro-
pane on CrOx/Zr02 catalysts and showedthatthe system is active and selective
to propene at 723-823 K. The main results of this study werethe following: (i)
the surface composition and with it the catalytic properties are conditioned
chiefly by the reaction atmosphere, irrespective of catalyst pretreatment, (ii)
oxygen treatment at 773 K completely restores the activity of a deactivated
catalyst, (iii) the active sites are mononuclear CrIllspecies, and (iv) adjacent
surface 0 2- ions of the support are also probably involved in the active centre.
In a subsequent study concerningpropane dehydrogenation on CrOx/Si02and
crOx/A1203, catalytic activity measurements were complemented by gas-vol-
umetric redox cycles, electron spin resonance (ESR) and Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies [14]; the results indicated that the CrIll ac-
tive species are endowed with two coordinative unsaturations. Moreover, the
average turnover frequency (propene molecules produced per second per total
chromium atom) was found to be substantially higher for the CrOX/Zr02 sys-
tem in comparison with CrOx/A1203 or CrO./Si02.
We have more recently turned our attention to the dehydrogenation of iso-
butane on the same type of chromia/zirconla catalysts and our findings are
included in the present paper. An added stimulus to our research was the im-
portance of isobutene in the synthesis of methyl tert-butyl ether, MTBE, by
reaction with methanol.
EXPERIMENTAL
Catalyst preparation
The zirconia support was prepared by hydrolysis of zirconium oxychloride
with ammonia, as already described [6,13]. After washing the precipitate to
get rid of Cl-, and drying at 383 K a "hydrous zirconia" was obtained. This
material was calcined in air at 973 K for 24 h in order to obtain a thermally
stable support at reaction-regeneration temperatures (up to 873K). Different
batches have BET surface areas in the range 15-18 m2g- 1• A potassium-con-
taining zirconia sample was prepared following the equilibrium adsorption
method [6,13] by contacting a portion of "hydrous zirconia" with a KN03
solution, set at pH = 9 by KOH addition, under shaking for 80 h. The sample,
which contained 0.36% potassium, was dried and calcined in air at 973 K for
24 h. This specimen is designated ZKO.36 (BET surface area = 19.4 m2g- 1 ).
{'-Alumina was obtained by thermal decomposition of boehmite at 773 K
according to Mc Iver et al. [15] (BET surface area 185 m2g- 1 ) . Silica from
Degussa (Aerosil 300,BET surface area 287 m2g- 1 ) was used.

CrOX/Zr02 (ZC) samples were obtained by the equilibrium adsorption pro-
cedure at pH=1 (by HNOs addition), as specified in refs. 6 and 13. Zirconia
calcined in air at 973 K was used. The catalysts are designated ZCx, where x
represents the approximate chromium content as wt.-%.
CrOX,K20/Zr02specimens were prepared in one oftwo ways: (a) byequilib-
rium adsorption at pH = 1 (by HNOs addition), using a portion of ZKO.36 as
support (about 80 h shaking) or (b) by incipient wetness impregnation of a
portion of ZKO.36 with chromic acid solution. The samples are indicated as
ZCKx;y, where x and y represent the approximate content as weight percent
of chromium and potassium, respectively. Letter i is added in the case of im-
pregnation method.
CrOx/y-AI20s and CrO./Si02catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness
impregnation of the support and are designated ACxiand SCxi, respectively.
A sample of crystalline chromia was prepared by adding 150 ml of 1 M am-
monia solution to 700 ml of a 0.07 M chromium nitrate solution over 30 min
[16].

All the chemicals used in the preparations were reagent grade. Table 1 lists
the catalysts investigated and some of their features.
Surfacearea
BET surface areas measurements, using nitrogen as adsorbate at 77 K, were
carried out in the same apparatus employed for catalysis experiments.
Gases
Isobutane from Alphagaz (99.95%), nitrogen and helium from Rivoira (both
IP grade) were used without further purification. Hydrogen from S.I.O.
(99.9995%) was passed over a commercial purifier (Matheson model 6406).
Oxygenfrom S.O.L. (99.995%) was dried over magnesiumperchlorate. Carbon
monoxide from S.O.L. (99.995%) was submitted to double distillation at 77 K
and the middle fraction was then employed.
Catalysis line
The apparatus designed for activity measurements in flowingconditionsand
for catalyst conditioning (flow, circulation or static) has already been de-
scribed [13]. The analysis of reactants and products was carried out by gas
chromatography (Carlo Erba GC 6000 Vegaseries 2 gas chromatograph, cou-
pled with an integrator Spectra Physics mod. SP4290). C1 to C4hydrocarbons
were analyzed with a Chrompack Plot column (internal diameter 0.53 mm,
length 50 m, coating 10 J-lm Na2S04-doped AI20s) held at 403 K, and a flame
ionization detector. Hydrogen was analyzed with a column (length 2 m, inter-
nal diameter 4 mm) packed with silica gel operated at room temperature, and
a thermal conductivity detector.
Procedure foractivity measurements
The catalyst (0.5 g) was always submitted to a standard oxidation (s.o.)
with flowing oxygen at 773 K for 0.5 h before each catalytic run. The aim of
the treatment was to clean the surface of carbonaceous species left from pre-
vious experiments and restore the initial chromium oxidation state. After an
outgassing at 383 K, the sample could thereafter be reduced with carbon mon-
oxide at 623 K to a controlled extent and finally evacuated at 723 K for 0.5 h.
In this case, the extent ofreduction (eICr= number of electrons per chromium
atom) was determined by the carbon monoxide consumption, as previously
specified [13]. Alternatively, after s.o.the sample could be directly purgedwith
a flowof nitrogen, while adjusting the reactor temperature to the desired value
and contacted with the reactant stream (generally 5 molar % isobutane in
S. De Rossi et al. / Appl. Catal. A 106 (1993) 125-141
129
nitrogen, except when otherwise stated). The total flow-rates were in the range
20-200 mlsTP min-I, but most of the experiments were carried out at a total
flow-rate of 50 mlsTP min-I. The space velocity corresponding to the latter
flow-rate was 0.8 kg of isobutane per kg of catalyst per hour.
The mass balance for carbon and hydrogen (Be and B H, respectively), con-
version and selectivity to a given product i (C; and S;, respectively) were cal-
culatedas:

Vim; 8;=100
v:m; ,
(nc)in
(nH)in
(nc)out
(nc)out
where (nc)in' (nH)in and (nc)out, (nH)out represent the total number of carbon
or hydrogen atoms per mlsPT of gas mixture at the entrance and at the exit of
the reactor (respectively), v; stands for the number of carbon atoms per mol-
ecule of i, m, the number of molecules of i per mlsPT of gas at the exit of the
reactor and (n )out the number of carbon atoms in the products per mlsPT of
gas leaving the reactor.
The dehydrogenation rates, r, were calculated as molecules of isobutene pro-
duced per second in experiments where 50% ofthe equilibrium conversion was
not exceeded. Rates calculated with this procedure are lower than those eval-
uated in differential conditions. Our procedure is, however, reliable when used
to describe large effects. In fact, the underestimation of r amounts to around
30% when 50% equilibrium conversion is reached, assuming first order kinet-
ics. The reaction was generally followed for a period of 2 to 5 h, with an initial
analysis 5 min from the start, followed by others at approximately 15-min
intervals. A continuous deactivation occurred, as observed for propane dehy-
drogenation. Initial rates were evaluated using the equation In r= In ro- ar, as
in the previous study [13]; here a and r stand for the deactivation coefficient
and the time-on-stream, respectively. The implication of this deactivation law
will be discussed below. Average turnover frequencies N and initial average
turnover frequencies No were calculated as the ratio of rand ro to the total
number of surface chromium atoms, respectively.
Blank experiments
Preliminary tests were carried out with the reactor filled with nitric acid-
washed silica wool, using the standard mixture. With a flow-rate as low as 15
mlsTP min -1, no reaction was observed up to 773 K. At 823 K, the dehydroge-
nation rate was 1.3-1015 molecules s-1, while conversion to isobutene, methane
and propene (the only products detected) at a flow-rate of 44 mlsTP min" '
were 0.15, 0.06 and 0.02%. At 873 K, the reaction rate was 1.5-1016 molecules
s-1, while the conversions to isobutene, methane andpropene were at the same
flow-rate 1.6, 0.8 and 0.3% respectively. Traces of ethene were also observed
(ca. 0.03%).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The maximum surface concentration of chromium in the ZC catalysts in-
vestigated here is 1.9 Cr atoms nm - 2(sample ZCO.29). This value corresponds
to the maximum amount of chromium which can be anchored on zirconia by
equilibrium adsorption under our experimental conditions, as shown previ-
ously [6]. At this low chromium concentration, all chromium atoms are dis-
persed on the surface of zirconia and accessible to the reactant, as demon-
strated by a FT-IR study of adsorbed nitric oxide [11] (dinytrosyls are by far
the most abundant species) and a nitric oxide adsorption study (yielding NO/
Cr ratio :::::: 2) [10]. The situation is therefore particularly favourable for an
investigation of the nature of chromium active sites. To the same end, we se-
lected CrOx/Si02and CrOx/y-AI20s samples with chromium concentration in
the same region (well below the monolayer value) for a comparison with ZC.
Conversion selectivity and side reactions
The behaviourofthe CrOx/Zr02 system in the dehydrogenation ofisobutane
is exemplifiedin Fig. 1,where the results ofa typical experiment on the catalyst
ZCO.29 are reported for the reaction temperature 823 K and total flow-rate of
50 mlsTP min -1, with the standard mixture. Fig. 1a shows that conversion to
isobutene decreases continuously from 45% at 5 min on-stream to about 5%
at 110 min on-stream due to deposition of coke. Molar selectivity to isobutene,
calculated with regard to the sum of the analyzedproducts, is always over 96%.
It shouldbe noted that this way of calculatingthe selectivity does not take into
account those carbon-containing species which escape gas-chromatographic

analysis, in particular coke. Since the mass balance for either carbon or hydro-
gen is close to 100%, this method nonetheless remains reliable.
To measure the amount of coke formed duringreaction, specific experiments
were carried out on the catalyst ZCO.29 at 823 K. The experiments consisted
of a sequence of catalytic runs of different duration (6, 21, 112, 203 min), in
which the same initial activity and selectivity were observed. At the end of
each run, the catalyst was treated with a nitrogen flowat the reaction temper-
ature for 10 min and briefly outgassed at room temperature. Oxygen at about
7 kPa was then circulated over the catalyst at 773K for 30 min and the carbon
dioxide and water produced were collected in a trap at 77 K at the reactor exit.
The results in the form /time-on-stream/molecules C02XlO-

19/ are the following: /6/1.9/0.5/, /21/6.2/0.9/, /112/15.7/1.2/,
/203/18.3/1.3/. Since the flow of reactant is 2.5 mlsTP mln "! corresponding
to 6.7-1019 molecules min-lor 26.8-1019 carbon atoms min-I, the average con-
versions to coke are 1.2% in the first 6 min, 1.1% in the subsequent 15 min,
0.4% in the interval 21 to 112 min, and 0.1% from 112 to 203 min. When the
number of carbon atoms from coke are considered, a value very close to 100%
for the carbon mass balance is obtained; this indicates that no significant
amounts of any other carbon-containing compound are produced.
The results of the experiments designed to measure the amount of coke pro-
duced after various times-on-stream, can be utilized to examine the effect of
coke on the rate of the main reaction (dehydrogenation). This point is illus-
trated in Fig. 2, where the decrease of the dehydrogenation rate relative to the
initial one, (r0 - r) / r0' is reported vs. the amount of coke per unit catalyst sur-
face (carbon atoms nm:"). A deviation from a linear behaviour is observed
with increasing coke concentration. As a first approximation, it may be as-

sumed that, at low coke coverage, the number of active sites (to which the
dehydrogenation rate, r, is proportional) blocked by coke decreases linearly
with the amount of coke produced. This gives:
-dr/dCc=K
(1)
where C; indicates the concentration of coke as carbon atoms per catalyst unit
area. Moreover, previous studies from this and other laboratories [13,18,19]
have pointed out that coke is produced mainly by further dehydrogenation of
the alkene or else by the dehydrogenation of an unsaturated adsorbed precur-
sor of the alkene. Therefore, the rate of coke formation should increase with
that of alkene production, i.e. the dehydrogenation rate r. The simplest as-
sumption of the proportionalityofcarbon formation and dehydrogenation rate
gives
dCcld7:=K'r
(2)
From (1) and (2), we obtain (-dr/dCc ) (dCc/d7:) =KK'r, which reduces to
-dr/d7:=KK'r, and by finite integration from (0, ro) to (7:, r) finally gives:
Inr=lnro-a7:, (with a=KK'), l.e, the expression representing the deactiva-
tion of our catalytic systems (see Experimental). No assumption is made about
the chemistry and structure of coke. Some comments can however be made.
Fig. 2 shows that when the number of the coke carbon atoms equals the
number of chromium atoms on the surface of the sample ZCO.29 (ca. 1.9 atoms
nm- 2 ) the activity amounts to roughly 90% of the initial one. Therefore, al-
though coke formation probably starts at the dehydrogenation sites, the de-
posit grows and settles in such a way as to involve the surrounding areas of the
support as well. Moreover, it can be noted that there is still some activity when
the amount of coke corresponds to 20 carbon atoms nm:", i.e, ten times the
number of surface chromium atoms and almost three times the number of total
surface cations (7.2 atoms nm- 2 [6]).
The gaseous by-products were essentially methane and propene with minor
amounts of propane, as shown in Fig. lb. It should be recalled that conversions
are expressed as the percent ratio of carbon atoms pertainingto a given product
to the total carbon atoms leaving the reactor (see Experimental). Conse-
quently, a value of roughly 3 apparent in Fig. 1b for the (conversion to pro-
pene) / (conversion to methane) ratio actually indicates that the number of
molecules of the two hydrocarbons is similar. This result suggests that the
main reaction responsible for the formation of gaseous by-products is the
cracking of the isobutane molecule. It is conceivable that, unlike coke forma-
tion, cracking occurs on Breasted sites directly from the isoalkane. A mecha-
nism involving the protonation of the alkane and the formation of a non-clas-
sical pentacoordinated carbonium ion, which then decomposes into a methane
molecule and a carbenium ion, was proposed to explain the cracking of alkanes
on acidic materials, such as H-ZSM-5 [20,21] andH-Y zeolites [22]. Zirconia-

based catalysts possess considerably lowerBrenstedacidity. However, Nakano
et al. [23] used infrared spectroscopy to show that hydroxyl groups exist on
Zr02 capable of giving a pyridinium ion from adsorbed pyridine above 473 K,
therefore acting as Brensted acid sites. It should also be borne in mind that
the extent of the cracking reactions is very small with our catalysts, even at
823 K (see Fig. 1b), so that a few sites of sufficiently high strength would
probably suffice. A contribution of a surface initiated homogeneous reaction
cannot be ruled out, but blank experiments have shown that homogeneous
cracking never exceedsone tenth ofthat observed for the catalyst ZCO.29 (Fig.
1b).
Dehydrogenation experiments werealso carriedout at 873K on ZCO.29. The
results, not shown for brevity, are: (i) fast catalyst deactivation (only 40%
conversion to isobutene after 5 min on-stream, which drops to 10% after a
further 15 min; (ii) an almost constant selectivity to isobutene at 80%; (iii)
no isomerization of either isobutane or isobutene. The absence of skeletal iso-
merization of C4 applies to all ZC catalysts at any explored reaction tempera-
ture, up to 873 K.
Influence of the pretreatment and reproducibility of activity
Fig. 3 shows the results of several experiments on a single portion (0.5 g) of
differently pretreated ZCO.29 catalyst. The pretreatment adopted consisted of
s.o, (open symbols) or s.o. plus reduction with carbon monoxide at 623 K,
followedby an outgassing at 723 K for 30 min (solid symbols). It is seen that

prereduction is not important for experiments at 823 K (upper part of Fig. 3),
while there is an effect of prereduction for experiments carried out at 773 K or
below (lower part of Fig. 3). At 773 K or below, sample prereduction with
carbon monoxide leads to a higher initial activity, which declines with time-
on-stream. The s.o, sample displays lower initial activity and, depending on
the reaction temperature, the activity increases with time-on-stream, reaches
a maximum and then decreases (for a reaction temperature of 773 K) or con-
tinuously increases (for reaction temperatures of 723 K and 673 K).1t is also
noted (see Fig. 3, lower part) that, at high time-on-stream values, pretreat-
ment memory is lost, and the dehydrogenation rates of both s.o, and carbon
monoxide prereduced catalyst tend to converge at all given temperatures.
Concerning the regenerability of the catalyst ZCO.29, Fig. 3 (upper part)
shows that activity at 823 K (both initial value and trend with time-on-stream)
after 9 reaction-regeneration cycles (0) and 22 reaction-regeneration cycles
( X ) is almost identical. It is specified that between the two experiments, runs
at 873 K were also performed; moreover, different reactant compositions were
used in some cases. Other relevant features are the extent of reduction attain-
able with carbon monoxide at 623 K (3.00.1 electrons per chromium atom
measured from the 13th to the 17th cycle, a value conforming to that measured
for many fresh s.o. ZC specimens [5-13] and the BET surface area (17.6 and
17.4 m2g- 1 for the fresh catalyst after s.o. and 28 cycles, respectively).
Influenceofreactantcomposition
Isobutane concentration
The dependence of the dehydrogenation rate on isobutane concentration in
the reactant stream for the catalyst ZCO.29 is illustrated in Fig. 4. From the
two compositions, 5 molar% isobutane (open symbols) and 20 molar% isobu-
tane (solid symbols), we can estimate the reaction order with respect to the
reactant in this composition range. If we neglect the rate of the reverse reac-
tion, the reaction order for isobutane is: n=log(r(20)/r(5/log(20/5), where
r(20) and r(5) stand for rates when the reactant mixture contains 20% and 5%
isobutane, respectively. Basedon ro values, the calculation givesthe same value
(n= 1.0) for the whole explored range 673-823 K.
Hydrogen addition
Fig. 5 shows the influence of hydrogen addition to the reactant mixture for
experiments carried out with ZCO.29 at 823 K and 773 K. The presence of
hydrogen leads to a slowing down of the deactivation, accompanied by a de-
crease of the initial dehydrogenation rate. A similar pattern had previously
been noted in the dehydrogenation of propane on ZC catalysts [13].

Catalytic activityand chromium surface concentration
Fig. 6 illustrates the dependence of the reaction rate on chromium surface
concentration for the reaction temperatures 673,723, 773and 823K. Here, for
a series of samples, the specific initial dehydrogenation rate, roes) (molecules i-
C4Hss-1 nm- 2), is plotted vs.the chromium surface concentration ofthe sam-
ple. In Fig. 6, the lines represent the best fittings (least squares method) ofthe
ro(s) values of ZC catalysts (open symbols). It is noteworthy that: (i) the re-
action rate increases with chromium content, (ii) a linear increase satisfac-
torily represents the experimental data, (iii) at any temperature, the extrap-

olation to abscissa=0 shows a positive intercept, which represents a
contribution not relatedto the chromiumcomponent. This underlines the need
to examine the activity of the support; moreover, since zirconia activity de-
pends on the extent of surface hydration [13], it was essential to measure the
dehydrogenation rate of zirconia in the same experimental conditions as those
of the ZC samples. The results for the support are shown in Fig. 6 as solid
symbols at abscissa = O. It can be seen that the intercepts of the lines drawn
for ZC catalysts satisfactorily match the experimentally measured activity of
the support.
The evaluation of the turnover frequency requires the knowledge of the
number of active sites, which is difficult to assess particularly in the case of
supported oxides. To compare different catalysts, however, estimates should
be made of the average turnover frequencies, N (molecules S-1 atc/ ), with
respect to all surface chromium atoms. This calculation is significant since aU
chromium atoms present in ZC samples are exposed on the surface, as already
mentioned. This estimate represents a lower limit for the true turnover fre-
quency of active sites, since not all exposed chromium atoms necessarily func-
tion as active sites. Furthermore, due to the deactivation, it is convenient to
evaluate initial values No, as specified under Experimental.
For the calculation, it is further assumed thatthe contributionofthe support
to the activity of the ZCcatalysts does not substantially change with the chro-
mium surface concentration. Specifically, the contribution of the support is
assumed equivalent to the intercept value at the various temperatures. Indeed,
at maximum chromium concentration (ca. 1.9 atom nm:"), the fraction of
zirconia surface covered by chromium is 1.9/7.2=0.26 (7.2 represents the
number ofsurface cations per nm"on zirconia [6] ). Consequently, the fraction
s. De Rossi et al. / Appl. Catal. A 106 (1993) 125-141
137
of bare zirconia surface contributing to the activity of the ZC samples varies
from about 1 (most dilute ZC samples) to 0.74. As a first approximation,
changes in this contribution may be considered negligible. Given the above
assumptions, the conclusion can be drawn that Nodoes not substantially vary
with the chromium surface concentration at a given temperature, and its value
corresponds to the slope of the line. Specifically, Novalues of 2.8, 9.4, 19 and
28'10- 3 molecules i-C4Hs S-l atc/ may be calculated for the reaction temper-
atures 673 K, 723 K, 773 K and 823 K, respectively.
The independence ofthe turnover frequency ofthe chromium concentration
was also deduced for the dehydrogenation of propane [13,14]. In these pre-
vious studies, specific experiments of selective oxidation of CrI to CrIll with
water enabled us to assess the active oxidation state of chromium (CrIll). The
results of the present investigation suggest that the chromium active species
operating for isobutane dehydrogenation is identical with that of propane de-
hydrogenation, namely a mononuclear Crll site with two coordinative
vacancies.
ZCK catalysts
Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to con-
tain small quantities (up to a fewpercent) of alkali ions, very often potassium.
Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related
to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (crack-
ing and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the
catalyst. To verify whether potassium exerts a similar positive influence to
chromia/zirconia catalysts, weexamined some ZCK samples. As a preliminary
measure, we analyzed the effect of the potassium addition to the pure support.
Zirconia-supported alkali ions have recently been studied by X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopy (XPS) [24]. Unlike Na + , potassium is not incorporated
upon a heat treatment at 773K and tends to remain well dispersed on the Zr02
surface. In the present work, we examined a sample containing 0.36 wt.-% K
(ZKO.36),which should conform to these previous findings.
Concerning the catalytic properties, we found that: (i) the dehydrogenation
rate for ZKO.36 is roughly one order of magnitude lower than that for Zr02'
(ii) the deactivation and cracking rates for the two samples are similar.
In order to examine the influence of potassium on the catalytic properties of
chromia/zirconia catalysts, we investigated two samples with different potas-
sium content (namely ZCKO.26; 0.36i and ZCKO.37; 0.06). Fig. 7 illustrates
the main results, together with the corresponding ones for the sample ZCO.29,
for the purpose of comparison. Given the difference in chromium concentra-
tion, the results are shown as average turnover frequencies per total chromium
atoms. No allowance was made for the support activity, since estimates of this
part of activity at various times-on-stream are unreliable.

The catalyst ZCKO.26; 0.36i displays lower initial activity and slower deac-
tivation in comparison withthe catalystZCO.29. It can be notedthatpotassium
addition (0.36 wt.-%) produces a lower activity decrease in the case of chro-
mium-containing system (at most a factor 4 at 773 K, compare Dand.in Fig.
7) than in the case of zirconia, where at the same temperature the decrease
was 10 fold, as already mentioned. A tentative explanation can be offered, by
recalling that potassium ions do not tendto be incorporated and therefore they
are externally adsorbedto the oxygen ions, preventingthem from participating
in the catalytic process. As regards the comparison of the potassium effect on
pure zirconia and on chromium catalysts, the more marked influence on pure
zirconia is related to the different nature of the active sites in the two cases, as
suggested in the paper dealing with the dehydrogenation of propane on the
same catalytic system [13]. Finally, it can be noted that the addition of a
quantity of potassium as low as 0.06 wt.-% (sample ZCKO.37; 0.06) has no
effect on either dehydrogenation rate or deactivation.
Concerning the cracking reactions, the conversion to C1-Cahydrocarbons at
823 K is lower (and consequently the selectivity higher) for ZCKO.26; 0.36i in
comparison with the ZCO.29 sample, especially for the early minutes on-stream.
Specifically,the conversion to C1-Cahydrocarbons at 823 K in 140min changes
from the initial 1.3% to 0.3% on ZCO.29, while the corresponding values mea-
sured for ZCKO.26; 0.36i are 0.3% and 0.2%.
Comparison with chromiaon silica and chromia on y-olumina catalysts
The activity of pure silica and pure y-alumina in the dehydrogenation of
isobutane was measured using the standard mixture and the usual mass of

catalyst (0.5 g). For silica, the initial rate, To, and the selectivity to isobutene
at 823 K were 1.0'1016 molecules S-l and 65%, respectively. The by-products
observed consistedof propene and methane, in almost equal amounts, together
with traces of ethene. For y-alumina, the To was 1.7'1016 molecules s-1 at 823
K. Selectivity to isobutene amounted to roughly 50%. Products other than the
primary ones included propene and methane in almost identical quantities,
and n-butenes, which indicates that skeletal isomerization (probably of the
isoalkene) occurred to some extent. Butadiene was also formed. Specifically,
the selectivity to n-butenes was 13% and that to butadiene 3%.
With reference to the chromia/silica and chromia/y-alumina catalysts ex-
amined in the present study, namely SC0.46i and ACO.62i, the initial dehydro-
genation rates, To ,were 14.9'1016 molecules S-l and 11.3'1016 molecules S-l
at 823 K, respectively. Comparison with the corresponding data for Si02 and
y-A120sreported above shows that the maximum contribution of both supports
to the activity ofthe supported chromium catalyst is 10%.At 823 K, selectivity
to isobutene was 90% for both SC0.46i (propene and methane, produced in
similar amounts, as the only by-products) and ACO.62i (selectivity to n-bu-
tenes  6%, selectivity to propene and methane, again present in very similar
quantities,  4%).
Fig. 8 shows the initial turnover frequencies per total chromium atom, NOt
for SCO.46i and ACO.62i, directly evaluated from To (with no correction for the
support activity), together with those determined for the ZC catalysts and a
sample of a-Cr20S' At each temperature (723 K, 773 K or 823 K) , (i) the No
values are substantially higher for the ZC catalysts compared with the other
systems and (ii) there is little difference among SC0.46i,ACO.62i and a-Cr20S'
An analogous result had been noted for the dehydrogenation of propane [13,14]
and clearly points to the importance ofthe support for alkane dehydrogenation

on chromium-based systems. For a detailed discussion on this point, reference
is made to our previous work [14]. Here it is recalled that, after standard oxi-
dation (s.o.), isolated Crv species (a probable precursor ofthe mononuclear
CrIll active species formed in the reducing reaction atmosphere) are present
on chromiajzirconia in much higher concentrations in comparison with those
on chromia/alumina andchromia/silica. This fact may account for the higher
activity of the former material. Moreover, the 0 2 - of the support near the
chromium active species may also have a role in the reaction.
CONCLUSIONS
The overall picture emerging from the reported data shows closesimilarities
with that of propane dehydrogenation studied previously. With reference to
the chromia/zirconia system, these similarities mainly concern: (i) the inde-
pendence of the activity above 773 K of catalyst prereduction, (ii) the effect
ofpotassium addition, (iii) the invariance ofthe turnover frequency with chro-
mium loading and (iv) the much higher turnover frequency in comparison
with those of CrOxjSi02 and CrOxjA120 3• Moreover, the turnover frequency
values for the dehydrogenation of isobutane are similar to those observed for
the dehydrogenation of propane. Specifically,the No values for the isobutane
reaction on chromia/zirconia are ca. 20% lower than those for the propane
reaction in the overall temperature range explored. It is inferred that the same
active site is operating in both reactions. In this respect, both previous and
present data indicate that mononuclear Crll species with two coordinative
unsaturations and, most probably, an adjacent 0 2 - ofthe support are involved.
