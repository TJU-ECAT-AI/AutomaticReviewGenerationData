The given literature does not provide information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or their key industrial applications. The text focuses on a specific study of propane dehydrogenation using chromia/silica and chromia/alumina catalysts, but does not discuss the broader context or historical development of these catalysts. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based solely on the provided document.

However, the literature does touch on some research focus areas related to chromium oxide catalysts, including:

1. Support materials: The study examines chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica and alumina.

2. Active sites: The research suggests that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies is the active site for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Structure: The study investigates different oxidation states of chromium and their effects on catalytic activity.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The research explores the adsorption of CO and NO on catalyst surfaces and their implications for catalytic activity.

While these aspects provide some insight into current research interests, they do not offer a comprehensive overview of the evolution and industrial applications of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933.

给定的文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史演变或其主要工业应用的信息。该文本主要集中于使用氧化铬/二氧化硅和氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的具体研究，但并未讨论这些催化剂的更广泛背景或历史发展。因此，仅基于所提供的文档无法全面回答这个问题。

然而，该文献确实涉及了一些与铬氧化物催化剂相关的研究重点领域，包括：

1. 载体材料：该研究考察了以二氧化硅和氧化铝为载体的铬氧化物催化剂。

2. 活性位点：研究表明，具有两个配位空位的单核CrIII是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。

3. 结构：该研究调查了铬的不同氧化态及其对催化活性的影响。

4. 反应机理：该研究探讨了CO和NO在催化剂表面的吸附及其对催化活性的影响。

虽然这些方面提供了一些当前研究兴趣的见解，但它们并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的演变和工业应用的全面概述。
