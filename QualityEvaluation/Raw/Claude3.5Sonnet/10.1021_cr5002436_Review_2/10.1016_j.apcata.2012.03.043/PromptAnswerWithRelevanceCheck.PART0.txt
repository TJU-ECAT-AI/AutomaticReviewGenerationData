The given scientific literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or their key industrial applications and research focus areas. The document focuses on a specific study of mesoporous CrTiO2 catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, but does not provide a broad historical overview of chromium oxide catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the given text.

The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or their key industrial applications. The document focuses on a specific study of mesoporous CrTiO2 catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad overview of chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

However, the document does discuss some aspects related to chromium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation, such as:

1. The importance of chromium oxidation state, structure, and interaction with the support in determining catalytic performance.

2. The use of titanium oxide as a support material for chromium catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

3. Investigation of active sites, including the role of different chromium species (Cr(VI), Cr(III), etc.) in the reaction.

4. The influence of chromium content, dispersion, and polymerization on catalyst activity and selectivity.

5. The study of acid properties and their effect on catalytic performance.

These aspects reflect some of the research focus areas in the field of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts, but do not provide a comprehensive historical perspective or overview of industrial applications.

给定的文献并不包含关于铬氧化物基催化剂自1933年以来的历史演变或其主要工业应用的信息。该文档主要集中于研究介孔CrTiO2催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的应用，而不是提供铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中的广泛概述。因此，无法根据所提供的文本直接回答这个问题。

然而，该文档确实讨论了一些与铬氧化物脱氢催化剂相关的方面，例如：

1. 铬的氧化态、结构以及与载体的相互作用对催化性能的重要影响。

2. 使用二氧化钛作为丙烷脱氢反应中铬催化剂的载体材料。

3. 对活性位点的研究，包括不同铬物种（Cr(VI)、Cr(III)等）在反应中的作用。

4. 铬含量、分散度和聚合度对催化剂活性和选择性的影响。

5. 酸性质及其对催化性能的影响研究。

这些方面反映了铬氧化物基脱氢催化剂领域的一些研究重点，但并不能提供全面的历史视角或工业应用概述。

This literature does not provide information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. The document focuses on a specific study of mesoporous CrTiO2 catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, rather than giving a broad historical overview. It does not discuss the key industrial applications or long-term research focus areas for chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. The text is limited to describing the synthesis, characterization, and performance of mesoporous CrTiO2 materials in a particular reaction, without placing this in a broader historical context.
