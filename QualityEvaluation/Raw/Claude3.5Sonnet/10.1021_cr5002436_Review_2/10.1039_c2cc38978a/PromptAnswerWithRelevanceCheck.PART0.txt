The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer some insights into current research focus areas and industrial applications:

1. Industrial application: The text mentions the use of chromium oxide-based catalysts (specifically Cr/Al2O3) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This is highlighted as an important process due to increased demand for propylene in plastic production and recent shale gas exploitation.

2. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the active sites of the catalyst. Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation, while Cr6+ is considered inactive.

3. Support materials: The catalyst described uses alumina (Al2O3) as a support material for the chromium oxide.

4. Deactivation mechanisms: A key area of research is understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation. Rapid deactivation is mentioned as a disadvantage of supported chromia catalysts. Coke formation is identified as a major cause of deactivation, occurring under the high temperature and low pressure conditions used for dehydrogenation.

5. Characterization techniques: The paper describes the development of new in-situ characterization techniques, specifically the use of UV-Vis spectroscopy in a pilot-scale reactor to study the catalyst under realistic reaction conditions. This allows for monitoring of coke formation and combustion in real-time.

6. Reaction conditions: The study of optimal reaction conditions is another focus area, as temperature affects both conversion and selectivity of the reaction.

While the paper doesn't provide a comprehensive historical perspective, it demonstrates that current research on chromium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation processes focuses on understanding active sites, deactivation mechanisms, and developing new characterization techniques for in-situ studies under industrially relevant conditions.
