[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale."

[3] "dd transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm."

[4] "Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive."

[5] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts are used for propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene, which is in increasing demand for plastics production. This application has gained renewed interest due to the shale gas boom.

2. Structure and active sites: Research focuses on understanding the different chromium species present in the catalyst. UV-Vis spectroscopy is used to study the dd transitions of chromium oxide species. Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation, while Cr6+ is considered inactive.

3. Support materials: The literature mentions alumina as a support material for chromium oxide catalysts (chromia/alumina catalysts).

4. Reaction mechanisms: The document does not provide specific information on reaction mechanisms.

5. Challenges: Rapid deactivation is noted as a disadvantage of supported chromia catalysts, indicating an area of ongoing research focus.

6. Characterization techniques: UV-Vis spectroscopy is highlighted as a frequently used method to study these catalysts under reaction conditions, allowing researchers to observe changes in chromium species and coke formation.

While the literature does not provide a historical perspective on the evolution of these catalysts since 1933, it does give insight into current research interests and industrial applications of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的全面概述。然而，它确实强调了这些催化剂在脱氢过程中当前重要性和研究重点领域的一些关键方面：

1. 工业应用：铬氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢生产丙烯，丙烯在塑料生产中的需求不断增加。由于页岩气的繁荣，这一应用引起了renewed兴趣。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点是了解催化剂中存在的不同铬物种。UV-Vis光谱用于研究铬氧化物物种的dd跃迁。Cr3+物种被认为是脱氢的活性位点，而Cr6+被认为是无活性的。

3. 载体材料：文献提到氧化铝作为铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料（铬/氧化铝催化剂）。

4. 反应机理：文档未提供有关反应机理的具体信息。

5. 挑战：快速失活被指出是负载型铬催化剂的一个缺点，表明这是一个持续研究的重点领域。

6. 表征技术：UV-Vis光谱被强调为在反应条件下研究这些催化剂的常用方法，使研究人员能够观察铬物种和积碳形成的变化。

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来这些催化剂演变的历史视角，但它确实提供了铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中当前研究兴趣和工业应用的洞察。
