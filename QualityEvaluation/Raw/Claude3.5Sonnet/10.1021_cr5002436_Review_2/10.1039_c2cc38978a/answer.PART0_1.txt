The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer some insights into current research focus areas and applications:

1. Structure and active sites: Research has focused on identifying the active chromium species. Cr3+ is proposed to be the active site for dehydrogenation, while Cr6+ is considered inactive.

2. Support materials: Alumina is used as a support for chromium oxide catalysts.

3. Promoters: Sodium (1 wt%) is mentioned as an additive to the catalyst formulation.

4. Characterization techniques: UV-Vis spectroscopy is frequently used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under dehydrogenation conditions.

5. Industrial applications: Propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene is highlighted as an important industrial application.

6. Challenges: Rapid deactivation is noted as a disadvantage of supported chromia catalysts, indicating an area of ongoing research focus.

7. Reaction mechanisms: The document mentions coke formation as a deactivation mechanism, suggesting that understanding and mitigating this process is an important research area.

While the document provides some current insights, it does not offer a comprehensive historical perspective on the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但它确实提供了一些关于当前研究重点领域和应用的见解：

1. 结构和活性位点：研究重点在于识别活性铬物种。Cr3+被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点，而Cr6+被认为是无活性的。

2. 载体材料：氧化铝被用作铬氧化物催化剂的载体。

3. 助剂：提到钠（1 wt%）作为催化剂配方的添加剂。

4. 表征技术：UV-Vis光谱经常被用来研究脱氢条件下的铬/氧化铝催化剂。

5. 工业应用：丙烷脱氢生产丙烯被强调为重要的工业应用。

6. 挑战：快速失活被指出是负载型铬催化剂的一个缺点，表明这是一个持续的研究重点领域。

7. 反应机理：文件提到焦炭形成是一种失活机制，这表明理解和减缓这一过程是一个重要的研究领域。

虽然该文件提供了一些当前的见解，但它并没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的全面历史视角。
