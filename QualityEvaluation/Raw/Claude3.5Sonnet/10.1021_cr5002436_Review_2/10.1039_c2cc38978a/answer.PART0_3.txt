The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. Instead, it focuses on a specific study using UV-Vis spectroscopy to characterize a Cr/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in a pilot-scale reactor.

Key points from the available information:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts are used industrially for alkane dehydrogenation, specifically propane to propylene conversion.

2. Research has focused on understanding the structure and active sites of these catalysts. Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation, while Cr6+ is considered inactive.

3. Alumina is used as a support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

4. A significant challenge with these catalysts is rapid deactivation.

5. Spectroscopic techniques, particularly UV-Vis spectroscopy, are important tools for studying these catalysts under reaction conditions.

6. Recent research aims to develop methods for characterizing these catalysts at larger scales, as evidenced by the pilot-scale reactor study described in the paper.

The literature does not provide information on the historical evolution of these catalysts or a comprehensive list of research focus areas and industrial applications beyond propane dehydrogenation.

这篇文献并没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述。相反，它侧重于使用紫外-可见光谱法在试点规模反应器中表征用于丙烷脱氢的Cr/Al2O3催化剂的具体研究。

从可用信息中得出的要点：

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂在工业上用于烷烃脱氢，特别是丙烷到丙烯的转化。

2. 研究重点是了解这些催化剂的结构和活性位点。Cr3+物种被认为是脱氢的活性位点，而Cr6+被认为是无活性的。

3. 氧化铝被用作铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料。

4. 这些催化剂的一个重要挑战是快速失活。

5. 光谱技术，特别是紫外-可见光谱法，是在反应条件下研究这些催化剂的重要工具。

6. 最近的研究旨在开发在更大规模上表征这些催化剂的方法，从文章中描述的试点规模反应器研究可以看出这一点。

该文献没有提供这些催化剂的历史演变信息，也没有提供除丙烷脱氢之外的研究重点领域和工业应用的全面列表。
