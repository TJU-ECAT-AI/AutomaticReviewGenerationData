[1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale."

[3] "dd transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm."

[4] "Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive."

[5] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts. High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer some insights into current research focus areas and industrial applications:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts are used in propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene, which is in increasing demand for plastics production. This application has gained renewed interest due to the shale gas boom.

2. Structure and active sites: Research focuses on understanding the different chromium species present in the catalyst. Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation, while Cr6+ is considered inactive.

3. Support materials: The literature mentions alumina as a support material for chromium oxide catalysts.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies investigate the formation and burning of coke deposits during the dehydrogenation reaction, as this is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

5. Characterization techniques: UV-Vis spectroscopy is frequently used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under reaction conditions, providing information on the electronic transitions of chromium species and coke formation.

6. Challenges: Rapid deactivation due to coke formation is identified as a significant disadvantage of supported chromia catalysts.

The literature does not provide information on specific promoters or a detailed evolution of these catalysts over time.

该文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实提供了一些关于当前研究重点领域和工业应用的见解：

1. 工业应用：铬氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢生产丙烯，后者在塑料生产中的需求不断增加。由于页岩气的繁荣，这种应用引起了renewed兴趣。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点是了解催化剂中存在的不同铬物种。Cr3+物种被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点，而Cr6+被认为是无活性的。

3. 载体材料：文献提到氧化铝作为铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料。

4. 反应机理：研究调查了脱氢反应过程中焦炭沉积的形成和燃烧，因为这是催化剂失活的主要原因。

5. 表征技术：UV-Vis光谱常用于在反应条件下研究铬/氧化铝催化剂，提供关于铬物种电子跃迁和焦炭形成的信息。

6. 挑战：由于焦炭形成导致的快速失活被认为是负载型铬催化剂的一个重要缺点。

文献没有提供关于特定促进剂或这些催化剂随时间演变的详细信息。
