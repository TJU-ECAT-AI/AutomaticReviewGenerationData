The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer some insights into current research focus areas and industrial applications:

1. Industrial application: The text mentions the use of chromium oxide-based catalysts (specifically Cr/Al2O3) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. This is highlighted as an important process due to increased demand for propylene in plastic production and recent shale gas exploitation.

2. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the active sites of the catalyst. Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation, while Cr6+ is considered inactive.

3. Support materials: The catalyst described uses alumina (Al2O3) as a support material for the chromium oxide.

4. Deactivation mechanisms: A key area of research is understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation. Rapid deactivation is mentioned as a disadvantage of supported chromia catalysts. Coke formation is identified as a major cause of deactivation, occurring under the high temperature and low pressure conditions used for dehydrogenation.

5. Characterization techniques: The paper describes the development of new in-situ characterization techniques, specifically the use of UV-Vis spectroscopy in a pilot-scale reactor to study the catalyst under realistic reaction conditions. This allows for monitoring of coke formation and combustion in real-time.

6. Reaction conditions: The study of optimal reaction conditions is another focus area, as temperature affects both conversion and selectivity of the reaction.

While the paper doesn't provide a comprehensive historical perspective, it demonstrates that current research on chromium oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation processes focuses on understanding active sites, deactivation mechanisms, and developing new characterization techniques for in-situ studies under industrially relevant conditions.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实提供了一些关于当前研究重点领域和工业应用的见解：

1. 工业应用：文中提到铬氧化物基催化剂（特别是Cr/Al2O3）用于丙烷脱氢制丙烯。由于塑料生产对丙烯需求的增加和近期页岩气开发的兴起，这一过程被强调为重要过程。

2. 活性位点：研究重点在于理解催化剂的活性位点。Cr3+物种被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点，而Cr6+被认为是无活性的。

3. 载体材料：所描述的催化剂使用氧化铝（Al2O3）作为铬氧化物的载体材料。

4. 失活机制：研究的一个关键领域是理解和减轻催化剂失活。快速失活被提及为负载型铬基催化剂的一个缺点。焦炭形成被认为是失活的主要原因，发生在脱氢反应所使用的高温和低压条件下。

5. 表征技术：论文描述了新的原位表征技术的开发，特别是在中试规模反应器中使用UV-Vis光谱来研究在实际反应条件下的催化剂。这允许实时监测焦炭的形成和燃烧。

6. 反应条件：研究最佳反应条件是另一个重点领域，因为温度影响反应的转化率和选择性。

虽然这篇论文没有提供全面的历史视角，但它表明当前关于用于脱氢过程的铬氧化物催化剂的研究主要集中在理解活性位点、失活机制，以及开发新的表征技术，以在工业相关条件下进行原位研究。
