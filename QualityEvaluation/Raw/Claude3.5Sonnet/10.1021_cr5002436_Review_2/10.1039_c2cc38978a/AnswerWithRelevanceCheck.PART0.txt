          [1] "This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics."

[2] "UV-Vis spectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale."

[3] "dd transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm."

[4] "Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive."

[5] "Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts."

[6] "High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time."

[7] "The catalyst consists of 20 wt% Cr (a mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+) and 1 wt% Na on an alumina support."

[8] "Here, we present the design, construction and use of a novel pilot-scale reactor, in which specially developed UV-Vis probes are inserted to characterize a catalyst material under reaction conditions."

[9] "The showcase example is the dehydrogenation of propane into propylene over an industrial Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, shaped in the form of 3 mm-sized catalyst bodies."

          While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, it offers insights into current research focus areas and industrial applications:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts are used for propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene, which is in increasing demand for plastics production. This application has gained renewed interest due to the shale gas boom.

2. Structure and active sites: Research focuses on understanding the different chromium species present in the catalyst. Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation, while Cr6+ is considered inactive.

3. Support materials: Alumina is used as a support material for chromium oxide catalysts (chromia/alumina catalysts).

4. Promoters: Sodium (1 wt%) is mentioned as an additive to the catalyst formulation.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Studies investigate the formation and burning of coke deposits during the dehydrogenation reaction, as this is a major cause of catalyst deactivation.

6. Challenges: Rapid deactivation due to coke formation is identified as a significant disadvantage of supported chromia catalysts, indicating an area of ongoing research focus.

7. Characterization techniques: UV-Vis spectroscopy is highlighted as a frequently used method to study these catalysts under reaction conditions, allowing researchers to observe changes in chromium species and coke formation. Recent research aims to develop methods for characterizing these catalysts at larger scales, as evidenced by the pilot-scale reactor study described.

8. Reaction conditions: The study of optimal reaction conditions is another focus area, as high temperatures and low pressures used for dehydrogenation affect both the reaction and coke formation.

While the literature provides current insights into research and applications, it does not offer a comprehensive historical perspective on the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933.

          虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它提供了一些关于当前研究重点领域和工业应用的见解：

1. 工业应用：铬氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢生产丙烯，丙烯在塑料生产中的需求不断增加。由于页岩气的繁荣，这一应用引起了renewed兴趣。

2. 结构和活性位点：研究重点是了解催化剂中存在的不同铬物种。Cr3+物种被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点，而Cr6+被认为是无活性的。

3. 载体材料：氧化铝被用作铬氧化物催化剂的载体材料（铬/氧化铝催化剂）。

4. 助剂：提到钠（1 wt%）作为催化剂配方的添加剂。

5. 反应机理：研究调查了脱氢反应过程中焦炭沉积的形成和燃烧，因为这是催化剂失活的主要原因。

6. 挑战：由于焦炭形成导致的快速失活被认为是负载型铬催化剂的一个重要缺点，表明这是一个持续的研究重点领域。

7. 表征技术：UV-Vis光谱被强调为在反应条件下研究这些催化剂的常用方法，使研究人员能够观察铬物种和积碳形成的变化。最近的研究旨在开发在更大规模上表征这些催化剂的方法，从文中描述的试点规模反应器研究可以看出这一点。

8. 反应条件：研究最佳反应条件是另一个重点领域，因为脱氢反应所使用的高温和低压条件既影响反应又影响焦炭形成。

虽然文献提供了关于当前研究和应用的见解，但它没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的全面历史视角。
