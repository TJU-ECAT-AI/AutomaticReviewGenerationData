[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2·Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "Different techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance (ESR), were used."

[5] "There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation states are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. However, the coordination geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polymerization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. The Phillips catalyst (chromium on silica) became famous for ethylene polymerization at low pressures.

2. Industrial applications expanded to include:
   - Production of high-density polyethylene
   - Production of linear low-density polyethylene
   - Copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1
   - Propylene polymerization (using chromium on silica-alumina)
   - Dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming (using chromium on alumina)

3. Research focus areas include:
   - Structure and oxidation states of chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+)
   - Coordination geometry of surface complexes
   - Degree of polymerization of chromium on the surface
   - Support materials (silica, alumina, silica-alumina)

4. Various analytical techniques have been employed to study these catalysts, including IR, DRS, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and ESR.

While the document doesn't provide a complete historical evolution, it demonstrates that chromium oxide-based catalysts have found significant applications in polymerization and dehydrogenation processes, with ongoing research into their structure and properties.
