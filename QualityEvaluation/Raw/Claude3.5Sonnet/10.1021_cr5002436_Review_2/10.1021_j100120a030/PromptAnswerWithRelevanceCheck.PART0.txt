[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2·Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."

[5] "There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation states are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. However, the coordination geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polymerization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate."
