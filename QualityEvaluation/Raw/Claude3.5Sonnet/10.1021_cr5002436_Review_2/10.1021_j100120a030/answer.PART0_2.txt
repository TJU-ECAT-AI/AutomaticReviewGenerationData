[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2·Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "The Phillips catalyst is one of the most studied and yet most controversial systems, while the studies of Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2·Al2O3 are more limited. All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."

[5] "Different techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance (ESR), were used."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. The Phillips catalyst (chromium on silica) has become famous for ethylene polymerization at low pressures.

2. Industrial applications have expanded to include:
   - Production of high-density polyethylene
   - Production of linear low-density polyethylene
   - Copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1
   - Polymerization of propylene (using chromium on silica-alumina)
   - Dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming (using chromium on alumina)

3. Research focus areas include:
   - Formation and nature of chromium species on catalyst surfaces
   - Identifying valence states responsible for catalysis
   - Structure and coordination of chromium species
   - Effects of different support materials (silica, alumina, silica-alumina)

4. Various analytical techniques have been employed to study these catalysts, including IR, DRS, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and ESR.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss the evolution of these catalysts over time or mention promoters, it does indicate that the Phillips catalyst remains one of the most studied and controversial systems in the field.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实突出了一些关键发展和应用：

1. 菲利普斯催化剂（硅基铬）因在低压下进行乙烯聚合而闻名。

2. 工业应用已扩展到包括：
   - 高密度聚乙烯的生产
   - 线性低密度聚乙烯的生产
   - 乙烯和1-丁烯的共聚
   - 丙烯的聚合（使用硅铝基铬）
   - 烷烃脱氢、脱氢环化和催化重整（使用氧化铝基铬）

3. 研究重点领域包括：
   - 催化剂表面铬物种的形成和性质
   - 识别负责催化作用的价态
   - 铬物种的结构和配位
   - 不同载体材料（二氧化硅、氧化铝、硅铝）的影响

4. 已使用各种分析技术来研究这些催化剂，包括红外光谱、漫反射光谱、X射线光电子能谱、拉曼光谱和电子自旋共振。

虽然文档没有明确讨论这些催化剂随时间的演变或提及助催化剂，但确实表明菲利普斯催化剂仍然是该领域最受研究和争议的系统之一。
