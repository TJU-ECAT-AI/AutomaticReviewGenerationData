[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2·Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."

[5] "There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation states are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. However, the coordination geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polymerization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. The Phillips catalyst (Cr/SiO2) was developed for ethylene polymerization at low pressures.

2. Industrial applications include:
   - Production of high-density polyethylene
   - Production of linear low-density polyethylene
   - Copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1
   - Polymerization of propylene (using Cr/SiO2·Al2O3)
   - Dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming (using Cr/Al2O3)

3. Key research focus areas include:
   - Formation and nature of chromium species on catalyst surfaces
   - Identification of valence states responsible for catalysis
   - Oxidation states of chromium (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+)
   - Coordination geometry of surface complexes
   - Degree of polymerization of chromium on surfaces
   - Structure of stabilized Cr6+ species
   - Effects of different support materials (silica, alumina, silica-alumina)

The document suggests that while there has been significant progress in understanding these catalysts, debates continue regarding the precise molecular structures and mechanisms involved.

   - 乙烯和丁烯-1的共聚
   - 丙烯的聚合（使用Cr/SiO2·Al2O3）
   - 烷烃脱氢、脱氢环化和催化重整（使用Cr/Al2O3）

3. 主要研究重点领域包括：
   - 催化剂表面铬物种的形成和性质
   - 识别负责催化作用的价态
   - 铬的氧化态（Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+）
   - 表面络合物的配位几何构型
   - 铬在表面上的聚合程度
   - 稳定的Cr6+物种的结构
   - 不同载体材料（二氧化硅、氧化铝、硅铝）的影响

文件表明，虽然在理解这些催化剂方面取得了重大进展，但关于精确的分子结构和涉及的机制仍然存在争议。
