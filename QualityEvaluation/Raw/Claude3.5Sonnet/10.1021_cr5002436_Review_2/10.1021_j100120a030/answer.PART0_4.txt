[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2•Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "The Phillips catalyst is one of the most studied and yet most controversial systems, while the studies of Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2•Al2O3 are more limited. All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."

[5] "Different techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy (IR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, and electron spin resonance (ESR), were used."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and applications:

1. The Phillips catalyst (chromium on silica) has become famous for ethylene polymerization at low pressures.

2. Industrial applications have expanded to include:
   - Production of high-density polyethylene
   - Production of linear low-density polyethylene
   - Copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1
   - Polymerization of propylene (using chromium on silica-alumina)
   - Dehydrogenation of alkanes, dehydrocyclization, and catalytic reforming (using chromium on alumina)

3. Research focus areas include:
   - Formation and nature of chromium species on catalyst surfaces
   - Identifying valence states responsible for catalysis
   - Structure and coordination of chromium species
   - Effects of different support materials (silica, alumina, silica-alumina)

4. Various analytical techniques have been employed to study these catalysts, including IR, DRS, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and ESR.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss promoters or detailed reaction mechanisms, it emphasizes the ongoing research into understanding the nature and behavior of chromium species on different supports, which is crucial for improving catalyst performance and expanding applications.
