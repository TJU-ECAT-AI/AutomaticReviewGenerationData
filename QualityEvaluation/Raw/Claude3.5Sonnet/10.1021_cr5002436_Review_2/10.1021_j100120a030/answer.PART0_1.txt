[1] "Chromium on silica (Cr/SiO2) is the famous Phillips catalyst for the polymerization of ethylene under relatively low pressures."

[2] "This catalyst is the basis for the Phillips particle-form process in the production of high-density polyethylene, and the use has been extended to the production of linear low-density polyethylene and the copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1."

[3] "Chromium on silica-alumina (Cr/SiO2·Al2O3) catalyses the polymerization of propylene and chromium on alumina (Cr/Al2O3) catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, in dehydrocyclization, and in catalytic reforming."

[4] "All these studies deal with the formation and nature of the chromium species on the catalyst surface or with the associated problem of identifying the valence state of the species which are responsible for catalysis."

[5] "There is a general consensus that the detectable oxidation states are Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. However, the coordination geometry of these surface complexes and the degree of polymerization of Cr on the surface are a matter of debate."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key industrial applications and research focus areas that have contributed to their significance:

1. Industrial applications:
- Polymerization of ethylene to produce high-density and linear low-density polyethylene (Phillips catalyst)
- Copolymerization of ethylene and butene-1
- Polymerization of propylene
- Dehydrogenation of alkanes
- Dehydrocyclization
- Catalytic reforming

2. Research focus areas:
- Formation and nature of chromium species on catalyst surfaces
- Identification of valence states responsible for catalysis
- Coordination geometry of surface complexes
- Degree of polymerization of chromium on the surface
- Oxidation states (Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+)
- Support materials (silica, alumina, silica-alumina)

The literature suggests that while there is consensus on some aspects of chromium oxide-based catalysts, such as the detectable oxidation states, there is still ongoing debate and research regarding the exact structures, active sites, and mechanisms involved in these catalytic processes.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实强调了一些对其在脱氢过程中的重要性有贡献的关键工业应用和研究重点领域：

1. 工业应用：
- 乙烯聚合生产高密度和线性低密度聚乙烯（菲利普斯催化剂）
- 乙烯和丁烯-1的共聚
- 丙烯的聚合
- 烷烃的脱氢
- 脱氢环化
- 催化重整

2. 研究重点领域：
- 催化剂表面铬物种的形成和性质
- 识别负责催化作用的价态
- 表面络合物的配位几何
- 铬在表面的聚合程度
- 氧化态（Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+和Cr2+）
- 载体材料（二氧化硅、氧化铝、硅铝）

文献表明，虽然在铬氧化物基催化剂的某些方面（如可检测的氧化态）已达成共识，但关于这些催化过程中涉及的确切结构、活性位点和机制仍存在持续的争论和研究。
