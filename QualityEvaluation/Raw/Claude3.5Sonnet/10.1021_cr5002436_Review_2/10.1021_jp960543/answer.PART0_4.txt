[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. 1-9 Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene."

[2] "The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides."

[3] "Previous Raman studies concluded that this chromium oxide species is predominantly present as a monochromate species."

[4] "The objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to study the feasibility of in situ Raman spectroscopy for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions and (2) to probe the reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their evolution and significance:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts have become crucial in the chemical industry for producing important commodity chemicals. Specifically, Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Phillips catalyst) are used for producing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), while Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for butane dehydrogenation to butene.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Molecular structure: There has been significant interest in elucidating the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides.
   b) Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of chromium oxide species, such as monochromate species.
   c) Support materials: Various supports have been studied, including SiO2 and Al2O3.
   d) Reaction mechanisms: The reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts has been investigated for processes like methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation.

3. Characterization techniques: In situ Raman spectroscopy has emerged as a valuable tool for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions, allowing researchers to probe their structure and reactivity during reactions.

While the literature doesn't explicitly mention promoters or provide a detailed historical account, it does demonstrate that chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved to become industrially significant, with ongoing research efforts focused on understanding their structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms using advanced characterization techniques.
