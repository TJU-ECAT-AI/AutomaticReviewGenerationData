[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. 1-9 Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene."

[2] "The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides."

[3] "These characterization studies revealed that under hydrated conditions the molecular structure of the surface chromium oxide species is only determined by the isoelectric point (IEP) or net pH at point of zero charge (PZC) of the support."

[4] "Upon calcination, dehydrated surface chromium oxide molecular structures are formed by reaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of the support."

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 has been significant, with key industrial applications in polyethylene production and butane dehydrogenation. The Phillips catalyst (Cr/SiO2) is used for producing HDPE and LLDPE, while Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are employed in butane dehydrogenation.

Research focus areas have included:

1. Molecular structure: Efforts to elucidate the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides have been a major focus due to their industrial importance.

2. Support materials: The influence of support materials on catalyst performance has been studied, with findings showing that the isoelectric point or net pH at the point of zero charge of the support determines the molecular structure of surface chromium oxide species under hydrated conditions.

3. Active sites: Research has revealed that dehydrated surface chromium oxide molecular structures form by reacting with surface hydroxyl groups of the support during calcination.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have investigated the redox behavior of supported chromium oxides, finding that it depends strongly on the specific support and influences catalytic activity.

5. Characterization techniques: In situ Raman spectroscopy has been developed as a valuable tool for characterizing supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions.

These research areas have contributed to a deeper understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts, enabling their optimization for various industrial dehydrogenation processes.
