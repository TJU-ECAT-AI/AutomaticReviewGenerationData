[1] "Supported chromium oxide catalysts are crucial in the chemical industry for the production of several important commodity chemicals. 1-9 Cr/SiO2 catalysts are known as the Phillips catalyst for the production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene."

[2] "The industrial importance of chromium oxide catalysts has attracted a great deal of interest in industrial and academic research toward the elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides."

[3] "Previous Raman studies concluded that this chromium oxide species is predominantly present as a monochromate species."

[4] "The objectives of this work are two-fold: (1) to study the feasibility of in situ Raman spectroscopy for studying supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions and (2) to probe the reactivity of supported chromium oxide catalysts during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation."

The question cannot be fully answered based on the given literature, as it does not provide information about the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, the document does provide some insights into their current applications and research focus areas:

Key industrial applications of chromium oxide catalysts include:
1. Production of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) using Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Phillips catalyst)
2. Dehydrogenation of butane to butene using Cr/Al2O3 catalysts

Research focus areas mentioned in the literature include:
1. Elucidation of the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides
2. Study of catalyst behavior under catalytic conditions using in situ Raman spectroscopy
3. Investigation of reactivity during methanol oxidation and butane dehydrogenation/oxidation
4. Examination of different support materials (e.g., SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2)
5. Analysis of chromium oxide species (e.g., monochromate and polychromate species)

The literature suggests that ongoing research is focused on understanding the structure, active sites, support materials, and reaction mechanisms of chromium oxide catalysts to improve their performance in dehydrogenation processes and other applications.
