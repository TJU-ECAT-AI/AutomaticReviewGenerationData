The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their evolution and significance:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts have become crucial in the chemical industry for producing important commodity chemicals. Specifically, Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Phillips catalyst) are used for producing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), while Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for the dehydrogenation of butane to butene.

2. Research focus areas: The industrial importance of these catalysts has led to significant research interest in elucidating the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides. Key areas of focus include:

   a) Structure: Studies have aimed to understand the molecular states of supported chromium oxide species, including their oxidation and coordination states.
   
   b) Active sites: Research has focused on identifying and characterizing the active sites of the catalysts.
   
   c) Support materials: Various support materials have been studied, including SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and mixed oxide supports.
   
   d) Reaction mechanisms: In situ spectroscopic techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, have been developed to study the catalysts under reaction conditions, providing insights into their surface chemistry and reaction mechanisms.

3. Analytical techniques: The development and application of advanced analytical techniques, particularly in situ Raman spectroscopy, have contributed significantly to understanding the structure and behavior of chromium oxide species on various supports under reaction conditions.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss promoters or provide a detailed historical timeline, it's clear that research on chromium oxide-based catalysts has evolved to focus on understanding their molecular structure, active sites, and behavior under reaction conditions, which has likely contributed to improvements in their catalytic performance for dehydrogenation processes.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了它们演变和重要性的一些关键方面：

1. 工业应用：铬氧化物催化剂在化学工业中对于生产重要的大宗化学品变得至关重要。具体来说，Cr/SiO2催化剂（菲利普斯催化剂）用于生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE），而Cr/Al2O3催化剂用于丁烷脱氢生成丁烯。

2. 研究重点领域：这些催化剂的工业重要性导致了对阐明负载型铬氧化物分子结构的大量研究兴趣。关键研究领域包括：

   a) 结构：研究旨在理解负载型铬氧化物物种的分子状态，包括它们的氧化态和配位状态。
   
   b) 活性位点：研究重点是识别和表征催化剂的活性位点。
   
   c) 载体材料：研究了各种载体材料，包括SiO2、Al2O3、ZrO2、TiO2和混合氧化物载体。
   
   d) 反应机理：开发了原位光谱技术（如拉曼光谱）来研究反应条件下的催化剂，提供了关于其表面化学和反应机理的见解。

3. 分析技术：先进分析技术（特别是原位拉曼光谱）的开发和应用，对于理解反应条件下各种载体上铬氧化物物种的结构和行为做出了重大贡献。

虽然文献没有明确讨论助剂或提供详细的历史时间线，但很明显，铬氧化物基催化剂的研究已经演变为关注理解其分子结构、活性位点和反应条件下的行为，这可能有助于改善它们在脱氢过程中的催化性能。
