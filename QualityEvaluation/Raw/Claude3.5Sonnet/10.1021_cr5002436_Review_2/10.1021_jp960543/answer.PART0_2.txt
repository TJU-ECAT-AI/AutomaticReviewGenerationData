The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight their current significance and some key developments:

1. Industrial applications: Chromium oxide catalysts are crucial for producing important commodity chemicals. Specifically, Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Phillips catalyst) are used for producing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), while Cr/Al2O3 catalysts are used for butane dehydrogenation to butene.

2. Research focus areas:
   a) Molecular structure: There has been significant interest in elucidating the molecular structure of supported chromium oxides.
   b) Active sites: Recent research has identified two types of surface chromium oxide species - a monomeric species that is difficult to reduce, and a polymeric species that is more easily reducible.
   c) Support materials: The study investigated various support materials, including SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and mixed oxide supports.
   d) Characterization techniques: In situ Raman spectroscopy has been developed as a valuable tool for characterizing supported chromium oxide catalysts under catalytic conditions.
   e) Redox behavior: The research focused on understanding the redox behavior of supported chromium oxides, which is crucial for their catalytic activity in dehydrogenation processes.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss the evolution of these catalysts since 1933 or mention specific promoters, it does showcase the ongoing research efforts to better understand and improve chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial applications.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现铬氧化物催化剂以来的全面历史概述。但它确实强调了它们当前的重要性和一些关键发展：

1. 工业应用：铬氧化物催化剂对于生产重要的大宗化学品至关重要。具体而言，Cr/SiO2催化剂（菲利普斯催化剂）用于生产高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）和线性低密度聚乙烯（LLDPE），而Cr/Al2O3催化剂用于丁烷脱氢制丁烯。

2. 研究重点领域：
   a) 分子结构：对于阐明负载型铬氧化物的分子结构有很大兴趣。
   b) 活性位点：最近的研究已经确定了两种类型的表面铬氧化物物种 - 一种难以还原的单体物种和一种更容易还原的聚合物种。
   c) 载体材料：该研究考察了各种载体材料，包括SiO2、Al2O3、ZrO2、TiO2和混合氧化物载体。
   d) 表征技术：原位拉曼光谱已被开发为在催化条件下表征负载型铬氧化物催化剂的有价值工具。
   e) 氧化还原行为：研究重点是了解负载型铬氧化物的氧化还原行为，这对于它们在脱氢过程中的催化活性至关重要。

虽然文献没有明确讨论自1933年以来这些催化剂的演变或提到具体的助剂，但它确实展示了持续的研究努力，以更好地理解和改进工业应用中的铬氧化物基催化剂。
