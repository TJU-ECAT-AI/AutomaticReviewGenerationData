[1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]."

[2] "Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support [2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia [5-12]."

[3] "Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium. Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst."

[4] "The overall picture emerging from the reported data shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation studied previously. With reference to the chromia/zirconia system, these similarities mainly concern: (i) the independence of the activity above 773 K of catalyst prereduction, (ii) the effect of potassium addition, (iii) the invariance of the turnover frequency with chromium loading and (iv) the much higher turnover frequency in comparison with those of CrOx/SiO2 and CrOx/Al2O3."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming a key focus in dehydrogenation processes. The main developments include:

1. Support materials: While alumina has been the traditional support, recent research has explored zirconia as a promising alternative. Studies have shown that chromia supported on zirconia exhibits superior performance compared to silica and alumina supports.

2. Promoters: Small quantities of alkali ions, particularly potassium, have been added to industrial chromia/alumina catalysts. Potassium helps reduce undesired side reactions like cracking and coking, thereby improving selectivity and catalyst lifetime.

3. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active sites. For chromia/zirconia catalysts, mononuclear CrIII species with two coordinative unsaturations are believed to be the active sites, with adjacent O2- ions from the support possibly playing a role.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have compared dehydrogenation processes for different alkanes (e.g., propane and isobutane) to understand similarities in reaction mechanisms and active sites.

5. Industrial applications: The main application has been the conversion of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes through catalytic dehydrogenation.

Key research areas have included investigating catalyst activity, selectivity, deactivation, and regeneration under various conditions. The focus has been on optimizing catalyst performance, understanding the role of the support material, and elucidating the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms.

Based on the literature provided, the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has focused on several key areas:

1. Support materials: While chromia catalysts were traditionally supported on alumina, recent research has explored other support materials, particularly zirconia. The literature mentions that zirconium dioxide has gained attention as a catalyst support.

2. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of the active sites in chromium oxide catalysts. The study concludes that the active site for both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies, likely accompanied by an adjacent O2- ion from the support.

3. Promoters: Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts often contain small amounts of alkali ions, particularly potassium, as promoters. These additives help reduce undesired side reactions like cracking and coking, thus improving selectivity and catalyst lifetime.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The research has investigated the dehydrogenation mechanisms for different alkanes, finding similarities between propane and isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/zirconia catalysts.

5. Industrial applications: The main industrial application highlighted is the conversion of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes through catalytic dehydrogenation. This process is of considerable practical interest.

The key research focus areas have included studying the structure of the catalysts, identifying and characterizing active sites, exploring new support materials, understanding the role of promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. These efforts have contributed to improving the performance and understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.
