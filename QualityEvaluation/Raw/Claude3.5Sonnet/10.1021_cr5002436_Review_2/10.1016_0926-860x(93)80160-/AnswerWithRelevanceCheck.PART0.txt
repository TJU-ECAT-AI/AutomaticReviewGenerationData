          [1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]."

[2] "Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support [2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia [5-12]."

[3] "Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium. Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst."

[4] "The overall picture shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is concluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent O2- ion of the support."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming a key focus in dehydrogenation processes. The main developments include:

1. Support materials: While alumina has been the traditional support, recent research has explored zirconia as a promising alternative. Studies have shown that chromia supported on zirconia exhibits superior performance compared to silica and alumina supports.

2. Promoters: Small quantities of alkali ions, particularly potassium, have been added to industrial chromia/alumina catalysts. Potassium helps reduce undesired side reactions like cracking and coking, thereby improving selectivity and catalyst lifetime.

3. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active sites. For chromia/zirconia catalysts, mononuclear CrIII species with two coordinative unsaturations are believed to be the active sites, with adjacent O2- ions from the support possibly playing a role.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have compared dehydrogenation processes for different alkanes (e.g., propane and isobutane) to understand similarities in reaction mechanisms and active sites.

5. Industrial applications: The main application has been the conversion of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes through catalytic dehydrogenation.

Key research areas have included investigating catalyst activity, selectivity, deactivation, and regeneration under various conditions. The focus has been on optimizing catalyst performance, understanding the role of the support material, and elucidating the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms.

          自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经有了显著的发展，成为脱氢过程中的重要研究焦点。主要发展包括：

1. 载体材料：虽然氧化铝一直是传统的载体，但近期研究已经探索了二氧化锆作为一种有前景的替代品。研究表明，以二氧化锆为载体的氧化铬催化剂比硅胶和氧化铝载体表现出更优异的性能。

2. 助剂：在工业用铬/氧化铝催化剂中添加了少量碱金属离子，特别是钾。钾有助于减少不良的副反应，如裂解和结焦，从而提高选择性和催化剂寿命。

3. 活性位点和结构：研究重点在于理解活性位点的本质。对于铬/二氧化锆催化剂，具有两个配位不饱和的单核CrIII物种被认为是活性位点，载体的相邻O2-离子可能也发挥作用。

4. 反应机理：研究比较了不同烷烃（如丙烷和异丁烷）的脱氢过程，以了解反应机理和活性位点的相似性。

5. 工业应用：主要应用是通过催化脱氢将低成本的饱和烃转化为更有价值的烯烃。

关键研究领域包括在各种条件下研究催化剂的活性、选择性、失活和再生。重点是优化催化剂性能，理解载体材料的作用，以及阐明活性位点和反应机理的本质。
