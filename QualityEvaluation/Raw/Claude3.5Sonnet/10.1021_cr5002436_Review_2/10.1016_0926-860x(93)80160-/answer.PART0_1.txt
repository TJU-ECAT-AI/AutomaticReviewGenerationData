[1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]."

[2] "Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support [2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia [5-12]."

[3] "Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium. Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst."

[4] "The overall picture shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is concluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent O2- ion of the support."

Based on the literature provided, the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 has focused on several key areas:

1. Support materials: While chromia catalysts were traditionally supported on alumina, recent research has explored other support materials, particularly zirconia. The literature mentions that zirconium dioxide has gained attention as a catalyst support.

2. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of the active sites in chromium oxide catalysts. The study concludes that the active site for both propane and isobutane dehydrogenation involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies, likely accompanied by an adjacent O2- ion from the support.

3. Promoters: Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts often contain small amounts of alkali ions, particularly potassium, as promoters. These additives help reduce undesired side reactions like cracking and coking, thus improving selectivity and catalyst lifetime.

4. Reaction mechanisms: The research has investigated the dehydrogenation mechanisms for different alkanes, finding similarities between propane and isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/zirconia catalysts.

5. Industrial applications: The main industrial application highlighted is the conversion of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes through catalytic dehydrogenation. This process is of considerable practical interest.

The key research focus areas have included studying the structure of the catalysts, identifying and characterizing active sites, exploring new support materials, understanding the role of promoters, and elucidating reaction mechanisms. These efforts have contributed to improving the performance and understanding of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

根据提供的文献，自1933年发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂的发展主要集中在以下几个关键领域：

1. 载体材料：传统上，氧化铬催化剂主要负载在氧化铝上，但近期研究探索了其他载体材料，特别是二氧化锆。文献提到二氧化锆作为催化剂载体已引起关注。

2. 活性位点：研究重点是了解氧化铬催化剂中活性位点的性质。该研究得出结论，丙烷和异丁烷脱氢的活性位点都涉及具有两个配位空位的单核Criii物种，很可能还伴有来自载体的相邻O2-离子。

3. 助剂：工业用氧化铬/氧化铝催化剂通常含有少量碱金属离子（特别是钾）作为助剂。这些添加剂有助于减少不期望的副反应，如裂解和结焦，从而提高选择性和催化剂寿命。

4. 反应机理：研究调查了不同烷烃的脱氢机理，发现氧化铬/二氧化锆催化剂上丙烷和异丁烷脱氢之间存在相似性。

5. 工业应用：突出的主要工业应用是通过催化脱氢将低成本饱和烃转化为更有价值的烯烃。这一过程具有相当大的实际意义。

关键研究重点领域包括研究催化剂的结构、识别和表征活性位点、探索新的载体材料、理解助剂的作用以及阐明反应机理。这些努力有助于提高氧化铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中的性能并加深对其的理解。
