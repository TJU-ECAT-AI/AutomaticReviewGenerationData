[1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]."

[2] "Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support [2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia [5-12]."

[3] "The overall picture shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is concluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent O 2- ion of the support."

[4] "Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium. Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933, becoming a key focus in industrial applications and research for dehydrogenation processes. The literature indicates several key developments:

1. Support materials: While chromia was traditionally supported on alumina, recent research has explored zirconia as a promising support material. This shift has led to investigations into the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia.

2. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of the active sites. For isobutane dehydrogenation, the active site is believed to be a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies, likely accompanied by an adjacent O 2- ion from the support. This is similar to the site proposed for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Promoters: Industrial chromia/alumina catalysts often include small amounts of alkali ions, particularly potassium, as promoters. Potassium is believed to have a beneficial effect by poisoning acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions like cracking and coking, thereby improving selectivity and catalyst lifetime.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have investigated the dehydrogenation mechanisms of various alkanes, including propane and isobutane, on chromia-based catalysts. The similarities in behavior between these reactions suggest common underlying mechanisms.

5. Industrial applications: The primary industrial application of these catalysts is the conversion of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes through catalytic dehydrogenation.

These developments highlight the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes and the continuous efforts to improve their performance through better understanding of their structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms.

自1933年发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经有了显著的发展，成为脱氢过程中工业应用和研究的重点。文献指出了几个关键的发展：

1. 载体材料：虽然传统上铬被负载在氧化铝上，但最近的研究探索了氧化锆作为一种有前景的载体材料。这种转变导致了对负载在氧化锆上的铬的表面化学和催化性能的研究。

2. 活性位点：研究重点是了解活性位点的性质。对于异丁烷脱氢，活性位点被认为是具有两个配位空位的单核Criii物种，可能伴随着来自载体的相邻O 2-离子。这与之前提出的丙烷脱氢活性位点类似。

3. 助剂：工业用铬/氧化铝催化剂通常包含少量碱金属离子，特别是钾，作为助剂。钾被认为具有有益效果，通过毒化负责不良副反应（如裂解和结焦）的酸性位点，从而提高选择性和催化剂寿命。

4. 反应机理：研究人员调查了各种烷烃（包括丙烷和异丁烷）在铬基催化剂上的脱氢机理。这些反应行为的相似性表明存在共同的基本机理。

5. 工业应用：这些催化剂的主要工业应用是通过催化脱氢将低成本饱和烃转化为更有价值的烯烃。

这些发展突出了铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续重要性，以及通过更好地理解其结构、活性位点和反应机理来不断改进其性能的努力。
