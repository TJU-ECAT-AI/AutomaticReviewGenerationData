[1] "A subject of considerable practical interest is the conversion, by catalytic dehydrogenation, of poorly reactive and low-cost saturated hydrocarbons to more valuable alkenes. As regards oxide systems, the superior performances of chromia (generally supported on aluminas) are well documented [1]."

[2] "Zirconium dioxide has recently been the focus of some attention as catalyst support [2-4] and our group has for some years been involved in the investigation of the surface chemistry and catalytic properties of chromia supported on zirconia [5-12]."

[3] "The overall picture shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is concluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent O2- ion of the support."

[4] "Industrial dehydrogenation chromia/alumina catalysts are known to contain small quantities (up to a few percent) of alkali ions, very often potassium. Indeed, it is generally accepted that potassium has a beneficial effect, related to the poisoning of acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions (cracking and coking), which lower the selectivity and shorten the lifetime of the catalyst."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery in 1933:

1. Applications: They are widely used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons to produce more valuable alkenes.

2. Support materials: While chromia was traditionally supported on alumina, recent research has focused on zirconia as a support material, which has shown improved catalytic properties.

3. Active sites: Research has identified that the active site for dehydrogenation reactions involves a mononuclear Criii species with two coordinative vacancies, likely alongside an adjacent O2- ion from the support.

4. Promoters: Industrial catalysts often include small amounts of alkali ions, particularly potassium, which help to poison acidic sites responsible for undesired side reactions, thereby improving selectivity and catalyst lifetime.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Studies have shown similarities between the dehydrogenation mechanisms of different alkanes (e.g., propane and isobutane) on chromium oxide catalysts.

6. Structure: Research has focused on understanding the surface chemistry and structure of supported chromia catalysts to optimize their performance.

These developments have contributed to the continued significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes, with ongoing research aimed at further improving their activity, selectivity, and longevity.

氧化铬基催化剂自1933年发现以来已经显著发展：

1. 应用：它们被广泛用于饱和碳氢化合物的催化脱氢，生产更有价值的烯烃。

2. 载体材料：虽然传统上氧化铬负载在氧化铝上，但最近的研究集中在二氧化锆作为载体材料上，这显示出了改进的催化性能。

3. 活性位点：研究已经确定，脱氢反应的活性位点涉及具有两个配位空位的单核Criii物种，可能还有来自载体的相邻O2-离子。

4. 助剂：工业催化剂通常包含少量碱金属离子，特别是钾，这有助于毒化负责不良副反应的酸性位点，从而提高选择性和催化剂寿命。

5. 反应机理：研究表明，不同烷烃（如丙烷和异丁烷）在氧化铬催化剂上的脱氢机理存在相似性。

6. 结构：研究重点是理解负载氧化铬催化剂的表面化学和结构，以优化其性能。

这些发展促进了氧化铬基催化剂在脱氢过程中持续的重要性，持续的研究旨在进一步提高其活性、选择性和寿命。
