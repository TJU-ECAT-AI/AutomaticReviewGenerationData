[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[3] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."

[4] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and research focus areas in recent years:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been identified as among the most active, selective, and stable catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

2. Research has focused on understanding the redox mechanism involving Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+). The concentration of these species depends on factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and support materials.

3. There has been a shift towards using mesoporous sieves as supports to achieve higher dispersion of chromium oxide species, which is believed to improve catalyst activity.

4. Recent investigations have shown excellent catalytic activity of Cr-containing mesoporous sieves in propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2.

5. The research has focused on optimizing catalyst structure, active sites, support materials, and understanding reaction mechanisms to improve performance in dehydrogenation processes.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention industrial applications, it implies that these catalysts are significant for propane dehydrogenation to produce propene, which is an important industrial process.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。然而，它确实强调了近年来的一些关键发展和研究重点领域：

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂已被确定为CO2存在下丙烷脱氢反应中最活跃、选择性最高和最稳定的催化剂之一。

2. 研究重点是了解涉及Cr物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+）的氧化还原机制。这些物种的浓度取决于铬负载量、制备条件、前体化合物和支撑材料等因素。

3. 为了获得更高分散度的铬氧化物物种，研究方向已转向使用介孔筛作为支撑材料，这被认为可以提高催化剂活性。

4. 最近的研究表明，含铬介孔筛在有无CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应中都表现出优异的催化活性。

5. 研究重点是优化催化剂结构、活性位点、支撑材料，并理解反应机理，以提高脱氢过程的性能。

虽然文档没有明确提到工业应用，但它暗示这些催化剂对于生产丙烯的丙烷脱氢反应非常重要，而这是一个重要的工业过程。
