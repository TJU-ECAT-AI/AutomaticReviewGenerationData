[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[4] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and research focus areas in recent years:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as among the most active, selective, and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

2. Research has focused on the role of CO2 in promoting propene yield through its oxidative abilities, acting as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

3. The redox mechanism involving Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) has been a key area of study. The concentration of these species depends on factors like chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and support materials.

4. Recent investigations have explored Cr-containing mesoporous sieves, which have shown excellent catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation both with and without CO2.

5. Support materials have been an important area of research, with attention given to mesoporous materials like SBA-1 due to their high surface area and unique structural properties.

While the literature doesn't explicitly mention industrial applications, the focus on propane dehydrogenation suggests this is a key application area for chromium oxide-based catalysts.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但是，它确实强调了近年来的一些关键发展和研究重点领域：

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂已经成为CO2存在下丙烷脱氢反应中最活跃、选择性最高和最稳定的催化剂之一。

2. 研究重点在于CO2通过其氧化能力促进丙烯产率的作用，作为丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的氧化剂。

3. 涉及Cr物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+）的氧化还原机制一直是研究的关键领域。这些物种的浓度取决于铬负载量、制备条件、前驱体化合物和载体材料等因素。

4. 最近的研究探索了含铬介孔筛，这些材料在有无CO2存在的情况下都表现出优异的丙烷脱氢催化活性。

5. 载体材料一直是一个重要的研究领域，由于SBA-1等介孔材料具有高比表面积和独特的结构特性而受到关注。

虽然文献没有明确提及工业应用，但对丙烷脱氢的关注表明这是铬氧化物基催化剂的一个关键应用领域。
