[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been investigated recently as a new way for obtaining propene from its low cost and poorly reactive saturated analogue, propane."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[4] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[5] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does discuss recent developments and key aspects of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been extensively studied for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, which is a new process for obtaining propene from propane.

2. These catalysts are considered among the most active, selective, and stable for this process.

3. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield is due to its oxidative abilities, acting as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

4. The redox mechanism of chromium oxide-based catalysts involves redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+). Their concentration depends on factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and the nature of the support.

5. Recent research has focused on achieving high dispersion of chromium oxide species to obtain more active catalysts. This has led to increased attention on mesoporous sieves as support materials.

6. The study of structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms continues to be important in developing more efficient chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention industrial applications, it implies that these catalysts are significant in the production of propene, which is an important industrial chemical.

该文献并未提供自1933年发现铬氧化物基催化剂以来的全面历史概述。然而，它确实讨论了这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的最新发展和关键方面：

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂已被广泛研究用于CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢，这是从丙烷获得丙烯的一种新工艺。

2. 这些催化剂被认为是该过程中最活跃、最选择性和最稳定的催化剂之一。

3. CO2对丙烯产率的促进作用是由于其氧化能力，在丙烷氧化脱氢成丙烯的过程中充当氧化剂。

4. 铬氧化物基催化剂的氧化还原机理涉及氧化还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+）。它们的浓度取决于铬负载量、制备条件、前体化合物和载体性质等因素。

5. 最近的研究重点是实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散，以获得更活跃的催化剂。这导致了对介孔筛作为支撑材料的关注度增加。

6. 对结构、活性位点和反应机理的研究继续在开发更高效的铬氧化物基脱氢催化剂方面发挥重要作用。

虽然文档没有明确提到工业应用，但它暗示这些催化剂在丙烯生产中具有重要意义，而丙烯是一种重要的工业化学品。
