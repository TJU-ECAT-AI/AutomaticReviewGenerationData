[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities. It has been suggested that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [5,10,13]."

[3] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[4] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved."

[5] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does highlight some key developments and research focus areas for these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been identified as among the most active, selective, and stable catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

2. Research has focused on understanding the promoting effect of CO2 on these catalysts, with findings suggesting that CO2 acts as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

3. The redox mechanism of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been a key area of study, with attention paid to the roles of different Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) and how their concentrations are affected by factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and support materials.

4. Efforts have been made to improve catalyst activity by achieving high dispersion of chromium oxide species at high Cr loadings.

5. Recent research has explored the use of mesoporous sieves as supports for chromium oxide catalysts, which have shown excellent catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation both with and without CO2.

6. The development of new support materials, such as SBA-1 mesoporous silica, has been an area of interest due to their unique textural properties and potential for improving catalyst performance.

While the literature doesn't explicitly mention industrial applications, the focus on propane dehydrogenation suggests this is a key area of interest for potential industrial use of chromium oxide-based catalysts.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实突出了这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的一些关键发展和研究重点领域：

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂被认为是在CO2存在下丙烷脱氢过程中最活跃、选择性最高和最稳定的催化剂之一。

2. 研究重点在于了解CO2对这些催化剂的促进作用，研究结果表明CO2在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程中充当氧化剂。

3. 铬氧化物基催化剂的氧化还原机理一直是一个重要的研究领域，特别关注不同铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+）的作用，以及它们的浓度如何受到铬负载量、制备条件、前驱体化合物和载体材料等因素的影响。

4. 为了提高催化剂活性，研究者们努力在高铬负载量下实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散。

5. 最近的研究探索了将介孔筛作为铬氧化物催化剂载体的应用，这些催化剂在有无CO2存在的情况下都表现出优异的丙烷脱氢催化活性。

6. 新型载体材料的开发，如SBA-1介孔二氧化硅，因其独特的纹理特性和提高催化剂性能的潜力而成为研究的兴趣领域。

虽然文献没有明确提及工业应用，但对丙烷脱氢的关注表明这是铬氧化物基催化剂潜在工业应用的一个关键领域。
