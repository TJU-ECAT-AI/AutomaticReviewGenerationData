[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[3] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."

[4] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into recent developments and research focus areas:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as among the most active, selective, and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

2. Research has focused on understanding and optimizing the redox mechanism involving Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+). The concentration of these species depends on factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and support materials.

3. Recent efforts have aimed at achieving high dispersion of chromium oxide species to improve catalyst activity. This has led to increased interest in mesoporous supports.

4. Mesoporous sieves, particularly Cr-containing ones, have shown excellent catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation both with and without CO2.

5. The development of new support materials, such as SBA-1 mesoporous silica, has been a focus area due to their unique textural properties and potential for industrial applications.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention all industrial applications, it implies that propane dehydrogenation to produce propene is a key application area for chromium oxide-based catalysts.
