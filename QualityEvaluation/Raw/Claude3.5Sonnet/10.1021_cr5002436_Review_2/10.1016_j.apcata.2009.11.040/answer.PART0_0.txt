[1] "In the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, different oxide materials were investigated as catalysts [123]. Among them, much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."

[2] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."

[3] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr lodgings as high as possible should be achieved. From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."

[4] "Several recent investigations have shown that Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer insights into recent developments and research focus areas:

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts have emerged as among the most active, selective, and stable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.

2. Research has focused on understanding and optimizing the redox mechanism involving Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+). The concentration of these species depends on factors such as chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and support materials.

3. Recent efforts have aimed at achieving high dispersion of chromium oxide species to improve catalyst activity. This has led to increased interest in mesoporous supports.

4. Mesoporous sieves, particularly Cr-containing ones, have shown excellent catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation both with and without CO2.

5. The development of new support materials, such as SBA-1 mesoporous silica, has been a focus area due to their unique textural properties and potential for industrial applications.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention all industrial applications, it implies that propane dehydrogenation to produce propene is a key application area for chromium oxide-based catalysts.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实提供了关于最近发展和研究重点领域的见解：

1. 铬氧化物基催化剂已经成为CO2存在下丙烷脱氢反应中最活跃、选择性最高和最稳定的催化剂之一。

2. 研究重点集中在理解和优化涉及铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+）的氧化还原机制。这些物种的浓度取决于诸如铬负载量、制备条件、前驱体化合物和支撑材料等因素。

3. 近期努力旨在实现铬氧化物物种的高度分散，以提高催化剂活性。这导致了对介孔支撑材料的兴趣增加。

4. 介孔筛，特别是含铬的介孔筛，在有无CO2存在的丙烷脱氢反应中都表现出优异的催化活性。

5. 新型支撑材料的开发，如SBA-1介孔二氧化硅，由于其独特的纹理特性和工业应用潜力，成为一个重点研究领域。

虽然文档没有明确提到所有工业应用，但它暗示丙烷脱氢生产丙烯是铬氧化物基催化剂的一个关键应用领域。
