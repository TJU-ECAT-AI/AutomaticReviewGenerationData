Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have been known and studied for many decades. Key developments include:

1. Support materials: While gamma-alumina has been widely used as a support due to its high surface area, it has drawbacks like catalyzing side reactions. Zirconia has recently gained attention as an alternative support material.

2. Promoters: Alkali ions, especially potassium, have been used to poison acidic sites on alumina supports that cause side reactions and deactivation.

3. Active sites: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active chromium species, including their oxidation state and nuclearity.

4. Structure: Studies have examined catalysts with low chromium loading where all chromium ions are accessible to reactants.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Investigations have been conducted into the roles of different chromium species and support interactions in the dehydrogenation process.

Industrial applications include the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to produce alkenes for polymerization and other organic syntheses. Research continues to focus on improving catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability for these important industrial processes.

铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的应用已经研究了几十年。主要的发展包括：

1. 载体材料：虽然γ-氧化铝因其高比表面积而被广泛使用作为载体，但它也有催化副反应的缺点。二氧化锆最近作为替代载体材料受到了关注。

2. 助剂：碱金属离子，特别是钾，被用来毒化氧化铝载体上导致副反应和失活的酸性位点。

3. 活性位点：研究集中在理解活性铬物种的性质，包括它们的氧化态和核数。

4. 结构：研究了低铬负载的催化剂，其中所有铬离子都可以被反应物接触到。

5. 反应机理：对不同铬物种和载体相互作用在脱氢过程中的作用进行了调查。

工业应用包括轻烷烃的脱氢以生产用于聚合和其他有机合成的烯烃。研究继续专注于提高这些重要工业过程中催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
