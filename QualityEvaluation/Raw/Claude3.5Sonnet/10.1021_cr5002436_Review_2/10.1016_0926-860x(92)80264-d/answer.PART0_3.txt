Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have been known for decades. Key developments and research areas include:

1. Support materials: Gamma-alumina has been widely used, but it catalyzes undesired side reactions. Zirconia has recently gained attention as an alternative support material.

2. Promoters: Alkali ions, especially potassium, have been used to poison acidic sites responsible for side reactions on alumina supports.

3. Active sites: Research has focused on low chromium loading catalysts where all chromium ions are accessible to reactants.

4. Structure: Studies have examined the surface concentration and accessibility of chromium species.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Investigations have looked at the activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation.

Industrial applications are not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but the research focus on dehydrogenation processes suggests their importance in industrial settings where alkanes are converted to alkenes.

铬氧化物基催化剂用于脱氢过程已知数十年。主要发展和研究领域包括：

1. 载体材料：γ-氧化铝被广泛使用，但它会催化不良的副反应。近年来，氧化锆作为替代载体材料受到关注。

2. 促进剂：碱金属离子，特别是钾，被用来毒化氧化铝载体上负责副反应的酸性位点。

3. 活性位点：研究集中在低铬负载催化剂上，其中所有铬离子都可被反应物接触。

4. 结构：研究考察了铬物种的表面浓度和可及性。

5. 反应机理：调查了铬负载催化剂在烷烃脱氢中的活性和选择性。

文中没有明确提及工业应用，但对脱氢过程的研究重点表明它们在将烷烃转化为烯烃的工业环境中的重要性。
