Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have been known for decades, with significant developments occurring since their discovery in 1933. Key areas of research and industrial applications include:

1. Support materials: While gamma-alumina has been widely used due to its high surface area and refractory properties, it promotes undesirable side reactions like cracking and coking. This has led to exploration of alternative supports, with zirconia receiving increased attention recently.

2. Promoters: Alkali ions, particularly potassium, have been used to poison acidic sites responsible for side reactions on alumina supports, improving catalyst performance.

3. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active chromium species and their dispersion on the support. The study discussed catalysts with low chromium loading (up to 0.8 wt.%) where all chromium ions are accessible to reactants.

4. Reaction mechanisms: Investigations have been conducted into the dehydrogenation process, including the role of different chromium oxidation states and the involvement of support oxygen ions in the active site.

5. Industrial applications: While not explicitly mentioned in the quotes, chromium oxide catalysts are primarily used for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to produce alkenes for polymerization and other organic syntheses.

These developments have contributed to improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes, making them significant in both industrial applications and academic research.

自1933年发现以来，用于脱氢过程的铬氧化物基催化剂已经发展了数十年，取得了重大进展。研究和工业应用的主要领域包括：

1. 载体材料：虽然γ-氧化铝因其高比表面积和耐火性而被广泛使用，但它会促进裂解和结焦等不良副反应。这导致了对替代载体的探索，最近氧化锆受到了越来越多的关注。

2. 助剂：碱金属离子，特别是钾，被用来毒化氧化铝载体上负责副反应的酸性位点，从而改善催化剂性能。

3. 活性位点和结构：研究集中在理解活性铬物种的性质及其在载体上的分散情况。讨论的研究涉及低铬负载（高达0.8 wt.%）的催化剂，其中所有铬离子都能被反应物接触到。

4. 反应机理：对脱氢过程进行了研究，包括不同铬氧化态的作用以及载体氧离子在活性位点中的参与。

5. 工业应用：虽然在引用中没有明确提到，但铬氧化物催化剂主要用于轻烃的脱氢，生产用于聚合和其他有机合成的烯烃。

这些发展有助于改善铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的活性、选择性和稳定性，使其在工业应用和学术研究中都具有重要意义。
