[1] "The activity and selectivity of chromia-supported catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation has been known for many decades [1,2]."

[2] "Gamma-alumina is widely employed since it is a refractory high surface area material, but it presents the undesired feature of catalyzing side reactions (cracking and coking), leading to catalyst deactivation."

[3] "The acidic sites responsible for the side reactions can be poisoned with alkali ions (very often potassium) with satisfactory results."

[4] "Indeed, zirconia has recently received increasing attention in connection with its possible use as a catalyst support [6]."

[5] "With this background, a study of propane dehydrogenation has been undertaken with the aim of investigating: (i) the parameters influencing the activity and the deactivation, (ii) the regeneration of the deactivated catalyst, and (iii) the nature of the active sites."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts for dehydrogenation processes have been studied for decades since their discovery in the 1930s. Key developments and research areas include:

1. Support materials: Initially, gamma-alumina was widely used as a support due to its high surface area and refractory properties. However, it catalyzes unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking. More recently, zirconia has gained attention as a potential support material.

2. Promoters: Alkali ions, particularly potassium, have been used to poison acidic sites on the support that cause side reactions, improving catalyst performance.

3. Active sites and structure: Research has focused on understanding the nature of active sites, including the oxidation state of chromium and whether mononuclear or polynuclear species are responsible for activity.

4. Deactivation and regeneration: Studies have investigated factors affecting catalyst deactivation and methods for regenerating spent catalysts.

5. Reaction mechanisms: Efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms of dehydrogenation reactions on chromium oxide catalysts.

Industrial applications have primarily centered on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to produce alkenes for polymerization and other organic syntheses. The ongoing research aims to improve catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability for these important industrial processes.

自20世纪30年代发现以来,氧化铬基脱氢催化剂已经研究了几十年。主要发展和研究领域包括:

1. 载体材料:最初,γ-氧化铝因其高比表面积和耐火性而被广泛用作载体。然而,它会催化裂解和结焦等不需要的副反应。最近,二氧化锆作为潜在的载体材料引起了关注。

2. 助剂:碱金属离子,特别是钾,被用来毒化载体上引起副反应的酸性位点,从而改善催化剂性能。

3. 活性位点和结构:研究重点是了解活性位点的性质,包括铬的氧化态以及单核或多核物种是否负责活性。

4. 失活和再生:研究了影响催化剂失活的因素以及再生失活催化剂的方法。

5. 反应机理:努力阐明氧化铬催化剂上的脱氢反应机理。

工业应用主要集中在轻烷烃的脱氢,生产用于聚合和其他有机合成的烯烃。正在进行的研究旨在提高这些重要工业过程中催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
