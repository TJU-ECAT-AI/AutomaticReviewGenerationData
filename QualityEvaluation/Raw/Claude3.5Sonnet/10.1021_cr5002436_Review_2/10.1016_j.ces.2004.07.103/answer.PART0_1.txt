<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This literature does not provide information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 or discuss their key industrial applications and research focus areas in detail. The document focuses specifically on using spectroscopic techniques to study coke formation on a chromium oxide catalyst during propane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a broad overview of chromium oxide catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information given in this document.

这篇文献并未提供关于氧化铬基催化剂自1933年发现以来的历史演变信息,也没有详细讨论其主要工业应用和研究重点领域。该文档专门关注使用光谱技术研究丙烷脱氢过程中氧化铬催化剂上的积炭形成,而不是提供氧化铬催化剂的广泛概述。因此,仅基于本文档中给出的信息无法充分回答这个问题。
