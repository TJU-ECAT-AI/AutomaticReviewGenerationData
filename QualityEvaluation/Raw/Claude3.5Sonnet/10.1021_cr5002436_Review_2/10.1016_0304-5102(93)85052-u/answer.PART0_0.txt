[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

[3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does mention some key aspects of their development and significance:

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become well-known for their high catalytic activity in several important industrial processes, including:

- Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
- Dehydrocyclization of paraffins 
- Polymerization of olefins

Research has focused on understanding the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide species, as these are now believed to be responsible for the catalytic properties, rather than bulk chromium oxide phases. 

Key areas of investigation include:
- Factors determining chromium oxide surface structures
- Influence of support materials
- Effects of surface coverage and calcination temperature

While not explicitly stated, the text implies ongoing research into optimizing these catalysts through better understanding of their structure-function relationships.

这篇文献并没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史。然而，它确实提到了它们发展和重要性的一些关键方面：

铬氧化物基催化剂在几个重要的工业过程中因其高催化活性而闻名，包括：

- 碳氢化合物的氢化和脱氢
- 石蜡的脱氢环化
- 烯烃的聚合

研究集中在理解表面铬氧化物物种的分子结构，因为现在认为这些结构是催化性能的原因，而不是块状铬氧化物相。

主要研究领域包括：
- 决定铬氧化物表面结构的因素
- 载体材料的影响
- 表面覆盖率和煅烧温度的影响

虽然没有明确说明，但文本暗示正在进行优化这些催化剂的持续研究，通过更好地理解它们的结构-功能关系。
