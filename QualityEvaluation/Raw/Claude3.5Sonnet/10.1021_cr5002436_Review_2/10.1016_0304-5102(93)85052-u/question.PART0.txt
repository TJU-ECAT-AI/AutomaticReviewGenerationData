Abstract 
The Cr09/A1203 catalyst system was investigated by Baman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelec- 
tron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and BET surface area measurements in order to determine 
the molecular structures and monolayer coverage of the surface chromium oxide phase under 
ambient conditions. Up to a surface coverage of 9% Cr03/AIz0s, the chromium oxide is stabilized 
by the alumina support in the + 6 oxidation state after cakination at 120-1050 C. The molecular 
structures of the chromium (VI) oxide surface species are a function of the surface coverage and 
calcination temperature because under ambient conditions the surface structures depend on the 
net surface pH at point of zero charge of the hydrated oxide surface. Increasing the surface cov- 
erage results in a decrease of the net surface pH and formation of more polymerized chromium 
oxide species. High calcination temperatures ( ,950C) 
cause a reduction of the BET surface 
area, as well as a phase transformation of Y-AlzOs into &I-A120s, and also result in an increase in 
the surface density of the chromium oxide overlayer (more polymerized surface chromium oxide 
species). Monolayer coverage is reached at ca. 12% CrOs/AixOs and crystalline CrzO, particles 
are found on the alumina surface together with surface chromium oxide species at higher loadings. 
At high cakination 
temperatures ( 3 800  C 
) 
, the CrzOs crystaihne particles react with the aIu- 
mina support to form Cr (III) in solid solution with CY-A&O, 
(corundum). The cr-A&O, lattice is 
slightly expanded due to the incorporation of chromia.

Introduction 
Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic ac- 
tivity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, de- 
hydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins [

erally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface

chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crys- 
talline CrOB or Cr,O, [2]. This knowledge has led to much interest in the 
molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors 
which determine these chromium oxide surface structures 
[ 2-211. A program 
has been started to study the supported chromium oxide system as a function 
of surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, 
and presence of 
moisture 
[ 19-211, For the Cr03/A1203 system, it was shown that after im- 
pregnation with CrO, solutions and drying at 25 
C under vacuum, the chro- 
mium oxide is present as hydrated chromate species at 2% Cr03/A1z03, as 
hydrated dichromate species between 10 and 30% Cr03/A1203, as hydrated 
trichromate species at 40% Cr03/A1z03, and as crystalline CrO, and hydrated 
trichromate species at 60% Cr03/A1203 [ 19 
J 
. After calcination at 500 C and 
re-exposure to the laboratory atmosphere (ambient conditions), it was found 
that in the O&5% Cr03 loading range, chromium oxide is present as hydrated 
chromate and dichromate species and that the ratio monomers/dimers 
de- 
creases with increasing surface coverage [ 201. In situ dehydration 
of these 
Cr03/A1203 samples causes the transformation 
of the hydrated chromate and 
dichromate species into two dehydrated species, each possessing one short ter- 
minal Cr=O bond, and one or more polymeric species [ 211. The dehydrated 
surface structure was found to be independent of surface coverage in the 0.5 
9% CrO, range. 
In the present paper, the influence of loading (524% Cr03/A1z03) and 
calcination temperature 
(120-1050 C ) on the surface chromium oxide struc- 
tures are studied under ambient conditions by Raman spectroscopy. Further- 
more, X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy 
(XPS ), X-ray diffraction analysis 
(XRD), pH at point of zero charge measurements, 
and BET measurements 
are used to gain additional information on the chromium oxidation state, chro- 
mium oxide and alumina phases, surface acidity, and surface areas, respectively. 
Experimental 
Sample preparation 
The supported chromium oxide catalysts were prepared by the incipient- 
wetness impregnation of y-A1203 (Harshaw, 180 m"/g ) with an aqueous solu- 
tion of chromium nitrate, Cr ( 
N03)3. After the impregnation step, the samples 
were dried at room temperature 
overnight, followed by additional drying at 
120C overnight. Finally, the Cr03/A1203 samples were calcined at tempera- 
tures ranging from 250C to 1050 C for 16 h. The surface coverages are ex- 
pressed as wt% of Cr03. 
Ramun studies 
The Raman apparatus consisted of a Triplemate 
spectrometer 
(Spex, 
Model 1877) coupled to an optical multichannel 
analyzer (Princeton Applied 
M. A. Vuurman et al./J. Mol. Catal. 84 (1993) 193-205 
195 
Research, Model 1463) equipped with an intensified photodiode array detector 
(1024 pixels, cooled to - 30 C, resolution 1 cm-). The Raman spectra were 
recorded approximately 1 h after the calcination step. The samples were pressed 
onto KBr and spun at 2000 rpm to avoid local heating effects as much as pos- 
sible. The acquisition time per scan was 30 s and 10 scans were averaged. The 
514.5 nm line of an Argon ion laser (Spectra Physics) was used as the excita- 
tion source. The laser power at the sample was l-100 mW. 
XPS m4murements 
The XPS spectra were obtained on a Leybold-Heraeus 
LHS-10 electron 
spectrometer. The X-ray source was obtained from an aluminium anode op- 
erating at 12 kV and 25 mA, and the binding energies of the Cr 2pajz signals 
were referenced to the Al 2p peak at 74.5 eV. The XPS measurements 
were 
performed at 5 x lo- Torr. 
X-ray diffraction 
The identification 
of the crystalline phases was performed on a Philips 
diffractometer using Cu K, radiation and a diffracted beam monochromator. 
Lattice parameters were determined with the Least Square Unit Cell Refine- 
ment Program of the Material Research Laboratory of the Pennsylvania State 
University. 
BET surface area measurements 
The BET surface areas were obtained with a Quantsorb surface area ana- 
lyzer (Quantachrome 
corporation, Model OS-g) using nitrogen gas. 
Point of zero surface charge (PZC) measurements 
The PZC of A1203, 
and Cr03/A1203 samples were determined by the mass 
titration method. A 0.1 M NaCl solution was prepared using distilled, deion- 
ized, and degassed water. Various amounts of solid samples were added to Er- 
lenmeyer flasks and sealed. The flasks were evacuated and backfilled with ni- 
trogen. The NaCl solution was transferred 
to the flasks under a nitrogen 
atmosphere. The oxide/water solutions were stirred overnight. The pH of each 
solution was measured after 24 h of stirring. The pH meter was calibrated 
before each measurement. 
Results and discussion 
Influence of surface coverage 
In a previous investigation, the Raman spectra of a series of 0.5-5% CrOJ 
A1203 
samples after calcination at 500C and re-exposure to the atmosphere 
were presented and discussed [ 201. The 0.5% Cr03/A1203 sample showed Ra- 
196

man bands at co. 866 and cu. 350 cm-l, which were assigned to the symmetric 
stretching and bending modes of hydrated surface chromate species (Cr0,2- ), 
respectively [22]. Increasing the surface coverage to 5% CrOs resulted in an 
upward shift of these two modes to 896 and 362 cm-, respectively, and in the 
appearance of a new band at 217 cm-l, indicative of Cr-0-Cr linkages. These 
bands were assigned to hydrated dichromate species (Cr,O,2- ) with 896 cm-, 
v,(CrO,);362cm-,S(CrO,)and217cm-,S(CrOCr) 
[22].TheRamanspec- 
tra of supported chromium oxide catalysts possessing moderate and high load- 
ings (5-24% Cr03/A1203) are presented in Fig. 1. The Raman spectrum of the 
9% Cr03/A1203 sample reveals the same bands as the 5% Cr03/A1203 sample 
(also included in Fig. 1) and these bands are accordingly assigned to hydrated 
dichromate surface species. A small amount of the chromium oxide species is 
partly dehydrated by the heat of the laser, as indicated by the shoulder on the 
high frequency side of the strong 896 cm- band [ 19-211. The concentration 
of the latter species increases in the 12-24% CrOs coverage range, as demon- 
strated by the presence of a pronounced band at cu. 1000 cm- in the corre-

sponding spectra. This increase is due to darkening of the supported chromium 
oxide samples with increasing surface coverage (5% Cr0JA1203, light yellow 
to 24% Cr0JA1203, brown ), which results in an enhanced absorbance of the 
laser light. The surface structures of the completely dehydrated chromium ox- 
ide species after in situ thermal treatment have been discussed in a previous 
article [21]. The spectra of the 12-24% Cr03/A1203 samples further show 
shoulders on either side of the strong 896 cm- band at cu. 960 and cu. 850 
cm-, 
which are indicative of the presence of hydrated trichromate species 
(Cr30&- ) on the alumina surface [23]. The cu. 960, 896, and cu. 850 cm- 
bands are accordingly assigned to V, 
(CrO,), v, ( 
CrOB), and V, 
( 
OCrO), respec- 
tively [ 
23 
1. 
The Raman spectra of the 12-24% Cr0JA1203 samples further show a 
sharp band at 550 cm-, which becomes more pronounced with increasing cov- 
erage. This band belongs to metal-oxygen vibration of distorted octahedrally 
coordinated chromium atoms in crystalline Crz03 [24]. Thus, the Raman 
spectra demonstrate that up to a loading of cu. 9% CrOB 
the surface chromium 
oxide species are stabilized in the + 6 oxidation state by the alumina support, 
while at 12% CrOB, 
above monolayer coverage, part of the chromium oxide is 
reduced to the + 3 oxidation state forming crystalline Crz03. 
This is further supported by the XPS and XRD measurements. The bind- 
ing energies of the Cr 2p,,, peak of several reference chromium compounds, 
and of the 5% and 9% Cr03/A1203 sample are summarized in Table 1. The 
binding energies of the two Cr03/A1203 samples correspond to chromium oxide 
in the + 6 oxidation state, which is in agreement with a XPS study of Okamoto 
et al. [7]. The X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the presence of Crz03 crys- 
tallites at a surface coverage of 14% CrOs and higher after calcination at 500 C, 
as shown in Table 2. The discrepancy between the Raman and XRD data (12% 
and 14% Cr03/A1203, respectively) for detection of Crz03 is due to the fact 
that crystals must be larger than 40 A to be detected by XRD, while Raman 
spectroscopy has excellent sensitivity to metal oxide crystallites. A recent in- 
frared spectroscopy investigation of the hydroxyl region and of surface chem- 
isorbed CO:! species for this Cr03/A1203 system showed that most of the OHAl

groups were consumed and that the bands of surface chemisorbed CO2 species 
are almost completely suppressed at a surface coverage of cu. 12% CrO, [ 251. 
This further supports the conclusion that monolayer coverage has been reached 
at cu. 12% Cr03/A1203. 
The BET surface areas of the supported chromium oxide samples as a 
function of the loading are also shown in Table 2. These results reveal that the 
high surface area of the alumina support is maintained after addition of chro- 
mium oxide and calcination at 500 C. At higher surface coverages, the cata- 
lysts possess slightly smaller surface areas because of the increased catalyst 
weight due to the addition of chromium oxide. 
The PZC for some of the Cr03/A1203 samples are shown in Table 3. Alu- 
mina itself possesses a pH at PZC of 7.7, while upon introducing chromium 
oxide the PZC values decrease with increasing surface coverage. 
It is well known that in aqueous solutions of CrO, different chromium

199 
oxide species are present depending on the chromium concentration 
and so- 
lution pH [ 22,231. At low chromium concentrations 
and under basic condi- 
tions, Cr0,2- ions dominate, while in acid solutions at higher chromium con- 
centrations, Cr20$- ions are present. Under extreme conditions of acidity and 
high chromium concentration, 
CraO& , and probably Cr40$- ions are formed. 
The following successive equilibria have been proposed for the behaviour of 
Cr (VI) under varying acidic conditions in aqueous solutions:

(3) 
The present Raman spectra of the catalysts also reveal the presence of 
hydrated chromate, dichromate, and trichromate 
species, respectively, with 
increasing loading or decreasing pH at PZC. This similarity exists since after 
re-exposure to the atmosphere 
(ambient conditions) the surface of the oxide 
support becomes hydrated and the surface chromium oxide overlayer is essen- 
tially in an aqueous medium. Recently, Deo and Wachs developed a model, 
based upon this similarity, which predicts the molecular structures of sup- 
ported metal oxides (such as vanadium, tungsten, molybdenum, and rhenium) 
under ambient conditions 
[ 261. It was found that the metal oxide surface 
structures are dependent on the net pH at which the surface possesses zero 
surface charge. The net surface pH at point of zero charge is determined by the 
specific support (titania, alumina, silica, etc. ) and the surface coverage of the 
metal oxide. The addition of surface chromium oxide to alumina decreases the 
pH at PZC of the hydrated surface (see Table 3), and the decrease is propor- 
tional to the surface chromium oxide coverage. Consequently, the hydrated 
chromium oxide structure changes from chromate to dichromate, trichromate, 
and tetrachromate, 
and this is similar to the change in structure in aqueous 
solution as a function of the pH. Recently, exactly the same relationship be- 
tween structure and PZC has been found for molybdenum and tungsten oxides 
supported on alumina [ 271. 
Influence of Cal&nation temperature 
First the influence of calcination temperature on the y-AlzOB 
support has 
been studied and the resulting Raman spectra are presented in Fig. 2. The 
Raman spectrum of y-A1203 (500 C ) is not shown because the y-A&OS 
phase 
is Raman inactive. Calcination of the alumina support at 950C transforms 
the y-A1203 
phase into a mixture of 8- and 6-A1203 (major Raman bands at 
843, ca. 750, and 254 cm- ) . The transformation 
to 8- and 6-A1203 
is confirmed 
by the XRD analysis, while the BET surface area decreases to 94 m2/g, as 
revealed in Table 2. Further calcination at elevated temperatures 
(1200 C) 
transforms the alumina to cw-Al,O, (major Raman bands at 742,631,577,416, 
and 378 cm-). Figure 2 also shows the Raman spectrum of a reference com-

cu. 800, cu. 750, cu. 610, cu. 590, and cu. 400 cm-. 
The influence of calcination temperature upon the supported chromium 
oxide system was studied for the 5% CrC3/A1203 (120-1050 C) and 24% CrCJ 
A1203 (500-950C) 
sample. Figure 3 shows the Raman spectra of 5% CrOJ 
A1203 
as a function of calcination temperature after re-exposure to the atmo- 
sphere for 1 h. As described in the experimental section, the supported chro- 
mium oxide samples are prepared from aqueous solutions of chromium nitrate. 
After drying at 12OC, the nitrate is still present, as revealed by the strong 
v,(NO,) 
band at 1050 cm-l 
[ 281. The surface chromium oxide possesses a 
hydrated chromate structure, Cr0,2-, as demonstrated by the Raman bands at 
856 and cu. 350 cm- 
(very weak) [22]. Thus, drying at 120C oxidizes the 
chromium cation from + 3 to + 6. At first sight, the fact that drying at 120 C 
oxidizes the chromium cation from + 3 to + 6 sounds improbable, but support 
can be found in an article by Fouad et al. [ 
291. Accordingly, the oxidation is 
initiated near 200

and it proceeds at even lower temperatures in the presence of an active oxidant 
such as NO<. The nitrate is not stable at higher temperatures 
as revealed by 
the complete absence of the strong 1050 cm-l band after drying at 25OC, 
while the chromium oxide bands are the same as after drying at 120C and 
match those of hydrated chromate species. The Raman spectrum recorded after 
calcination at 500 C has been discussed above and reveals the presence of 
hydrated dichromate species. After calcination at 950 and 1050 C, the color of 
the 5% Cr03/A1203 sample changed from light yellow (120-500  C 
) to orange 
(950-1050C). This slight darkening of the sample results in some laser-in- 
duced dehydration as indicated by a weak band at cu. 1000 cm-. The presence 
of shoulders at both sites of the strong cu. 900 cm- band at cu. 950 and cu. 850 
cm- indicates the presence of hydrati 
trichromate species as discussed above. 
The Raman spectra further show additional bands after calcination at 950 or 
1050C at cu. 750, cu. 610,560, and 250 cm- due to the formation of 8,6-A1203 
(see Fig. 2). The transformation 
of y-A1203 
to 8,&A1203 
at elevated calcination 
temperatures 
is also reflected in the XRD patterns and in the dramatic de- 
crease of the BET surface area, as revealed in Table 2. Thus, the alumina 
support appears to stabilize the +6 oxidation state of the surface chromium 
oxide up to very high calcination temperatures.

changes, however, from hydrated chromate, via dichromate, to trichromate 
with increasing calcination temperature. The loading of all samples is the same, 
5% CrO,/Al,O,, but the amount of water present on the alumina surface after 
re-exposure to the atmosphere for approximately 1 h is larger after drying at 
low temperatures 
( 4 250 C) than after calcination at 500C [ 301. This is 
because after drying at 250C the surface is completely dehydrated but after 
calcination at 500 C also dehydroxylated. The rehydroxylation and water ad- 
sorption is probably not completed after 1 h for the sample calcined at 500C 
and, therefore, this sample contains less water. Considering equilibria ( 
1 
), (2)) 
and (3)) it is evident that the Hz0 content also influences these equilibria. If 
the water content is lower, as in the case of the sample calcined at 5OOC, 
equilibrium (1) shifts to the right, leading to the formation of dichromate spe- 
cies. Consequently, the net pH of the aqueous film will also be lower after 
calcination at 500C than after drying at 250C. The presence of hydrated 
trichromate species after calcination at 950 and 1050 C is probably caused by 
two factors. First, the water content will even be lower than in the case of the 
sample calcined at 5OOC, 
due to severe dehydroxylation. 
Second, the signifi- 
cant loss in surface area of the alumina support serves to increase the surface 
density of the chromium oxide overlayer. The decrease of water content and 
increase of surface density results in a shift of equilibrium (2) to the right 
leading to a further reduction of the net pH at PZC of the hydrated oxide 
surface and formation of trichromate species. 
The Raman spectra of the 24% Cr03/A1203 sample under ambient con- 
ditions after calcination at different temperatures are presented in Fig. 4. The 
Raman spectrum obtained after calcination at 500 C has been discussed above 
and it was shown that in addition to some laser-induced dehydrated chromium 
oxide species and hydrated trichromate species, crystalline Cr,O, particles are 
present on the alumina surface. After calcination 
at high temperatures 
( a800C), 
the Cr,O, particles are not stable since the 550 cm- band de- 
creases in intensity and is completely absent after calcination at 950C. The 
Raman spectrum after calcination at 950  C further shows bands at cu. 800, cu. 
750, cu. 610, cu. 590, and cu. 400 cm-l, which match those of Cr0.25A11.,503 
(see 
Fig. 2). The XRD analysis of the 24% Cr03/A1203 sample also reveals that the 
amount of Crz03 decreases after calcination at 800C and that a-A&O, is 
formed (Table 2). The a-Al,O, phase formed from the 24% Cr03/A1,03 at 
high calcination temperatures, 
however, possesses lattice parameters slightly 
different from those of an a-A1203 reference sample as shown in Table 4. Both 
parameters a and c appear to be slightly larger than for crystalline cu-Al,O,. 
Thus, the Raman spectra and XRD data reveal that at higher calcination tem- 
peratures crystalline Crz03 reacts with alumina to form a solid solution of C!I@ 
in cx-Al,O,. A similar observation has been made by Saleh et al. for a 7% Vz05/ 
TiOz sample after calcination at elevated temperatures 
[ 311. The disappear- 
ance of the Raman band of crystalline V205 and the distortion of the titania 
(rutile) lattice was attributed to the formation of a substitutional 
solid solu- 
tion of V4+ in TiOz ( 
rutile )

Conclusions 
It was found that up to a surface coverage of 9% Cr03/A1203 chromium 
oxide is stabilized by the alumina support 
in the + 6 oxidation state after cal- 
cination at 120-1050C. 
The molecular structures of the hydrated chro- 
mium (VI) oxide surface species, however, are a function of the surface cover- 
age and calcination temperature. This is because the surface structures are 
dependent on the net surface pH at PZC of the hydrated oxide surface. Increas- 
ing the surface coverage results in a decrease of net surface pH and formation 
of more polymerized chromium oxide species (dichromates, and trichro- 
mates ) 
. High calcination temperatures cause a reduction of the BET surface 
area and results in an increase of the surface density of the chromium oxide 
overlayer. The net surface pH decreases by the increase of surface density and, 
204 
M. A. Vuurman et al./J. Mol. Catal. 84 (1993) 193-205 
consequently, more polymerized chromium oxide species (trichromates) are 
found on the alumina surface. Monolayer coverage is reached at cu. 12% 
CrO,/ 
A1203 
and crystalline Crz03 
particles are found on the alumina surface together 
with surface chromium oxide species. At high calcination temperatures 
( 
&800C) the Cr203 crystalline particles react with the alumina support to 
form Cr(II1) in solid solution with a-A&O, (corundum). The a-Al,O, lattice 
is slightly expanded due to the incorporation of chromia.
