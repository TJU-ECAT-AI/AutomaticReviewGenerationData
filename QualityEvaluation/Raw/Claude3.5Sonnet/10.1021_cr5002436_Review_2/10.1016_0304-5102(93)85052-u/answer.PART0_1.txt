[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

[3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

The literature does not provide information on the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does highlight some key aspects of their current significance and research focus areas:

1. Chromium oxide catalysts are important for several industrial processes, including hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and olefin polymerization.

2. The catalytic properties are attributed to surface chromium oxide species rather than bulk chromium oxide phases.

3. Research has focused on understanding the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide phases and the factors that influence these structures.

4. Studies have examined the effects of surface coverage, support materials (e.g., alumina), calcination temperature, and presence of moisture on the chromium oxide structures.

5. Characterization techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, and BET surface area measurements have been employed to investigate these catalysts.

While the document does not explicitly mention promoters or detailed reaction mechanisms, it emphasizes the importance of understanding surface structures and their relationship to catalytic activity.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史演变信息，但它确实强调了它们当前的重要性和研究重点领域：

1. 铬氧化物催化剂在几个工业过程中很重要，包括烃类的氢化和脱氢、石蜡的脱氢环化以及烯烃的聚合。

2. 催化性能归因于表面铬氧化物物种，而不是体相铬氧化物。

3. 研究重点是了解表面铬氧化物相的分子结构以及影响这些结构的因素。

4. 研究考察了表面覆盖度、载体材料（如氧化铝）、煅烧温度和水分存在对铬氧化物结构的影响。

5. 使用拉曼光谱、XPS、XRD和BET比表面积测量等表征技术来研究这些催化剂。

虽然文档没有明确提到助剂或详细的反应机理，但它强调了理解表面结构及其与催化活性关系的重要性。
