[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

[3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

The literature does not provide information about the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it indicates that supported chromium oxides are important catalysts for several industrial processes, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, and olefin polymerization. 

Research has focused on understanding the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide species, which are believed to be responsible for the catalytic activity, rather than bulk chromium oxide phases. Scientists are interested in determining the factors that influence these surface structures.

The document does not provide specific information about the evolution of applications, active sites, support materials, promoters, or reaction mechanisms for chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. However, it is clear that there is ongoing research interest in elucidating the nature and behavior of surface chromium oxide species on supports like alumina.

该文献没有提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂演变的信息。然而，它表明负载型铬氧化物是几个工业过程的重要催化剂，包括加氢、脱氢、脱氢环化和烯烃聚合。

研究重点在于理解表面铬氧化物物种的分子结构，这些物种被认为是催化活性的原因，而不是bulk铬氧化物相。科学家们对决定这些表面结构的因素感兴趣。

该文档没有提供关于铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中应用、活性位点、载体材料、助剂或反应机理演变的具体信息。然而，很明显，对于阐明铬氧化物物种在氧化铝等载体上的性质和行为仍有持续的研究兴趣。
