[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

[3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide a comprehensive history of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does mention some key aspects of their development and significance:

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have become well-known for their high catalytic activity in several important industrial processes, including:

- Hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
- Dehydrocyclization of paraffins 
- Polymerization of olefins

Research has focused on understanding the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide species, as these are now believed to be responsible for the catalytic properties, rather than bulk chromium oxide phases. 

Key areas of investigation include:
- Factors determining chromium oxide surface structures
- Influence of support materials
- Effects of surface coverage and calcination temperature

While not explicitly stated, the text implies ongoing research into optimizing these catalysts through better understanding of their structure-function relationships.

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 has involved several key developments:

1. Recognition of their high catalytic activity for various reactions including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, and olefin polymerization.

2. Understanding that surface chromium oxide species, rather than bulk chromium oxide phases, are responsible for the catalytic properties.

3. Increased focus on studying the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide phases and the factors that influence these structures.

4. Research programs examining how variables like surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, and moisture affect the supported chromium oxide system.

Key industrial applications include hydrocarbon reactions and olefin polymerization. Research focus areas have centered on understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, exploring different support materials, and investigating reaction mechanisms. While the document doesn't mention specific promoters, the emphasis on studying various factors affecting catalyst performance suggests this may also be an area of interest.
