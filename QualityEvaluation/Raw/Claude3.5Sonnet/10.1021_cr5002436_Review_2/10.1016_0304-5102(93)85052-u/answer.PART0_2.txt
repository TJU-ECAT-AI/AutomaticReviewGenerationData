[1] "Supported chromium oxides are well known to possess high catalytic activity in hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons, dehydrocyclization of paraffins, and polymerization of olefins"

[2] "It is now generally accepted that the catalytic properties of these systems are due to surface chromium oxide species and not to bulk chromium oxide phases such as crystalline CrO3 or Cr2O3"

[3] "This knowledge has led to much interest in the molecular structures of the surface chromium oxide phases and in the factors which determine these chromium oxide surface structures"

[4] "A program has been started to study the supported chromium oxide system as a function of surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, and presence of moisture"

The evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 has involved several key developments:

1. Recognition of their high catalytic activity for various reactions including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, dehydrocyclization, and olefin polymerization.

2. Understanding that surface chromium oxide species, rather than bulk chromium oxide phases, are responsible for the catalytic properties.

3. Increased focus on studying the molecular structures of surface chromium oxide phases and the factors that influence these structures.

4. Research programs examining how variables like surface coverage, support type, calcination temperature, and moisture affect the supported chromium oxide system.

Key industrial applications include hydrocarbon reactions and olefin polymerization. Research focus areas have centered on understanding catalyst structure, identifying active sites, exploring different support materials, and investigating reaction mechanisms. While the document doesn't mention specific promoters, the emphasis on studying various factors affecting catalyst performance suggests this may also be an area of interest.

自1933年以来,铬氧化物催化剂的发展经历了几个关键阶段:

1. 认识到它们在多种反应中具有高催化活性,包括氢化、脱氢、脱氢环化和烯烃聚合。

2. 理解表面铬氧化物物种,而非体相铬氧化物,是催化性能的来源。

3. 更加关注研究表面铬氧化物相的分子结构及影响这些结构的因素。

4. 开展研究计划,考察表面覆盖度、载体类型、焙烧温度和水分等变量如何影响负载型铬氧化物体系。

主要工业应用包括烃类反应和烯烃聚合。研究重点领域集中在理解催化剂结构、识别活性位点、探索不同载体材料以及研究反应机理。虽然文献中没有提到具体的助剂,但对影响催化剂性能的各种因素的研究强调表明,这可能也是一个感兴趣的领域。
