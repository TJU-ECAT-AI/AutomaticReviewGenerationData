[1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

[2] "chromium-based catalysts employed in industrial plants possess higher concentrations of chromium, generally supported on alumina with alkali oxides as promoters [7]. The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

[3] "Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of their development and applications:

1. Chromium oxide catalysts have been extensively studied on various supports, including zirconia, alumina, and silica, for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly for propane and isobutane.

2. Industrial applications focus on chromium-based catalysts with higher chromium concentrations, typically supported on alumina with alkali oxide promoters. The main applications are:
   a) Propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization
   b) Isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene

3. Research has focused on understanding the role of the support material and supported chromium species, particularly when chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity. This includes comparing the activity of chromia/zirconia catalysts with chromia/alumina and chromia/silica systems.

4. Studies have investigated the structure and nature of active sites, including the oxidation states of chromium (CrVI, CrV, and CrIII) and their interactions with different support materials.

5. The impact of chromium loading, support type, and preparation methods on catalyst performance has been a key area of research.

While the document does not provide a complete historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts, it demonstrates ongoing research efforts to optimize these catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes by focusing on support materials, active sites, and reaction mechanisms.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实提供了一些关于其发展和应用的关键方面的见解：

1. 铬氧化物催化剂在各种载体上已经进行了广泛的研究，包括氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化硅，主要用于烷烃脱氢过程，特别是丙烷和异丁烷。

2. 工业应用主要集中在具有较高铬浓度的铬基催化剂上，通常以氧化铝为载体，并添加碱金属氧化物作为助剂。主要应用包括：
   a) 丙烷脱氢制丙烯，用于聚合
   b) 异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯

3. 研究重点在于理解载体材料和负载铬物种的作用，特别是当铬负载量超过单层容量时。这包括比较铬/氧化锆催化剂与铬/氧化铝和铬/二氧化硅系统的活性。

4. 研究调查了活性位点的结构和性质，包括铬的氧化态（CrVI、CrV和CrIII）及其与不同载体材料的相互作用。

5. 铬负载量、载体类型和制备方法对催化剂性能的影响一直是研究的重点领域。

虽然该文档没有提供铬氧化物基催化剂的完整历史演变，但它展示了持续的研究努力，旨在通过关注载体材料、活性位点和反应机理来优化这些催化剂用于工业脱氢过程。
