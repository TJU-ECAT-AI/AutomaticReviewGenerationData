[1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

[2] "chromium-based catalysts employed in industrial plants possess higher concentrations of chromium, generally supported on alumina with alkali oxides as promoters [7]. The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

[3] "Previous work on dilute ZC, AC and SC systems [13] indicated that: (i) the catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation was proportional to the Cr content; (ii) the dehydrogenation rate per Cr atom (i.e. the turnover frequency per Cr atom) was substantially higher for ZC than either AC or SC;"

[4] "Several Cr species were identied, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR g-signal), CrIII (ESR d-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters (ESR b-signal) and a-chromia."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer insights into some key aspects of their development and applications:

1. Chromium oxide catalysts have been extensively studied on various supports, including zirconia, alumina, and silica, for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly propane and isobutane dehydrogenation.

2. Industrial applications focus on propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization and isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. These catalysts typically use alumina as a support with alkali oxide promoters.

3. Research has focused on understanding the relationship between chromium content and catalytic activity, as well as the performance of different support materials. Zirconia-supported chromium catalysts have shown higher turnover frequencies compared to alumina and silica supports.

4. Structure and active site investigations have identified various chromium species present in these catalysts, including CrVI, CrV, CrIII, small CrIII oxide clusters, and α-chromia. The relative abundance and interaction of these species with the support material play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance.

5. The study of reaction mechanisms and the role of different chromium species in the catalytic process continues to be an important area of research, with particular attention given to high-oxidation state chromium species as precursors for catalytically active sites.

While the literature does not provide a comprehensive historical perspective, it demonstrates the ongoing importance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes and the continued research efforts to optimize their performance through understanding of structure-activity relationships and support material interactions.

虽然文献没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物催化剂的全面历史概述，但它确实提供了一些关于其发展和应用的关键方面的见解：

1. 铬氧化物催化剂在各种载体上，包括氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化硅，已经被广泛研究用于烷烃脱氢过程，特别是丙烷和异丁烷脱氢。

2. 工业应用主要集中在丙烷脱氢生产聚合用丙烯和异丁烷脱氢生产异丁烯。这些催化剂通常使用氧化铝作为载体，并添加碱金属氧化物作为助剂。

3. 研究重点在于理解铬含量与催化活性之间的关系，以及不同载体材料的性能。与氧化铝和二氧化硅载体相比，氧化锆负载的铬催化剂显示出更高的转化频率。

4. 结构和活性位点的研究已经识别出这些催化剂中存在的各种铬物种，包括CrVI、CrV、CrIII、小的CrIII氧化物簇和α-氧化铬。这些物种的相对丰度及其与载体材料的相互作用在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。

5. 反应机理的研究以及不同铬物种在催化过程中的作用继续是一个重要的研究领域，特别关注高氧化态铬物种作为催化活性位点前体的作用。

虽然文献没有提供全面的历史视角，但它展示了铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续重要性，以及通过理解结构-活性关系和载体材料相互作用来优化其性能的持续研究努力。
