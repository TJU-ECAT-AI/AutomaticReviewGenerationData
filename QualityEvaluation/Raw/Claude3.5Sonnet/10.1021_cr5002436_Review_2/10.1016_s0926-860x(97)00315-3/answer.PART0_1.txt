[1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

[2] "As given above, it was considered worthwhile to extend the studies giving attention to systems with higher loading of chromium, thereby moving towards systems whose surface chemistry approaches that of industrial catalysts."

[3] "The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

[4] "Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer insights into recent research focus areas and industrial applications:

1. Research has expanded to include higher chromium loadings on various supports, particularly zirconia, alumina, and silica. This shift aims to better understand systems that more closely resemble industrial catalysts.

2. Key industrial applications include propane dehydrogenation to produce propene for polymerization, and isobutane dehydrogenation to produce isobutene.

3. Research focus areas include:
   - Investigating the role of different supports (zirconia, alumina, silica)
   - Studying supported species at chromium loadings exceeding monolayer capacity
   - Comparing catalytic activity across different support materials
   - Examining the interaction between chromium species and support surfaces

4. The study emphasizes understanding structure-activity relationships, particularly how support materials and chromium loading affect catalyst performance in dehydrogenation processes.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention promoters or detailed reaction mechanisms, it demonstrates ongoing interest in optimizing chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes through a deeper understanding of their structure and active sites.

1. 研究已扩展到包括在各种载体上使用更高铬负载，特别是氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化硅。这种转变旨在更好地理解更接近工业催化剂的系统。

2. 主要工业应用包括丙烷脱氢生产聚合用丙烯，以及异丁烷脱氢生产异丁烯。

3. 研究重点领域包括：
   - 研究不同载体（氧化锆、氧化铝、二氧化硅）的作用
   - 研究铬负载超过单层容量时的负载物种
   - 比较不同载体材料的催化活性
