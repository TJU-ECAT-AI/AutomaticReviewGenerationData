[1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

[2] "The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

[3] "Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading."

The document does not provide information on the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does discuss some key aspects of current research and applications:

1. Industrial applications: The main applications are propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization, and isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene.

2. Research focus areas: 
- Support materials: The study focuses on zirconia, alumina, and silica as supports for chromium oxide catalysts.
- Structure and active sites: The research investigates the role of support and supported species when chromium loading exceeds monolayer capacity.
- Comparison of different supports: The study compares the activity of chromia/zirconia catalysts with chromia/alumina and chromia/silica systems.

The document does not provide specific information on promoters or detailed reaction mechanisms. The research appears to be focused on understanding the relationship between catalyst structure, composition, and activity in dehydrogenation processes.

该文档没有提供自1933年发现以来铬氧化物基催化剂的历史演变信息。但是，它确实讨论了当前研究和应用的一些关键方面：

1. 工业应用：主要应用是丙烷脱氢生成丙烯用于聚合，以及异丁烷脱氢生成异丁烯。

2. 研究重点领域：
- 载体材料：该研究重点关注氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化硅作为铬氧化物催化剂的载体。
- 结构和活性位点：研究调查了当铬负载超过单层容量时载体和负载物种的作用。
- 不同载体的比较：该研究比较了铬/氧化锆催化剂与铬/氧化铝和铬/二氧化硅系统的活性。

该文档没有提供关于助剂或详细反应机理的具体信息。研究似乎集中在理解催化剂结构、成分和脱氢过程活性之间的关系。
