The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer some insights into their evolution and current applications:

Chromium oxide catalysts have been developed for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane and isobutane. They are typically supported on materials like zirconia, alumina, or silica.

Industrial applications focus on:
1) Propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization
2) Isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene, which is used to produce ethers as octane boosters for unleaded gasoline

Key research areas include:
- Studying different support materials (zirconia, alumina, silica) and their effects on catalytic activity
- Investigating the role of chromium content and oxidation states
- Examining the use of alkali oxide promoters in industrial catalysts
- Understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and activity

The research has shown that zirconia-supported chromium catalysts exhibit higher activity per chromium atom compared to alumina or silica supports. This suggests that the interaction between chromium and the support material plays a crucial role in catalyst performance.

[2] "As given above, it was considered worthwhile to extend the studies giving attention to systems with higher loading of chromium, thereby moving towards systems whose surface chemistry approaches that of industrial catalysts."

[3] "The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

[4] "Interest was mainly focused on the zirconia support, but alumina and silica were also examined for comparison. A study was therefore undertaken to clarify the role of both the support and the supported species when the chromium loading exceeds the monolayer capacity of zirconia and to compare the activity of these catalysts with that of chromia/g-alumina and chromia/silica systems with a similar surface Cr loading."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. However, it does offer insights into recent research focus areas and industrial applications:

1. Research has expanded to include higher chromium loadings on various supports, particularly zirconia, alumina, and silica. This shift aims to better understand systems that more closely resemble industrial catalysts.

2. Key industrial applications include propane dehydrogenation to produce propene for polymerization, and isobutane dehydrogenation to produce isobutene.

3. Research focus areas include:
   - Investigating the role of different supports (zirconia, alumina, silica)
   - Studying supported species at chromium loadings exceeding monolayer capacity
   - Comparing catalytic activity across different support materials
   - Examining the interaction between chromium species and support surfaces

4. The study emphasizes understanding structure-activity relationships, particularly how support materials and chromium loading affect catalyst performance in dehydrogenation processes.

While the document doesn't explicitly mention promoters or detailed reaction mechanisms, it demonstrates ongoing interest in optimizing chromium oxide-based catalysts for industrial dehydrogenation processes through a deeper understanding of their structure and active sites.
