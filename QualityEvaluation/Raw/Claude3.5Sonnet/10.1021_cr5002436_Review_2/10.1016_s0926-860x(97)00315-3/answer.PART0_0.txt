[1] "In previous papers ([13], and references therein) we reported the results of investigations into chromia supported on either zirconia or g-alumina or silica systems employed as catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, namely propane and isobutane."

[2] "chromium-based catalysts employed in industrial plants possess higher concentrations of chromium, generally supported on alumina with alkali oxides as promoters [7]. The main applications are: (i) propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization; and (ii) isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene."

[3] "The demand for these ethers as octane number boosters for unleaded gasoline is continuously increasing."

[4] "Previous work on dilute ZC, AC and SC systems [13] indicated that: (i) the catalytic activity for alkane dehydrogenation was proportional to the Cr content; (ii) the dehydrogenation rate per Cr atom (i.e. the turnover frequency per Cr atom) was substantially higher for ZC than either AC or SC;"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive historical overview of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933. However, it does offer some insights into their evolution and current applications:

Chromium oxide catalysts have been developed for alkane dehydrogenation, particularly propane and isobutane. They are typically supported on materials like zirconia, alumina, or silica.

Industrial applications focus on:
1) Propane dehydrogenation to propene for polymerization
2) Isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene, which is used to produce ethers as octane boosters for unleaded gasoline

Key research areas include:
- Studying different support materials (zirconia, alumina, silica) and their effects on catalytic activity
- Investigating the role of chromium content and oxidation states
- Examining the use of alkali oxide promoters in industrial catalysts
- Understanding the relationship between catalyst structure and activity

The research has shown that zirconia-supported chromium catalysts exhibit higher activity per chromium atom compared to alumina or silica supports. This suggests that the interaction between chromium and the support material plays a crucial role in catalyst performance.

该文献并未提供自1933年以来铬氧化物基催化剂的全面历史概述。但是，它确实提供了一些关于它们的演变和当前应用的见解：

铬氧化物催化剂已被开发用于烷烃脱氢，特别是丙烷和异丁烷。它们通常负载在氧化锆、氧化铝或二氧化硅等材料上。

工业应用主要集中在：
1）丙烷脱氢制丙烯，用于聚合
2）异丁烷脱氢制异丁烯，用于生产醚类作为无铅汽油的辛烷值提升剂

主要研究领域包括：
- 研究不同载体材料（氧化锆、氧化铝、二氧化硅）及其对催化活性的影响
- 研究铬含量和氧化态的作用
- 研究工业催化剂中碱金属氧化物助剂的使用
- 理解催化剂结构与活性之间的关系

研究表明，相比于氧化铝或二氧化硅载体，氧化锆负载的铬催化剂表现出更高的单位铬原子活性。这表明铬与载体材料之间的相互作用在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。
