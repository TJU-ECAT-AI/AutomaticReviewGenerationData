The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or their key industrial applications. The document focuses on a specific study of chromium catalysts supported on ZSM-5 zeolites for ethane dehydrogenation using CO2 as an oxidant. It does not provide a broad historical or industrial perspective on chromium oxide catalysts.

However, the paper does discuss some aspects of research focus areas for these catalysts, including:

1. Structure and active sites: The study investigates the oxidation state and structure of chromium species on zeolite supports, identifying Cr6+=O (possibly Cr5+=O) as the active species.

2. Support materials: The research examines the effect of different zeolite supports, particularly the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ZSM-5, on catalyst activity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The paper proposes a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr5+ and Cr3+ species during the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Role of promoters/co-feeds: The study explores the use of CO2 as an oxidant and its effects on catalyst activity and carbon removal.

While these aspects are discussed in the context of this specific study, the paper does not provide a comprehensive overview of the historical development or industrial significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

给定的文献并不包含关于铬氧化物催化剂自1933年以来的历史演变或其主要工业应用的信息。该文档主要关注以CO2为氧化剂的ZSM-5分子筛负载的铬催化剂用于乙烷脱氢的特定研究。它并未提供铬氧化物催化剂的广泛历史或工业视角。

然而，该论文确实讨论了这些催化剂研究重点领域的一些方面，包括：

1. 结构和活性位点：该研究考察了分子筛载体上铬物种的氧化态和结构，确定Cr6+=O（可能是Cr5+=O）为活性物种。

2. 载体材料：研究考察了不同分子筛载体，特别是ZSM-5的SiO2/Al2O3比对催化剂活性的影响。

3. 反应机理：论文提出了在脱氢反应过程中涉及Cr6+/Cr5+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原循环。

4. 助剂/共进料的作用：该研究探讨了CO2作为氧化剂的使用及其对催化剂活性和碳去除的影响。

虽然这些方面在这项特定研究的背景下被讨论，但该论文并未提供铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中历史发展或工业重要性的全面概述。

It does not provide a broad overview of chromium oxide catalysts or their historical development.

However, the paper does discuss some aspects of chromium catalyst research, including:

2. Support materials: The research examines the effect of different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios in ZSM-5 zeolites on catalyst activity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The paper proposes a redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr5+ and Cr3+ species during the dehydrogenation reaction.

4. Role of promoters/co-feeds: The study explores the use of CO2 as an oxidant and its effects on catalyst performance and carbon removal.

While these aspects are discussed in the context of ethane dehydrogenation, the paper does not provide a comprehensive overview of chromium oxide catalysts in various industrial applications or their historical development since 1933.

The provided literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since 1933 or their key industrial applications. The document focuses on a specific study of Cr/ZSM-5 catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation using CO2, rather than providing a broad overview of chromium oxide catalysts. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the given information.

However, the document does discuss some aspects of chromium-based catalysts for dehydrogenation, including:

1. The use of Cr catalysts supported on high-silica H-ZSM-5 zeolites for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2.

2. Research focus on understanding the structure and oxidation state of active Cr species (Cr6+ or possibly Cr5+) on the zeolite support.

3. Investigation of the redox cycle involving Cr6+/Cr5+ and Cr3+ species during the reaction.

4. Study of support materials, particularly the influence of SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in ZSM-5 zeolites on catalyst activity.

5. Examination of the role of CO2 as an oxidant and its effect on carbon deposition and catalyst regeneration.

While these aspects provide some insight into current research areas for chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, they do not address the broader historical context or industrial applications requested in the original question.

然而，该文档确实讨论了铬基脱氢催化剂的一些方面，包括：

1. 使用高硅H-ZSM-5沸石负载的Cr催化剂，利用CO2进行乙烷的氧化脱氢。

2. 研究重点是了解沸石载体上活性Cr物种（Cr6+或可能是Cr5+）的结构和氧化态。

3. 研究反应过程中涉及Cr6+/Cr5+和Cr3+物种的氧化还原循环。

4. 研究载体材料，特别是ZSM-5沸石中SiO2/Al2O3比对催化剂活性的影响。

5. 研究CO2作为氧化剂的作用，以及其对碳沉积和催化剂再生的影响。

虽然这些方面为当前铬基脱氢催化剂的研究领域提供了一些见解，但它们并没有涉及原始问题所要求的更广泛的历史背景或工业应用。

1. Highly active catalysts contained Cr6+ or Cr5+ species on high-silica ZSM-5 supports.

2. A redox cycle between Cr6+/Cr5+ and Cr3+ states is important for catalytic activity. 

3. CO2 plays roles in oxidizing the reduced Cr species and removing carbon deposits.

4. Support properties like SiO2/Al2O3 ratio affect the Cr species and catalyst performance.

While these insights contribute to understanding of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts, the paper does not provide a comprehensive overview of the field's historical development or industrial applications as requested in the question.
