<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933, nor does it discuss their key industrial applications and research focus areas in a broad historical context. The document focuses on a specific study comparing zirconia-, alumina-, and zirconia/alumina-supported chromia catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the field. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933. The document focuses on a specific study comparing zirconia-, alumina-, and zirconia/alumina-supported chromia catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not provide a broad overview of the development of these catalysts over time or discuss their various industrial applications and research focus areas. The text is limited to describing experimental results related to catalyst activity, coke formation, and surface species observed during dehydrogenation reactions for the specific catalysts studied.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information about the historical evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts since their discovery in 1933 or their key industrial applications. The text focuses on a specific study comparing zirconia-, alumina-, and zirconia/alumina-supported chromia catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation. It does not provide a broad overview of the development and applications of chromium oxide catalysts over time.

However, the literature does touch on some research focus areas for chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts, including:

1. Support materials: The study compares zirconia, alumina, and zirconia/alumina as supports for chromia catalysts.

2. Structure and active sites: The text discusses chromium oxidation states, surface species, and their relation to catalytic activity.

3. Reaction mechanisms: The formation of various surface species during dehydrogenation is examined using spectroscopic techniques.

4. Catalyst performance: Dehydrogenation activity, coke formation, and the effects of pretreatment are investigated.

While these aspects are explored in the context of this specific study, the literature does not provide a comprehensive overview of the historical development and industrial significance of chromium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

给定的文献并未包含关于铬氧化物催化剂自1933年发现以来的历史演变或其主要工业应用的信息。该文本专注于比较二氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化锆/氧化铝负载的铬催化剂用于异丁烷脱氢的特定研究。它没有提供铬氧化物催化剂随时间发展和应用的广泛概述。

然而，该文献确实涉及了铬基脱氢催化剂的一些研究重点领域，包括：

1. 载体材料：该研究比较了二氧化锆、氧化铝和二氧化锆/氧化铝作为铬催化剂的载体。

2. 结构和活性位点：文本讨论了铬的氧化态、表面物种及其与催化活性的关系。

3. 反应机理：使用光谱技术研究了脱氢过程中各种表面物种的形成。

4. 催化剂性能：研究了脱氢活性、积碳形成以及预处理的影响。

虽然这些方面在这项特定研究的背景下进行了探讨，但该文献并未提供铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢过程中历史发展和工业重要性的全面概述。
