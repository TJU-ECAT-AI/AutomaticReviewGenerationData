Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery by Frey and Huppke in 1933. They have become the commercial catalyst of choice for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the form of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

Key industrial applications include the production of propene and isobutene, with the CATOFIN process being a world leader in this field. The process has an installed capacity of 600,000 metric tons per year for propene and 2,600,000 metric tons per year for isobutene.

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance include:

1. Identification of active sites
2. Influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic performance
3. Elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism
4. Support materials: While alumina remains the preferred support, other materials like zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been extensively studied.
5. Promoters: Alkali ion dopants, particularly potassium, are used to mitigate the acidity of the alumina support and improve catalyst performance.

These research efforts have led to a deeper understanding of the catalyst structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms, contributing to the ongoing improvement and widespread industrial use of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年Frey和Huppke发现以来，铬氧化物基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变。它们已成为烷烃脱氢过程中首选的商业催化剂，特别是以Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的形式。

主要工业应用包括丙烯和异丁烯的生产，其中CATOFIN工艺在这一领域处于世界领先地位。该工艺的丙烯年产能为60万吨，异丁烯年产能为260万吨。

对其重要性有贡献的研究重点领域包括：

1. 活性位点的识别
2. 制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种和催化性能的影响
3. 脱氢机理的阐明
4. 载体材料：虽然氧化铝仍然是首选载体，但其他材料如氧化锆、二氧化硅和氧化镁也已被广泛研究。
5. 助剂：使用碱金属离子掺杂剂，特别是钾，以减轻氧化铝载体的酸性并改善催化剂性能。

这些研究努力导致了对催化剂结构、活性位点和反应机理的更深入理解，促进了铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续改进和广泛工业应用。
