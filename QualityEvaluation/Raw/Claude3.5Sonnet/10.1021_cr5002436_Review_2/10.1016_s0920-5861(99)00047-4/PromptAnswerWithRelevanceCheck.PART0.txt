[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[2] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

[3] "Propene is used in the polymer industry for the synthesis of high-purity polypropylene, whereas isobutene is needed for the synthesis of MTBE and ETBE, additives to gasoline."

[4] "Although alumina with a surface area of 50–300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail"

[5] "To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery by Frey and Huppke in 1933. They have become the commercial catalyst of choice for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the form of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

Key industrial applications include the production of propene for high-purity polypropylene synthesis and isobutene for MTBE and ETBE production as gasoline additives.

Research focus areas have centered on:
1. Identifying active sites
2. Understanding how preparation and treatment conditions affect chromium oxide speciation and catalytic performance
3. Elucidating the dehydrogenation mechanism

Support materials have been a key area of development. While alumina remains the preferred industrial support, other materials like zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have been extensively studied. The surface area of alumina supports typically ranges from 50-300 m2/g.

To improve catalyst performance, researchers have investigated the use of promoters. Notably, alkali ion dopants (especially potassium) are often used to poison acid sites on the alumina support, which can lead to unwanted side reactions. These dopants are typically added in concentrations up to 2 wt%.

Overall, the evolution of chromium oxide-based catalysts has been driven by a combination of industrial needs and fundamental research into catalyst structure and function, leading to their current significance in dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年Frey和Huppke发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经发展了很多。它们已成为烷烃脱氢过程中首选的商业催化剂，特别是以Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的形式。

主要工业应用包括生产用于高纯度聚丙烯合成的丙烯，以及生产用作汽油添加剂的MTBE和ETBE的异丁烯。

研究重点领域集中在：
1. 识别活性位点
2. 了解制备和处理条件如何影响氧化铬的形态和催化性能
3. 阐明脱氢机理

载体材料一直是发展的关键领域。虽然氧化铝仍然是首选的工业载体，但其他材料如氧化锆、二氧化硅和氧化镁也已被广泛研究。氧化铝载体的比表面积通常在50-300 m2/g范围内。

为了提高催化剂性能，研究人员还研究了助剂的使用。值得注意的是，碱金属离子掺杂剂（尤其是钾）经常被用来毒化氧化铝载体上的酸性位点，这些位点可能导致不需要的副反应。这些掺杂剂的添加浓度通常高达2 wt%。

总的来说，氧化铬基催化剂的演变是由工业需求和对催化剂结构和功能的基础研究共同推动的，这使得它们在脱氢过程中具有现今的重要性。

[3] "The CATOFIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane."

[4] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail [7]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery by Frey and Huppke in 1933. They have become the commercial catalyst of choice for alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their superior properties. The key industrial application is the production of propene and isobutene, with the CATOFIN process being a world leader in this field.

Research has focused on several key areas:

1. Identification of active sites
2. Influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic performance
3. Elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism
4. Optimization of support materials and promoters

While alumina remains the preferred support for industrial applications, other materials like zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been extensively studied. The chromium loading typically ranges from 1-3 wt%, although activity has been observed across a wider range (0-20 wt%).

Dopants are often added to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity, contributing to the overall effectiveness of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. The continued research and development in these areas have maintained the significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the industry for decades.
