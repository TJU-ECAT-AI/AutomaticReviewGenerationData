[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[2] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

[3] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity."

[4] "Although alumina with a surface area of 50–300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail"

[5] "The CATOFIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery by Frey and Huppke in 1933. They have become the commercial catalyst of choice for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the form of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts. 

Key industrial applications include the production of propene and isobutene, with the CATOFIN process being a world leader in this field. The research focus areas that have contributed to their significance include:

1. Identification of active sites
2. Influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic performance
3. Elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism
4. Optimization of support materials (primarily alumina, but also zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide)
5. Use of dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity

These catalysts have been extensively studied and optimized over the years, with researchers exploring various aspects such as chromium loading, support materials, and preparation methods to enhance their performance in dehydrogenation processes.

自1933年Frey和Huppke发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经发展得很显著。它们已成为烷烃脱氢过程中首选的商业催化剂，特别是Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂形式。

主要工业应用包括丙烯和异丁烯的生产，其中CATOFIN工艺在这一领域处于世界领先地位。对其重要性有贡献的研究重点领域包括：

1. 活性位点的识别
2. 制备和处理条件对氧化铬物种和催化性能的影响
3. 脱氢机理的阐明
4. 载体材料的优化（主要是氧化铝，但也包括氧化锆、二氧化硅和氧化镁）
5. 使用掺杂剂来调节失活和提高选择性

这些催化剂多年来已经被广泛研究和优化，研究人员探索了各种方面，如铬负载量、载体材料和制备方法，以提高它们在脱氢过程中的性能。
