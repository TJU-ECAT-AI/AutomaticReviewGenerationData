          [1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[2] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

[3] "The CATOFIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane."

[4] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail [7]."

[5] "To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%."

          Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery by Frey and Huppke in 1933. They have become the commercial catalyst of choice for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly in the form of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.

Key industrial applications include the production of propene and isobutene, with the CATOFIN process being a world leader in this field. The process has an installed capacity of 600,000 metric tons per year for propene and 2,600,000 metric tons per year for isobutene. It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane.

Research focus areas that have contributed to their significance include:

1. Identification of active sites
2. Influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic performance
3. Elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism
4. Support materials: While alumina with a surface area of 50-300 m2/g remains the preferred support for industrial applications, other materials like zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been extensively studied.
5. Chromium loading: Typically around 1-3 wt% Cr, but activity has been observed in the range of 0-20 wt% Cr.
6. Promoters: Alkali ion dopants, particularly potassium (up to 2 wt%), are used to mitigate the acidity of the alumina support, regulate deactivation, and improve selectivity.

These research efforts have led to a deeper understanding of the catalyst structure, active sites, and reaction mechanisms, contributing to the ongoing improvement and widespread industrial use of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

          自1933年Frey和Huppke发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经发生了显著的演变。它们已成为烷烃脱氢过程中首选的商业催化剂，特别是以Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的形式。

主要工业应用包括丙烯和异丁烯的生产，其中CATOFIN工艺在这一领域处于世界领先地位。该工艺的丙烯年产能为60万吨，异丁烯年产能为260万吨。据估计，全球25%的MTBE产量来自异丁烷的催化脱氢。

对其重要性有贡献的研究重点领域包括：

1. 活性位点的识别
2. 制备和处理条件对铬氧化物物种和催化性能的影响
3. 脱氢机理的阐明
4. 载体材料：虽然表面积为50-300 m2/g的氧化铝仍然是工业应用的首选载体，但其他材料如氧化锆、二氧化硅和氧化镁也已被广泛研究。
5. 铬负载量：通常在1-3 wt%左右，但在0-20 wt%的范围内都观察到了活性。
6. 助剂：使用碱金属离子掺杂剂，特别是钾（最高2 wt%），以减轻氧化铝载体的酸性，调节失活并改善选择性。

这些研究努力导致了对催化剂结构、活性位点和反应机理的更深入理解，促进了铬氧化物基催化剂在脱氢过程中的持续改进和广泛工业应用。
