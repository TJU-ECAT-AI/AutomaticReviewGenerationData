[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[2] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

[3] "The CATOFIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively."

[4] "Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail"

[5] "To overcome these problems, the responsible acid sites are often poisoned with an alkali ion dopant, mostly potassium, in a concentration up to 2 wt%."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery by Frey and Huppke in 1933. They have become the commercial catalyst of choice for alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their superior properties. The key industrial application is in the production of propene and isobutene, with the CATOFIN process being a world leader in this field.

Research focus areas have included:

1. Identification of active sites
2. Understanding the influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic performance
3. Elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism
4. Exploration of different support materials beyond the preferred alumina, such as zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide
5. Use of promoters like potassium to mitigate issues with the alumina support

These research efforts have contributed to the ongoing significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes by improving their performance, understanding their structure and function, and addressing challenges associated with their use.
