[1] "Since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [4,5], the superior properties of supported chromium oxide catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation are well-known, and Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are widely used as the commercial catalyst of choice."

[2] "All the newer studies primarily focus on (a) identification of the active sites; (b) influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation, and on the catalytic activity/selectivity; and (c) elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism."

[3] "The CATOFIN1 process leads the world for producing propene and isobutene with an installed capacity of 600 000 and 2 600 000 metric tons per year, respectively. It is estimated that 25% of the worldwide production of MTBE originates from the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane."

[4] "Commercial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts are typically composed of chromium oxides dispersed on a porous support including dopants to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity. The Cr loading is mostly around 13 wt% Cr [56], but dehydrogenation activity has been observed in the entire range between 0 and 20 wt% Cr. Although alumina with a surface area of 50300 m2/g is the preferred support for industrial applications, other supports such as zirconia, silica and magnesium oxide have also been studied in great detail [7]."

Chromium oxide-based catalysts have evolved significantly since their discovery by Frey and Huppke in 1933. They have become the commercial catalyst of choice for alkane dehydrogenation processes due to their superior properties. The key industrial application is the production of propene and isobutene, with the CATOFIN process being a world leader in this field.

Research has focused on several key areas:

1. Identification of active sites
2. Influence of preparation and treatment conditions on chromium oxide speciation and catalytic performance
3. Elucidation of the dehydrogenation mechanism
4. Optimization of support materials and promoters

While alumina remains the preferred support for industrial applications, other materials like zirconia, silica, and magnesium oxide have also been extensively studied. The chromium loading typically ranges from 1-3 wt%, although activity has been observed across a wider range (0-20 wt%).

Dopants are often added to regulate deactivation and improve selectivity, contributing to the overall effectiveness of these catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. The continued research and development in these areas have maintained the significance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the industry for decades.

自1933年Frey和Huppke发现以来，氧化铬基催化剂已经有了显著的发展。由于其优越的性能，它们已成为烷烃脱氢过程中首选的商业催化剂。其主要工业应用是生产丙烯和异丁烯，其中CATOFIN工艺在该领域处于世界领先地位。

研究主要集中在以下几个关键领域：

1. 活性位点的识别
2. 制备和处理条件对氧化铬物种和催化性能的影响
3. 阐明脱氢机理
4. 优化载体材料和助剂

虽然氧化铝仍然是工业应用的首选载体，但其他材料如氧化锆、二氧化硅和氧化镁也已被广泛研究。铬的负载量通常在1-3 wt%范围内，尽管在更宽的范围内（0-20 wt%）都观察到了活性。

经常添加助剂以调节失活和提高选择性，这有助于提高这些催化剂在脱氢过程中的整体效果。这些领域的持续研究和开发使氧化铬基催化剂在行业中数十年来一直保持着重要地位。
