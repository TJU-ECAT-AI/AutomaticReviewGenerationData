[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[6] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

The literature focuses on the use of N2O as a soft oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nickel molybdate catalysts. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or discuss other soft oxidants in detail. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. Performance of nickel molybdate catalysts with N2O:
- At low concentrations (300 ppm), N2O improves propylene yield and selectivity while decreasing propane conversion.
- At higher concentrations (1-10%), propylene selectivity decreases, and carbonaceous products form.

2. Mechanism of N2O action:
- N2O induces reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface by inhibiting O2 adsorption.
- This slows down catalyst reoxidation, leading to a more reduced state of the catalyst.

3. Challenges and future research directions:
- Optimizing N2O concentration to balance selectivity and conversion.
- Understanding the interplay between N2O and O2 in the reaction system.
- Investigating the transitory nature of propylene production with pure N2O.

4. Strategies for improvement:
- Modulating the oxidation state of oxide catalysts by adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O and CO2.
- Balancing the reducing effect of N2O with the oxidizing effect of O2 to achieve optimal catalyst performance.

The study does not address corrosiveness issues, C-H bond activation strategies, or catalyst regenerability directly. It suggests that future research should focus on understanding and optimizing the complex interactions between soft oxidants, molecular oxygen, and the catalyst surface to enhance ODHP processes.

该文献主要关注在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中使用N2O作为软氧化剂，并使用镍钼酸盐催化剂。虽然文献没有对各种催化剂系统进行全面比较或详细讨论其他软氧化剂，但可以提取一些关键点：

1. 使用N2O的镍钼酸盐催化剂性能：
- 在低浓度（300 ppm）下，N2O提高了丙烯产率和选择性，同时降低了丙烷转化率。
- 在较高浓度（1-10%）下，丙烯选择性下降，并形成碳质产物。

2. N2O的作用机制：
- N2O通过抑制O2吸附，诱导催化剂表面Mo的还原。
- 这减缓了催化剂的再氧化速率，使催化剂处于更还原的状态。

3. 挑战和未来研究方向：
- 优化N2O浓度以平衡选择性和转化率。
- 理解N2O和O2在反应系统中的相互作用。
- 研究纯N2O条件下丙烯生产的瞬态性质。

4. 改进策略：
- 通过调整N2O和CO2等促进剂的浓度来调节氧化物催化剂的氧化态。
- 平衡N2O的还原作用和O2的氧化作用，以实现最佳催化剂性能。

该研究没有直接涉及腐蚀性问题、C-H键活化策略或催化剂再生能力。它建议未来的研究应该集中在理解和优化软氧化剂、分子氧和催化剂表面之间的复杂相互作用，以增强ODHP过程。
