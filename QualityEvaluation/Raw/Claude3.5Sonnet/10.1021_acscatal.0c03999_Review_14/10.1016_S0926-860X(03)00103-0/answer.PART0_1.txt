[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using N2O as a soft oxidant on nickel molybdate catalysts. The key findings include:

1. Low concentrations of N2O (300 ppm) improve propylene yield and selectivity while decreasing propane conversion.

2. N2O induces reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface by inhibiting O2 adsorption, slowing down catalyst reoxidation.

3. Higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%) lead to decreased propylene selectivity, oxygen consumption, and CO2 selectivity. The catalyst becomes more deeply reduced, and carbonaceous products form.

4. Adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O and CO2 can modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts during the reaction, affecting catalytic performance.

The study does not directly compare various catalyst systems or discuss other soft oxidants. It focuses primarily on nickel molybdate catalysts with N2O as a promoter.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:

1. Balancing catalyst reduction and oxidation states for optimal performance
2. Preventing excessive catalyst reduction at higher N2O concentrations
3. Controlling carbonaceous product formation

Key areas for future research and development based on this study include:

1. Optimizing N2O concentrations for different catalyst systems
2. Investigating combinations of promoters (e.g., N2O and CO2) to fine-tune catalyst oxidation states
3. Developing strategies to maintain optimal catalyst reduction levels during reaction
4. Exploring the use of other soft oxidants in combination with N2O
5. Improving catalyst regenerability to address deep reduction and carbonaceous product formation

The study does not specifically address C-H bond activation or reaction system renovation, but these remain important areas for future ODHP research.

该文献讨论了使用N2O作为软氧化剂在镍钼酸盐催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展。主要发现包括：

1. 低浓度N2O（300 ppm）可提高丙烯产率和选择性，同时降低丙烷转化率。

2. N2O通过抑制O2吸附来诱导催化剂表面Mo的还原，从而减缓催化剂的再氧化速率。

3. 较高浓度的N2O（1-10%）导致丙烯选择性、氧气消耗和CO2选择性降低。催化剂被更深度还原，并形成碳质产物。

4. 调节N2O和CO2等促进剂的浓度可以调节反应过程中氧化物催化剂的氧化态，从而影响催化性能。

该研究没有直接比较各种催化剂系统或讨论其他软氧化剂。它主要关注以N2O为促进剂的镍钼酸盐催化剂。

ODHP中持续存在的挑战包括：

1. 平衡催化剂的还原和氧化状态以获得最佳性能
2. 防止在较高N2O浓度下催化剂过度还原
3. 控制碳质产物的形成

基于这项研究，未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 为不同的催化剂系统优化N2O浓度
2. 研究促进剂的组合（例如N2O和CO2）以微调催化剂的氧化态
3. 开发策略以在反应过程中保持最佳的催化剂还原水平
4. 探索与N2O组合使用其他软氧化剂
5. 改善催化剂的再生能力，以解决深度还原和碳质产物形成的问题

该研究没有具体涉及C-H键活化或反应系统改造，但这些仍然是未来ODHP研究的重要领域。
