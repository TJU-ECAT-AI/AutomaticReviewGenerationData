[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved. Decreases in the oxygen consumption, in the yield and in the selectivity in CO2 were also observed."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. It focuses mainly on the effects of N2O as a gas dope on nickel molybdate catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from the available information:

1. Performance of nickel molybdate catalysts with N2O:
- At low concentrations (300 ppm) of N2O, propylene yield and selectivity improve, while propane conversion decreases.
- Higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%) lead to decreased propylene selectivity and increased formation of carbonaceous products.

2. Challenges in ODHP:
- Balancing the oxidation state of the catalyst to achieve optimal performance.
- Controlling the formation of carbonaceous products at higher concentrations of soft oxidants.

3. Key areas for future research:
- Optimizing the concentration of promoters (like N2O and CO2) to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts.
- Understanding the mechanisms by which soft oxidants interact with catalyst surfaces.
- Investigating the long-term stability and regenerability of catalysts under different oxidant conditions.

4. Strategies for improvement:
- Using a combination of oxidants (e.g., N2O and O2) to balance catalyst reduction and oxidation.
- Exploring other soft oxidants and their effects on different catalyst systems.
- Developing methods to control the adsorption and dissociation of oxidants on catalyst surfaces.

The literature does not specifically address C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, or reaction system renovation. More comprehensive research is needed to fully address the question and compare different catalyst systems for ODHP using soft oxidants.

该文献并未提供使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的各种催化剂系统的全面比较。它主要集中在N2O作为气体掺杂剂对钼酸镍催化剂的影响。但是，从可用信息中可以得出一些见解：

1. 使用N2O的钼酸镍催化剂的性能：
- 在低浓度（300 ppm）的N2O下，丙烯产率和选择性提高，而丙烷转化率降低。
- 较高浓度的N2O（1-10%）导致丙烯选择性降低和碳质产物形成增加。

2. ODHP的挑战：
- 平衡催化剂的氧化状态以实现最佳性能。
- 控制在较高浓度的软氧化剂下碳质产物的形成。

3. 未来研究的关键领域：
- 优化促进剂（如N2O和CO2）的浓度以调节氧化物催化剂的氧化状态。
- 理解软氧化剂与催化剂表面相互作用的机制。
- 研究不同氧化剂条件下催化剂的长期稳定性和再生能力。

4. 改进策略：
- 使用氧化剂组合（如N2O和O2）来平衡催化剂的还原和氧化。
- 探索其他软氧化剂及其对不同催化剂系统的影响。
- 开发控制氧化剂在催化剂表面吸附和解离的方法。

该文献并未具体涉及C-H键活化、催化剂再生能力或反应系统改造。需要更全面的研究才能充分解答该问题并比较使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的不同催化剂系统。
