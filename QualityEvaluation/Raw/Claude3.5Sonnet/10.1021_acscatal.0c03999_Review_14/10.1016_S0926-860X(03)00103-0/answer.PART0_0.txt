[1] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[2] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[3] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[6] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

This literature focuses primarily on the use of N2O as a soft oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on nickel molybdate catalysts. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it offers valuable insights into the effects of N2O on catalyst performance.

The study shows that at low concentrations (300 ppm), N2O improves the selectivity to propylene while decreasing propane conversion. This is attributed to N2O inducing a partial reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface, which inhibits O2 adsorption and slows down catalyst reoxidation. The reduced state of the catalytic sites appears to favor selectivity.

However, at higher N2O concentrations (1-10%), the selectivity to propylene decreases, and carbonaceous products form due to deeper reduction of the catalyst. The study also demonstrates that propylene can be produced from propane using pure N2O, but this likely requires the presence of molecular oxygen for sustained production.

The main challenge highlighted in this work is finding the optimal concentration of N2O to balance selectivity and conversion. Too little N2O doesn't significantly improve performance, while too much leads to over-reduction of the catalyst and decreased selectivity.

Key areas for future research suggested by this study include:

1. Exploring the optimal concentrations of soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 to modulate catalyst oxidation states.
2. Investigating the synergistic effects of combining different soft oxidants.
3. Developing strategies to prevent over-reduction of catalysts at higher concentrations of soft oxidants.
4. Studying the long-term stability and regenerability of catalysts under various soft oxidant conditions.
5. Understanding the mechanistic details of how soft oxidants interact with the catalyst surface and influence C-H bond activation.

While this study doesn't directly address corrosiveness or propose major renovations to reaction systems, it suggests that fine-tuning the oxidation state of catalysts through careful use of soft oxidants could be a promising strategy for optimizing ODHP processes.

这篇文献主要关注在镍钼酸盐催化剂上使用N2O作为温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。虽然它没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，但对N2O对催化剂性能的影响提供了有价值的见解。

研究表明，在低浓度（300 ppm）下，N2O提高了丙烯的选择性，同时降低了丙烷的转化率。这归因于N2O诱导催化剂表面的Mo部分还原，抑制了O2的吸附并减缓了催化剂的再氧化速率。催化活性位点的还原状态似乎有利于选择性。

然而，在较高的N2O浓度（1-10%）下，丙烯的选择性降低，由于催化剂的深度还原，形成了碳质产物。研究还表明，可以使用纯N2O从丙烷生产丙烯，但这可能需要分子氧的存在才能持续生产。

这项工作强调的主要挑战是找到N2O的最佳浓度，以平衡选择性和转化率。太少的N2O不会显著改善性能，而太多则会导致催化剂过度还原和选择性降低。

这项研究建议的未来研究关键领域包括：

1. 探索N2O和CO2等温和氧化剂的最佳浓度，以调节催化剂的氧化状态。
2. 研究不同温和氧化剂组合的协同效应。
3. 开发策略，防止在较高浓度的温和氧化剂下催化剂过度还原。
4. 研究在各种温和氧化剂条件下催化剂的长期稳定性和再生能力。
5. 了解温和氧化剂如何与催化剂表面相互作用并影响C-H键活化的机制细节。

虽然这项研究没有直接解决腐蚀性问题或提出对反应系统的重大改造，但它表明，通过谨慎使用温和氧化剂来微调催化剂的氧化状态可能是优化ODHP过程的一种有前途的策略。
