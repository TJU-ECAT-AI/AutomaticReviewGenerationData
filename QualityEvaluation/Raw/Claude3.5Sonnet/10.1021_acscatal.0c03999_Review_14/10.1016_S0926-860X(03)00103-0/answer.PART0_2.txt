[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites thus work in a more reduced state."

[5] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[6] "Propylene is produced from propane in presence of pure N2O. But this probably occurs only under transitory conditions as N2O probably needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

[7] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

The literature provided does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using various catalyst systems or compare their performance. Instead, it focuses on the effects of using N2O as a gas dope in ODHP with nickel molybdate catalysts. However, some insights can be drawn from this study:

1. The use of soft oxidants like N2O can influence catalyst performance in ODHP. At low concentrations (300 ppm), N2O improved propylene yield and selectivity while decreasing propane conversion.

2. N2O acts by reducing Mo at the catalyst surface, inhibiting O2 adsorption and slowing catalyst reoxidation. This allows catalytic sites to work in a more reduced state.

3. Higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%) led to deeper reduction of the catalyst, decreased propylene selectivity, and formation of carbonaceous products.

4. The study suggests that adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O and CO2 could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts during ODHP, thus affecting their catalytic performance.

5. Challenges in ODHP persist, such as balancing conversion and selectivity. The study shows that while low N2O concentrations improved selectivity, higher concentrations led to decreased performance and catalyst deactivation.

Future research in ODHP could focus on:

1. Optimizing the use of soft oxidants like N2O in combination with molecular oxygen to balance catalyst reduction and oxidation.

2. Investigating other promoters or gas dopes that could modulate catalyst oxidation states.

3. Developing catalysts that maintain high selectivity even at higher conversions.

4. Addressing catalyst deactivation issues, particularly the formation of carbonaceous products at higher N2O concentrations.

5. Exploring the potential of transient reaction conditions, as the study suggests propylene production from propane occurs with pure N2O under transitory conditions.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论使用各种催化剂系统进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展或比较它们的性能。相反，它主要关注在使用钼酸镍催化剂进行ODHP时，N2O作为气体掺杂剂的影响。然而，从这项研究中可以得出一些见解：

1. 使用N2O等软氧化剂可以影响ODHP中催化剂的性能。在低浓度(300 ppm)下，N2O提高了丙烯的产率和选择性，同时降低了丙烷的转化率。

2. N2O通过还原催化剂表面的Mo来发挥作用，抑制O2的吸附并减缓催化剂的再氧化速率。这使得催化活性位在更加还原的状态下工作。

3. 更高浓度的N2O（1-10%）导致催化剂更深度还原，丙烯选择性降低，并形成碳质产物。

4. 该研究表明，调整N2O和CO2等促进剂的浓度可能是在ODHP过程中调节氧化物催化剂氧化态的有用工具，从而影响其催化性能。

5. ODHP中的挑战仍然存在，例如平衡转化率和选择性。该研究表明，虽然低浓度N2O提高了选择性，但高浓度导致性能下降和催化剂失活。

ODHP的未来研究可以关注：

1. 优化N2O等软氧化剂与分子氧的组合使用，以平衡催化剂的还原和氧化。

2. 研究其他可以调节催化剂氧化态的促进剂或气体掺杂剂。

3. 开发即使在较高转化率下仍保持高选择性的催化剂。

4. 解决催化剂失活问题，特别是在较高N2O浓度下形成碳质产物的问题。

5. 探索瞬态反应条件的潜力，因为研究表明在瞬态条件下，纯N2O可以从丙烷生成丙烯。
