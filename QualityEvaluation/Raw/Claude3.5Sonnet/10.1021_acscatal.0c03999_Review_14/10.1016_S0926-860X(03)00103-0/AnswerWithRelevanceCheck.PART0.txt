          [1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

          The literature focuses on the use of N2O as a soft oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nickel molybdate catalysts. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it offers insights into the effects of N2O on catalyst performance:

1. At low concentrations (300 ppm), N2O improves propylene yield and selectivity while decreasing propane conversion.
2. N2O induces reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface by inhibiting O2 adsorption, slowing down catalyst reoxidation.
3. Higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%) lead to decreased propylene selectivity, deeper reduction of the catalyst, and formation of carbonaceous products.
4. Adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O and CO2 can modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts during the reaction, affecting catalytic performance.

The study suggests that fine-tuning the oxidation state of catalysts through careful use of soft oxidants could be a promising strategy for optimizing ODHP processes. However, challenges persist in balancing catalyst reduction and oxidation states for optimal performance and preventing excessive catalyst reduction at higher N2O concentrations.

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Optimizing N2O concentrations for different catalyst systems
2. Investigating combinations of promoters to fine-tune catalyst oxidation states
3. Developing strategies to maintain optimal catalyst reduction levels during reaction
4. Exploring the use of other soft oxidants in combination with N2O
5. Improving catalyst regenerability to address deep reduction and carbonaceous product formation

          该文献主要关注在镍钼酸盐催化剂上使用N2O作为温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。虽然它没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，但对N2O对催化剂性能的影响提供了有价值的见解：

1. 在低浓度（300 ppm）下，N2O提高了丙烯的产率和选择性，同时降低了丙烷的转化率。
2. N2O通过抑制O2的吸附来诱导催化剂表面Mo的还原，从而减缓催化剂的再氧化速率。
3. 较高浓度的N2O（1-10%）导致丙烯选择性降低、催化剂更深度还原，并形成碳质产物。
4. 调节N2O和CO2等促进剂的浓度可以调节反应过程中氧化物催化剂的氧化态，从而影响催化性能。

研究表明，通过谨慎使用温和氧化剂来微调催化剂的氧化状态可能是优化ODHP过程的一种有前途的策略。然而，在平衡催化剂的还原和氧化状态以获得最佳性能，以及防止在较高N2O浓度下催化剂过度还原方面仍然存在挑战。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：
1. 为不同的催化剂系统优化N2O浓度
2. 研究促进剂的组合以微调催化剂的氧化态
3. 开发策略以在反应过程中保持最佳的催化剂还原水平
4. 探索与N2O组合使用其他软氧化剂
5. 改善催化剂的再生能力，以解决深度还原和碳质产物形成的问题
