Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results. The use of elemental sulfur (S2) as a soft oxidant in sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) has demonstrated potential for enhancing propylene selectivity while moderating overoxidation. Various metal sulfide catalysts have been explored, with some achieving propylene selectivities as high as 86% at temperatures between 450-550°C.

Comparing catalyst systems, the performance of S-ZrO2 in SODHP has been found to be comparable to well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts used in traditional ODHP in terms of propylene selectivity. This suggests that metal sulfide catalysts can be effective for selective oxidative propylene production.

Persistent challenges in this field include:
1. Overoxidation of the olefin product to CO and CO2, which has limited the achievement of high propylene yields despite years of research.
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion, as there is often a trade-off between these two parameters.

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance propane conversion while maintaining high selectivity.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to ensure long-term stability and performance.
3. Optimizing reaction systems to maximize propylene yields and minimize unwanted side reactions.
4. Developing more active and selective catalysts, as SODHP is still in its early stages and has room for improvement.
5. Further exploring the use of soft oxidants like S2 to moderate the thermodynamic driving force towards overoxidation.

These research directions aim to address the challenges in ODHP and improve the overall efficiency of propylene production using soft oxidants.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展显示了令人鼓舞的结果。使用元素硫(S2)作为硫-ODHP(SODHP)中的软氧化剂已经表现出增强丙烯选择性同时减缓过度氧化的潜力。研究人员探索了各种金属硫化物催化剂，其中一些在450-550°C的温度范围内实现了高达86%的丙烯选择性。

在比较催化剂系统时，发现SODHP中S-ZrO2的性能在丙烯选择性方面与传统ODHP中使用的经过充分研究的过渡金属氧化物催化剂相当。这表明金属硫化物催化剂可以有效地用于选择性氧化生产丙烯。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括：
1. 烯烃产物过度氧化为CO和CO2，这限制了高丙烯产率的实现，尽管已经进行了多年的研究。
2. 平衡选择性和转化率，因为这两个参数之间通常存在权衡。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：
1. 改善C-H键活化，以提高丙烷转化率，同时保持高选择性。
2. 增强催化剂的再生能力，以确保长期稳定性和性能。
3. 优化反应系统，以最大化丙烯产率并最小化不需要的副反应。
4. 开发更活跃和选择性更高的催化剂，因为SODHP仍处于早期阶段，有很大的改进空间。
5. 进一步探索使用S2等软氧化剂，以减缓过度氧化的热力学驱动力。

这些研究方向旨在解决ODHP中的挑战，并提高使用软氧化剂进行丙烯生产的整体效率。
