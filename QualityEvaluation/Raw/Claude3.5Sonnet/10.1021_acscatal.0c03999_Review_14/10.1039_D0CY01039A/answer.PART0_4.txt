[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 (ODHP) is an approach that has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of propylene production. This reaction is thermo-dynamically favorable owing to its exothermicity (Figure 1a), and coking is significantly suppressed under O2."

[2] "Recently elemental sulfur, in the form of S2 vapor, has been implemented as a soft oxidant for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to enhance ethylene selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation."

[3] "Figure 4 compares the conversions and product distributions of the six catalysts. Propane conversion is significantly catalyst-dependent and varies from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550 C. The major reaction products are propylene and CS2. Less than 4% combined C2 and C1 products are detected at the highest temperature of 550C, suggesting that C-C bond activation is a relatively minor pathway."

[4] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."

[5] "Figure 7 shows the conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 to those of ODHP over some well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts in the literature. Although the reaction conditions are not exactly identical, it can be seen that the propylene selectivity over S-ZrO2 is comparable to the selectivities that have been reported for optimized traditional ODHP."

[6] "These results highlight that SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route to selective oxidative propylene production. Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results. The use of elemental sulfur (S2) as a soft oxidant has been explored as an alternative to traditional oxygen-based ODHP. This approach, known as sulfur-ODHP (SODHP), has demonstrated potential for improving propylene selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation.

Various catalyst systems have been investigated for SODHP, including transition metal sulfides and sulfided metal oxides. The performance of these catalysts varies significantly in terms of selectivity and conversion. For instance, sulfided zirconia (S-ZrO2) showed the highest propylene selectivity of 86%, while palladium sulfide (PdS) exhibited the lowest at 38%. Propane conversion ranged from 4.7% to 8.1% at 550°C, depending on the catalyst used.

Comparing SODHP to traditional ODHP with oxygen, the study found that propylene selectivity over S-ZrO2 was comparable to that of optimized transition metal oxide catalysts reported in the literature. This suggests that SODHP using metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route for selective oxidative propylene production.

However, persistent challenges remain in this field. The study did not explicitly mention corrosiveness issues, but the use of sulfur-based systems may introduce concerns related to material compatibility and downstream processing. Additionally, while SODHP shows promise, it is still in its early stages of development, and further optimization is needed to improve overall performance.

Key areas for future research and development in SODHP include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further investigation into the relationship between metal-sulfur bond strength and catalyst activity could lead to more efficient C-H activation catalysts.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts that maintain their activity and selectivity over extended periods of use is crucial for practical applications.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Exploring different reactor designs, operating conditions, and feed compositions to maximize propylene yield and minimize unwanted side reactions.

4. Developing more active and selective catalysts: As SODHP is still in its infancy, there is significant potential for discovering new catalyst formulations that offer improved performance.

5. Understanding and controlling the nature of the sulfur oxidant: Further studies on the behavior of sulfur vapor under reaction conditions could lead to better control over the oxidation process.

By addressing these challenges and focusing on these key areas, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and economically viable SODHP processes for propylene production.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)方面的最新进展显示出了令人鼓舞的结果。研究人员已经探索了使用元素硫(S2)作为软氧化剂，作为传统氧基ODHP的替代方案。这种被称为硫-ODHP(SODHP)的方法，通过调节过度氧化的热力学驱动力，显示出提高丙烯选择性的潜力。

研究人员已经对各种催化剂体系进行了SODHP研究，包括过渡金属硫化物和硫化金属氧化物。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面的性能差异显著。例如，硫化氧化锆(S-ZrO2)显示出最高的丙烯选择性，达到86%，而硫化钯(PdS)的选择性最低，为38%。在550°C时，丙烷转化率根据所使用的催化剂不同，范围在4.7%到8.1%之间。

将SODHP与传统的氧气ODHP进行比较，研究发现S-ZrO2上的丙烯选择性与文献报道的优化过渡金属氧化物催化剂相当。这表明使用金属硫化物催化剂的SODHP可以成为选择性氧化生产丙烯的有效途径。

然而，这一领域仍然存在持续的挑战。虽然研究没有明确提到腐蚀性问题，但使用基于硫的系统可能会引起材料兼容性和下游处理方面的担忧。此外，尽管SODHP显示出前景，但它仍处于发展的早期阶段，需要进一步优化以提高整体性能。

SODHP未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：进一步研究金属-硫键强度与催化剂活性之间的关系，可能会导致更高效的C-H活化催化剂。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：开发能在长期使用过程中保持活性和选择性的催化剂对实际应用至关重要。

3. 优化反应系统：探索不同的反应器设计、操作条件和进料组成，以最大化丙烯产率并最小化不希望的副反应。

4. 开发更活跃和选择性的催化剂：由于SODHP仍处于起步阶段，发现新的催化剂配方以提供更好的性能具有巨大潜力。

5. 理解和控制硫氧化剂的性质：对反应条件下硫蒸气行为的进一步研究可能会导致对氧化过程更好的控制。

通过解决这些挑战并关注这些关键领域，研究人员可以致力于开发更高效和经济可行的SODHP工艺，用于丙烯生产。
