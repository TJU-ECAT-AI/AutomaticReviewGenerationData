[1] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."

[2] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."

[3] "Figure 7 shows the conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 to those of ODHP over some well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts in the literature. Although the reaction conditions are not exactly identical, it can be seen that the propylene selectivity over S-ZrO2 is comparable to the selectivities that have been reported for optimized traditional ODHP."

[4] "These results highlight that SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route to selective oxidative propylene production. Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts."

[5] "The findings reported in this study demonstrate that SODHP is a viable route to selective propylene formation over inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts. Further experimental and theoretical studies of SODHP catalyst development are ongoing."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the development of sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) systems. Various metal sulfide catalysts have been investigated, showing unique reaction product distributions. The performance of these catalysts varies widely in terms of selectivity and conversion.

S-ZrO2 has shown the highest propylene selectivity at 86%, while PdS exhibited the lowest at 38%. The conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 is comparable to that of well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts used in traditional ODHP, despite differences in reaction conditions.

Persistent challenges in this field include optimizing catalyst performance and understanding the reaction mechanisms. The corrosiveness of sulfur-containing compounds and the inherent properties of the SODHP reaction may also present challenges that need to be addressed.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further studies on the relationship between metal-sulfur bond strength and catalyst activity could lead to more efficient C-H activation.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts that can maintain their activity and selectivity over extended periods of operation is crucial for practical applications.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Refining reaction conditions, such as temperature and reactant ratios, could lead to improved propylene yields.

4. Exploring new catalyst materials: Investigating a wider range of metal sulfides and other sulfur-tolerant materials could potentially yield more active and selective catalysts.

5. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Further experimental and theoretical studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of SODHP, which could inform catalyst design.

As SODHP is still in its infancy, there is significant potential for improvement in catalyst performance and overall process efficiency. The development of inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts for selective propylene formation through SODHP represents a promising direction for future research in this field.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在硫-ODHP（SODHP）系统的开发上。研究人员对各种金属硫化物催化剂进行了探索，发现它们产生独特的反应产物分布。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面的性能差异很大。

S-ZrO2显示出最高的丙烯选择性，达到86%，而PdS的选择性最低，为38%。尽管反应条件有所不同，但S-ZrO2在SODHP中的转化率-选择性关系与传统ODHP中使用的知名过渡金属氧化物催化剂相当。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括优化催化剂性能和理解反应机理。含硫化合物的腐蚀性以及SODHP反应的固有特性也可能带来需要解决的问题。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：进一步研究金属-硫键强度与催化剂活性之间的关系，可能会导致更高效的C-H键活化。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：开发能在长期运行中保持活性和选择性的催化剂对实际应用至关重要。

3. 优化反应系统：改进温度和反应物比例等反应条件，可能会提高丙烯产率。

4. 探索新的催化剂材料：研究更广泛的金属硫化物和其他耐硫材料，可能会产生更活跃和选择性更高的催化剂。

5. 理解反应机理：需要进行更多的实验和理论研究来阐明SODHP的详细机理，这可能会为催化剂设计提供指导。

由于SODHP还处于初期阶段，催化剂性能和整体过程效率还有很大的改进潜力。通过SODHP开发用于选择性丙烯生成的廉价和耐硫催化剂，代表了该领域未来研究的一个有前景的方向。
