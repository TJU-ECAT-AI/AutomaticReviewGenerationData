Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results. The use of elemental sulfur (S2) as a soft oxidant has emerged as a novel approach, known as sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). This method has demonstrated potential in enhancing ethylene selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic drive towards over-oxidation, which has been a persistent challenge in traditional ODHP using O2.

Various catalyst systems have been explored for SODHP, including transition metal sulfides and sulfided metal oxides. Among these, S-ZrO2 has shown particularly promising performance, with propylene selectivities as high as 86% at 450-550°C. When compared to well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts used in traditional ODHP, the conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 is comparable, despite the different reaction conditions.

However, persistent challenges remain in the field of ODHP. The primary issue is the overoxidation of the olefin product to CO and CO2, which has made achieving high propylene yields elusive despite years of research. Additionally, while SODHP shows promise, it is still in its infancy and requires further development.

Key areas for future research and development in ODHP include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further studies are needed to understand and optimize the mechanism of C-H activation in SODHP, which appears to be the rate-determining step in the process.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Research should focus on developing catalysts that can maintain their activity and selectivity over extended periods, possibly by improving the sulfidation-desulfidation cycle in SODHP catalysts.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Further exploration of reaction conditions, such as temperature ranges and reactant ratios, could lead to improved propylene yields and selectivities.

4. Developing more active and selective catalysts: As SODHP is a relatively new approach, there is significant potential for discovering and designing catalysts that outperform current options.

5. Understanding the role of sulfur species: More detailed studies on the nature and behavior of sulfur vapor oxidants at different reaction temperatures could provide insights for process optimization.

By addressing these areas, researchers can work towards overcoming the current limitations in ODHP and potentially develop more efficient and selective processes for propylene production.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了令人鼓舞的结果。使用元素硫（S2）作为软氧化剂已成为一种新颖的方法，被称为硫-ODHP（SODHP）。这种方法通过调节过度氧化的热力学驱动力，显示出提高乙烯选择性的潜力，而这一直是传统使用O2进行ODHP的持续挑战。

SODHP已经探索了各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属硫化物和硫化金属氧化物。其中，S-ZrO2显示出特别有前景的性能，在450-550°C下丙烯选择性高达86%。与传统ODHP中使用的经过充分研究的过渡金属氧化物催化剂相比，尽管反应条件不同，但S-ZrO2在SODHP中的转化率-选择性关系是可比的。

然而，ODHP领域仍然存在持续的挑战。主要问题是烯烃产物过度氧化成CO和CO2，这使得尽管经过多年研究，实现高丙烯产率仍然难以实现。此外，虽然SODHP显示出前景，但它仍处于起步阶段，需要进一步发展。

ODHP未来研究和发展的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：需要进一步研究以理解和优化SODHP中C-H活化的机制，这似乎是该过程的速率决定步骤。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：研究应集中于开发能够长期保持其活性和选择性的催化剂，可能通过改善SODHP催化剂中的硫化-脱硫循环。

3. 优化反应系统：进一步探索反应条件，如温度范围和反应物比例，可能导致改善的丙烯产率和选择性。

4. 开发更活跃和选择性的催化剂：由于SODHP是一种相对较新的方法，因此在发现和设计优于当前选择的催化剂方面存在巨大潜力。

5. 理解硫物种的作用：对不同反应温度下硫蒸气氧化剂的性质和行为进行更详细的研究，可能为过程优化提供见解。

通过解决这些领域，研究人员可以努力克服ODHP当前的限制，并可能开发出更高效和选择性的丙烯生产过程。
