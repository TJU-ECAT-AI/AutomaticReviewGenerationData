Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results. The use of elemental sulfur (S2) as a soft oxidant has been explored as an alternative to traditional O2-based ODHP. This approach, known as sulfur-ODHP (SODHP), has demonstrated potential in enhancing selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation.

Various catalyst systems have been investigated for SODHP, with a focus on earth-abundant metal sulfides. These catalysts have shown promising performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. For example, sulfided zirconia (S-ZrO2) has demonstrated propylene selectivity comparable to well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts used in traditional ODHP.

Persistent challenges in this field include:

1. Optimizing catalyst performance: While SODHP shows promise, there is still room for improvement in terms of activity and selectivity.

2. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms of C-H bond activation and product formation in SODHP.

3. Catalyst stability and regeneration: Ensuring long-term stability and developing effective regeneration strategies for sulfide catalysts remain important challenges.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Developing catalysts with enhanced ability to selectively activate propane C-H bonds.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Exploring methods to maintain catalyst activity over extended periods and develop efficient regeneration techniques.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Investigating reactor designs and process conditions to maximize propylene yield and minimize byproduct formation.

4. Exploring new catalyst compositions: Investigating a wider range of metal sulfides and mixed metal sulfides to identify more active and selective catalysts for SODHP.

5. Scaling up and process integration: Addressing challenges related to large-scale implementation of SODHP and integration with existing propylene production processes.

As SODHP is still in its early stages, continued research in these areas is expected to lead to significant improvements in the efficiency and selectivity of propylene production using soft oxidants.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示出了有希望的结果。研究人员已经探索了使用元素硫（S2）作为软氧化剂来替代传统的基于O2的ODHP。这种被称为硫-ODHP（SODHP）的方法通过调节过度氧化的热力学驱动力，展示了提高选择性的潜力。

研究人员已经针对SODHP研究了各种催化剂系统，重点关注丰富的金属硫化物。这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面表现出了良好的性能。例如，硫化锆（S-ZrO2）已经展示出与传统ODHP中使用的知名过渡金属氧化物催化剂相当的丙烯选择性。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括：

1. 优化催化剂性能：虽然SODHP显示出前景，但在活性和选择性方面仍有改进空间。

2. 理解反应机理：需要进一步研究以阐明SODHP中C-H键活化和产物形成的确切机理。

3. 催化剂稳定性和再生：确保硫化物催化剂的长期稳定性并开发有效的再生策略仍然是重要的挑战。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：
