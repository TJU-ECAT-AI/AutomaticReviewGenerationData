[1] "Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising route for the large-scale production of alkenes."

[2] "Over mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below 40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally observed at higher conversions [35]."

[3] "Li-promoted magnesia is a potential catalysts for ODH and cracking of lower alkanes and light petroleum gases (LPG), due to its high selectivity towards olefin formation [6, 1013]."

[4] "Supported alkali metal chloride catalysts have high activity and selectivity to olefins compared to conventional catalysts."

[5] "The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."

[6] "Catalysts having molten alkali metal chloride phases under reaction conditions show much higher olefin selectivities than solid chloride containing catalysts."

[7] "Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above. The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, rather than soft oxidants. However, it provides some insights into the performance of different catalyst systems:

1. Traditional mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (e.g., vanadium) show low alkene yields (below 40%) and extensive formation of CO and CO2 at higher conversions.

2. Li-promoted magnesia catalysts demonstrate high selectivity towards olefin formation.

3. Supported alkali metal chloride catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity to olefins compared to conventional catalysts.

4. Molten alkali metal chloride catalysts achieve maximum selectivity to propene (70%) in ODHP above the melting temperature of the chloride phase.

5. Catalysts with molten alkali metal chloride phases show much higher olefin selectivities than solid chloride-containing catalysts.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. However, it highlights three key factors contributing to the excellent selectivity of supported alkali metal chloride catalysts:

1. Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites
2. High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with olefins
3. Spatial isolation of hypochlorite oxidation sites in the dynamic melt

These insights suggest that future research and development in ODHP could focus on:

1. Optimizing catalyst compositions to achieve an ideal balance of Lewis acidity and mobility of active species
2. Exploring novel supported melt systems to enhance C-H bond activation and selectivity
3. Investigating ways to maintain catalyst stability and regenerability in molten states
4. Developing reaction systems that can effectively utilize the unique properties of supported molten salt catalysts

While the study doesn't directly address soft oxidants or other specific challenges, it demonstrates the potential for innovative catalyst designs to significantly improve ODHP performance.

这篇文献讨论了使用负载型碱金属氯化物催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，而不是软氧化剂。但是，它提供了一些关于不同催化剂系统性能的见解：

1. 传统的含有氧化还原活性过渡金属阳离子(如钒)的混合氧化物表现出较低的烯烃产率(低于40%)，并在高转化率下产生大量的CO和CO2。

2. 锂促进的氧化镁催化剂表现出对烯烃形成的高选择性。

3. 负载型碱金属氯化物催化剂与传统催化剂相比，表现出较高的活性和对烯烃的选择性。

4. 熔融碱金属氯化物催化剂在氯化物相的熔点以上达到最高的丙烯选择性(70%)。

5. 具有熔融碱金属氯化物相的催化剂比固态氯化物催化剂表现出更高的烯烃选择性。

这项研究没有直接提到持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。然而，它强调了三个对负载型碱金属氯化物催化剂具有优异选择性的关键因素：

1. 可接触的路易斯酸位点浓度低
2. 熔体中阳离子和阴离子的高度流动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用
3. 动态熔体中次氯酸盐氧化位点的空间隔离

这些见解表明，ODHP的未来研究和开发可以集中在：

1. 优化催化剂组成，以实现路易斯酸性和活性物种流动性的理想平衡
2. 探索新型负载熔体系统，以增强C-H键活化和选择性
3. 研究在熔融状态下维持催化剂稳定性和再生能力的方法
4. 开发能有效利用负载型熔盐催化剂独特性质的反应系统

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及软氧化剂或其他具体挑战，但它展示了创新催化剂设计显著改善ODHP性能的潜力。
