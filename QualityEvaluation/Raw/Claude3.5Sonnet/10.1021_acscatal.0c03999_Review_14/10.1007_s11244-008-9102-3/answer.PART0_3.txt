[1] "ODH of ethane and propane were explored for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, such as ethane and propane. The catalysts have high activity and selectivity to olefins compared to conventional catalysts."

[2] "The highest activity was observed for Li-MD (6.1 lmol (g s)-1 at 873 K). Addition of higher alkali metal ions to the catalyst led to decreased catalytic activity (4.2 and 2.6 lmol (g s)-1 for Li-Na-MD and Li-K-MD, respectively)."

[3] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [ Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."

[4] "Catalysts having molten alkali metal chloride phases under reaction conditions show much higher olefin selectivities than solid chloride containing catalysts."

[5] "Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above. The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

This document does not specifically discuss recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Instead, it focuses on supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts for ODH of ethane and propane.

The study shows that these supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts demonstrate high activity and selectivity for olefin production compared to conventional catalysts. The Li-MD catalyst showed the highest activity, while catalysts with higher alkali metal ions (Na, K) showed decreased activity but improved selectivity.

The order of catalysts for olefin selectivity was found to be Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane was achieved above the melting temperature of the alkali metal chloride phase.

The study attributes the excellent olefin selectivity to three main factors:
1. Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts
2. High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with olefins
3. Spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt

The document does not discuss persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties, nor does it elaborate on key areas for future research like improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

这篇文档并没有特别讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，也没有比较包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统。相反，它主要关注支持的熔融碱金属氯化物催化剂用于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。

研究表明，与传统催化剂相比，这些支持的熔融碱金属氯化物催化剂在烯烃生产方面表现出高活性和高选择性。Li-MD催化剂显示出最高的活性，而含有更高碱金属离子（Na，K）的催化剂虽然活性降低，但选择性有所提高。

催化剂对烯烃选择性的顺序为Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。在乙烷ODH中，乙烯的最大选择性达到94%，而在丙烷ODH中，丙烯的最大选择性达到70%，这些最大选择性都是在碱金属氯化物相的熔点以上温度获得的。

研究将优异的烯烃选择性归因于三个主要因素：
1. 支持的催化剂中可接近的Lewis酸位点浓度低
2. 熔体中阳离子和阴离子的高度移动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用
3. 次氯酸盐氧化位点在动态熔体中和表面上的空间隔离

该文档没有讨论诸如腐蚀性或固有反应特性等持续存在的挑战，也没有详细阐述未来研究的关键领域，如改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。
