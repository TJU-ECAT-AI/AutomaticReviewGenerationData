[1] "Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising route for the large-scale production of alkenes."

[2] "Over mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below 40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally observed at higher conversions [35]."

[3] "In contrast, halogen promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 show high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes [611]."

[4] "Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

[5] "Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."

[6] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."

[7] "Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above. The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

The literature focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes, particularly ethane and propane, using supported alkali metal chloride catalysts. While it does not directly address recent advances in ODHP using soft oxidants, it does provide insights into catalyst performance and challenges in the field:

1. Catalyst performance: The paper reports high selectivity and yields for olefins using supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, particularly those forming molten phases under reaction conditions. The best-performing catalyst (Li-K-MD) achieved 94% selectivity for ethene in ODH of ethane and 70% selectivity for propene in ODH of propane. This performance surpasses that of traditional mixed oxide catalysts with redox-active transition metal cations.

2. Challenges: The literature mentions catalyst stability as an issue for some supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, though the specific catalysts studied showed improved stability. Corrosiveness is not explicitly discussed, but the use of chloride-based catalysts may pose corrosion concerns.

3. Key areas for future research:
   a. C-H bond activation: The paper suggests that OCl- species are responsible for C-H bond activation. Further research could focus on optimizing the formation and stability of these active sites.
   b. Catalyst regenerability: While not directly addressed, the dynamic nature of the molten chloride catalysts may contribute to improved regenerability and longer catalyst lifetimes.
   c. Reaction system optimization: The study emphasizes the importance of the molten state of the catalyst and the spatial isolation of active sites. Future research could focus on further optimizing these aspects to improve ODHP processes.

4. Strategies for improvement: The paper highlights three factors contributing to high olefin selectivity: low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites, high mobility of ions in the melt, and spatial isolation of active sites. These insights could guide the development of new catalyst systems for ODHP.

While the literature does not specifically address soft oxidants, the principles and strategies discussed could potentially be applied to develop improved ODHP catalysts using various oxidants.

该文献主要关注使用负载型碱金属氯化物催化剂进行低级烷烃（特别是乙烷和丙烷）的氧化脱氢（ODH）。虽然它没有直接讨论使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的最新进展，但它确实提供了关于催化剂性能和该领域挑战的见解：

1. 催化剂性能：该文报道了使用负载型碱金属氯化物催化剂获得了高选择性和高烯烃产率，特别是那些在反应条件下形成熔融相的催化剂。性能最佳的催化剂（Li-K-MD）在乙烷ODH中实现了94%的乙烯选择性，在丙烷ODH中实现了70%的丙烯选择性。这一性能超过了传统的具有氧化还原活性过渡金属阳离子的混合氧化物催化剂。

2. 挑战：文献提到一些负载型碱金属氯化物催化剂存在稳定性问题，尽管所研究的特定催化剂显示出改善的稳定性。腐蚀性问题没有明确讨论，但使用氯化物基催化剂可能会引起腐蚀问题。

3. 未来研究的关键领域：
   a. C-H键活化：该文章暗示OCl-物种负责C-H键活化。进一步的研究可以集中在优化这些活性位点的形成和稳定性上。
   b. 催化剂再生能力：虽然没有直接讨论，但熔融氯化物催化剂的动态特性可能有助于提高再生能力和延长催化剂寿命。
   c. 反应系统优化：该研究强调了催化剂熔融状态和活性位点空间隔离的重要性。未来的研究可以集中在进一步优化这些方面以改进ODHP过程。

4. 改进策略：该文强调了三个因素对高烯烃选择性的贡献：可接近的Lewis酸位点浓度低，熔体中离子的高移动性，以及活性位点的空间隔离。这些见解可以指导开发新的ODHP催化剂系统。

虽然该文献没有特别提到软氧化剂，但所讨论的原理和策略可能有助于开发使用各种氧化剂的改进型ODHP催化剂。
