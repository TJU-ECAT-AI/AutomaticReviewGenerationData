[1] "Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising route for the large-scale production of alkenes."

[2] "Over mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below 40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally observed at higher conversions [35]."

[3] "In contrast, halogen promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 show high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes [611]."

[4] "Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

[5] "Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products. This makes these materials excellent catalysts for ODH of ethane and propane as shown here."

[6] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using various catalyst systems. While it does not specifically focus on soft oxidants, it provides insights into the performance of different catalysts:

1. Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts: Mixed oxides with redox-active transition metal cations (e.g., vanadium) show low alkene yields (below 40%) and produce significant amounts of CO and CO2 at higher conversions.

2. Main group element metal oxides: Halogen-promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 demonstrate high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes.

3. Supported alkali metal chlorides: These catalysts, especially when in a molten state, show excellent performance in ODH of ethane and propane. The order of selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD, with maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane.

The main challenges in this field include:

1. Catalyst stability: Some catalysts, such as alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2, show excellent performance but lack stability.

2. Corrosiveness: Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of chloride-based catalysts may lead to corrosion issues.

3. Inherent reaction properties: The formation of CO and CO2 at higher conversions remains a challenge for some catalyst systems.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Developing catalysts that can efficiently activate C-H bonds while maintaining high selectivity to desired products.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Focusing on catalyst systems that can maintain stability and performance over extended periods.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Exploring supported molten salt catalysts, which provide a dynamic surface that minimizes interactions with highly reactive products, potentially leading to improved selectivity and yield.

4. Investigating the role of catalyst composition: Further studies on the impact of different alkali metal combinations and support materials on catalyst performance.

5. Understanding the mechanisms of selective oxidation: Deepening the insight into the role of spatially isolated active sites and their impact on product selectivity.

该文献讨论了使用各种催化剂系统进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展。虽然它并未特别关注软氧化剂，但提供了不同催化剂性能的见解：

1. 过渡金属/金属氧化物催化剂：具有氧化还原活性过渡金属阳离子（如钒）的混合氧化物显示出较低的烯烃产率（低于40%），并在较高转化率下产生大量CO和CO2。

2. 主族元素金属氧化物：在MgO、SiO2和ZrO2上负载的卤素促进的碱金属和稀土混合氧化物在低级烷烃的氧化转化过程中表现出较高的烯烃产率。

3. 负载型碱金属氯化物：这些催化剂，特别是在熔融状态下，在乙烷和丙烷的ODH中表现出优异的性能。对烯烃的选择性顺序为Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD，乙烷ODH中乙烯的最高选择性为94%，丙烷ODH中丙烯的最高选择性为70%。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 催化剂稳定性：一些催化剂，如负载在SiO2或ZrO2上的碱金属氯化物，虽然性能优异但缺乏稳定性。

2. 腐蚀性：虽然未明确提及，但使用氯化物基催化剂可能会导致腐蚀问题。

3. 固有反应特性：对于某些催化剂系统，在较高转化率下CO和CO2的形成仍然是一个挑战。
