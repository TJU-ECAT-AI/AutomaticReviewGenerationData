          "Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising route for the large-scale production of alkenes."

"Over mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below 40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally observed at higher conversions [35]."

"In contrast, halogen promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 show high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes [611]."

"Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

"Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."

"The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."

          The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using various catalyst systems:

1. Traditional mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (e.g., vanadium) show low alkene yields (below 40%) and extensive formation of CO and CO2 at higher conversions.

2. Halogen-promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 demonstrate high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes.

3. Supported alkali metal chlorides, especially in molten form, show excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane and propane. The order of selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD.

4. Supported alkali metal chloride melts provide a dynamic surface that minimizes interactions with highly reactive products, leading to high selectivity.

5. Maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is achieved above the melting temperature of the alkali metal chloride phase.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on soft oxidants, it highlights the potential of supported molten salt catalysts for improving ODHP performance.

          该文献讨论了使用各种催化剂系统进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展：

1. 传统的含有氧化还原活性过渡金属阳离子（如钒）的混合氧化物表现出较低的烯烃产率（低于40%），并在高转化率下产生大量的CO和CO2。

2. 在MgO、SiO2和ZrO2上负载的卤素促进的碱金属和稀土混合氧化物在低级烷烃的氧化转化过程中表现出较高的烯烃产率。

3. 负载型碱金属氯化物，特别是在熔融状态下，在乙烷和丙烷的ODH中表现出优异的催化性能。对烯烃的选择性顺序为Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。

4. 负载型碱金属氯化物熔体提供了一个动态表面，最大限度地减少了与高反应性产物的相互作用，从而导致高选择性。

5. 在乙烷ODH中，乙烯的最大选择性达到94%，而在丙烷ODH中，丙烯的最大选择性达到70%，这些最大选择性都是在碱金属氯化物相的熔点以上温度获得的。

虽然该研究并未特别关注软氧化剂，但它突出了负载型熔融盐催化剂在提高ODHP性能方面的潜力。

          "Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

"Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above. The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

          The literature mentions some persistent challenges in the field of ODHP:

1. Catalyst stability: Some catalysts, such as alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2, show excellent performance but lack stability.

2. Corrosiveness: Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of chloride-based catalysts may lead to corrosion issues.

3. Inherent reaction properties: The formation of CO and CO2 at higher conversions remains a challenge for some catalyst systems.

The study also identifies key factors contributing to excellent olefin selectivity, which could guide future research:

1. Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in supported catalysts
2. High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with olefins
3. Spatial isolation of hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt

These insights suggest potential areas for future research and development, such as improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems to address the identified challenges and capitalize on the factors contributing to high selectivity.

          该文献提到了ODHP领域中一些持续存在的挑战：

1. 催化剂稳定性：一些催化剂，如负载在SiO2或ZrO2上的碱金属氯化物，虽然性能优异但缺乏稳定性。

2. 腐蚀性：虽然未明确提及，但使用氯化物基催化剂可能会导致腐蚀问题。

3. 固有反应特性：对于某些催化剂系统，在较高转化率下CO和CO2的形成仍然是一个挑战。

研究还确定了导致优异烯烃选择性的关键因素，这些因素可以指导未来的研究：

1. 负载型催化剂中可接近的Lewis酸位点浓度低
2. 熔体中阳离子和阴离子的高度移动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用
3. 动态熔体中和表面次氯酸盐氧化位点的空间隔离

这些见解提示了未来研究和开发的潜在领域，如改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统，以解决已识别的挑战并利用有助于高选择性的因素。
