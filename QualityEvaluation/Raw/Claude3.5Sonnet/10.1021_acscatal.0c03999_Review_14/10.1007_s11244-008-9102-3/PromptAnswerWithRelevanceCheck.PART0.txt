[1] "Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising route for the large-scale production of alkenes."

[2] "Over mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below 40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally observed at higher conversions [35]."

[3] "In contrast, halogen promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 show high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes [611]."

[4] "Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

[5] "Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."

[6] "The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."

[7] "Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above. The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

The literature focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lower alkanes, particularly ethane and propane, using supported alkali metal chloride catalysts. While it does not directly address recent advances in ODHP using soft oxidants, it does provide insights into catalyst performance and challenges in the field:

1. Catalyst performance: The paper reports high selectivity and yields for olefins using supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, particularly those forming molten phases under reaction conditions. The best-performing catalyst (Li-K-MD) achieved 94% selectivity for ethene in ODH of ethane and 70% selectivity for propene in ODH of propane. This performance surpasses that of traditional mixed oxide catalysts with redox-active transition metal cations.

2. Challenges: The literature mentions catalyst stability as an issue for some supported alkali metal chloride catalysts, though the specific catalysts studied showed improved stability. Corrosiveness is not explicitly discussed, but the use of chloride-based catalysts may pose corrosion concerns.

3. Key areas for future research:
   a. C-H bond activation: The paper suggests that OCl- species are responsible for C-H bond activation. Further research could focus on optimizing the formation and stability of these active sites.
   b. Catalyst regenerability: While not directly addressed, the dynamic nature of the molten chloride catalysts may contribute to improved regenerability and longer catalyst lifetimes.
   c. Reaction system optimization: The study emphasizes the importance of the molten state of the catalyst and the spatial isolation of active sites. Future research could focus on further optimizing these aspects to improve ODHP processes.

4. Strategies for improvement: The paper highlights three factors contributing to high olefin selectivity: low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites, high mobility of ions in the melt, and spatial isolation of active sites. These insights could guide the development of new catalyst systems for ODHP.

While the literature does not specifically address soft oxidants, the principles and strategies discussed could potentially be applied to develop improved ODHP catalysts using various oxidants.

The literature does not specifically discuss recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. However, it does provide some insights into the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, including propane, using various catalyst systems.

The document mentions that mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations, such as vanadium, show alkene yields below 40% in ODH, with significant formation of CO and CO2 at higher conversions. In contrast, halogen-promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 demonstrate high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes.

A notable advancement is the use of supported alkali metal chloride melts as catalysts. These catalysts minimize the surface concentration of accessible metal cations, providing a dynamic surface that reduces interactions with highly reactive products. This results in excellent selectivity to olefins.

The literature does not explicitly discuss the persistent challenges in ODHP or specific strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems. However, it does highlight the importance of catalyst design in achieving high selectivity and yield.

Key factors contributing to the excellent selectivity of supported alkali metal chloride melts include:
1. Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites
2. High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with olefins
3. Spatial isolation of hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt

While the document does not directly address future research directions for ODHP, it suggests that the approach of using supported chloride melts could be applied to develop highly specific catalysts for other reactions, potentially opening new avenues for catalyst design and optimization.

文献提到，含有氧化还原活性过渡金属阳离子(如钒)的混合氧化物在ODH中的烯烃产率低于40%，在高转化率下会形成大量的CO和CO2。相比之下，在MgO、SiO2和ZrO2上负载的卤素促进的碱金属和稀土混合氧化物在低级烷烃的氧化转化过程中表现出较高的烯烃产率。

[2] "The highest activity was observed for Li-MD (6.1 lmol (g s)-1 at 873 K). Addition of higher alkali metal ions to the catalyst led to decreased catalytic activity (4.2 and 2.6 lmol (g s)-1 for Li-Na-MD and Li-K-MD, respectively)."

This document does not specifically discuss recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Instead, it focuses on supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts for ODH of ethane and propane.

The study shows that these supported molten alkali metal chloride catalysts demonstrate high activity and selectivity for olefin production compared to conventional catalysts. The Li-MD catalyst showed the highest activity, while catalysts with higher alkali metal ions (Na, K) showed decreased activity but improved selectivity.

The order of catalysts for olefin selectivity was found to be Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. Maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane was achieved above the melting temperature of the alkali metal chloride phase.

The study attributes the excellent olefin selectivity to three main factors:
1. Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts
2. High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with olefins
3. Spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt

The document does not discuss persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties, nor does it elaborate on key areas for future research like improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

这篇文档并没有特别讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，也没有比较包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统。相反，它主要关注支持的熔融碱金属氯化物催化剂用于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。

研究表明，与传统催化剂相比，这些支持的熔融碱金属氯化物催化剂在烯烃生产方面表现出高活性和高选择性。Li-MD催化剂显示出最高的活性，而含有更高碱金属离子（Na，K）的催化剂虽然活性降低，但选择性有所提高。

催化剂对烯烃选择性的顺序为Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD。在乙烷ODH中，乙烯的最大选择性达到94%，而在丙烷ODH中，丙烯的最大选择性达到70%，这些最大选择性都是在碱金属氯化物相的熔点以上温度获得的。

研究将优异的烯烃选择性归因于三个主要因素：
1. 支持的催化剂中可接近的Lewis酸位点浓度低
2. 熔体中阳离子和阴离子的高度移动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用
