Abstract
Potential and limitations of molten alkali metal
(Li, Na, and K) chlorides supported on Dy2O3/MgO were
explored for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower
alkanes, such as ethane and propane. The catalysts have
high activity and selectivity to olefins compared to con-
ventional catalysts. Optimum performance is obtained with
catalysts on which the alkali metal chloride phase is molten
under reaction conditions. Lower chloride melting point
correlates with higher selectivity. The high selectivity to
ethene or propene is attributed to the high mobility of
cations and anions, which facilitates desorption of alkene
(limiting further oxidation) and the generation of spatially
isolated hypochloride anions acting as the active sites for
the primary CH bond activation.

1 Introduction
Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are
important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their
demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative
dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising
route for the large-scale production of alkenes. However,
currently known catalysts do not provide sufficiently high
activity and selectivity for industrial applications. Over
mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations
(such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below
40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally
observed at higher conversions [35]. In contrast, halogen
promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on
MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 show high yields of olefins during
oxidative conversion of lower alkanes [611]. In particular,
Li-promoted magnesia is a potential catalysts for ODH and
cracking of lower alkanes and light petroleum gases (LPG),
due to its high selectivity towards olefin formation [6, 10
13]. Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlo-
rides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent
catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst
stability was not satisfactory [14, 15].
In recent studies, we have observed that molten LiCl
supported on Dy2O3/MgO is an exceptional catalyst in ODH
of ethane [12, 13] and propane [6] with respect to the
achievable olefin yields. Noteworthy, this catalyst also
provides a higher stability compared to similar catalysts [14,
15]. As the liquid phase has been identified to be crucial for
the catalyst properties [13], we explore here the significance
of single and mixtures of alkali metals on Dy2O3/MgO in
order to have a greater flexibility for the catalytic applica-
tions. We further wish to deepen the insight into this new
approach to generate uniform, mobile, and self-healing
surfaces for complex reactions that require high site speci-
ficity. In particular, we will address the role of the physical
state and the chemical composition with respect to activity
and selectivity for ODH of ethane and propane.

1.6 mmol) in de-ionized water. Alkali metal nitrate(s), i.e.,
for M/Dy/Mg/O/Cl, LiNO3 (2.76 g, 0.04 mol), NaNO3
(3.40 g, 0.04 mol) or KNO3 (4.05 g, 0.04 mol), for Li/Na/
Dy/Mg/O/Cl, LiNO3 (2.00 g, 0.029 mol) and NaNO3
(0.94 g, 0.011 mol), and for Li/K/Dy/Mg/O/Cl, LiNO3
(1.66 g, 0.024 mol) and KNO3 (1.62 g, 0.016 mol), as well
as HCl (37 %, 1.6 mL) and NH4Cl (1.04 g, 0.019 mol)
were added to the mixture. The atomic ratios of Li/
Na = 2.6 (Li/Na/Dy/Mg/O/Cl) and Li/K = 1.5 (Li/K/Dy/
Mg/O/Cl) were chosen to obtain eutectic compositions of
the alkali metal chloride [16]. The suspensions were stirred
for 2 h at 353 K. Then, water was removed under reduced
pressure at 353 K and the residues were dried for 12 h at
353 K. Subsequently, the precursors were calcined for 12 h
at 973 K in a flow of synthetic air (100 NmL/min). The
powder was pressed, crushed, and sieved to 160224 lm
particle size.
The concentration of Mg, Dy, Li, Na, and K was ana-
lyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) using a
UNICAM 939 spectrometer. The chloride concentration
was analyzed by ion chromatography (IC) on a Metrohm
690 Ion Chromatograph. The specific surface area was
determined by N2 adsorption at 77 K (BET method) on a
PMI Automated BET Sorptometer. XRD phase analysis
was performed on a Philips XPert instrument in Bragg-
Brentano geometry in the range 2h = 1080 in steps of
0.02/s. In-situ high temperature XRD diffractograms were
obtained in an environmental chamber (HTK Paar 1200) in
synthetic air. TG-DSC measurements were performed
using a modified Setaram TG-DSC 111 thermo analyzer.
The concentration of desorbing CO2 and water was fol-
lowed using a Balzers QMG 420 mass spectrometer.
Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 was
performed in a custom-built UHV setup connected to a
quadrupole mass spectrometer. The catalysts were activated
for 1 h at 873 K prior to NH3 adsorption (adsorption at
323 K and 10 mbar). After outgassing for 3 h at 10-3 mbar,
the concentration of desorbing molecules was followed
during heating to 873 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min.
Raman measurements were performed on Renishaw
Raman microscope (Type 1000) equipped with a CCD-
detector (400 9 578 pixels) using a 785 nm diode laser
excitation. The power level of the laser was about
300 mW. The wave number accuracy was within 1 cm-1.
For measurements, each catalyst was pressed into a self-
supporting wafer and placed in a sample holder consisting
of a gold plate attached to a heating wire. The sample
holder was mounted in the center of a Raman cell, which is
closed with a quartz glass window. The Raman cell was
connected with a multi-port switch valve, which allowed
changing the feed (N2/O2). The temperature was monitored
by a thermocouple placed next to the catalyst sample and
controlled with a Eurotherm temperature controller. Prior
to recording Raman spectra, the samples were treated in N2
flow (50 mL/min) at 673 K for 1 h and in-situ Raman
spectra recorded at various temperatures (298773 K) in
N2O2 (1:1) gas mixture (total flow 50 mL/min).
Kinetic measurements for ODH of ethane and propane
were performed in a tubular fixed bed quartz reactor (inner
diameter = 6 mm) working at atmospheric pressure. The
catalysts were mixed with an equal amount of inert mate-
rial (SiC) to achieve isothermal operation. For ODH of
ethane, the partial pressure of ethane (99.5%) and oxygen
(10.1% in He) was 70 mbar each with balance He
(99.99%). If not stated otherwise, the weight hourly space
velocity was 0.8 h-1. For the experiments shown in Fig. 7,
the WHSV was adjusted such that all catalysts showed
similar conversion of ethane at each temperature (*2% at
773 K, *5% at 823 K, *9% at 838 K, *13% at 853 K,
*19% at 868 K, *26% at 883 K, *39% at 903 K, and
*56% at 923 K). For ODH of propane, the partial pressure
of propane (99.5%) and oxygen was *77 mbar each and
the WHSV was 1.8 h-1. In order to obtain different pro-
pane conversions at constant reaction temperature, the
partial pressures were varied from 50 to 90 mbar (WHSV
0.63.6 h-1). Quantifiable reaction products were C3H6,
C2H4, CO,
CO2, and H2O. At
higher
temperatures
(
[
823 K), other products such as methane, ethane, and
n-butane were also observed during ODH of propane in
low concentrations.
The composition of the products was analyzed with a
Hewlett Packard 6890 Series gas chromatograph equipped
with FID and TCD detector. A Pora Plot Q and a Molsieve
column were used for product separation. The mass bal-
ance based on the difference between the amount of carbon
at the reactor inlet and outlet was closed with 2% accuracy
in ODH of ethane and 5% in ODH of propane.
Prior to each run, the samples were activated in helium
flow at 873 K for 1 h and employed for at least 2 h at
853 K to obtain stable alkane and oxygen conversions.
ODH measurements were performed at temperatures of
723923 K for ethane and 773898 K for propane. Under
these operating conditions, no measurable conversion of
alkane (
\
0.8%) was observed in an either empty or SiC
filled reactor. Time on stream studies for Li-MD showed
stable performance for at least 40 h at 823 K in ODH of
ethane and propane.

3.1 Chemical Composition and Determination
of Catalyst Phases
Catalysts M/Dy/Mg/O/Cl (M = Li, Na or K; denoted as
M-MD) containing a single alkali metal and materials

K/Li/Dy/Mg/O/Cl
(K-Li-MD)
and
Na/Li/Dy/Mg/O/Cl
(Na-Li-MD) with an eutectic mixture of the alkali metal
chlorides were prepared by co-precipitation of the corre-
sponding salts from aqueous solutions and subsequent
calcination. The elemental composition, the BET surface
area, and the acid site concentration of the catalysts are
compiled in Table 1. The overall concentration of alkali
metal cations and Cl- ions was similar for all catalysts.
However, the substitution of Li+ by Na+ and K+ resulted
in a notable decrease in the specific surface area of up to
80%. The lowest surface area (1.9 m2/g) was found for
K-Li-MD, which compares with 10.3 m2/g for Li-MD.
This is attributed to the low melting point of the LiCl/KCl
eutectic mixture and the filling of voids between small
particles. During calcination, the pores of the sample are
assumed to become blocked by the LiCl/KCl melt causing
reduced specific surface area.
XRD analysis showed that MgO and Dy2O3 prevailed as
crystalline phase in all catalysts. The characteristic signals
for the alkali metal chlorides, except of LiCl, were also
detected at room temperature. LiCl is highly hygroscopic
and, most likely, was hydrated at ambient conditions. It has
to be noted that crystalline mixed chloride phases of Li/Na
and Li/K were also not observed in the solid-state. The
XRD phases and melting temperature of alkali chlorides
are presented in Table 2. To explore phase transformations,
which take place between room temperature and reaction
conditions, XRD spectra of pre-activated catalysts were
recorded in-situ between 373 and 923 K. The XRD pattern
of Li-K-MD shown in Fig. 1 is representative for all Li
containing catalysts of this study. MgO and Dy2O3 were
present over the entire temperature range. While KCl was
observed as crystalline phase at room temperature, the
signals for LiCl appeared upon heating to 373 K. With
increasing temperature, the XRD reflexes of the alkali
metal chlorides were shifted to higher d-values and van-
ished at temperatures between 623 and 848 K. This
suggests that the alkali metal chlorides have melted, pos-
sibly accompanied by spreading of the chloride phase over
the surface of the support. The same observation was found
for the other Li containing catalysts, while for Na-MD and
K-MD changes in the XRD patterns were not observed
upon heating (Fig. 2), indicating that all phases on these
catalysts remain solid.
In
TG-DSC
analysis,
an
endothermic
signal
was
observed for all catalysts at approximately 373 K. It is due
to the release of water. Two other types of endothermic
signals were seen between 523 and 923 K (Fig. 3). One of
the signals was accompanied by a decrease in catalyst mass
(signal at 819, 762, 618, and 807 K for K-MD, Na-MD,
Li-MD, and Li-K-MD, respectively). It is caused by the
release of carbon dioxide and/or water chemisorbed on the
materials, when stored under ambient conditions. The
second type of signals was only observed for catalysts
containing lithium and was not associated with a change in
the catalyst mass (signal at 877, 617, and 835 K for Li-MD,
Li-K-MD, and Li-Na-MD, respectively). As it coincides
with the disappearance of the XRD peaks, we conclude that
it results from melting of the alkali metal chloride phase.
The temperature of the phase transformation agrees with
the melting temperature of the bulk chlorides and eutectic
compositions as outlined in Table 2 [16, 17].
3.2 Concentration of Acid Sites
TPD profiles of alkali metal chloride containing Dy/Mg/O
catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate that
the concentration of acid sites decreased in the sequence
Li-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Na-MD [ Li-K-MD & K-MD
(Table 1). As the desorption maximum was shifted to
lower temperatures, while its intensity decreased, we con-
clude that the concentration and strength of acid sites
decreased in the same order. It is important to note that the
strength of acid sites is related to the Lewis acidity of the
alkali metal cations (Li+ [ Na+ [ K+). The bi-metallic
catalysts Li-Na-MD and Li-K-MD showed an acid strength
in between that of Li-MD and Na-MD, and Li-MD and
K-MD, respectively, indicating that the acid properties are
determined by the chemical composition of the bulk
material. Note that TPD measurements were performed
below the melting temperature of the alkali metal chloride
phase.

3.3 Raman Spectra of Supported Chloride Catalysts
In order to characterize the supported chlorides under
reaction conditions, the catalysts were studied by in-situ
Raman
spectroscopy.
The
spectrum
of
pure
Dy2O3
(Fig. 5a) showed a sharp band at 373 cm-1 and three minor
bands at 331, 467, 587 cm-1, attributed all to Dy-O
vibrations [18]. The Raman spectrum of KLi-MD recorded
at RT after heat treatment in N2 exhibits three prominent
bands at 382, 471, and 524 cm-1. The band due to Dy-O
vibrations were slightly shifted to higher wavenumbers
(372382 cm-1 and 467471). The band at 524 cm-1 is
attributed to the lattice vibration of Li2O being in good
agreement with the reports by Osaka et al. [19] and Ishil
et al. [20]. This suggests that Li2O is formed in minor
amounts during the calcination process by oxidation of
LiCl. It is unclear at present if this Li2O is accessible to
adsorbing molecules under reaction conditions. The band at

approximately 1060 cm-1 is attributed to carbonates [21].
The two peaks in the range 850950 cm-1 are speculated
to be associated with hydroxyl groups and/or adsorbed
water.
The in situ Raman spectra of Li-K-MD recorded in a O2/
N2 mixture are shown in Fig. 5b. With increasing tem-
perature, the Raman bands are broadened and slightly
shifted to lower wavenumbers. The apparent decrease in
intensity of the band with increasing temperature is
attributed to fluorescence, which leads to a gradually
dominating background intensity. While bands due to
OCl- or Cl2 were not observed even at higher tempera-
tures, their formation in low concentrations cannot be
excluded (see e.g., ref. [22]). The results suggest that oxi-
dizing species exist only in very low concentrations or as
transient species. The bands at 383, 472, and 524 cm-1
were identical with all alkali metal chlorides and similar
results were obtained when the samples were heated to
higher
temperatures
demonstrating
that
the
observed
changes with respect to the Raman spectra of Dy2O3 are
due to the chloride overlayer.
3.4 Catalytic Properties of Supported Chloride
Catalysts
3.4.1 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane
The temperature dependence of the rates and yields in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane are displayed in
Fig. 6.
The
highest
activity
was
found
for
Li-MD
(5.7 lmol (g s)-1 at 853 K). Substitution of Li+ by higher
alkali metal ions resulted in a marked decrease in catalytic
activity, i.e., 3.3, 2.1, 1.4, and 0.4 lmol (g s)-1 for Li-
Na-MD, Na-MD, Li-K-MD, and K-MD, respectively. The
corresponding yields in ethene were 62% (Li-MD), 40%
(Li-Na-MD), 17% (Na-MD), 16% (Li-K-MD) and 4%
(K-MD). It is particularly interesting to note that the
selectivity was much higher for those catalysts, which were
molten under reaction conditions (83, 89, and 94% for
Li-MD, Li-Na-MD, Li-K-MD, respectively) than for solid
catalysts (61 and 58% for Na-MD, K-MD, respectively).
Separate kinetic experiments (not shown here) were
also done in the presence and absence of Dy2O3 over the
Li/Mg/O/Cl catalyst during ODH of ethane. The activity
increased in the presence of Dy2O3 without a variation in
ethene selectivity. Thus, the higher activity is attributed to
the higher specific surface area (10.3 m2/g) of Li/Dy/Mg/O/Cl
compared to Li/Mg/O/Cl (4.7 m2/g).
Closer analysis of the selectivity to ethene as a function
of temperature revealed two distinct regimes (Fig. 7). The
selectivity to ethene first increased linearly with tempera-
ture, but then leveled off at higher temperatures (compared
at approximately equal conversions). For Na-MD and
Table 2 XRD phases observed for alkali metal chlorides supported
on Dy/Mg/O at 373 K and melting temperature (Tmelt) of the alkali

K-MD, the selectivity increased to 7580% at 903 K. The
catalysts Li-MD and Li-Na-MD showed a linear increase in
selectivity to 873 and 823 K, respectively. At higher tem-
peratures, the selectivity was constant at 8590%, while for
Li-K-MD, the selectivity was 94% between 823 and 923 K.
Constant selectivity was always obtained, when the
supported alkali metal chloride was in molten state. For
Na-MD and K-MD, the selectivity was constant above
903 K, although a direct proof of the molten state by XRD or
TG-DSC analysis could not be obtained. It appears that for
both catalysts the mobility of the surface atoms is sufficient
to achieve a similar albeit weaker effect than with the melt.
3.4.2 Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
The catalytic properties were also explored with respect to
the ODH of propane from 773 to 898 K. The rate of pro-
pane conversion and yield to olefinic products (propene
and ethene) increased exponentially with temperature
(Fig. 8). The highest activity was observed for Li-MD
(6.1 lmol (g s)-1 at 873 K). Addition of higher alkali
metal ions to the catalyst led to decreased catalytic activity
(4.2 and 2.6 lmol (g s)-1 for Li-Na-MD and Li-K-MD,
respectively). The corresponding olefin yields (ethene and
propene) were 31% (Li-MD), 26% (Li-Na-MD), and 18%
(Li-K-MD) with the propene yields being higher than the
ethene yields. The trends in catalytic performance of alkali
metal chloride catalysts were similar in ODH of ethane and
propane (see Table 3).

The effect of temperature on the selectivity to olefins
(propene and ethene) is shown in Fig. 9. Li-K-MD had a
much higher selectivity to propene in comparison to Na-Li-
MD and Li-MD. For Li-K-MD the selectivity to propene
decreased, while with Li-Na-MD and Li-MD, it passed
through a slight maximum at 798 and 848 K with
increasing temperature. The selectivity with respect to
ethene was identical for all supported alkali metal chloride
catalysts and increased linearly with temperature. The
product distributions of Li-MD and Li-K-MD catalysts are
shown in Fig. 10. For Li-MD the selectivity to propene
changed only to a modest degree (38%  5), while the
ethene selectivity increased from 12 to 34% on the expense
of the formation of CO and CO2 that decreased from 54 %
at 500 C to 17% at 625 C. Above 550 C also formation
of methane, ethane, and butane were observed. For Li-K-
MD, the selectivity to propene decreased from 91 to 55%,
while the selectivities to ethene increased from 9 to 31%
and that for CO and CO2 increased from 4 to 10%.
In order to explore the variation of the selectivity as a
function of conversion, the space velocity (WHSV = 0.6
3.6 h-1) has been varied at constant temperature (823 K)
and propane/oxygen ratio (1/1) (see Fig. 11). The Li-K-
MD catalyst showed higher selectivities to propene than
the Li-Na-MD and Li-MD catalysts at all conversions. The
selectivity of Li-K-MD decreased significantly (from 78 to
56%) with increasing propane conversion (020%), while
the selectivity over Li-Na-MD and Li-MD catalysts
remained nearly unaffected.
Interestingly, the ethene
selectivity (2025%) remained virtually constant with
propane conversion pointing to the fact that ethene is not a
sequential product of propene. Upon cracking of propane to
ethene, methane should be formed in equimolar quantities.
However, the concentration of methane was only 2030%
of the concentration of ethene formed. The concentration
of CO and CO2 on the other hand was always equal or
higher than the concentration of ethene. This suggests that
a significant part of the methyl groups/radicals formed in
the cracking process has reacted further. In all cases, the
concentrations of CO and CO2 suggest that also larger
fragments have been fully oxidized. A small concentration
of ethane and butane indicate that the chemistry observed
also includes CC bond formation as one of the secondary
reactions.

4 Discussion
4.1 State and Physicochemical Properties of Catalysts
It is generally accepted that the balance between acid-base
and redox properties of the catalyst surface determines the
performance of catalysts in ODH of lower alkanes [14, 23,
24]. Single pass yields above 5060% only been achieved
with a very small number of solid catalysts, i.e., Ni-Nb or
vanadia based mixed oxides and supported (molten) alkali
chloride catalysts. Among these, the molten chloride cat-
alysts are unique, as their change of state allows exploring
the influence of self organization, i.e., the dynamic
restructuring
of
the
catalyst
surface
under
reaction
conditions.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the variation of the X-ray
diffractograms as a function of temperature. The disap-
pearance of the LiCl and KCl peaks for Li-K-MD in Fig. 1
at 623 K is in contrast to the persistence of the KCl peaks
for K-MD in Fig. 2. This indicates that the eutectic mixture
causes the disappearance of the separate crystalline phases
upon melting. After cooling and solidification, the two
chloride phase form again. The calorimetric studies support
that observation. It is interesting to note that for LiCl
containing catalysts, melting is preceded by expansion of
the corresponding alkali metal chloride lattice (indicated by
shift of the XRD peaks to higher d-values). The melting
points of bulk LiCl and the eutectic mixtures NaCl-LiCl
and KCl-LiCl [16, 17] agree well with the melting tem-
peratures of the alkali metal chloride phase in the supported
catalysts (see Table 2). Evidences for such phase trans-
formation were not observed for Na-MD and K-MD
indicating that the supported NaCl and KCl remain solid to
at least 923 K. The fact that the mixed chlorides form a
homogeneous melt, but two segregated phases in the solid
state precludes drawing direct conclusions from the char-
acterization of the acid base properties of the mixed
chlorides in solid state.
For the supported chlorides with only one cation, the
concentration of adsorbed NH3 decreased in the sequence
Li-MD [ Na-MD [ K-MD, while the maximum of the
TPD peak shifted to lower temperatures in that sequence.
This indicates that the concentration and strength of the
acid
sites
decreases
in
the
sequence
Li-MD [ Na-
MD [ K-MD in agreement with results by Wang et al. [14]
for silica supported catalysts (see Table 1). The acid sites
on K-MD are so weak that the desorption peak of ammonia
is hardly visible.
4.2 Dependence of Catalytic Activity and Selectivity
on Catalyst Properties
The rate of ethane conversion to ethene decreased in the
order
Li-MD [ Na-MD [ K-MD
(Fig. 6)
correlating
sympathetically with the decreasing acidity. Thus, one
might conclude at first that the order of catalyst activity is
predominantly influenced by the concentration and strength
of acid sites in these materials. Consequently, the lower
activity of Na-MD and K-MD is attributed to the lower
acidity of the catalyst induced by the Na+ and K+ ions. In

line with these expectations, the activity of Li-Na-MD (Li-
K-MD) is between the activity of Li-MD and Na-(K-)MD.
It is, however, interesting to note that the catalytic
activity of Li-MD, Li-Na-MD, and Li-K-MD normalized to
the specific surface area varies sympathetically with the
melting temperature of the supported alkali metal chloride
phase (see Table 2). Thus, it appears that high mobility of
the surface cation and anions is beneficial for the catalytic
activity. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that
the two catalysts that do not form a supported molten layer,
i.e., Na-MD and K-MD have the lowest intrinsic activity in
ODH of ethane. The sequence of activity with these two
catalysts follows, however, the concentration of acid sites.
This could suggest that the cations are directly or indirectly
important for alkane activation, but are more efficient in
the melt than in the solid state.
Not only the activity, but also the selectivity is strongly
enhanced by the presence of the chloride melt. The supported
LiCl melt containing catalyst has a greater selectivity com-
pared with LiCl/Li2CO3 as solid catalyst [25]. The presence
of sufficient chloride melt (1390 monolayers of the alkali
metal chloride) is concluded to eliminate sorption and cat-
alytic sites capable of retaining and oxidizing the formed
olefin. We conclude that the sites causing non-selective
oxidation are accessible metal cations, i.e., coordinatively
unsaturated cations strongly adsorbing the olefin and
assisting so full oxidation (COx formation). The highest
selectivity to olefins is reached at the melting point (Figs. 7
and 9) and it decreases in the sequence Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-
MD [ Li-MD. The two supported chlorides that do not melt
show also the lowest olefin selectivities.
These results suggest that the cations do not directly
control the CH bond activation through interactions, but
indirectly influence the catalytic properties of the chloride
overlayer. Their accessibility in the melt will be rather low
because of the constant mobility of the chloride anions and
the metal cations. This mobility will be the larger the lower
the melting point of the chloride is. The surface will have a
strong tendency to terminate with the larger chloride
anions. However, the decreasing electronegativity of the
cation will change the chemical reactivity of the chloride
and the transiently formed hypochloride anions increasing
the nucleophilicity of the chloride and the hydroxy groups
formed in the alkane activation step.
After establishing that the presence of catalyst in the
form of a molten chloride is beneficial, let us analyze the
interaction of oxygen with these materials. The amount of
oxygen consumed by Li-MD and Li-Na-MD increases
significantly with temperature indicating that the uptake is
related either to an endothermic reaction or to higher
mobility of the ions. Compared to Li-MD, the oxygen
uptake of Li-Na-MD was lower (1.4 and 1.0 lmol/g at
878 K, respectively). This is attributed to the lower oxygen
solubility with increasing radius of the cation [26, 27].
Oxygen forms an active species within the chloride melt,
which is responsible for the catalyst activity. The formation
of hypochlorites according to Eq. 1 appears most likely
[12], as chloride ions seem to be essential for a high cat-
alytic activity [25].

We speculate that OCl- is formed at the interface of melt
and support, since the support influences the catalyst activity
and selectivity even at temperatures above the melting point
of the alkali chloride phase [6, 8, 11]. As the solubility of
alkanes in the chloride mixture is very low, the OCl- ions are
assumed to diffuse to the catalyst surface to react. According
to this model, the rate of alkene formation depends on surface
concentration of the transient hypochlorite concentration
and the concentration of adsorbed alkane. The observation
that for ethane and propane the order of the reaction is close
to one (0.94 for ethane and 0.84 for propane) and that the
reaction order in oxygen is 0.250.3 are consistent with the
proposal that rate determining step is the activation of ethane
or propane by hypochlorite ions.
4.3 Elementary Steps of Alkane Activation
In a previous publication, the potential contributions of the
surface and gas phase reaction for the oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane have been outlined in detail for a
chlorine free catalyst, i.e., Li/MgO [28, 29]. The kinetic
results show clearly that at a reaction temperature of 873 K
the alkanes were activated at the catalyst surface, but that
much of the subsequent chemistry occurred in the form of
radical chemistry in the gas phase. The catalytic site acti-
vating the alkane was concluded to be the Li+O- site, as it
has been proposed before by Lunsford et al. [30]. The
selectivity between dehydrogenation and cracking has been
attributed to the generation of sec- and n-propyl radicals.
The OH• radical has been deduced to be the most abundant
radical chain propagator in the gas phase.
In the present case, the Li+O- sites, if present at all, are
presumably covered by liquid layers of LiCl or the other
chlorides used. Thus, we propose that the redox site initi-
ating the catalytic chemistry is the OCl- anion formed
transiently. Under reaction conditions OCl- ions is able to
form O- and Cl• radicals according to Eq. 2. The initiation
step involves homolytic hydrogen abstraction from ethane
or propane, forming a hydroxy group and a carbenium ion
attached to the chlorine ion. In this step two reactions can
occur. One possibility is that the surface carbenium ion
decomposes to the olefin and water freeing the chloride
ion. The other possibility is that the ClC bond cleaves
homolytically desorbing an ethyl or propyl radical. At least
at higher temperatures this latter pathway seems to be of
164
Top Catal (2008) 50:156167
123
significance. While we cannot differentiate between the
two reaction pathways based on the results of the current
study, it should be mentioned that the overall catalytic
chemistry will lead to identical product distributions.
For propane two different CH bonds, i.e., on the sec-
ondary or on the primary carbon atom can be cleaved in the
first reaction step. The energetic difference for the homo-
lytic cleavage of the CH bond at the secondary and at the
primary carbon atom is 11 kJ/mol suggesting that more
sec- than n-propyl radicals (or carbenium ions) are formed.
If a sec-propyl radical or the corresponding carbenium ion
is formed, the species can only cleave a hydrogen atom to
form propene. In case of the n-propyl radical (carbenium
ion) the species can undergo cracking at the  position
leading to ethene and a methyl radical. The energetic dif-
ference is sufficient to explain the higher selectivity to
propene than to cracked products.
If the sec-propyl radical desorbs, it will primarily react
with oxygen to form propene and a hydroperoxy radical.
The latter reacts with a new propane molecule to H2O2,
which by decomposition gives two hydroxyl radicals
(•OH). These hydroxyl radicals become the main species to
activate the first CH bond [31] at reactant pressure above
300 mbar by reacting with propane molecules to propyl
radicals and water.
In contrast to the sec-propyl radical, the n-propyl radical is
able to undergo CC cleavage at the  position forming
ethene and a methyl radical (Eq. 7 [32, 33]). A part of the
methyl radicals react with a second propane molecule,
whereby methane is formed and generates propyl radical.
The presence of ethane suggests that also combination of two
methyl (or ethyl) radicals occurs (Eqs. 8 and 9). A significant
fraction of the methyl radical is being oxidized, however, to
CO and CO2. It is not clear to what extent this occurs at the
catalyst surface and to what extent in the gas phase. How-
ever, additional CO and CO2 is formed by readsorption of
alkenes (ethene and propene) leading to total oxidation.

4.4 Influence of the Catalyst Composition
As discussed above, the overall chemistry starts with the
activation of the alkane at the surface through homolytic
CH bond cleavage at the OCl- site. This step is combined
either with the direct decomposition to alkene and water at
the surface or with desorption of the radical into the gas
phase. The latter process starts the gas phase radical
chemistry outlined in refs. [28, 29] and depicted in
Scheme 1. The overall high selectivity to olefins is caused
by the combination of two positive effects.
The first is related to the remarkable stability of the allyl
radicals (C3H5
•, C2H3
•) radical making the gas phase reac-
tions of propene very slow. Consequently, further reactions
of propene or ethene must occur at the catalyst surface and
must involve readsorption.
The second is related to the weak adsorption of alkenes on
the surface of the chloride melt, which is not only mostly
terminated by the larger anions, but the mobility of the cat-
ions in the melt will weaken the interaction with the olefin
through p bonding. The more mobile the melt, the more
likely the random movements will break existing interac-
tions. This is in perfect agreement with the observation that
the selectivity to olefins increases with decreasing melting
point of the chloride overlayer (see also ref, [13]). The
positive role of the weaker interaction explains also the
highly positive effect of the molten overlayer through
blocking existing defects at the catalyst surface that are
accessible when all components are in the solid state.
However, also the varying Lewis acid strength of the
cations influences the readsorption of alkenes. The higher
selectivity of Li-K-MD compared to Li-Na-MD and Li-MD
suggests that the lower Lewis acid strength of K+ relative
to Na+ and Li+ weakens the interactions with alkenes and
facilitates breaking the bonds between ethyl- and propyl
moieties and the catalyst surface. Consequently, the higher
ethene and propene selectivities of Li-K-MD catalyst are
attributed to the easier decomposition of ethyl or propyl
cations or radicals formed on the catalyst surface.
The increasing selectivity to dehydrogenation compared
to cracking in the conversion of propane in the sequence
Li-MD \ Li-Na-MD \ Li-K-MD is also attributed to the
decreasing Lewis acidity of the cations in that sequence.
We would like to speculate that the presence of Na and K
reduces the ability to activate the CH groups at the pri-
mary carbon atom.
So far, the presence of chlorine radicals has not been
considered as initiator of the CH activation of the alkanes
and/or as radical chain propagator. Based on the high sta-
bility of the supported chloride catalysts under the reaction
conditions, we conclude that chloride ions are not likely to
Top Catal (2008) 50:156167
165
123
form ClH bonds in the first or the second step of the
hydrogen elimination. As approximately 100 turnovers are
estimated per chloride atoms lost, it appears that in the
direct decomposition of the surface bound alkyl chloride,
the hydrogen atom is donated to the OH group formed in
the first step. This second step is driven by the acid base
properties of the partners involved. As the nucleophilicity
of the OH group is higher than that of the Cl- anion,
elimination of a proton from the ethyl or propyl rest will
lead to the formation of water rather than of HCl. The
water formed, however, will partly hydrolyze the supported
chloride.
Carbon dioxide that has been seen to impede the reac-
tion for the Li/MgO, adsorbs only weakly on the materials
studied. Enrichment of the chloride layer or the support
with carbonates has not been observed. In-situ Raman
measurements showed that carbonates formed during
storage of the pre-catalysts decomposed below 573 K.
As a last point, we would like to emphasize that the low
concentration of OCl- formed is beneficial for the selec-
tivity to olefins. In many instances, high product selectivity
in selective oxidation catalysis is associated with spatial
isolation of catalytically active sites (site isolation) [34,
35]. Assuming that all oxygen molecules adsorbed during
pulse experiments under reaction conditions (not shown
here) are converted to OCl-, the ratio of LiCl to OCl- is
above 1000:1. The low oxygen solubility in the melt and
the low stability of OCl- relative to decomposition to LiCl
and O2 leads to low concentration and a short lifetime of
the active sites. Under these conditions, the OCl- species
are surrounded only by cations and Cl- anions, thereby
becoming spatially isolated from each other.
5 Conclusions
Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group
of catalysts for applications in which the surface concen-
tration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized.
The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes un-
saturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction
with highly reactive products. This makes these materials
excellent catalysts for ODH of ethane and propane as
shown here.
For oxidative dehydrogenation, the present systems
relies on metal cations that do not change their oxidation
state, but facilitate the redox cycle by allowing the for-
mation of a sizable concentration of hypochlorite anions in
the presence of oxygen.
The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to
olefins
is
Li-K-MD [ Li-Na-MD [ Li-MD [ K-MD [
Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH
of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is
obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal
chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter.
Catalysts having molten alkali metal chloride phases under
reaction conditions show much higher olefin selectivities
than solid chloride containing catalysts. With increasing
temperature, the selectivity to olefin increases, while the
formation of COx decreases in parallel. This indicates less
pronounced
re-adsorption
of
alkenes
under
these
conditions.
Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the
excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most
important impact is related to the low concentration of
accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as

representation for the different
modes of propane activation

Top Catal (2008) 50:156167
123
discussed above. The second reason is associated with the
high mobility of cations and anions within the melt
reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason
is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in
and on the dynamic melt.
This new approach might allow tailoring highly specific
catalysts also for other reactions. In principle, the sup-
ported chloride melt could not only serve as catalyst, as in
the case demonstrated here. It could disperse other cata-
lytically
active
complexes,
cations,
or
anions
very
effectively to generate a new group of dynamic single site
catalysts.
