[1] "Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising route for the large-scale production of alkenes."

[2] "Over mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below 40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally observed at higher conversions [35]."

[3] "In contrast, halogen promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 show high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes [611]."

[4] "Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

[5] "Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."

[6] "Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above. The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

The literature does not specifically discuss recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. However, it does provide some insights into the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, including propane, using various catalyst systems.

The document mentions that mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations, such as vanadium, show alkene yields below 40% in ODH, with significant formation of CO and CO2 at higher conversions. In contrast, halogen-promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 demonstrate high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes.

A notable advancement is the use of supported alkali metal chloride melts as catalysts. These catalysts minimize the surface concentration of accessible metal cations, providing a dynamic surface that reduces interactions with highly reactive products. This results in excellent selectivity to olefins.

The literature does not explicitly discuss the persistent challenges in ODHP or specific strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems. However, it does highlight the importance of catalyst design in achieving high selectivity and yield.

Key factors contributing to the excellent selectivity of supported alkali metal chloride melts include:
1. Low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites
2. High mobility of cations and anions within the melt, reducing interactions with olefins
3. Spatial isolation of hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt

While the document does not directly address future research directions for ODHP, it suggests that the approach of using supported chloride melts could be applied to develop highly specific catalysts for other reactions, potentially opening new avenues for catalyst design and optimization.

该文献并未具体讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展。但是，它确实提供了一些关于使用各种催化剂体系对低级烷烃(包括丙烷)进行氧化脱氢的见解。

文献提到，含有氧化还原活性过渡金属阳离子(如钒)的混合氧化物在ODH中的烯烃产率低于40%，在高转化率下会形成大量的CO和CO2。相比之下，在MgO、SiO2和ZrO2上负载的卤素促进的碱金属和稀土混合氧化物在低级烷烃的氧化转化过程中表现出较高的烯烃产率。

一个显著的进展是使用负载的碱金属氯化物熔体作为催化剂。这些催化剂最大限度地减少了表面可接触金属阳离子的浓度，提供了一个动态表面，减少了与高反应性产物的相互作用。这导致了优异的烯烃选择性。

文献并未明确讨论ODHP中持续存在的挑战，或改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及改进反应系统的具体策略。然而，它确实强调了催化剂设计在实现高选择性和高产率方面的重要性。

负载的碱金属氯化物熔体具有优异烯烃选择性的关键因素包括：
1. 可接触的Lewis酸性位点浓度低
2. 熔体中阳离子和阴离子的高度流动性，减少了与烯烃的相互作用
3. 动态熔体中和表面次氯酸盐氧化位点的空间隔离

虽然文献没有直接讨论ODHP的未来研究方向，但它暗示了使用负载氯化物熔体的方法可以用于开发其他反应的高度特异性催化剂，可能为催化剂设计和优化开辟新的途径。
