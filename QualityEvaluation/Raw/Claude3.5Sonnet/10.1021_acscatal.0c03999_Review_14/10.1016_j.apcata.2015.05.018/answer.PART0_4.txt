[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over various catalysts is being developed [68]. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."

[2] "The highest selectivity (9496%) was achieved at 200 C over PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

[3] "There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

[5] "The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. Propane consumption turnover frequency was 45 103 s1 which is comparable with the highest known values obtained at the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, but challenges remain. Various catalyst systems have been explored, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides.

Performance comparison:
- Traditional catalysts: Yield of propylene does not exceed 35%, which is economically insufficient.
- PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst: Achieved 94-96% selectivity at 200°C, but with only 20% conversion.
- Ru/TiO2 catalyst with molecular chlorine: Reached 95% selectivity at 50% propane conversion and 400°C.

Soft oxidants being investigated include organochlorine compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, nitrous oxide, CO2, and halogens. Among these, molecular chlorine has shown the most promising results based on thermodynamic calculations.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:
1. Corrosiveness of some oxidants
2. Inherent reaction properties limiting conversion and selectivity
3. Balancing high selectivity with high conversion rates

Key areas for future research and development:
1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance conversion rates
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to extend catalyst lifetime
3. Renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes
4. Developing novel catalyst formulations to improve selectivity and conversion simultaneously
5. Investigating alternative soft oxidants that balance reactivity with material compatibility
6. Exploring ways to mitigate corrosion issues associated with certain oxidants
7. Optimizing reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, reactant ratios) for maximum efficiency

The use of molecular chlorine as an oxidant shows promise, but further research is needed to address potential corrosion issues and improve overall process efficiency. Developing catalysts that can maintain high selectivity at higher conversion rates remains a key challenge in the field of ODHP.

丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）使用温和氧化剂的最新进展显示了有希望的结果，但仍然存在挑战。研究人员已经探索了各种催化剂系统，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。

性能比较：
- 传统催化剂：丙烯产率不超过35%，经济效益不足。
- PtH3PMo12O40催化剂：在200°C下实现了94-96%的选择性，但转化率仅为20%。
- 使用分子氯的Ru/TiO2催化剂：在400°C和50%丙烷转化率下达到95%的选择性。

正在研究的温和氧化剂包括有机氯化物、含硫化合物、氧化亚氮、二氧化碳和卤素。其中，根据热力学计算，分子氯显示出最有前景的结果。

ODHP持续存在的挑战包括：
1. 某些氧化剂的腐蚀性
2. 反应固有特性限制了转化率和选择性
3. 平衡高选择性和高转化率

未来研究和开发的关键领域：
1. 改善C-H键活化以提高转化率
2. 提高催化剂再生能力以延长催化剂寿命
3. 改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程
4. 开发新型催化剂配方，同时提高选择性和转化率
5. 研究替代温和氧化剂，平衡反应性和材料兼容性
6. 探索减轻某些氧化剂相关腐蚀问题的方法
7. 优化反应条件（温度、压力、反应物比例）以实现最大效率

使用分子氯作为氧化剂显示出前景，但需要进一步研究以解决潜在的腐蚀问题并提高整体过程效率。开发能在更高转化率下保持高选择性的催化剂仍然是ODHP领域的一个关键挑战。
