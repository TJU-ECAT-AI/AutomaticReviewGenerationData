[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over various catalysts is being developed [68]. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."

[2] "The yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides [9]. The highest selectivity (9496%) was achieved at 200 C over PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

[3] "There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

[5] "The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. Propane consumption turnover frequency was 45 103 s1 which is comparable with the highest known values obtained at the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown some promising results, but also highlight persistent challenges in the field.

Various catalyst systems have been explored for ODHP:

1. Traditional metal oxide catalysts: The best catalysts to date yield no more than 35% propylene, which is not economically viable.

2. Mixed metal oxides: Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides achieved a 40% yield.

3. Heteropoly compounds: PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst showed high selectivity (94-96%) at 200°C, but with only 20% conversion.

4. Ruthenium-based catalysts: Using molecular chlorine as an oxidant, Ru/TiO2 catalyst achieved 95% selectivity at 50% propane conversion and 400°C.

Soft oxidants being investigated include organochlorine compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, nitrous oxide, CO2, and halogens. Among these, molecular chlorine has shown the most promise thermodynamically.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:

1. Low yields and conversions, limiting economic viability
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion
3. High reaction temperatures
4. Potential corrosiveness of halogen-based systems

Key areas for future research and development:

1. Improving C-H bond activation to increase conversion rates
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to extend catalyst lifetime
3. Optimizing reaction systems to balance selectivity, conversion, and temperature requirements
4. Developing more effective soft oxidants that balance reactivity with material compatibility
5. Exploring novel catalyst compositions and structures to improve performance

The use of molecular chlorine as an oxidant with ruthenium-based catalysts shows promise, but further research is needed to address challenges related to corrosion and process optimization.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了一些有前景的结果，但也突出了该领域持续存在的挑战。

ODHP已探索了各种催化剂系统：

1. 传统金属氧化物催化剂：迄今为止最好的催化剂产率不超过35%的丙烯，这在经济上不可行。

2. 混合金属氧化物：Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O混合氧化物实现了40%的产率。

3. 杂多化合物：PtH3PMo12O40催化剂在200°C下显示出高选择性（94-96%），但转化率仅为20%。

4. 钌基催化剂：使用分子氯作为氧化剂，Ru/TiO2催化剂在50%丙烷转化率和400°C下实现了95%的选择性。

正在研究的软氧化剂包括有机氯化物、含硫化合物、一氧化二氮、CO2和卤素。其中，分子氯在热力学上显示出最大的潜力。

ODHP持续面临的挑战包括：

1. 低产率和转化率，限制了经济可行性
2. 平衡选择性和转化率
3. 高反应温度
4. 基于卤素系统的潜在腐蚀性

未来研究和发展的关键领域：

1. 改善C-H键活化以提高转化率
2. 增强催化剂再生能力以延长催化剂寿命
3. 优化反应系统以平衡选择性、转化率和温度要求
4. 开发更有效的软氧化剂，平衡反应性和材料兼容性
5. 探索新型催化剂组成和结构以提高性能

使用分子氯作为氧化剂的钌基催化剂显示出前景，但需要进一步研究以解决与腐蚀和工艺优化相关的挑战。
