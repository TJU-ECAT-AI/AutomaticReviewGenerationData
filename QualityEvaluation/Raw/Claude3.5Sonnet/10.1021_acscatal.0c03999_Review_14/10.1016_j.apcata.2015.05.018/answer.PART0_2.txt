[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over various catalysts is being developed [68]. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility. The yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides [9]. The highest selectivity (9496%) was achieved at 200 C over PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

[2] "There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[3] "Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

[4] "The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2  2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol. is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization."

[5] "Ru/TiO2-1 catalyst (0.28 wt.% Ru) was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania (Degussa P-25 with a specific surface area of 57 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.36 cm3/g) with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] (Aurat, Russia) with pH = 1 at 90 C followed by drying at 110 C and calcination in air at 350 C for 2 h."

[6] "The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400 C. Propane consumption turnover frequency was 45 103 s1 which is comparable with the highest known values obtained at the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxide catalysts and main group element metal oxides have been explored for this reaction.

Performance comparison:
- Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides achieved a yield of 40%.
- PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst showed the highest selectivity of 94-96% at 200°C, with a conversion of approximately 20%.
- Ru/TiO2 catalyst demonstrated 95% selectivity toward propylene at 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion at 400°C.

Various soft oxidants have been investigated, including organochlorine compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, nitrous oxide, CO2, and halogens. Molecular chlorine has been identified as the most advantageous oxidizing agent based on thermodynamic calculations.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:
1. Corrosiveness of some oxidants
2. Inherent reaction properties limiting conversion and selectivity
3. Balancing C-H bond activation with over-oxidation

Key areas for future research and development:
1. Improving C-H bond activation: Develop catalysts that can selectively activate propane C-H bonds while minimizing further oxidation of propylene.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Design catalysts that maintain their activity and selectivity over extended periods and can be easily regenerated.
3. Renovating reaction systems: Optimize reactor designs and process conditions to maximize propylene yield and minimize energy consumption.
4. Exploring novel soft oxidants: Investigate other mild oxidizing agents that can provide high selectivity and conversion while minimizing corrosion and safety issues.
5. Developing multifunctional catalysts: Combine different active sites to promote both C-H activation and selective oxidation.

The use of chlorine as an oxidant in the Ru/TiO2 catalyst system has shown promising results, with high selectivity and conversion. However, further research is needed to address potential corrosion issues and improve the overall process efficiency for industrial applications.
