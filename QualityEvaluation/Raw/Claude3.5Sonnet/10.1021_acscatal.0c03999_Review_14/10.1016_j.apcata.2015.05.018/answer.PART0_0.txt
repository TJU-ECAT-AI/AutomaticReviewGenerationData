The yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides [9]. The highest selectivity (94–96%) was achieved at 200◦C over Pt–H3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have explored various catalyst systems and oxidizing agents. The literature mentions attempts to use organochlorine compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, nitrous oxide, CO2, and halogens as mild oxidants for propane dehydrogenation. Among these, molecular chlorine was found to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent based on thermodynamic calculations.

In terms of performance, traditional catalysts for ODHP have shown limited success. The best catalysts known to date achieve propylene yields not exceeding 35%, which is considered economically insufficient. However, some progress has been made:

1. Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides achieved a yield of 40%.
2. Pt-H3PMo12O40 catalyst showed the highest selectivity of 94-96% at 200°C, but with a relatively low conversion of approximately 20%.

A significant advancement is reported with Ru/TiO2 catalysts prepared using K4[Ru2OCl10]. This catalyst system demonstrated high catalytic activity, achieving 95% selectivity toward propylene at 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion at 400°C.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include issues related to corrosiveness (likely due to the use of chlorine-based oxidants) and inherent reaction properties that limit conversion and selectivity. The trade-off between high selectivity and low conversion (or vice versa) remains a significant hurdle.

Key areas for future research and development should focus on:

1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to prolong catalyst life and improve process economics.
3. Renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, potentially by exploring novel reactor designs or process configurations that can better manage heat transfer and product separation.
4. Developing catalysts that can achieve high selectivity and conversion simultaneously, possibly by fine-tuning the composition and structure of mixed oxide catalysts or exploring new classes of materials.
5. Addressing corrosion issues associated with chlorine-based systems, either by developing more resistant materials or finding alternative soft oxidants that offer similar benefits without the drawbacks.

These research directions aim to overcome the current limitations in ODHP and move towards more efficient and economically viable processes for propylene production.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展中，研究人员探索了各种催化剂系统和氧化剂。文献提到尝试使用有机氯化物、含硫化合物、一氧化二氮、二氧化碳和卤素作为丙烷脱氢的温和氧化剂。根据热力学计算，分子氯被发现是最有利的氧化剂。

在性能方面，传统的ODHP催化剂显示出有限的成功。目前已知的最佳催化剂的丙烯产率不超过35%，这在经济上被认为是不够的。然而，已经取得了一些进展：

1. Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O混合氧化物达到了40%的产率。
2. Pt-H3PMo12O40催化剂在200°C下显示出94-96%的最高选择性，但转化率相对较低，约为20%。

使用K4[Ru2OCl10]制备的Ru/TiO2催化剂系统取得了重大进展。该催化剂系统表现出高催化活性，在400°C下实现了50%的丙烷转化率和完全的氯气转化，同时对丙烯的选择性达到95%。

ODHP持续面临的挑战包括与腐蚀性相关的问题（可能是由于使用氯基氧化剂）以及限制转化率和选择性的固有反应特性。高选择性和低转化率（或反之）之间的权衡仍然是一个重大障碍。

未来研究和开发的关键领域应该集中在：

1. 改善C-H键活化，以提高转化率同时保持高选择性。
2. 提高催化剂的再生能力，延长催化剂寿命并改善工艺经济性。
3. 改进反应系统以优化ODHP工艺，可能通过探索新型反应器设计或工艺配置，以更好地管理热传递和产品分离。
4. 开发能够同时实现高选择性和高转化率的催化剂，可能通过微调混合氧化物催化剂的成分和结构，或探索新类别的材料。
5. 解决与氯基系统相关的腐蚀问题，可以通过开发更耐腐蚀的材料，或寻找提供类似优势但没有缺点的替代软氧化剂。

这些研究方向旨在克服ODHP当前的局限性，并朝着更高效、更具经济可行性的丙烯生产工艺迈进。
