[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over various catalysts is being developed [68]. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."

[2] "The highest selectivity (9496%) was achieved at 200 C over PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

[3] "There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

[5] "Nowadays, a RuO2/TiO2 catalyst is proposed for the Deacon reaction that allows performing this process at temperatures below 300 C [1921]. Catalysts based on ruthenium also show good performance in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane [22]."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown some progress, but still face significant challenges. Various catalyst systems have been explored, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides.

Performance of catalyst systems:
- Traditional catalysts: The yield of propylene does not exceed 35%, which is economically insufficient.
- PtH3PMo12O40 catalyst: Achieved high selectivity (94-96%) at 200°C, but with relatively low conversion (around 20%).
- Ruthenium-based catalysts: Show promising performance in reactions involving chlorine and its derivatives, particularly for the Deacon reaction and oxychlorination of methane and ethane.

Soft oxidants being investigated include:
- Organochlorine compounds
- Sulfur-containing compounds
- Nitrous oxide
- CO2
- Halogens (particularly molecular chlorine)

Molecular chlorine has been identified as the most advantageous oxidizing agent based on thermodynamic calculations.

Persistent challenges in ODHP:
1. Low yields and conversions
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion
3. Potential corrosiveness of some oxidants (e.g., chlorine)
4. Inherent reaction properties limiting performance

Key areas for future research and development:
1. Improving C-H bond activation
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Optimizing reaction systems for ODHP processes
4. Developing more efficient and stable catalysts
5. Exploring novel soft oxidants with better performance and reduced environmental impact
6. Investigating synergistic effects between different catalysts and oxidants
7. Scaling up promising laboratory results to industrial applications

To address these challenges, researchers should focus on:
- Designing advanced catalyst materials with improved selectivity and stability
- Exploring novel reaction mechanisms and pathways
- Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand catalyst behavior under reaction conditions
- Implementing process intensification strategies to enhance overall efficiency
- Investigating the potential of hybrid systems combining different oxidants or catalysts

By addressing these key areas, researchers aim to overcome the current limitations in ODHP and develop more efficient and economically viable processes for propylene production.
