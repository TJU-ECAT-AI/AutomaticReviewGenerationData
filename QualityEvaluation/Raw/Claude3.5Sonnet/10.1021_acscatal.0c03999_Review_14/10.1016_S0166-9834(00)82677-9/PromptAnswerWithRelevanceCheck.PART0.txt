Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, or comparisons of various catalyst systems for this process. The document focuses on the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons using a bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, which is a different process than ODHP. It does not discuss soft oxidants, transition metal/metal oxides, or main group element metal oxides as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The text also does not address challenges such as corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or optimizing ODHP processes. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the information provided in this document.

给定的文献中没有包含关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展,也没有比较各种催化剂系统在这一过程中的表现。该文档主要讨论了使用双功能Pt/H-ZSM-5催化剂将丙烷转化为更高级烃类的过程,这与ODHP是不同的过程。文中没有讨论软氧化剂、过渡金属/金属氧化物或主族元素金属氧化物作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的情况。文本也没有提到腐蚀性等挑战,或改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力、优化ODHP过程的策略。因此,基于本文档提供的信息无法回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information about recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, nor does it compare the performance of various catalyst systems for this reaction. The document focuses on the conversion of propane over bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, which is a different process than ODHP.

The literature does not discuss challenges such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties related to ODHP. It also does not mention strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or optimizing ODHP processes.

The document primarily describes the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. This process involves dehydrogenation of propane to propene over platinum, followed by oligomerization of propene on the acid sites of the zeolite. The main products observed were butanes, with some formation of higher hydrocarbons and aromatics at higher temperatures.

While this research provides insights into propane conversion using bifunctional catalysts, it does not address the specific topics related to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane that were asked about in the question.

给定的科学文献不包含关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展的信息，也没有比较各种催化剂系统在这种反应中的性能。该文档主要关注双功能Pt/H-ZSM-5催化剂上丙烷的转化，这是一个与ODHP不同的过程。

文献没有讨论与ODHP相关的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。它也没有提到改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或优化ODHP过程的策略。

该文档主要描述了使用铂和H-ZSM-5分子筛催化剂组合将丙烷转化为高级烃类的过程。这个过程包括丙烷在铂上脱氢生成丙烯，随后丙烯在分子筛的酸性位点上进行寡聚。观察到的主要产物是丁烷，在较高温度下还有一些高级烃类和芳烃的生成。

虽然这项研究提供了使用双功能催化剂进行丙烷转化的见解，但它并没有涉及问题中询问的与丙烷氧化脱氢相关的具体主题。
