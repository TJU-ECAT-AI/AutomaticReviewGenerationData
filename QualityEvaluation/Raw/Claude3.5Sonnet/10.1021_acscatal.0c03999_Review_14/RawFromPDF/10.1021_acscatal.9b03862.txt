Abstract
Mechanistic details and product distributions for C3H8–O2 reactions catalyzed by gas-phase NOx species are compared to reactions on solid V2O5 catalysts. C3H8 conversions are greatly enhanced by addition of small concentrations of NO to C3H8–O2 mixtures without solid catalysts because homogeneous catalytic redox cycles involving oxidation of NO to NO2, reduction by H-addition to form HONO and release of OH radicals facilitate abstraction of H-atoms from strong C–H bonds in C3H8. NOx-mediated conversions exhibit C3H6 selectivity values among the highest reported at similar oxidative conditions because OH radicals are strong abstractors that activate C–H bonds via early transition states that do not exhibit significant bond elongation, which dampens bond-strength sensitivity and the preference to activate weak allylic C–H bonds in C3H6 products over strong bonds in C3H8. C3H8 conversion rates increase with residence time and NO, O2, and H2O pressures and exhibit supra-linear dependence on C3H8 pressure with trends analogous to homogeneous systems involving H-abstraction by OH radicals but significantly different from V2O5 catalysts that exhibit linear C3H8 pressure dependence and weak sensitivity to the other parameters. Temperature dependencies of rate-constant-ratios representing activation energy differences between primary and secondary C3H8 and allylic C3H6 C–H bonds in NOx-catalyzed routes are much weaker than V2O5, consistent with dampened bond-strength sensitivity that is also observed in density functional theory estimates of these differences for OH radicals. NOx mediation enables efficient alkane activation providing high productivity and yields at moderate temperatures, which is important for chemical transformations requiring rate-limiting C–H activation.

1. Introduction
Selective formation of alkenes and oxygenates via alkane activation in exothermic oxidative routes remains challenging because products undergo more facile secondary C–H bond activation or C–O bond formation than reactants. (1,2) Systems reported to exhibit high propene (C3H6) yields in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane (C3H8) on metal oxide catalysts and in gas-phase homogeneous reactions are summarized in Table S1 and Figure S1. Most oxide catalysts exhibit single-pass C3H6 yields below 20% and approach with increasing temperature values attainable in gas-phase C3H8–O2 reactions in empty reactors; (3) some alkali and halogen promoted oxides lead to 20–30% C3H6 yields at high temperatures via routes that tend to involve both homogeneous and heterogeneous contributions. (4) Improvements in C3H6 selectivity with increasing temperatures in heterogeneous reactions are attributed to the lower activation energy for secondary reactions. (1) These studies show significant differences in kinetic details between solid catalysts and homogeneous gas-phase reactions. (5) The reactions on solid oxides are typically first- and zero-order in alkane and O2 pressures, respectively, while rates on the latter systems tend to exhibit higher-order dependence on pressures of these reactants. (5)
Recent reports of high selectivity to C3H6 and C2H4 in C3H8–O2 reactions on boron-based catalysts (6−15) have attracted significant interest in understanding the origins of the reactivity of these materials previously considered inert. The boron nitride systems were shown to require treatments that restore nitrogen content for sustained performance, suggesting that nitrogen atoms are important, (10) but reactions were also reported to proceed efficiently in other boron-based starting materials without nitrides. (7,14) In spite of the requirement of solid-boron-based surfaces, these systems seem to exhibit supra-linear reaction orders in C3H8 and nonzero orders in O2 pressures similar to homogeneous systems, (6) pointing to some uniqueness in reaction steps involved.
Here, we report alternative selective dehydrogenation pathways involving homogeneous C3H8–O2 reactions enhanced by addition of trace concentrations of NO and assess how mechanistic details and selectivity limitations for this system compare with solid catalysts. In these reactions, the NO and NO2 (NOx) species undergo oxidation reduction catalytic cycles to release highly reactive OH radicals, which provide an important practical route to selective oxidative conversion of hydrocarbons at moderate temperatures. The effects of pressures of reactants and cofed H2O on measured alkane conversion rates and energies of reactive species and transition states from density functional theory (DFT) are used to infer mechanistic details of NOx catalysis, identify the types of radicals and reactive species involved, and determine conditions important for maximizing selectivity to desired products. The OH radicals generated in NOx catalytic cycles are strong abstractors of H-atoms in strong C–H bonds, and therefore, they activate C–H bonds via exothermic steps with early C–H activation transition states that cannot differentiate between strong and weak bonds in alkanes and product alkenes, respectively. Such dampening of bond-strength effects on activation rates and its relation to selectivity improvements in C3H8 ODH are probed via temperature dependences of rate constant ratios relevant to selectivity and DFT calculations for C–H activation energy differences between C3H8 and the C3H6 product.
2. C3H8 Activation Rates and Selectivities in C3H8–O2–NO Reactions
Figure 1 shows the effect of NO pressure on C3H8 conversion and product selectivity in empty flow reactors of two different sizes (6 and 12 cm3 volumes; details in Figure S3). At the given reaction conditions (773 K, 3 kPa C3H8, 10 kPa O2, 30 cm3 min–1), C3H8 exhibits conversions below 0.1% in the absence of NO, but the introduction of 0.005 kPa NO increases the conversion by factors of 35 and 20 for the 6 and 12 cm3 reactors, respectively. The incorporation of NO leads to additional C3H8 reactions that are up to two or more orders of magnitude higher than the number of NO molecules added, depending on residence times and alkane pressures used, which suggests that NO acts as a catalyst instead of getting stoichiometrically consumed in the reaction. This catalytic role of NOx in hydrocarbon conversion has been proposed and probed mechanistically in many previous studies. (16−25) Such large enhancements lead to homogeneous reactions rates comparable to those on solid catalysts, as shown in the Supporting Information via comparisons of productivity of NOx-mediated reactions with several previously reported catalytic reactions (Table S2), which may make it practical to run these reactions at large scales. The C3H8 conversion increases with increasing NO pressure and is greater for the larger reactor, suggesting that reactions proceed in the gas-phase via homogeneous pathways enabled by NO or its oxidation products. The conversions increase more significantly than reactor volumes (Figure 1a) because rates are higher at longer residence times; such nonlinear residence time effects are further probed in section 4. C3H8–O2 reactions at 0.005 kPa NO and conversions below 5% exhibit C3H6 and C2H4 selectivity near 80% and 10%, respectively (Figure 1b), total C1–C3 oxygenates selectivities near 7%, and total CO and CO2 selectivity below 3% (detailed product selectivities in Figure S6a). The C3H6 selectivity decreases weakly with conversion, consistent with higher yields than those typically attained on oxide catalysts, as also reported in the case of boron nitride catalysts. (6) The formation of C2H4 is consistent with C–C bond cleavage typically observed when homogeneous pathways mediate C3H8 activation, which point to mechanistic similarities between NO-catalyzed reactions and the homogeneous reactions previously reported. (3,4,26) Higher NO feed concentrations enhance C3H8 conversion rates more significantly but cause a slight decrease in C3H6 selectivity at low conversions (Figure 1b), suggesting that an optimum low NO concentration maximizes the alkene selectivity at a given conversion.
Figure 1

Large enhancements in rates of alkane activation by NOx have been studied previously for the direct conversion of CH4 to oxygenate such as HCHO. (19,27) The NOx-catalyzed reactions led to greater HCHO selectivity than heterogeneous routes, but the yields remained well below 10% and significant side reactions that introduced nitrogen into hydrocarbons were observed due to large NOx feed concentrations up to 5 kPa. We show here that much smaller NO concentrations can be used to selectively convert C3H8 to alkenes (Figure 1b; Section S4). Such small concentrations of NO are present as impurities in industrial exhaust gases (28−30) that may be added to hydrocarbons and O2 to carry out the desired oxidative conversions. For example, power plant boilers and other sources such as industrial boilers, incinerators, and gas turbines operating at high temperatures produce NOx by oxidizing N2 or nitrogen-containing fuels, leading to concentrations up to 300 and 1000 ppm at operating temperatures of 1350 K (30) and 1750 K, (31) respectively. Flue gases from these sources can be mixed with C3H8–O2 mixtures for production of alkenes and other oxygenates using NOx at much lower temperatures and for potentially avoiding more expensive NOx treatments.
The mechanism of NOx-catalyzed conversions of hydrocarbons such as CH4 involve the generation of OH radicals. These radicals have been detected by laser-induced fluorescence measurements (32) for CH4/O2/NOx reactions and their role as predominant abstractors of H-atoms from strong C–H bonds has been determined from kinetic simulations. (19,27,32) The OH radicals generated from H2O and O2 in alkali promoted oxides and molten salt catalysts at high temperatures have also been shown to activate hydrocarbons. (4,33,34) Therefore, we probe the role of H2O in further enhancing NOx-mediated C3H8 conversions by cofeeding H2O to C3H8–O2 reactants with and without NOx catalysts, as shown in Figure 2. When no H2O is cofed (0 kPa H2O in Figure 2a), the C3H8 conversion is near 1% for 0.005 kPa NOx, which is much higher than conversion without NOx. At this conversion, the average pressure of H2O produced from C3H8–O2 reactions are near 0.01 kPa H2O, which is much less than the cofed water pressures. The addition of 1 kPa H2O for 0.005 kPa NOx increases the conversions to nearly 1.5%; for reactions without NOx, the conversion increase is much smaller. Further increase in cofed H2O pressure increases the C3H8 conversion with slightly greater sensitivity for reactions with NOx. Thus, H2O enhances reaction rates more significantly when NOx is present, suggesting that it acts as a promoter or a cocatalyst for NOx-catalyzed OH radical generation. The alkene selectivities remain similar for reactions with and without NOx and exhibit weak sensitivity to conversion (Figure 2b), suggesting that similar reactive species can be responsible for alkane activations in both cases. These reactive species have been proposed and shown to be OH radicals in previous homogeneous reaction studies. (19,27,32)

Next, we propose mechanistic details involving catalytic reactions of NOx and H2O that lead to rate enhancements in gas-phase C3H8–O2 reactions shown in Figures 1 and 2. We probe the feasibility of these reactions using DFT-derived H-abstraction strengths of gaseous reactive species, C–H bond strengths for different types of bonds in C3 hydrocarbons and organic radicals, C–H bond activation energies and experimental activation energies available in the literature, and electronic energies and Gibbs free energies for reactions involved in catalytic steps. These assessments are used to establish the nature of active species relevant for the selective gas-phase oxidative dehydrogenations.
3. OH Radical Generation via NOx Catalysis and Mechanistic Connections of Rate and Selectivity Enhancements to Strengths of H-Abstractors and C–H Bonds
3.1. H-Abstractors Generated in NOx Catalytic Cycles
Previous kinetic simulations for CH4–O2–NOx reactions suggest that NO2 formed via NO oxidation facilitates pathways that generate OH radicals, which are strong abstractors of H-atoms in CH4, and reform NO to complete NOx catalytic cycles, (16) without NO getting stoichiometrically consumed in the process. (19,27) Dehydrogenations of saturated hydrocarbons and oxygenates occur via homolytic C–H activation steps at H-abstracting oxidants, (2,35) indicating that mechanisms similar to CH4 activation are also relevant to C3H8 dehydrogenation. Scheme 1 shows such catalytic cycles involving interactions of NOx with oxidant O2 and reductant hydrocarbons. The oxidation of NO to •NO2 (step 1, Scheme 1) can occur via well-established kinetics with rates proportional to O2 pressure and the square of NO pressure, and with slightly negative activation energy that indicates facile nature of this step. (36) This reaction is mediated by a kinetically relevant step involving a trimolecular transition state. (37−40) The NO2 molecule abstracts an H-atom from a saturated organic molecule (HX; e.g., C3H8) to form HONO and an organic radical species (X•, step 2, Scheme 1). The HONO species dissociates to form OH radical and NO molecule (step 3). The OH radicals generated in this cycle also abstract H-atoms from organic molecules (HY) to form organic radical species (Y•) and H2O (step 4). These cycles are analogous to Mars van Krevelen (MvK) redox cycles ubiquitous in selective oxidation of organic molecules on oxides where facile O2 activation forms an oxidized form of the catalyst, which is reduced via kinetically relevant C–H activation steps to form surface OH species that dehydroxylate to form H2O and O-vacancies. (41−44) The redox cycles for NOx, however, can generate highly energetic gaseous OH species instead of surface oxygen species.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. NOx Catalytic Cycles Generating OH Radicalsa
aHX and HY represent organic molecules activated by C–H activation.
The OH radicals exhibit a strong tendency to abstract H-atoms from strong C–H bonds, as proposed in many previous studies. (4,16,17,19,21,26,34,45) Their formation according to Scheme 1, however, requires a sacrificial H-abstraction by NO2 to generate HONO precursors. The HX and HY molecules in Scheme 1 represent different or the same organic molecules depending on the types of species present during reactions and the reactivity preferences dictated by the strengths of the abstractors and C–H bonds. HX represents a sacrificial species with weak C–H bonds that can activate C–H bonds by NO2 as an abstractor for facile HONO formation. Previous kinetic simulations for CH4–O2–NOx reactions found that CH4 itself acts as the sacrificial species near zero conversion during the induction period when weaker C–H bonds are not present, but at finite conversions oxygenate species such as HCHO molecules and HCO radicals with very weak C–H bonds can be the sacrificial H-donors. (18,19,22−24,27) The organic radicals (X• and Y•) further react with oxidants to form unsaturated or oxidized organic molecules (e.g., C3H6, HCHO). Species with weak C–H bonds may activate on weaker abstractors, leading to several possibilities including C–H bond activation in organic species occurring directly at HONO, NO, or O2 to form H2O+NO, HNO, and •OOH species, respectively. These plausible steps for the activation of C3H8 and C3H7 radicals by different oxidants are shown in Scheme 2.
Scheme 2
Scheme 2. C–H Activations in C3H8 and C3H7 Radical by Different Oxidant Species Involved in NOx Catalytic Cycles
These possibilities lead to complex reaction networks in which only some of the many steps contribute to most of the observed rates and to selectivity limitations. (18,19,22−24,27) Kinetic analyses for such systems require knowledge of rate constants for all possible steps. Many of these constants for CH4 oxidation are available from experiments but require further modifications for kinetic simulations. Analogous analyses for C3H8 oxidation are more complex than CH4 and involve greater uncertainty in values of rate constants due to the significantly greater number and structural complexity of possible organic species involved as minor products. Yet, trends in reactivity of the catalytic species present in reaction can be determined using thermodynamic properties reflected in bond strengths in reactants and abstractors derived from DFT calculations. Analyses based on these reactivity trends are used here to derive mechanistic insights and assess relevance of reactive species to rates and selectivity, instead of numerical data based on tabulated rate constants and activation energies. We probe which of the possible steps may prevail at reaction conditions by examining the strengths of C–H bonds and abstractors involved in the steps shown in Scheme 2.
3.2. Strengths H-Abstractors and C–H Bonds
The H-abstraction strengths of the various molecular species involved in catalytic cycles of NOx (Schemes 1 and 2) and of lattice O-atoms of the V2O5(001) surface used as a representative solid oxide catalyst are given by the DFT-derived values of H-atom addition energy (HAE) shown in Table 1. The DFT calculations were performed using PBE-D3BJ DFT functionals (46) within the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package. Gas molecules were simulated in a 20 Å cubic box with dipole corrections, and V2O5(001) surface were simulated using two layers of orthorhombic oxide repeating periodically in lateral directions and vacuum separation in (001) direction. Additional details of computational methods and catalyst models are provided in Section S2.4. More negative HAE values represent stronger H-abstractors that tend to be more reactive for C–H bond activation.
Table 1. DFT (PBE-D3BJ)-Derived Electronic Energies for H-Atom Addition to H-Abstractors
The HAE values range from −179 kJ mol–1 to −520 kJ mol–1 for the weakest (NO) to the strongest (OH) abstractor in Schemes 1 and 2. The HAE value for the O-atom in terminal V═O* species in V2O5, the most reactive site on this oxide, is −292 kJ mol–1. Weak H-abstractors NO, O2, and HONO exhibit HAE values less negative than the lattice O-atoms of V2O5. As a result, these species are unlikely to directly abstract strong C–H bonds in alkanes. NO2 and OOH radical species are stronger abstractors than V2O5, while OH radicals are much stronger than even OOH (Table 1). These values are consistent with the catalytic cycle proposed in Scheme 1, where C–H bonds are abstracted from NO2 and OH radicals instead of the weak abstractors such as NO. The strong H-abstraction propensity of OH radicals leads to high reactivity of this abstractor for strong C–H bonds.
Table 2 shows the strength of C–H bonds in C3H8, in dehydrogenation product C3H6, and in radicals formed by first C–H activation in these molecules, as reflected in their experimental and PBE-D3BJ-derived bond dissociation enthalpies and electronic energies (BDE). Larger BDE values represent stronger C–H bonds that exhibit higher C–H activation energy for a given H-abstractor. The DFT-derived enthalpies are slightly lower than experimental values but exhibit similar differences among different types of C–H bonds as observed in measurements. (35,47)

The electronic C–H BDE values for different types of C–H bonds in C3H8 and C3H6 range from +371 kJ mol–1 to +478 kJ mol–1. The BDE value is higher for the primary C–H bond in C3H8 (438 kJ mol–1) than the secondary C–H bond (421 kJ mol–1, Table 2), suggesting that the secondary bonds are more reactive for homolytic C–H activations. The vinylic C–H bonds of the C3H6 are much stronger than both primary and secondary bonds in C3H8 (478 and 454 kJ mol–1, Table 2), suggesting that these bonds are much less reactive. In contrast, the allylic C–H bonds in C3H6 are weaker than the bonds in C3H8 (371 kJ mol–1, Table 2), which indicates that the C3H6 molecule can undergo facile C–H activations at the allylic position and is more reactive for C–H activations than the reactants. Such allylic C–H activations are often rate-limiting steps in oxidation of C3H6. (48−51) C3H6 is the desired product in C3H8 oxidative dehydrogenation, and therefore, these facile C–H activations represent the most significant limitations to the selectivity to this product on typical transition metal oxide catalysts such as V2O5 because they lead to more facile activation of weaker C–H bonds.
The C–H BDE values for propyl radical species formed by first C–H activation in C3H8 are much lower than all bonds in C3H8 and C3H6 (157 and 174 kJ mol–1 for primary and secondary radicals, respectively; Table 2), which is indicative of the much more reactive nature of these radicals. The C–H BDE for the allyl radial formed from C3H6 is higher than propyl radicals, but it remains much lower than C3H8 and C3H6 molecules suggesting their reactive nature.
Next, we probe the effect of the BDE and the HAE values on DFT-derived C–H activation energies given by differences in electronic energy between the C–H activation transition state and the isolated abstractor and hydrocarbon. These trends are used to determine preferences for the abstractors for the activation of the different organic molecules and radicals in Table 2 and the most likely abstractors involved in C3H8 activation in the NOx-mediated catalytic cycles shown in Scheme 1.
3.3. Effects of Abstractor Strengths and C–H Bond Strengths on C–H Activation Energies
The C–H activation energies derived from PBE-D3BJ calculations for a secondary C–H bond in C3H8 (CH3CH2CH3, Table 2) to form a secondary C3H7 radical, for a C–H bond in the secondary C3H7 radical (CH3•CHCH3) to form the desired C3H6 product, and for an allylic C–H bond in C3H6 (CH2═CHCH3), as a function of HAE of the H-abstractors in Table 1 are shown in Figure 3. These C–H activations shown here represent the sequence of steps required to form the desired C3H6 product and its secondary reactions (C3H8 → •C3H7 → C3H6 → •C3H5); thus, activation energy differences among these steps are relevant to C3H6 selectivity.
Figure 3

The C–H activation energies for a secondary C–H bond in C3H8 are lower for stronger H-abstractors with more negative HAE values (CH3CH2CH3, Figure 3). This C–H bond is weaker and more reactive among the two types of C–H bonds in C3H8 (Table 2). The activation energy is greater than 150 kJ mol–1 for weak abstractors NO, O2, and HONO, near 75 kJ mol–1 for NO2 and V2O5 abstractors of intermediate strength, and 39 kJ mol–1 for the OOH radical. The OH radicals are much stronger H-abstractors than all other abstractors. The energy of the system decreases monotonically as the C3H8 molecule approaches this abstractor and does not exhibit a local maximum indicative of a transition state (nudged elastic band calculation shown in Figure S20), which leads to an activation energy of zero. These trends in C3H8 activation energy are consistent with experimental values reported in the literature for the different oxidants, which are shown in Table S4. The measured activation energies in literature are 200, 95, and 58 kJ mol–1 for O2, NO2, and the OOH radical and nearly zero for the OH radical. (52−55) These predicted and measured activation energies suggest that the activation rates for OH radials are much higher than the other abstractors. Estimates form Arrhenius expression suggests that C3H8 activation rates at 773 K for OH radical are larger than OOH radical by 3 orders of magnitude for the DFT-derived activation energy (+39 kJ mol–1 for OOH, Figure 3) and by 4 orders of magnitude to measured values in the literature (+58 kJ mol–1 for OOH (54)); other abstractors are much less reactive than both OH and OOH radicals. Thus, C3H8 molecules will be activated preferentially by OH radicals even if the concentration of these radicals were much smaller than the concentrations of other abstractors. These estimates are consistent with the predominant role of OH radicals in homogeneous oxidations catalyzed by NOx as well as alkali promoted and molten salt oxides. (4,16−21,34)
The C–H bond in the C3H7 radical is much weaker than C3H8, leading to much lower activation energy for a given abstractor (CH3•CHCH3, Figure 3). The C–H activation energy for this radical is 45 and 40 kJ mol–1, for weak abstractors NO and HONO, respectively. For NO2 and OOH and OH radicals, the energies decrease monotonically as the C3H7 radical approaches the abstractors, leading to zero activation energies. O2 forms a stable physiosorbed complex with the C3H7 radical which undergoes C–H activation via a transition state with −14 kJ mol–1 activation energy relative to the isolated precursors. This negative activation energy is consistent with the experimental value of −9 kJ mol–1 reported in the literature (56) (Table S4). Thus, in contrast to the C3H8 molecule, the C3H7 radical does not exhibit a strong preference for OH radicals as abstractors. The activation energy is near zero for several abstractors and it can be activated on several abstractor species, depending on the abundance of these species. The C3H7 radical can also act as a sacrificial H-atom donor required to form HONO (Scheme 1). O2 exhibits slightly negative activation energies and is fed at much higher concentrations than NO in the measurements (typical conditions: 3, 10, and 0.005 kPa C3H8, O2, and NO, respectively); thus, O2 is likely to activate most of the C3H7 radicals.
The C–H activation energies as a function of HAE were also calculated for a primary C–H bond in C3H8 (CH3CH2CH3, Table 2), and subsequent C–H activation in the primary radical to form C3H6 are shown in Figure S14 and Table S6. These activation energies exhibit similar overall trends as that shown for the secondary C–H bond activation and the subsequent alkene formation (Figure 3). The activation energies for CH3CH2CH3 are zero for OH radicals and 12–17 kJ mol–1 higher than CH3CH2CH3 for other abstractors, consistent with the less reactive nature of stronger primary C–H bonds. OH radicals, however, suppress these bond strength differences, leading to no activation energy difference between primary and secondary C–H bonds. The activation energies for both types of C3H7 radicals are similar within 6 kJ mol–1 (Figure 3, Figure S14, and Table S7).
Figure 3 also shows the activation energies for the allylic C–H bond in C3H6. This C–H bond is weaker than the bonds in C3H8 by about 50 kJ mol–1 but nearly 200 kJ mol–1 stronger than the bonds in C3H7 radicals (Table 2). As a result, the activation energies for C3H6 are intermediate between the two species. The lower activation energies of C3H6 than C3H8 is consistent with low selectivity to the desired C3H6 product observed on most oxide catalysts. The difference between the two activation energies diminishes as the abstractors become stronger and nearly zero for OH radicals, suggesting that stronger abstractors are more selective to C3H6.
The decrease in activation energies with increasing abstractor strength exhibits a curved trend with a smaller local slope for stronger abstractors (Figure 3), consistent with deviations from linear Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relations (57,58) that have been observed for C–H and O2 activations and C–O bond formation reactions on oxides. (35,59−61) Such trends can be described by crossing-potential models that represent C–H activation transition state structures and their energies via the intersection point between harmonic potentials for C–H bond cleavage and O–H bond formation, as shown in Scheme 3.
Scheme 3
Scheme 3. Effect of C–H Bond Strength and H-Abstractor Strength on C–H Bond Activationa
a(a) Crossing of harmonic potentials for C–H cleavage and O–H formation, and (b) changes in lateness of transition sate (TS) with reaction energies.
The stretching of a C–H or an O–H bond beyond its equilibrium length increases the potential energy of the species, which is represented here by parabolic shape of the harmonic potential energy surface for these bonds (Scheme 3a). A lower vertical position of the minimum energy point of a parabola represents stronger bond strength. C–H activation requires breaking of a C–H bond and formation of an O–H bond, which can be represented by overlapping the potentials (parabolas) for a reactant C–H bond and a product O–H bond. The x-axis here represents the position of H-atom moving away for the C-atom and toward the O-atom. The intersection point of the two potentials represents the C–H activation transition state.
For a given C–H bond, the minimum energy point of the OH potential shifts to lower energy while keeping the same distance with the C–H bond minimum position along the x-direction as the H-abstractor becomes stronger (stronger O–H bond) and the C–H activation step becomes more exothermic. As a result, the intersection-point appears at lower energies (y-axis) and at earlier points along the C–H stretching coordinate (x-axis). When the abstractors are very strong, the intersection occurs near the flat part of the C–H parabola near the equilibrium C–H bond position where the energy of the intersection point decreases weakly with lowering of the O–H parabola (Scheme 3a). These intersection points represent early transition states with barely stretched C–H bonds and activation energies near zero.
The crossing potential models accurately capture the general shape of the activation energy versus HAE trends in Figure 3. Some deviations from the trendlines appear because activation energies depend not only on bond-making and -breaking shown by crossing potentials but also on additional attractive radical–radical or dispersive van der Waals interactions between reacting species in the reactant and the product state, as shown recently. (35) The functional form of the dependence of activation energies on the reaction energies derived from such crossing potential models are analogous to the activation energy term in Marcus theory, (62) which accounts for the curvatures neglected in linear BEP relations. (35) Predictions from such models are also consistent with Hammond’s postulate that more exothermic reactions occur via earlier transition states that are more reactant-like (Scheme 3b). (63) The small C–H bond elongation at early transition states, in turn, leads to activation energies insensitive to bond strengths.
For the C–H activation steps shown in Scheme 2 and the corresponding activation energies in Figure 3, the final state reaction energy is given by the summation of the C–H BDE in Table 2 and HAE in Table 1. The C–H BDE in C3H8 and C3H6 are larger than negative of the HAE of all abstractors except the OH radical. As a result, these reactions are endothermic for these weaker abstractors and highly exothermic for the OH radicals. As the reactions become less endothermic, the transition states appear earlier along the reaction coordinate and become less sensitive to bond strength. The DFT-derived bond-lengths of the transition states are shown in the Supporting Information, and they indeed exhibit shorter C–H and longer H–O bonds for more exothermic reactions (Figure S15). For OH radicals, the reaction is very exothermic, and the transition states are very early, leading to nearly complete insensitivity to bond strength and suppression of high reactivity for the weaker bonds. For weak C–H bonds in C3H7 radicals, the reaction is exothermic and is mediated by early transition states for both strong and weak abstractors which leads several abstractors with near-zero activation energies (Figure 3). Thus, both calculated activation energies and fundamental conceptual assessments of the bond activation process point to the importance of OH radicals in selectively activating strong C–H bonds.
These analyses establish that (i) OH radicals can be generated from redox catalytic routes consisting of NOx reduction oxidation steps reported in many past studies on NOx-mediated hydrocarbon oxidations, (ii) OH radicals are very strong H-abstractors that activate strong C–H bonds in C3H8 at rates several orders of magnitude higher than any other reactive species, which makes them the predominant C3H8 activating species even when they are present at lower concentrations than other species, (iii) weak C–H bonds in C3H7 radicals do not require strong H-abstractors and can be activated by NO2 and O2, with O2 being more abundant, and (iv) OH radicals can improve selectivity by dampening the preference exhibited by all other abstractors for activating C3H6 over C3H8.
Next, we combine these insights with additional steps for consumption of OOH radicals and the role of H2O in OH radical generation and use DFT calculations to assess energies of steps in a proposed reaction network for C3H8 activation in NOx-mediated routes.
3.4. Role of H2O and Alternative OH Radical Generation Paths
Scheme 4 shows more complete steps involved in NOx-mediated catalytic mechanism for OH radical generation and C3H8 activation. Electronic energies, enthalpies, and Gibbs free energies derived from DFT calculations for the steps in this mechanism are shown in Table 3. NO2 formation via NO–O2 reaction is highly exothermic, but its stoichiometry leads to fewer products than reactants, which results in entropy loss and slightly positive Gibbs free energies (22 kJ mol–1, step 1, Table 3; ΔG = ΔH – TΔS). The mildly endoergic nature of this step (i.e., slightly positive ΔG) suggests that it will form a small but significant concentration of NO2 to reach equilibrium. Higher O2 concentrations push this equilibrium toward the NO2 product. C3H7 radicals donate a H-atom to NO2 to form HONO and C3H6 (step 2 in Scheme 4) because this step was found to be facile based on calculated C–H activation energies in Figure 3; this step is also highly exothermic and exoergic. The OH radical formation by HONO dissociation (step 3) is highly endothermic but only mildly endoergic due to entropy gain from the formation of two molecules from one (ΔG = +12 kJ mol–1, step 3, Table 3). The OH radical activates C3H8 to form the C3H7 radical and H2O, in highly facile exothermic and exoergic steps (step 4). The C3H7 radical activates an O2 molecule to form a OOH radical (step 5), which is also facile. This OOH radical can react with NO to form NO2 and OH radical (step 6), which is much more facile than NO oxidation by O2 (step 1). Previous kinetic simulations have shown that step 6 can lead to rapid NO oxidation, forming NO2 in greater concentrations than the equilibrium value for step 1. (19) These details show that NOx can catalyze OH radical generation and C3H8 activation in a series of facile steps.

H2O enhances C3H8 conversion in C3H8–O2 reaction and does so to a much greater extent for NOx-catalyzed reactions than reactions without NOx (Figure 2). These enhancements are consistent with the role of water in generating OH radicals in molten salt catalysts and the facile reactions of NOx to form HONO even at room temperature. (64) The HONO formation via the NO–NO2–H2O reaction is exothermic and moderately endoergic at the reaction temperature (step 7, Scheme 4 and Table 3, ΔH = −35 kJ mol–1, ΔG = +53 kJ mol–1, 773 K), suggesting formation of small but significant concentrations of HONO using high H2O pressures to push equilibrium toward products. DFT calculations for this reaction are shown in Figure S22. These calculations show that NO, NO2, and H2O form a trimolecular complex and form HONO via a transition state with negative electronic activation relative to isolated molecules. Lower temperatures lead to a less exoergic nature of this step due to lesser contribution of entropy loss to free energy. The HONO molecules then dissociate to form OH radicals (step 3). Another step involving HONO and HONO2 from NO2 and H2O is shown in Table 3 (step 8). This step is also mildly endoergic and suggests another route to a species that dissociates to form OH radicals. This reaction was also found to be facile in experiments reported in the literature. (65,66) Thus, several steps involved in catalytic redox cycles of NOx generate OH radicals (Scheme 4). These radicals can also be quenched to form O2 and H2O (step 9, Table 3), which leads to low concentration of these radicals. This highly potent nature of these radicals leads to enhanced C3H8 activations even at these low concentrations. Formation of such abstractors without NOx would require direct initial alkane activation on O2, which has very high activation energies (Figure 3, Scheme 2). NOx facilitates OH radical generation at moderate temperature by forming stable NOx-derived species that enhance OH radical formation at moderate temperature. At finite C3H8 conversions organic species other than C3H8 exist in the reaction mixture, including alkenes and oxygenate formed as minor products. Plausible steps for formation of these products and some activation energies from experimental measurements of these steps reported in the literature are shown in Schemes S1,2 and Table S5. These products also contain weak C–H bonds and can promote H-abstraction by NO2 to further enhance concentrations of HONO and OH radicals, as shown via experiments and kinetic simulations for HCHO formations in CH4–O2–NOx reactions. (18,19,22−24,27)
Next, we compare reaction rates and selectivity in this NOx-mediated OH radical based reactions with V2O5 catalysts to assess the effect of abstractor strength on rates and selectivity.
4. Differences in Rates and Selectivity between NOx-Mediated Pathways and V2O5 Catalysts
C3H8 activation on vanadium-based oxide catalysts occurs via MvK redox cycles, where lattice oxygen species shown in Table 2 (V═O* species) act as predominant H-abstractors. C–H activations at these sites lead to reduced centers existing as OH pairs or as O-vacancies formed by dihydroxylations at OH pairs. These reduced centers are reoxidized by rapid O2 activations to restore the V═O* sites. The rapid nature of the reoxidation steps leads to most of the catalyst existing as V═O* and nearly fixed number of these abstractors at different reaction conditions. (1,42,67) In contrast, the NOx-mediated cycles lead to OH radicals as predominant abstractors of strong C–H bonds in C3H8. The concentration of these abstractors varies with reaction conditions due to changes in concentrations of sacrificial H-atom donors to NO2 (step 2 in Schemes 1 and 4) and presence of H2O (step 7 in Scheme 4). These differences influence how change in C3H8 conversion via changing residence time affects reaction rates in the two types of reactions. Figure 4 shows C3H8 activation rates and product selectivity as a function of C3H8 conversion for different flow rates (30–150 cm3 min–1) in an empty reactor with 0.005 kPa NO and on a V2O5 catalyst without NO at identical temperature and reactant pressures (773 K, 3 kPa C3H8, 10 kPa O2). Rates on V2O5 decreased slightly with increased conversion (Figure 4a), consistent with the inhibition of C–H activation by products such as H2O via their adsorption on active lattice oxygens. (67) In contrast, the C3H8 activation rates in NOx-promoted homogeneous reactions increased with conversion, suggesting a corresponding increase in the concentration of OH radical species that abstract H-atoms from alkanes. (19)

(a) C3H8 activation rates and (b) selectivity to alkenes, CO, and CO2 as a function of C3H8 conversion, in 12 cm3 empty reactor with 0.005 kPa NO (closed symbols) and on V2O5 catalyst without NO (open symbols) (773 K, 3 kPa C3H8, 10 kPa O2, 30–150 cm3 min–1). The balance selectivity corresponds to C1–C3 oxygenates shown in Figure S7. Dashed curves represent best-fits to the form of eq 2.
The homogeneous and heterogeneous systems also exhibit large differences in selectivity trends (Figure 4b), which can be interpreted using the likely sequence of product formation shown in Scheme 5. The selectivity to C3H6 product at zero conversion represents the fraction of primary C3H8 activations that branch to this product. The decrease in C3H6 selectivity with increasing conversion represents sequential conversion of C3H6 to secondary products (Scheme 5a). A balance over the moles of products, when their formation rates can be represented by lumped first-order rate constants for parallel conversions of C3H8 (k1, k2, Scheme 5a) and sequential conversion of C3H6 (k3), lead to selectivity at zero conversion (SC3H60) given by derivations in Section S8.1: (68)

and the selectivity (SC3H6) at finite conversions (XC3H8) given by

Regression of SC3H6 data in Figure 4b to the form of eqs 1 and 2 provides rate-constant-ratios that represent numerical descriptors of the selectivity trends, where smaller k2/k1 and k3/k1 values represent higher selectivity at zero conversion and weaker selectivity decrease with increasing conversion, respectively.
Scheme 5
Scheme 5. Products Formed in Oxidative Conversion of C3H8 via (a) All, (b) Secondary, and (c) Primary •C3H7 Radicals
For the data shown in Figure 4, the k3/k1 values are much smaller in NOx-mediated reactions than on V2O5 (2.1 ± 0.19 and 56.7 ± 0.8 for NOx and V2O5, respectively), suggesting that lattice O-atoms of V2O5 favor sequential reactions of C3H6 (k3) over primary C3H8 activations (k1) more than the radicals generated in NOx-based pathways. These details are consistent with the weaker allylic C–H bond in C3H6 (bond dissociation enthalpy, BDE, 411 and 363 kJ mol–1 for CH3CH2CH3 and CH2CHCH3, respectively;Table 2), the preference of lattice oxygens to activate these weaker bonds (Figure 3) or form C–O bonds in alkenes, and the ability of strong abstractors to dampen such preference due to formation of early C–H activation transition states (as shown in Scheme 3 and Figure 3).
The NOx-mediated reactions exhibit larger k2/k1 values than V2O5 (0.23 ± 0.01 and 0.08 ± 0.01, respectively, for data in Figure 4) and form significant amounts of C2H4 at zero conversion, instead of CO and CO2 (Figure 4b). On the basis of the atomic connectivity in the radicals, the C2H4 products can form via C–C bond cleavage in primary •CH2CH2CH3 radicals (69,70) but not in the more stable secondary CH3•CHCH3 radicals resulting from C3H8 activations (Scheme 5b,c; BDE: 422 and 411 kJ mol–1 for CH3CH2CH3 and CH3CH2CH3, respectively, Table 2). Weaker abstractors such as lattice V═O* species in V2O5 prefer to activate weaker C–H bonds at a much higher rate (Figure 3) and, therefore, form predominantly CH3•CHCH3 radicals that cannot crack to form C2H4. The •CH2CH2CH3 radical formation in NOx-mediated homogeneous reactions shows that the OH radicals generated in these routes activate both weak and strong C–H bonds in C3H8 and generate both primary and secondary radicals, which is consistent with the dampening of bond-strength discrimination by OH radicals. The C2H4 selectivity remains near 10% in Figure 4b, which suggests that not all C3H7 radicals formed are primary •CH2CH2CH3 radicals and not all of them crack to give C2H4. A majority of the radicals formed are either CH3•CHCH3 or •CH2CH2CH3 radicals that proceed via dehydrogenation or O-insertion pathways to form oxygenates, with minority cracking products forming from the primary radicals. In contrast, the O-atoms in V2O5 only activate the weaker secondary C–H bond in C3H8 to form the secondary radical, which leads to higher C3H6 selectivity at zero conversion and lower k2/k1 values. Thus, the formation of C2H4 is an important evidence of the involvement of strong abstractors such as •OH radicals in the homogeneous reactions.
The formation of C2H4 via C–C cleavage in primary •CH2CH2CH3 radicals also results in •CH3 radicals (Scheme 5c). These radicals can either form C–O bonds with the O-atom containing gaseous species or couple with other •CH3 radicals to form C2H6, and C2H4 upon further dehydrogenation. The coupling of radicals can be tested using ratios of carbon moles in C2 hydrocarbons to C1 products, which should be less than two if no coupling occurred and some C2H4 molecules formed in C–C cleavage steps oxidized further to C1 products. The measured C2 hydrocarbons to C1 product ratios are, however, much greater than two at low residence times, suggesting that significant coupling of •CH3 radicals does occur despite low concentrations of these radicals (details in Section S6 and Figure S9). In contrast, direct coupling products of a primary C3H7 radical with another C3H7 radical or cross coupling with CH3 radical is not observed. These details are analyzed further by examining the reactive preferences for primary C3H7 and CH3 radicals via plausible steps shown in Scheme 6 and electronic energy, enthalpy, and free energy of these steps in Table 4.

The cracking of primary radicals •CH2CH2CH3 is endothermic but highly exoergic (step 1, Table 4 and Scheme 6), due to entropy gain from the formation of two species from one. This step becomes even more exoergic if radical concentrations are lower than the arbitrary low concentration chosen in Table 4 and if temperatures are higher. In contrast, the coupling steps from propyl radicals (steps 2 and 3, Table 4, Scheme 6) are highly endothermic, but they require entropy loss from formation of a single product to form two species present in very low concentrations, which lead to more free energy penalty for lower pressures and higher temperatures. H-abstraction from primary C3H7 radicals is also favored by enthalpy and free energy (step 4, Table 4), and it is very facile with slightly negative electronic activation energy (Figure 3; Figure S14). In contrast to radical coupling, this step also involves reaction of a radical present in low concentrations with an O2 molecule fed at a much higher concentration leading to a much lower entropy penalty and higher rate compared to coupling reactions with near-zero activation energy but an entropy penalty to bring two species of low concentrations together. These details suggest that, when propyl radicals are present at low concentrations, its cracking and dehydrogenation by O2 will be preferred over coupling reactions.
In contrast to propyl radicals, methyl radicals contain only one C atom and its reactions must involve coupling or reactions with O2 (Scheme 6). The electronic energies and free energies in Table 4 show that the coupling of two methyl radicals (step 5) is more favorable than the coupling of two propyl radicals of the cross-coupling (steps 2,3) at the same concentration of all radicals. In contrast, the reactions of methyl radicals with O2 are much less favorable (steps 6, 7) than such reactions for propyl radicals (step 4). The free energy difference between coupling of two propyl radicals and two methyl radicals is even more positive than the corresponding electronic energies (electronic energy and free energy difference +20 and +45 kJ mol–1, respectively, in steps 3 and 5; similar differences exist but are less prominent for cross-coupling). The enthalpy and entropy contributions to these differences are shown in Section S14. The coupling of radicals is highly exothermic, suggesting that it likely proceeds via early transition states with insignificant enthalpy barriers. The Gibbs free energy for activation, however, also involves entropy contributions. The •CH2CH2CH3 radicals exhibit significantly greater rotational entropy than •CH3 radicals leading to more significant entropy loss in the longer chain radicals because of the coupling. This greater entropy loss leads to higher Gibbs free energy and lower coupling preference for •CH2CH2CH3 for both self-coupling and cross-coupling because the molecule must align at the transition states to undergo coupling. The secondary propyl radicals are also formed as shown in Scheme 5b, but these species cannot crack and exhibit weaker coupling preferences than primary radials, resulting in their contributions only to dehydrogenation or O-insertion events. Thus, these energies confirm that methyl radicals have significantly greater preference for coupling over other preferences favored by propyl radicals, consistent with measured selectivity for C2/C1 products and lack of observed C6 and C4 products, which was also observed recently for boron nitride catalysts. (71)
The residence time effects highlight significant differences between reactions at lattice O-atoms and the pathways mediated by strong gas-phase H-abstractors. Next, we further probe these differences by examining the effect of reactant pressures on rates and selectivity.
5. Effects of Reactant Pressures on Rates and Selectivity
The effect of O2 pressure on C3H8 activation rates in the 12 cm3 quartz reactor at different temperatures is shown in Figure 5a (773, 788, and 798 K; 60 cm3 min–1, 0.005 kPa NO, 3 kPa C3H8, 1–15 kPa O2). At each of these temperatures, rates increase with O2 pressure at pressures less than 5 kPa O2 but become nearly insensitive to O2 pressure at higher pressures. Figure 5b shows product selectivities as a function of conversion for different O2 pressures at 798 K. Higher O2 pressures lead to higher C3H6 selectivity and correspondingly lower C2H4 selectivity, such that the sum of C3H6 and C2H4 selectivity remains nearly independent of O2 pressure (Figure 5b; 798 K). The slopes of trend-lines for the effect of conversion on selectivity are affected less significantly by O2 pressures than the intercepts. These results suggest that higher O2 pressures increase the C3H8 activation rates slightly (Figure 5a) and exhibit only small effects on the rates of activation of C3H6 relative to C3H8 greatly (k3/k1 values indicated by slopes of dashed curves in Figure 5b). Instead, the most significant effect of O2 involves altering the branching between C–H activation and C–C bond cleavage in primary •CH2CH2CH3 radicals (steps represented by constants k1″ and k2,1″ in Scheme 5c). These primary radicals are unstable and undergo a second C–H activation to form C3H6 even by weak abstractors such as O2 (Figure 3). Higher O2 pressures increase the rate of this bimolecular C–H activation over monomolecular C–C cleavage. Such results are counterintuitive in the light of attempts to improve selectivity on oxide catalysts by staging the O2 feed to maintain low O2 concentrations. They also present opportunities for increasing C3H6 yields beyond values reported here using O2 pressures much higher than that required by reaction stoichiometry.

(a) C3H8 activation rates as a function of O2 pressure at a 60 cm3 min–1 flow rate and at 773, 788, and 798 K, and (b) alkene selectivity as a function of conversion for 30–100 cm3 min–1 flow rates at 798 K and 1, 3, and 10 kPa O2 (0.005 kPa NO, 3 kPa C3H8, 12 cm3 reactor). Dashed curves represent best-fits to the form of eq 2.
The effect of C3H8 pressure on C3H8 activation rates in a 12 cm3 quartz reactor at different temperatures is shown in Figure 6a (773, 788, and 798 K; 60 cm3 min–1, 0.005 kPa NO, 0.6–11 kPa C3H8, 10 kPa O2). C3H8 activation rates exhibit a supra-linear increase with C3H8 pressure, suggesting that higher alkane concentrations increase concentrations of OH radicals that activate alkanes because more sacrificial species for activating NO2 (step 2, Schemes 1 and 4) and more H2O is present at a given conversion when the alkane pressure is higher. Figure 6b shows that C3H6 and C2H4 selectivities remain nearly independent of C3H8 pressure above 3 kPa at 798 K.
Figure 6

(a) C3H8 activation rates as a function of C3H8 pressure at 60 cm3 min–1 flow rate, 773, 788 and 798, and (b) alkene selectivity as a function of conversion for 20–150 cm3 min–1 at 798 K, 0.6–12 kPa C3H8 (0.005 kPa NO, 10 kPa O2, 12 cm3 reactor). Dashed curves represent best-fits to the form of eq 2.
The effect of H2O pressure from H2O cofed with reactants and formed from C3H8–O2 conversions on rates and selectivity are shown in Figure 7. The reaction rates increase significantly with added H2O pressure (Figure 7a), as also shown by increasing conversions in Figure 2. The rate enhancements by added H2O are much more significant at higher temperature (Figure 7a; 773 and 798 K, 30 cm3 min–1, 0.005 kPa NO, 0–10 kPa H2O, 3 kPa C3H8, 10 kPa O2). H2O formed from the reaction shifts the trends only slightly, and the nonzero intercepts in these trends suggest that rate enhancement form NOx catalysis, which is further enhanced by H2O. These results are consistent with the role of H2O in forming HONO from NO and NO2 in proposed mechanisms (Schemes 1 and 4), and the facile nature of these steps reported form experimental studies in literature. (65,66)Figure 7b shows product selectivities as a function of conversion for added H2O pressures at 798 K. The C3H6 and C2H4 selectivities remain nearly independent of added H2O (Figure 7b).

Dashed curves represent best-fits to the form of eq 2.
These effects of reactant pressures deviate significantly from ODH reactions on oxide catalysts that involve MvK cycles with rate-limiting C–H activation at lattice O-atoms of oxides and fast O2 activation. (41) Such mechanisms invariably exhibit a first-order dependence on alkane pressure and zero-order dependence on O2 pressure. (1,72−75) The ODH rates in MvK cycles show a small decrease in rates with H2O pressures due to its adsorption at active sites. (1,67) The results in NOx-mediated reactions (Figures 5–7) and their deviations from heterogeneous reactions on oxides are also observed in trends reported recently for boron nitride (6,11) and previously for systems in which catalysts generate radicals for homogeneous reactions; (5) they likely originate here from higher concentrations of •OH species in NOx-mediated routes at higher alkane, O2, and H2O pressures (Schemes 1 and S3; Supporting Information).
The C3H6 selectivity data as a function of conversion for the different reactant pressures and reaction temperatures shown in Figures 5–7 and Figure S11 are regressed to the form of eq 2 to determine rate constant ratios, which are shown as a function of reactant pressures and reciprocal temperature in Figures 8 and 9, respectively. These data are used to summarize the effect of reactant pressure on selectivity and derive activation energy differences relevant to selectivity via effects of temperature on the ratios.

Figure 8 shows the rate constant ratios as a function of reactant pressures. C3H8 and H2O pressures do not have significant effects on k2/k1 values (Figure 8a). Higher O2 pressures lead to much smaller k2/k1 values, which correspond to lesser C–C cleavage and greater C3H6 selectivity (Figure 5b). These effects suggest that primary •C3H7 species responsible for C2H4 formation undergo C–H activation more preferentially than C–C activation when more O2 is present (Scheme 5c). The k3/k1 values are nearly unaffected by C3H8 or H2O pressures (Figure 8b) but decrease slightly (implying higher selectivity) at higher O2 pressure. These data suggest that using denser feeds with high alkane and H2O pressures will significantly enhance the rates (Figures 6a and 7a) and productivity (Table S2), while retaining high selectivity and yields. Furthermore, high O2 pressures can be used to decrease C2H4 selectivity and increase C3H6 selectivity to values higher than that shown here (Figure 5b).
6. Effect of Abstractor Strength on Activation Enthalpy Differences for Steps Involving C–H Bonds of Different Strengths
Figure 9 shows the rate constant ratios k2/k1 and k3/k1, representing selectivity for C3H6 formation over parallel and sequential reactions, respectively, as a function of reciprocal temperature for identical reactant pressures on V2O5 catalyst and in NOx-catalyzed reactions. NOx-mediated reactions exhibit larger k2/k1 values than V2O5 (Figure 9a) because generation of primary radicals leads to significant C–C bond cleavage, which results in high C2H4 selectivity at zero conversion (Figure 4b). The k3/k1 values are much larger in V2O5 than in NOx-mediated reactions because the latter reactions dampen the secondary reactions of C3H6 (Figure 9b).
The effects of temperature on rate constant ratios, at identical reactant pressures in Figure 9 (k2/k1, and k3/k1 at 0.005 kPa NO, 3 kPa C3H8, and 10 kPa O2), are expressed as activation enthalpy differences between the parallel or sequential undesired reactions and the C3H6 formation reaction using the following relations (details in section S8.2):

The values of activation enthalpy differences relevant to rate constant ratios k2/k1 (ΔΔH21 = ΔH2act – ΔH1act) and k3/k1 (ΔΔH31 = ΔH3act – ΔH1act) derived from slopes of regressed lines in Figure 9 are shown in Table 5.

aUncertainties represent the standard errors.
The rate constant ratios on the V2O5 catalyst decrease with increasing temperature (Figure 9), suggesting that the activation enthalpy for parallel and sequential undesired reactions are lower than the primary reaction in Scheme 5a (ΔΔH21 = −33 ± 34 kJ mol–1 and ΔΔH31 = −26 ± 1 kJ mol–1; Table 5). In contrast, NOx-mediated homogeneous reactions exhibit increasing k2/k1 values with temperature, which shows that the activation enthalpy for the C2H4 formation step is higher than for the C–H activation in C3H8 (ΔΔH21 = 15 ± 10 kJ mol–1; Table 5). The C2H4 formation step can only occur via C–C cleavage in primary •C3H7 radicals (Scheme 5c), suggesting that NOx reactions involve significant formation of such primary radicals, in spite of the stronger C–H bonds involved in forming these radicals (Table 2). The activation of primary and secondary C–H bonds in C3H8 cannot be differentiated from Figure 9, because the k1 values represent an ensemble average of all C–H activations occurring in C3H8. Therefore, the positive ΔΔH21 values indicate that the C–C bond cleavage in primary •C3H7 radical, which does not involve strong H-abstractors, has higher activation enthalpy than the C–H activation required to form this radical.
The k3/k1 values in NOx reactions are much lower than V2O5 and exhibit a much weaker temperature dependence (ΔΔH31 = −3 ± 3 and −26 ± 1 kJ mol–1 for NOx and V2O5, respectively; Table 5). The steps for C3H6 reactions involve kinetically relevant activation of weak allylic C–H bonds prior to C–O bond formation that leads to oxygenates. (49,76) Therefore, ΔΔH31 represents activation enthalpy differences for C–H activation in C3H6 and C3H8, and its negative values indicate that C3H6 activation is more facile due to weaker C–H bonds (Table 2). However, the ΔΔH31 values in NOx reactions are much closer to zero than V2O5, which means that the H-abstractors involved in NOx-mediated reactions can activate the two bonds with only slightly different rates despite the large difference in bond strength. This difference between C3H8 and C3H6 activation energies derived from DFT is described next for C–H activation using the H-abstractors of different strengths shown in Table 1.
Figure 10 shows the DFT-derived difference between electronic energies for C–H activation at a secondary C–H bond in C3H8 (BDE 411 kJ mol–1, Table 2) and an allylic C–H bond in C3H6 (BDE 363 kJ mol–1, Table 2) as a function of the HAE of H-abstractors. When the abstractor is weak (less negative HAE; e.g., NO in Table 1), the product state is less stable than the reactant. This scenario can be shown using a crossing potential for C–H cleavage and O–H formation, in which the product O–H potential is higher in energy than the reactant (inset in Figure 10). Such cases lead to high activation energies and the transition state represented by the crossing point of the potentials is “late” because it requires nearly full cleavage of the C–H bond and formation of the O–H bond. The lateness is to be confirmed by the structures and energies of transition states shown in Section S13. Such late transition states are highly sensitive to C–H bond strength, because the bond is nearly broken at the transition state. As a result, the C–H activation energy is very different in the stronger C3H8 C–H bond and the weaker C3H6 C–H bond. However, when the abstractor is strong (more negative HAE; e.g., OOH and OH in Table 1), the product state potential shifts to lower energies and leads to “early” transition states. Very early transition states do not involve significant C–H bond stretching and are insensitive to the C–H bond strength, leading to small differences between activation energy for strong and weak bonds in Figure 10. Thus, the DFT-derived energies confirm that strong abstractors would lead to improvement in selectivity by suppression of bond-strength effects. Notably, the activation energy difference is fairly significant for V2O5 O-atoms (+32 kJ mol–1, Figure 10), and even for OOH radicals (+17 kJ mol–1, Figure 10), suggesting that only OH radicals, the strongest abstractor among those shown in Figure 10, can account for the ΔΔH31 values near zero in the measured data (ΔΔH31 = −3 ± 3 kJ mol–1, Table 5).

Thus, we conclude that the generation of OH radicals for C–H activation and the dampening of bond-strength discrimination by such strong abstractors lead to high selectivity and yield for alkenes. The OH radicals generated in NOx-mediated reaction paths abstract both primary and secondary C–H bonds in C3H8. The primary alkyl radicals can undergo C–C bond cleavage, which leads to significant C2H4 formation in addition to the dehydrogenation product C3H8. The yields attained in this process are shown in Table S1 and Figure S1, along with yields reported in the literature. At 798 K, 24% maximum C3H6 yield was attained, and the corresponding maximum alkene (C3H6 + C2H4) and alkene + C3-oxygenates yields are 43% and 47%, respectively. An important consequence of strong abstractors and the low activation energy differences is that the yields are quite insensitive to temperature. As a result, the C3H6 yields >22% are attained even at temperatures much lower than previously reported in any other systems (723 K, Figure S1). These lower temperature conditions lead to a lower fraction of C2H4 (combined C3H6+C2H4 yield 31%) with a greater fraction of additional valuable C3 oxygenate products that are not observed in other systems. The lower C–C cleavage at lower temperature (k2/k1, Figure 9) corresponds to increased fractions of C3 oxygenate (Figure S1) without affecting C3H6 yields and leads to a combined alkene and C3 oxygenate yields of 40% at 723 K.
The NOx mediation can also enhance other reactions limited by C–H bond activation. Examples of such reactions shown in Section S15 include: (i) C2H6 dehydrogenation with high C2H4 selectivity and (ii) formation of C3 hydrocarbons via C–C coupling in C2H4–CH3OH–O2–NO reactions. Such facile C–H activations may also be useful for other reactions such as C–C coupling or oxygenate formations that require organic radical intermediates formed via rate-limiting C–H activation steps. (2,77−80)
7. Conclusions
NOx-mediated generation of OH radical species selectively activates strong C–H bonds in alkanes with high alkene productivity and yields at moderate temperatures by weakening the bond-strength-based discrimination of activation rates. The kinetic details and selectivity trends in these reactions resemble boron nitride and alkali promoted oxides that facilitate homogeneous reactions (5,6,13) but differ markedly from reactions at lattice oxygens of oxide catalysts. NOx helps overcome the high temperature requirements for the generation of OH radicals in alkali-based catalysts (5,34,45) and, in turn, produces alkyl radicals and dehydrogenated products more efficiently.
