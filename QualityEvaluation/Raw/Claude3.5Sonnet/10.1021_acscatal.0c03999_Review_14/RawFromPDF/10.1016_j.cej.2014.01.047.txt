Iron-based catalyst supported on sulfated alumina was proved to be highly active and selective in cata-
lytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. At 560 C, 20% propylene yield along with more than 80%
selectivity was obtained on 20Fe/5S–Al. It was demonstrated that sulfate species mainly existed in the
form of SO2

and interacted with Fe atoms via Fe–O–S bond, leading to enhanced acidity especially the
generation of Bronsted acids. Meanwhile, propane is more likely to adsorb on Fe species at the elec-
tron-deﬁcient state, resulting in higher activity. XPS and on-line MS results indicated the loss of sulfur
species in the form of SO2 was the main reason for the irreversible deactivation of catalysts.

1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of propane is an important route to produce
propylene. Currently, studies on propane dehydrogenation mainly
focus on two aspects: catalytic dehydrogenation and catalytic oxi-
dative dehydrogenation. Though both catalytic dehydrogenation
combining with membrane separation and catalytic oxidative
dehydrogenation can break the thermodynamic equilibrium either
by separating H2 in time or converting H2 to H2O, thus improving
the single pass conversion theoretically [1–3], there is still a long
way to go to realize commercial application. In the commercial
process of propane dehydrogenation, the reactor is still traditional
ﬁxed-bed, moving- bed or recycling ﬂuid-bed, and the catalyst can
be only selected from Cr-based catalysts and Pt-based catalysts. For
these catalysts, researchers are devoting to improving propylene
selectivity and catalyst stability, for example, reducing coking reac-
tion by adding alkali metals as promoters [4–7] or using new mate-
rials such as molecular sieve as supports [8–11]. However, the
severe pollution to environment of Cr-based catalysts and the high
cost of Pt-based catalysts are problems that defy solution. Thus, in
our opinion, the most important thing is to develop cheap and
environment-friendly catalysts in order to make full use of propane
dehydrogenation to produce propylene.
In comparison, iron oxide catalysts are a kind of pollution-free,
cheap, easily available material and have been widely used in

alkane dehydrogenation [12–19]. Among the studied catalysts, Fe/
ZSM-5 catalysts with low iron loading were highly active in N2O-
mediated propane dehydrogenation [15–17], exhibiting 20–65%
propane conversion. Though the stronger acidity of ZSM-5 favored
the activation and cleavage of C–H, it also brought about much side
reactions, such as cracking and oligomerization, resulting in low
selectivity and stability [20,21]. Therefore, many studies were fo-
cused on the application of zeolite-based catalysts with a high Si/
Al, but the activity was rather low [22].
Compared with ZSM-5, c-Al2O3 is believed to be an excellent
support with weaker acidity which can prevent the sintering of
iron. Michorczyk et al. found that Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 exhibited high
selectivity (85%) in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in spite
of low conversion (less than 10%) [23]. To our knowledge, little
work has been dedicated to improving the dehydrogenation per-
formance of Fe2O3/c-Al2O3 catalysts. Previous researchers have
shown that sulfation of silica has beneﬁcial effects on the activity
of Cr2O3/SiO2 in ethane dehydrogenation [24]. Herein, in this paper,
we evaluated the performance of sulfated alumina supported iron
catalyst in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane and correlated the
contribution of sulfate species to the different behavior. Mean-
while, the reasons for catalyst deactivation were also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Supports
Sulfated alumina support was prepared as follows: ﬁrstly, pseu-
do boehmite, deionized water and hydrochloric acid with a mass
ratio of 10:30:1 were mixed and placed in a water bath at 65 C un-
til the pH value reached 3–4, meanwhile, the sol formed. Then a
certain amount of ammonium sulfate (5 wt%) was added and stir-
red for 2 h, followed by drying at 120 C for 4 h and calcinating at
700 C for 2 h under air atmosphere. The obtained sulfated support
was denoted as 5S–Al.
2.1.2. Catalysts
Supported iron catalysts were prepared by the common
impregnation method using aqueous solution of iron (III) nitrate.
The investigated loading of Fe2O3 was 20 wt%. After impregnation,
the samples were dried at 120 C for 4 h and calcinated at 700 C
for 2 h under air atmosphere. The obtained catalysts were referred
to as 20FeAl and 20 Fe/5S–Al.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max RB diffractom-
eter operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, using Cu Ka radiation with a
scanning speed of 10 C/min.
TG-DTA analysis was performed on DTU-2A differential ther-
mogravimetric analyzer. The catalyst (about 30 mg) was placed
in a crucible using Al2O3 as reference. The temperature was raised
from 20 C to 550 C at a rate of 10 C/min.
FT-IR spectra were determined on Nicolet Nexus Fourier trans-
form instrument. The background spectrum and the infrared spec-
trum of chemisorbed pyridine were recorded at 200 C.
The surface area and pore structure were measured by N2
adsorption–desorption
method
at
77 K
using
QUDRASORB
multi-functional adsorption apparatus. Prior to the measurement,
the samples were degassed at 300 C for 4 h to ensure complete re-
moval of the adsorbed moisture.
C3H8-TPD
experiment
was
carried
out
in
the
following
procedure. 0.1 g catalyst of 0.3–0.9 mm diameter was heated under
helium ﬂow (30 mL/min) from room temperature to 500 C and
maintained for 1 h. After cooling down to 100 C, C3H8 adsorption
was carried out for 30 min. Then the catalysts were swept with he-
lium until removed the physically adsorbed C3H8, and ﬁnally the
desorption step was performed from 100 C to 450 C at a heating
rate of 10 C/min. Temperature-programmed reduction experi-
ment (H2-TPR) by 10% H2/N2 (30 mL/min) in the temperature range
of 80–800 C and on-line MS analysis of reaction products were
conducted on the same apparatus. The mass numbers of 2, 18,
34, 64, 44 and 41 were used for H2, H2O, H2S, SO2, CO2 and C3H6.
XPS studies were conducted using an ESCALab250 electron
spectrometer from Thermo Scientiﬁc Corporation with monochro-
matic 150 W Al Ka radiation. The binding energy measurement
was referenced to Al (2p) at 74.7 eV.
2.3. Catalyst test
The catalytic performance was measured under atmospheric
pressure at 560 C in a ﬁxed-bed reactor, where 2 g catalyst was
loaded. Prior to reaction, the catalyst was pretreated in ﬂowing
nitrogen
to
remove
adsorbed
water.

of
98.7 mol% propane and 1.3 mol% propylene was introduced into
the reactor at a ﬂow rate of 12 mL/min.
The product was analyzed by Bruker GC-450 chromatography.

The reaction–regeneration cycles were carried out in the fol-
lowing form: reaction at 560 C for 6 h, regeneration under air
atmosphere at 700 C for 1 h.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic performance of supported iron catalysts
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane was ﬁrst conducted
over 20FeAl and 20Fe/5S–Al catalysts and the results were shown
in Fig. 1. It is interesting to note that for 20FeAl, propane conver-
sion decreased signiﬁcantly while propylene yield increased in
the ﬁrst 0.75 h, subsequently, the conversion along with the yield
of methane began to increase without any formation of propylene.
Besides, a certain amount of oxidation products COx were also de-
tected (Fig. S1), indicating that propane can be oxidized by the lat-
tice oxygen of iron oxide, which is in accordance with previous
research [25]. With the extension of the reaction, the lattice oxygen
was fast consumed as evidenced by the dramatically decreased
amount of COx to almost nill after seventy minutes. According to
XRD results (Fig. S2), after reaction for 2 h, Fe2O3 almost disap-
peared accompanied by the appearance of Fe. Thus, the obvious
change in the product distribution could be attributed to the vari-
ation of active species participating in the reaction.
Compared with 20FeAl, much higher conversion and propylene
yield (about 20%) with more than 80% selectivity were obtained
over 20Fe/5S–Al. Meanwhile, propylene had always been the main
product. These results well suggested that sulfation of support sig-
niﬁcantly improved the catalytic behavior of 20FeAl. Moreover,
146
Y.-n. Sun et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 244 (2014) 145–151
signiﬁcant differences were found in the MS signals of oxidation
products. Fewer amount of COx were observed in the initial stage,
which decreased much lower with TOS. The textural properties of
supports and catalysts were also measured and tabulated in
Table S1. After sulfation, the surface area of Al2O3 decreased from
181.6 m2/g to 156.5 m2/g, however, there was little change in the
surface area and pore structure of catalysts, suggesting that the
sulfated support is more favorable to the dispersion of iron oxide
which is consistent with the weakened Fe2O3 phase shown in
XRD patterns. Besides, the calculated average particle sizes of
Fe2O3 from the XRD line broadening using Scherrer equation of
20FeAl and 20Fe/5S–Al were 37.2–25.1 nm respectively. Based on
these results, it was concluded that sulfation of support could
effectively suppress the aggregation of iron oxide, thus inhibiting
the oxidation reaction caused by the oxidation property of iron
species.
3.2. Effect of reaction–regeneration cycles on the catalytic
performance of 20Fe/5S–Al
According to Section 3.1, the activity of 20Fe/5S–Al gradually
declined with prolonged reaction time. After 38 h, only 8.5% pro-
pylene yield was retained, indicating a low reaction stability. Fur-
thermore, the effect of reaction–regeneration cycles was also
studied. As shown in Fig. 2, the activity decreased signiﬁcantly
with the increased cycles. After one cycle, propane conversion de-
creased from 24.7% to 22.6% while propylene yield from 20.0% to
18.8% (TOS = 1 h), which maintained at around 16.6% and 14.8%
respectively after six cycles. Based on these results, it was believed
that in addition to carbon deposition, there was another reason
contributing to catalyst deactivation. XRD results showed that
Fe2O3 almost disappeared with the formation of a small quantity
of Fe3O4 after six cycles, suggesting an irreversible reduction pro-
cess during the reaction. Consequently, we may speculate that
the irreversible reduction of iron species was responsible for the
declined dehydrogenation activity.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effect of acidity on the catalytic performance
As described in Section 3.1, sulfation of alumina produced a
notably positive effect on propane conversion and propylene yield.
In a previous paper, Wang et al. found similar results in ethane
dehydrogenation over Cr/SiO2 catalyst, and attributed the in-
creased activity to enhanced acidity [24].
The FT-IR spectra (shown in Fig. 3) of Al2O3 only exhibited a
strong band at around 1450 cm1 attributed to the chemisorption
of pyridine on Lewis acid sites [26–29]. On the contrary, Bronsted
acid sites proportional to the area under BPy band at 1540 cm1
was observed over 5SAl. According to Yao et al., SO3 can react with
the hydroxyl on the surface of Al2O3 and give rise to two kinds of
Bronsted acids, which can be ascribed to two different acid hydro-
xyl groups including bridging hydroxyl groups (S–OH–Al) and ter-
minal hydroxyl groups attached to S atom (S–OH). For 20Fe/5S-Al,
lower amount of Bronsted acid sites were retained because of the
loss of sulfur species at high calcination temperature (700 C). After
10 h of reaction, Bronsted acidity almost disappeared with a

reduced amount of total acid sites, while after 38 h, only burr peaks
without any obvious band assigned to adsorption of pyridine on
acid centers were observed, which was consistent with the de-
creased activity with TOS. Thus, it could be concluded that the
strengthened acid property caused by sulfate species was partly
responsible for the higher catalytic activity of 20Fe/5S–Al.
4.2. Role of sulfate species
In comparison with 20FeAl, 20Fe/5S–Al was proved to be highly
active and selective for the production of propylene via propane
dehydrogenation. In addition to enhanced acidity, it was believed
that sulfation of support could effectively inhibit the rapid
consumption of lattice oxygen, conﬁrming the important role of
reducibility provided by the iron species in improving the dehydro-
genation performance [26–28].
From H2-TPR proﬁles (Fig. 4), it was obvious that Fe2O3 can be
reduced at temperature higher than 350 C. When the temperature
rose to above 500 C, a broad peak followed by a non-ending peak
was observed. The shape of TPR pattern for 20FeAl was very similar
with pure Fe2O3, however, the low-temperature peak shifted to
higher temperature with a shoulder peak at about 300 C. These re-
sults indicated that there was a strong interaction between Fe2O3
and alumina leading to the stabilization of Fe2O3 phase and the
formation of FeAl2O4 during the ﬁrst step of reduction [23]. The
deposition of Fe2O3 on sulfated alumina signiﬁcantly changed the
behavior in the reduction process, the low-temperature peak ap-
peared at the same temperature with a small shoulder peak at
about 600 C, which can be attributed to the reduction from
Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 and from Fe3O4 to Fe as revealed by the composition
of the pre-reduced samples detected by XRD. Thus, it is deduced
that compared with 20FeAl, a larger amount of Fe3+ of 20Fe/5S–
Al catalysts were much easier to be reduced to Fe3O4, but more dif-
ﬁcult to be further reduced to low valence species such as Fe.
All in all, the different acidity and reducibility of 20Fe/5S–Al
catalyst was related to the introduction of sulfate species and the
details were depicted in Scheme 1. Due to the strong electron-
drawing ability of sulfate ion from a basic molecule, the adjacent
iron ion should be more electropositive, which strengthened the
Fe–O bond and made the oxygen more difﬁcult to be removed
[30,31].
To further verify above analysis, XPS characterization of Fe 2p
(Fig. 5) for 20FeAl and 20Fe/5S–Al was conducted. The Fe 2p3/2
peak appeared at 710.7 eV with its associated 3d ? 4s satellite
peak at 718.7 eV, indicating that Fe species were characteristic of
Fe3+ in Fe2O3, as proved by the spin–orbital splitting of 13.5 eV be-
tween Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks [32,33]. Besides, the band posi-
tion shifted to higher binding energy for 20Fe/5S–Al. In terms of
the screening by valence electrons, the lower the electron density,
the greater the electron binding energy [33], demonstrating that
there existed an electron transfer from Fe atoms.
As for propane dehydrogenation, it is supposed that the initial
adsorption of C3H8 on the active sites and subsequent C–H activa-
tion step played an important role in the reaction [34–37]. In view
of the signiﬁcantly improved catalytic performance, C3H8 adsorp-
tion–desorption experiment was also conducted (shown in Supple-
mentary Fig. S3). The adsorption quantity calculated with the area
of 1 mL propane pulse peak as the datum was tabulated in Table 1.
Both catalysts presented only one desorption peak suggesting
there was only one type of adsorption site for the activation of pro-
pane. After sulfation of alumina, the desorption peak shifted from
318 C to 379 C while the adsorption capacity increased from
0.011 mmol/g to 0.017 mmol/g. This can be attributed to that, for
one thing, the sulfation of support decreased the electron density
and caused Fe atoms being electropositive, since the secondary
carbon of propane has 0.051 negative charge, they are more likely
to adsorb; for another, the higher desorption temperature indi-
cated a lower adsorption activated energy for propane, all of which
were advantageous to the reaction.
From aforementioned results, it could be concluded that sulfa-
tion of alumina signiﬁcantly changed the electronic property of
the catalysts, leading to higher acidity and adsorption capacity of
propane, which were responsible for the high activity and selectiv-
ity in propane dehydrogenation.

4.3. Catalyst deactivation
Fig. 6 exhibits MS signals in reaction–regeneration cycles (re-
acted at 560 C for 20 min, then regenerated under air atmosphere
at 700 C for 20 min) over 20Fe/5S–Al. The release of SO2 together
with a small amount of oxygen was probably due to the reduction
of the sulfate group to sulﬁte group by propane followed by the
decomposition of the latter [38]. With the extended cycles, the
content of SO2 dramatically declined. In addition, more and more
carbon dioxide were generated in the process of regeneration
indicative of the formation of much carbon deposition. In addition,
the concentration of H2 showed a decreasing trend. TG-DTA results
also showed that the carbon deposition for 20FeAl after 4 h of reac-
tion was about 253 mg/gcat, while that of 20Fe/5S–Al after 10 h and
38 h were 13 mg/gcat and 106 mg/gcat respectively. From above re-
sults, we may conclude that sulfation of alumina could signiﬁ-
cantly inhibit coke formation. However, with extended reaction
or regeneration, sulfate species were released in the form of SO2.
XPS characterization was also conducted over fresh and regen-
erated 20Fe/5S–Al (shown in Fig. 7). The nature and number of sul-
fate species were deduced from the extraction of the two S 2p
components by ﬁtting the experimental photoelectron peaks lo-
cated at 169.7 and 168.5 eV. The major peak of fresh 20Fe/5S–Al
at 169.8 eV was assigned to S–O bond in SO2
4
species [32] while
the minor peak at 168.4 ± 0.1 eV has been attributed to the pres-
ence of SO2
3
species, in accordance with the fact that S 2p shift
observed between SO2
4
and SO2
3
species is about 1.5 ± 0.1 eV
[39]. The percentage areas of the two components (Table 2) indi-
cated that SO2
4
species were predominant on the surface. After

six reaction–regeneration cycles, only the peak at 168.5 eV with
much lower intensity was observed. Consequently, it could be
speculated that the loss of sulfate made great contribution to the
irreversible deactivation of 20Fe/5S–Al.
It is important to note that after six cycles, surface molar ratio of
Fe/Al also decreased. As XRD results showed, Fe2O3 almost disap-
peared with the formation of a certain amount of Fe3O4, suggesting
an irreversible reduction process during the reaction, which was
further conﬁrmed by the gradually decreased signal of H2O and
weakened reducibility. Based on the investigation in Section 4.2,
it was thought oxygen was easier to lose because of the weakened
Fe–O caused by the loss of sulfur species, resulting in the irrevers-
ible reduction of iron cations. In conclusion, not only sulfate groups
but also iron species played an important role in the reaction, and
loss of sulfate groups was the main reason for the irreversible
deactivation of 20Fe/5S–Al.
5. Conclusions
The present work demonstrates a new class of iron-based cata-
lysts for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, which are non-no-
ble, environment-friendly and of great potential. Alumina treated
with ammonium sulfate showed dramatically improved activity
and selectivity, 20% propylene yield along with more than 80%
selectivity was obtained over 20Fe/5S–Al, which was superior to
that of most catalysts reported previously.
FT-IR, XPS and on-line MS analysis were employed to study the
effect of sulfation on the catalytic performance. It was found that
the sulfate species mainly existed in the form of SO2
4
and inter-
acted with Fe species via Fe–O–S bond. In this structure, Fe trans-
ferred electron to S atom, thereby strengthening the Fe–O bond
and leading to the generation of Bronsted acids. Meanwhile, since
the secondary carbon of propane has 0.051 negative charges, they
are more likely to be adsorbed on the electron-deﬁcient state of Fe
species, all of which are in favor of excellent dehydrogenation
performance.
As for catalyst deactivation, the loss of sulfate ion and the
reduction of iron cations were believed to be the main reasons
for the irreversible deactivation of 20Fe/5S–Al. Therefore, the chal-
lenge for future study is the preservation of sulfur species.
