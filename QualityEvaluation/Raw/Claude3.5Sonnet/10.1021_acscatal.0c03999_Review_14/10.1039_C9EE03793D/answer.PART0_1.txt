[1] "4.2.1 ODH of light alkanes"

[2] "Compared to state-of-the-art chemical production technologies, we illustrate that chemical looping offers significant opportunities for process intensification and exergy loss minimization. In many cases, an order of magnitude reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emission can be realized without the needs for carbon dioxide capture."

[3] "Given the exciting opportunities offered by chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) and the emissions and energy demand in the current chemical production practice, the CLBC design principles and redox catalyst selection/optimization strategies covered in this article can provide useful information for researchers in the general areas of chemical looping, catalysis, particle technology, and process intensification."

The literature does not provide specific information about recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or comparisons of various catalyst systems. It also does not discuss challenges like corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation in ODHP processes.

The document only briefly mentions oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes as a topic, without providing details on propane specifically or recent advances. It does highlight that chemical looping offers opportunities for process intensification and reduced energy consumption and emissions in chemical production generally, which could potentially apply to ODHP processes. However, without more specific information, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be provided based solely on this literature.

该文献没有提供关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展或各种催化剂系统比较的具体信息。它也没有讨论诸如腐蚀性或改进ODHP过程中C-H键活化策略等挑战。

文档仅简要提到了轻烃的氧化脱氢(ODH)作为一个主题，但没有提供关于丙烷的具体细节或最新进展。它确实强调了化学循环为化学生产提供了过程强化和减少能源消耗和排放的机会，这可能适用于ODHP过程。然而，由于缺乏更具体的信息，仅基于这篇文献无法对该问题提供全面的回答。
