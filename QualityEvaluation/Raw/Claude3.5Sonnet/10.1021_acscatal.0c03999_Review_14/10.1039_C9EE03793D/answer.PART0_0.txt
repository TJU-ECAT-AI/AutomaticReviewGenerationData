[1] "4.2.1 ODH of light alkanes"

[2] "Given the exciting opportunities offered by chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) and the emissions and energy demand in the current chemical production practice, the CLBC design principles and redox catalyst selection/optimization strategies covered in this article can provide useful information for researchers in the general areas of chemical looping, catalysis, particle technology, and process intensification."

The given literature does not provide sufficient information to fully answer the question about recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. While the document mentions "ODH of light alkanes" as a subtopic, it does not go into specific details about catalyst systems, performance metrics, challenges, or future research directions for ODHP. The literature appears to be a broader overview of chemical looping beyond combustion (CLBC) and does not focus specifically on ODHP processes.

The document does suggest that CLBC principles and redox catalyst selection/optimization strategies could be useful for researchers in catalysis and process intensification, which may be relevant to ODHP research. However, without more specific information on ODHP in the given text, a comprehensive answer to the question cannot be provided based solely on this literature.

给定的文献没有提供足够的信息来全面回答关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展问题。虽然文档提到"轻烃的ODH"作为一个小主题，但它并没有深入探讨ODHP的具体催化剂系统、性能指标、挑战或未来研究方向。这篇文献似乎是对超越燃烧的化学循环(CLBC)的更广泛概述，并不专门针对ODHP工艺。

文档确实提出，CLBC原理和氧化还原催化剂选择/优化策略可能对催化和工艺强化领域的研究人员有用，这可能与ODHP研究相关。然而，由于给定文本中缺乏关于ODHP的更具体信息，仅基于这篇文献无法对该问题提供全面的回答。
