Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to the question based on the given literature. The provided text appears to be only a brief title and author information for a research article, without any content related to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), catalyst systems, or challenges in the field. To properly address the question, we would need access to the full text of the article or additional relevant literature on ODHP processes, catalyst performance, and current challenges in the field.

The provided literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the question about recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The text appears to be a partial citation or reference to an article titled "Selective CH Bond Activation via NOx-Mediated Generation of Strong H-Abstractors" published in ACS Catalysis. It does not provide any details about ODHP, catalyst systems, selectivity, conversion, challenges, or future research directions in this field. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the question based on the given literature.
