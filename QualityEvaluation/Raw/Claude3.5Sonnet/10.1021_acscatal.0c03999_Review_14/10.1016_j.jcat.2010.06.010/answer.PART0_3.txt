[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

The literature provides insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of catalysts with O2 and N2O as oxidizing agents.

Catalyst systems discussed include iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. The study focuses mainly on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts.

In terms of selectivity and conversion:
- N2O as an oxidant significantly improves propene selectivity compared to O2.
- With N2O, propene selectivity reached 80% at 10% propane conversion, compared to only 50% with O2.
- However, the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O was half that of O2.

The main challenges and areas for future research include:

1. Understanding and controlling the nature of active oxygen species:
   - O2 forms highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species (OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O).
   - N2O likely forms less reactive nucleophilic oxide ions.

2. Balancing activity and selectivity:
   - O2 provides higher activity but lower selectivity.
   - N2O offers higher selectivity but lower activity.

3. Improving C-H bond activation:
   - The study suggests that different oxygen species affect C-H bond activation differently.

4. Enhancing catalyst regenerability:
   - The slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

5. Optimizing reaction systems:
   - Further research is needed to combine the high activity of O2 with the high selectivity of N2O.

Future research should focus on developing catalysts and reaction systems that can achieve both high activity and high selectivity, possibly by controlling the formation and nature of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface.

文献提供了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，特别是比较了使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂的催化剂性能。

讨论的催化剂系统包括含铁沸石、大块钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。该研究主要集中在VOx/MCM-41催化剂上。

在选择性和转化率方面：
- 与O2相比，N2O作为氧化剂显著提高了丙烯的选择性。
- 使用N2O时，在10%的丙烷转化率下，丙烯选择性达到80%，而使用O2时仅为50%。
- 然而，使用N2O的丙烷转化频率只有使用O2时的一半。

主要挑战和未来研究领域包括：

1. 理解和控制活性氧物种的性质：
   - O2形成高活性的亲电氧物种（OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , 和 Vn+  O）。
   - N2O可能形成反应性较低的亲核氧化物离子。

2. 平衡活性和选择性：
   - O2提供更高的活性但选择性较低。
   - N2O提供更高的选择性但活性较低。

3. 改善C-H键活化：
   - 研究表明，不同的氧物种对C-H键活化的影响不同。

4. 提高催化剂再生能力：
   - 使用N2O时，还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。

5. 优化反应系统：
   - 需要进一步研究，以结合O2的高活性和N2O的高选择性。

未来的研究应该集中在开发能够同时实现高活性和高选择性的催化剂和反应系统，可能通过控制催化剂表面活性氧物种的形成和性质来实现。
