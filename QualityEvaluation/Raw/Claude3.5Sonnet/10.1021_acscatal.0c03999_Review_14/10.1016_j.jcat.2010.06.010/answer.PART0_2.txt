[1] "Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides and supported vanadium-containing materials"

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction, the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of N2O as an oxidizing agent instead of O2. Supported vanadium-containing materials, bulk vanadium oxides, and iron-containing zeolites have demonstrated improved propene selectivity when using N2O. The maximum propene yields reported have reached up to 25% with these materials.

The improved performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, leading to higher propene selectivity.

Comparing O2 and N2O as oxidants, O2 shows higher activity but lower propene selectivity. This is due to the formation of highly reactive species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O when using O2. These species react rapidly with both propane and propene, even at room temperature. In contrast, N2O does not form such highly reactive species, instead proceeding through nucleophilic oxide ions, which results in higher propene selectivity.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties. Key areas for future research and development should focus on:

1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance propane conversion.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to maintain long-term performance.
3. Renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, potentially by exploring new soft oxidants or catalyst designs that can balance activity and selectivity.
4. Further investigation into the mechanism of N2O-based ODHP to exploit its selectivity advantages while improving overall conversion rates.

These strategies aim to address the ongoing challenge of achieving high propene yields by balancing conversion and selectivity in ODHP processes.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了令人鼓舞的结果，尤其是使用N2O作为氧化剂代替O2。支持的含钒材料、体相钒氧化物和含铁沸石在使用N2O时表现出改善的丙烯选择性。据报道，这些材料的最大丙烯产率已达到25%。

N2O性能改善归因于还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程，从而提高了丙烯选择性。

比较O2和N2O作为氧化剂，O2显示出更高的活性但较低的丙烯选择性。这是由于使用O2时形成了高度活性的物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22和Vn+  O。这些物种即使在室温下也能快速与丙烷和丙烯反应。相比之下，N2O不形成这种高度活性的物种，而是通过亲核氧化物离子进行反应，这导致了更高的丙烯选择性。

ODHP的持续挑战包括腐蚀性和固有的反应特性。未来研究和开发的关键领域应关注：

1. 改善C-H键活化以提高丙烷转化率。
2. 增强催化剂的再生能力以保持长期性能。
3. 改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程，可能通过探索新的软氧化剂或可以平衡活性和选择性的催化剂设计。
4. 进一步研究基于N2O的ODHP机制，以利用其选择性优势，同时提高整体转化率。

这些策略旨在通过平衡ODHP过程中的转化率和选择性来解决获得高丙烯产率的持续挑战。
