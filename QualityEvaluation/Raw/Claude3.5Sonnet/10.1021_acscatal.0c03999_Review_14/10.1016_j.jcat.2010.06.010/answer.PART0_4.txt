[1] "Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene, high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]. Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of mesoporous silica materials containing highly dispersed surface VOx species. These catalysts have demonstrated maximum propene yields of up to 25%.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent instead of molecular oxygen has led to significant improvements in propene selectivity across various catalyst systems, including iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The enhanced performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, thereby improving selectivity.

When comparing O2 and N2O as oxidants, O2 shows higher activity but lower propene selectivity. This is likely due to the formation of highly reactive species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O. These species, particularly Vn+  O, have been experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and propene completely even at room temperature.

In contrast, N2O does not form these highly reactive species. Instead, the reaction with N2O probably proceeds through the participation of nucleophilic oxide ions, which contributes to the higher propene selectivity observed in ODHP reactions using N2O as the oxidant.

Persistent challenges in this field include the corrosiveness of the oxidants and inherent reaction properties that limit selectivity and conversion. Key areas for future research and development should focus on:

1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance conversion rates.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to maintain long-term performance.
3. Renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, potentially by exploring novel reactor designs or process configurations.
4. Developing catalysts that can balance high activity with improved selectivity, possibly by fine-tuning the electronic and structural properties of active sites.
5. Investigating alternative soft oxidants or combinations of oxidants that could offer improved performance over O2 or N2O alone.

These research directions aim to address the ongoing challenges in ODHP and push the boundaries of what is currently achievable in terms of propene yield and selectivity.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了令人鼓舞的结果，特别是使用含有高度分散表面VOx物种的介孔二氧化硅材料。这些催化剂已经展示出高达25%的最大丙烯产率。

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂代替分子氧，在各种催化剂系统中，包括含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料，都显著提高了丙烯选择性。

N2O性能的提升归因于减少了VOx物种的再氧化速度，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化，从而提高了选择性。

比较O2和N2O作为氧化剂时，O2显示出更高的活性但较低的丙烯选择性。这可能是由于形成了高度活性的物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22和Vn+  O。这些物种，特别是Vn+  O，已经通过实验证明具有很高的活性，即使在室温下也能部分与丙烷反应，并与丙烯完全反应。

相比之下，N2O不形成这些高活性物种。相反，与N2O的反应可能通过亲核氧化物离子的参与进行，这有助于在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP反应中观察到更高的丙烯选择性。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括氧化剂的腐蚀性以及限制选择性和转化率的固有反应特性。未来研究和发展的关键领域应该集中在：

1. 改善C-H键活化以提高转化率。
2. 增强催化剂的再生能力，以保持长期性能。
3. 革新反应系统以优化ODHP过程，可能通过探索新型反应器设计或工艺配置。
4. 开发能够平衡高活性和改善选择性的催化剂，可能通过微调活性位点的电子和结构特性。
5. 研究替代软氧化剂或氧化剂组合，可能比单独使用O2或N2O提供更好的性能。

这些研究方向旨在解决ODHP中持续存在的挑战，并推动当前在丙烯产率和选择性方面可实现性的边界。
