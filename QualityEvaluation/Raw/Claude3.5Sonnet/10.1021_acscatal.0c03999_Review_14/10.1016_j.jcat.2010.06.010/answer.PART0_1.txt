[1] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[2] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[3] "A turnover frequency of propane conversion of 0:016 molC3H8 mol1V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxidizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher, amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane conversion of approximately 10%."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of catalysts with O2 and N2O as oxidizing agents.

The use of N2O instead of O2 as an oxidizing agent has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity over various catalyst systems, including iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The improved performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, leading to higher propene selectivity.

Experiments with VOx/MCM-41 catalysts showed that while O2 provided higher activity (turnover frequency), N2O resulted in significantly higher propene selectivity (80% vs 50%) at similar conversion levels (~10%).

The difference in performance is explained by the nature of oxygen species formed. With O2, highly reactive species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O are formed, which react readily with both propane and propene. In contrast, N2O forms less reactive nucleophilic oxide ions, resulting in higher propene selectivity.

The study doesn't directly address persistent challenges or future research directions for ODHP. However, the findings suggest that key areas for improvement include:

1. Optimizing catalyst systems to balance activity and selectivity.
2. Further investigation of soft oxidants like N2O to enhance selectivity.
3. Understanding and controlling the formation of different oxygen species on catalyst surfaces.
4. Developing strategies to suppress consecutive oxidation of propene.

These insights could guide future research in improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing ODHP processes.

该文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，特别比较了使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂时催化剂的性能。

使用N2O代替O2作为氧化剂已被证明可以显著提高各种催化剂系统的丙烯选择性，包括含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O性能改善归因于还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化，从而提高了丙烯选择性。

使用VOx/MCM-41催化剂的实验表明，虽然O2提供了更高的活性(转化频率)，但N2O在相似转化水平(~10%)下实现了显著更高的丙烯选择性(80%对50%)。

性能差异解释为形成的氧物种性质不同。O2形成高活性物种如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O，它们易与丙烷和丙烯反应。相比之下，N2O形成反应性较低的亲核氧离子，导致更高的丙烯选择性。

该研究没有直接讨论ODHP的持续挑战或未来研究方向。然而，这些发现表明关键改进领域包括：

1. 优化催化剂系统以平衡活性和选择性。
2. 进一步研究N2O等软氧化剂以提高选择性。
3. 理解和控制催化剂表面不同氧物种的形成。
4. 开发抑制丙烯连续氧化的策略。

这些见解可以指导未来在改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化ODHP过程方面的研究。
