[1] "Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene, high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]. Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with highly dispersed surface VOx species on high surface area mesoporous silica materials. These catalysts have demonstrated propene yields up to 25%, making them among the best-performing materials for ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent instead of molecular oxygen has led to significant improvements in propene selectivity across various catalyst systems, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The improved performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, thereby increasing selectivity.

The key difference in performance between O2 and N2O as oxidants lies in the nature of the active oxygen species formed. With O2, highly reactive species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O are formed, which react rapidly with both propane and propene, leading to higher activity but lower selectivity. In contrast, N2O forms less reactive nucleophilic oxide ions, resulting in higher propene selectivity.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include managing the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and overcoming inherent reaction limitations. Future research should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems. Strategies may include developing more stable and selective catalysts, exploring novel soft oxidants, and designing innovative reactor configurations to better control the reaction pathway and minimize undesired side reactions.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展中，高度分散的表面VOx物种负载在高比表面积介孔二氧化硅材料上表现出了promising的结果。这些催化剂已经实现了高达25%的丙烯产率，成为ODHP中性能最佳的材料之一。

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂代替分子氧，在各种催化剂系统中都显著提高了丙烯的选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、体相钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O性能改善的原因在于其对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程，从而提高了选择性。

O2和N2O作为氧化剂性能差异的关键在于形成的活性氧物种的性质不同。O2形成高活性物种如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22和Vn+  O，它们与丙烷和丙烯都能快速反应，导致活性较高但选择性较低。相比之下，N2O形成反应性较低的亲核氧化物离子，从而获得更高的丙烯选择性。

ODHP持续面临的挑战包括管理反应环境的腐蚀性和克服固有的反应限制。未来研究应集中在改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统上。策略可能包括开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂，探索新型软氧化剂，以及设计创新的反应器构型，以更好地控制反应途径并最小化不需要的副反应。

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of catalysts with O2 and N2O as oxidizing agents.

The use of N2O instead of O2 as an oxidizing agent has been shown to significantly improve propene selectivity over various catalyst systems, including iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The improved performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, leading to higher propene selectivity.

Experiments with VOx/MCM-41 catalysts showed that while O2 provided higher activity (turnover frequency), N2O resulted in significantly higher propene selectivity (80% vs 50%) at similar conversion levels (~10%).

The difference in performance is explained by the nature of oxygen species formed. With O2, highly reactive species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O are formed, which react readily with both propane and propene. In contrast, N2O forms less reactive nucleophilic oxide ions, resulting in higher propene selectivity.

The study doesn't directly address persistent challenges or future research directions for ODHP. However, the findings suggest that key areas for improvement include:

1. Optimizing catalyst systems to balance activity and selectivity.
2. Further investigation of soft oxidants like N2O to enhance selectivity.
3. Understanding and controlling the formation of different oxygen species on catalyst surfaces.
4. Developing strategies to suppress consecutive oxidation of propene.

These insights could guide future research in improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing ODHP processes.

该文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，特别比较了使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂时催化剂的性能。

使用N2O代替O2作为氧化剂已被证明可以显著提高各种催化剂系统的丙烯选择性，包括含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O性能改善归因于还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化，从而提高了丙烯选择性。

使用VOx/MCM-41催化剂的实验表明，虽然O2提供了更高的活性(转化频率)，但N2O在相似转化水平(~10%)下实现了显著更高的丙烯选择性(80%对50%)。

性能差异解释为形成的氧物种性质不同。O2形成高活性物种如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22 和Vn+  O，它们易与丙烷和丙烯反应。相比之下，N2O形成反应性较低的亲核氧离子，导致更高的丙烯选择性。

该研究没有直接讨论ODHP的持续挑战或未来研究方向。然而，这些发现表明关键改进领域包括：

1. 优化催化剂系统以平衡活性和选择性。
2. 进一步研究N2O等软氧化剂以提高选择性。
3. 理解和控制催化剂表面不同氧物种的形成。
4. 开发抑制丙烯连续氧化的策略。

这些见解可以指导未来在改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化ODHP过程方面的研究。

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of N2O as an oxidizing agent instead of O2. Supported vanadium-containing materials, bulk vanadium oxides, and iron-containing zeolites have demonstrated improved propene selectivity when using N2O. The maximum propene yields reported have reached up to 25% with these materials.

The improved performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, leading to higher propene selectivity.

Comparing O2 and N2O as oxidants, O2 shows higher activity but lower propene selectivity. This is due to the formation of highly reactive species like OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O when using O2. These species react rapidly with both propane and propene, even at room temperature. In contrast, N2O does not form such highly reactive species, instead proceeding through nucleophilic oxide ions, which results in higher propene selectivity.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties. Key areas for future research and development should focus on:

1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance propane conversion.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to maintain long-term performance.
3. Renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, potentially by exploring new soft oxidants or catalyst designs that can balance activity and selectivity.
4. Further investigation into the mechanism of N2O-based ODHP to exploit its selectivity advantages while improving overall conversion rates.

These strategies aim to address the ongoing challenge of achieving high propene yields by balancing conversion and selectivity in ODHP processes.

ODHP的持续挑战包括腐蚀性和固有的反应特性。未来研究和开发的关键领域应关注：

1. 改善C-H键活化以提高丙烷转化率。
2. 增强催化剂的再生能力以保持长期性能。
3. 改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程，可能通过探索新的软氧化剂或可以平衡活性和选择性的催化剂设计。
4. 进一步研究基于N2O的ODHP机制，以利用其选择性优势，同时提高整体转化率。

这些策略旨在通过平衡ODHP过程中的转化率和选择性来解决获得高丙烯产率的持续挑战。

The literature provides insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of catalysts with O2 and N2O as oxidizing agents.

Catalyst systems discussed include iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. The study focuses mainly on VOx/MCM-41 catalysts.

In terms of selectivity and conversion:
- N2O as an oxidant significantly improves propene selectivity compared to O2.
- With N2O, propene selectivity reached 80% at 10% propane conversion, compared to only 50% with O2.
- However, the turnover frequency of propane conversion with N2O was half that of O2.

The main challenges and areas for future research include:

1. Understanding and controlling the nature of active oxygen species:
   - O2 forms highly reactive electrophilic oxygen species (OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O).
   - N2O likely forms less reactive nucleophilic oxide ions.

2. Balancing activity and selectivity:
   - O2 provides higher activity but lower selectivity.
   - N2O offers higher selectivity but lower activity.

3. Improving C-H bond activation:
   - The study suggests that different oxygen species affect C-H bond activation differently.

4. Enhancing catalyst regenerability:
   - The slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O results in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites.

5. Optimizing reaction systems:
   - Further research is needed to combine the high activity of O2 with the high selectivity of N2O.

Future research should focus on developing catalysts and reaction systems that can achieve both high activity and high selectivity, possibly by controlling the formation and nature of active oxygen species on the catalyst surface.
