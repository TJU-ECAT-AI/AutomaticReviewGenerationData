[1] "Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene, high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]. Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."

[2] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

[3] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

[4] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

[5] "In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with highly dispersed surface VOx species on high surface area mesoporous silica materials. These catalysts have demonstrated propene yields up to 25%, making them among the best-performing materials for ODHP.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent instead of molecular oxygen has led to significant improvements in propene selectivity across various catalyst systems, including steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

The improved performance with N2O is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. This suppresses the consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides, thereby increasing selectivity.

The key difference in performance between O2 and N2O as oxidants lies in the nature of the active oxygen species formed. With O2, highly reactive species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O are formed, which react rapidly with both propane and propene, leading to higher activity but lower selectivity. In contrast, N2O forms less reactive nucleophilic oxide ions, resulting in higher propene selectivity.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include managing the corrosiveness of the reaction environment and overcoming inherent reaction limitations. Future research should focus on improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and optimizing reaction systems. Strategies may include developing more stable and selective catalysts, exploring novel soft oxidants, and designing innovative reactor configurations to better control the reaction pathway and minimize undesired side reactions.

在使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展中，高度分散的表面VOx物种负载在高比表面积介孔二氧化硅材料上表现出了promising的结果。这些催化剂已经实现了高达25%的丙烯产率，成为ODHP中性能最佳的材料之一。

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂代替分子氧，在各种催化剂系统中都显著提高了丙烯的选择性，包括蒸汽活化的含铁沸石、体相钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料。

N2O性能改善的原因在于其对还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低。这抑制了丙烯连续氧化为碳氧化物的过程，从而提高了选择性。

O2和N2O作为氧化剂性能差异的关键在于形成的活性氧物种的性质不同。O2形成高活性物种如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22和Vn+  O，它们与丙烷和丙烯都能快速反应，导致活性较高但选择性较低。相比之下，N2O形成反应性较低的亲核氧化物离子，从而获得更高的丙烯选择性。

ODHP持续面临的挑战包括管理反应环境的腐蚀性和克服固有的反应限制。未来研究应集中在改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力和优化反应系统上。策略可能包括开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂，探索新型软氧化剂，以及设计创新的反应器构型，以更好地控制反应途径并最小化不需要的副反应。
