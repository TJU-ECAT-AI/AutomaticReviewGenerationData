          "Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene, high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]. Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."

"When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

"Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

"The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

"In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with high surface area mesoporous silica materials containing highly dispersed surface VOx species. These catalysts have demonstrated maximum propene yields of up to 25%.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent instead of molecular oxygen has led to significant improvements in propene selectivity across various catalyst systems, including iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

When comparing O2 and N2O as oxidants:
- O2 shows higher activity but lower propene selectivity, likely due to the formation of highly reactive species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O.
- N2O offers higher propene selectivity but lower activity. This is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides.
- With N2O, the reaction probably proceeds through the participation of nucleophilic oxide ions, contributing to higher propene selectivity.

Performance comparison:
- Using O2: Higher turnover frequency of propane conversion (0.016 molC3H8 mol-1V s-1), but lower propene selectivity (50% at 10% propane conversion).
- Using N2O: Lower turnover frequency (about half of O2), but higher propene selectivity (80% at 10% propane conversion).

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了令人鼓舞的结果，特别是使用含有高度分散表面VOx物种的高比表面积介孔二氧化硅材料。这些催化剂已经展示出高达25%的最大丙烯产率。

使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为氧化剂代替分子氧，在各种催化剂系统中，包括含铁沸石、块状钒氧化物和负载型含钒材料，都显著提高了丙烯选择性。

比较O2和N2O作为氧化剂时：
- O2显示出更高的活性但较低的丙烯选择性，这可能是由于形成了高度活性的物种，如OxV5+  O2、OxV5    O22和Vn+  O。
- N2O提供更高的丙烯选择性但活性较低。这归因于减少了VOx物种的再氧化速度，导致活性晶格氧位点的稳态浓度较低，从而抑制了丙烯向碳氧化物的连续氧化。
- 使用N2O时，反应可能通过亲核氧化物离子的参与进行，这有助于提高丙烯选择性。

性能比较：
- 使用O2：丙烷转化频率更高（0.016 molC3H8 mol-1V s-1），但丙烯选择性较低（在10%丙烷转化率下为50%）。
- 使用N2O：转化频率较低（约为O2的一半），但丙烯选择性更高（在10%丙烷转化率下为80%）。

          Persistent challenges in ODHP include the corrosiveness of the oxidants and inherent reaction properties that limit selectivity and conversion. Key areas for future research and development should focus on:

1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance conversion rates.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to maintain long-term performance.
3. Renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes, potentially by exploring novel reactor designs or process configurations.
4. Developing catalysts that can balance high activity with improved selectivity, possibly by fine-tuning the electronic and structural properties of active sites.
5. Investigating alternative soft oxidants or combinations of oxidants that could offer improved performance over O2 or N2O alone.
6. Understanding and controlling the nature of active oxygen species formed during the reaction to balance activity and selectivity.
7. Exploring strategies to suppress consecutive oxidation of propene while maintaining high propane conversion rates.

These research directions aim to address the ongoing challenges in ODHP and push the boundaries of what is currently achievable in terms of propene yield and selectivity.
