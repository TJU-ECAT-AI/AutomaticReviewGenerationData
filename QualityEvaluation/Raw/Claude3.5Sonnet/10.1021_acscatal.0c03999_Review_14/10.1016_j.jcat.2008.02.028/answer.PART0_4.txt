[1] "VOx/SiO2 catalysts were prepared through an innovative flame pyrolysis (FP) technique and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Catalytic activity measured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed a promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared samples. The best results were obtained with a 10 wt% V loading, which provided the best propylene yield among the samples, especially under anaerobic conditions (up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion)."

[3] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another."

[4] "Comparing the catalyst prepared with the solgel method containing 7 wt% V2O5 [30] and the V10Si catalyst reported here demonstrates that the two samples behaved similarly under anaerobic conditions (with very similar plots of selectivity to propylene as a function of conversion), but the solgel catalyst gave better selectivity than the FP catalyst under co-feed conditions."

[5] "Our findings confirm significant differences in the nature of V sites of the FP-prepared samples and the impregnated samples and those in samples prepared by conventional techniques, such as solgel [30]. Indeed, high V dispersion was evident for the FP-prepared samples, at least up to 10 wt% V2O5."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems beyond vanadium oxide on silica support. The study focuses on a specific preparation technique (flame pyrolysis) for VOx/SiO2 catalysts and their performance in ODHP.

The flame pyrolysis (FP) prepared VOx/SiO2 catalysts showed promising selectivity for propylene production, especially under anaerobic conditions. The best performance was achieved with 10 wt% V loading, reaching up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion under anaerobic conditions.

The FP preparation method allowed for higher vanadium dispersion compared to traditional impregnation methods, with highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix. This high dispersion was maintained up to 10 wt% V2O5 loading.

Compared to sol-gel prepared catalysts, the FP-prepared samples showed similar performance under anaerobic conditions but lower selectivity under co-feed conditions. However, the FP method allowed for higher vanadium loadings without V2O5 segregation, potentially leading to improved catalyst performance.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges in ODHP such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. It also does not discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. These aspects would require further research beyond the scope of the provided literature.

该文献并未对使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展进行全面分析，也没有比较除了钒氧化物/二氧化硅催化剂之外的其他催化剂系统。本研究主要集中在VOx/SiO2催化剂的特定制备技术（火焰热解）及其在ODHP中的性能。

火焰热解(FP)制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂在丙烯生产中表现出良好的选择性，特别是在无氧条件下。10 wt%的V负载量表现最佳，在无氧条件下，丙烷转化率为10%时，丙烯选择性可达80%。

与传统浸渍法相比，FP制备方法允许更高的钒分散度，V5+O基团高度分散并部分嵌入二氧化硅基质中。这种高分散度在V2O5负载量达到10 wt%时仍能保持。

与溶胶-凝胶法制备的催化剂相比，FP制备的样品在无氧条件下表现相似，但在共进料条件下选择性较低。然而，FP方法允许在不发生V2O5分离的情况下实现更高的钒负载量，这可能会导致催化剂性能的提升。

该研究没有直接讨论ODHP中持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。它也没有讨论改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力或革新反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略。这些方面需要进行超出本文献范围的进一步研究。
