[1] "VOx/SiO2 catalysts were prepared through an innovative flame pyrolysis (FP) technique and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another."

[3] "Catalytic activity measured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed a promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared samples."

[4] "The best results were obtained with a 10 wt% V loading, which provided the best propylene yield among the samples, especially under anaerobic conditions (up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion)."

[5] "This is likely related to the much higher dispersion of the VOx species in the FP-prepared samples, which also helps reduce the coke formation triggered by exposed surface acid sites."

The literature does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems beyond the VOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared by flame pyrolysis. It also does not discuss persistent challenges like corrosiveness or elaborate on key areas for future research in improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

However, the study does present some relevant findings on VOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared by flame pyrolysis for ODHP:

1. The flame pyrolysis technique produced catalysts with highly dispersed V5+O active sites partially incorporated into the silica matrix.

2. These catalysts showed promising selectivity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

3. The best performance was achieved with 10 wt% V loading, reaching up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion under anaerobic conditions.

4. The high dispersion of VOx species in flame pyrolysis-prepared samples helped reduce coke formation.

5. The study suggests that the flame pyrolysis method allows for higher V concentrations without V2O5 segregation, leading to greater selectivity compared to traditionally prepared catalysts.

While these findings contribute to ODHP catalyst development, they do not address the full scope of the question regarding recent advances, challenges, and future research directions in the field.

该文献并未直接讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，也没有比较火焰热解法制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂以外的各种催化剂系统。它也没有讨论腐蚀性等持续存在的挑战，或详细阐述改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力等未来研究的关键领域。

然而，该研究确实对火焰热解法制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂用于ODHP提出了一些相关发现：

1. 火焰热解技术生产的催化剂具有高度分散的V5+O活性位，部分被纳入二氧化硅基质中。

2. 这些催化剂在有氧和无氧条件下都表现出良好的选择性。

3. 在10 wt%的V负载量下获得了最佳性能，在无氧条件下达到了10%丙烷转化率时80%的选择性。

4. 火焰热解法制备的样品中VOx物种的高度分散有助于减少积碳形成。

5. 研究表明，火焰热解法允许更高的V浓度而不会发生V2O5分离，与传统制备的催化剂相比，这导致了更高的选择性。

虽然这些发现对ODHP催化剂的开发有所贡献，但它们并未涵盖该领域最新进展、挑战和未来研究方向的全部范围。

The literature focuses on a specific catalyst system (VOx/SiO2) prepared by flame pyrolysis (FP) for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), rather than providing a broad comparison of various catalyst systems. However, some key points can be extracted:

1. The FP-prepared VOx/SiO2 catalysts showed promising selectivity for ODHP under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

2. The best performance was achieved with 10 wt% V loading, reaching up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion under anaerobic conditions.

3. Higher dispersion of VOx species in FP-prepared samples contributed to improved performance and reduced coke formation.

4. High V site isolation was beneficial for selectivity, but bulk vanadia segregation at higher loadings decreased catalyst selectivity.

The study does not directly address the use of soft oxidants, corrosiveness issues, or strategies for improving C-H bond activation. However, it highlights the importance of catalyst preparation methods in achieving high dispersion and isolation of active sites for improved ODHP performance.

Future research in this field could focus on:
1. Exploring FP preparation techniques for other metal oxide catalysts.
2. Optimizing catalyst compositions to balance dispersion and loading.
3. Investigating the performance of FP-prepared catalysts under various reaction conditions, including the use of soft oxidants.
4. Developing strategies to maintain high dispersion and site isolation at higher metal loadings.
5. Studying the relationship between catalyst structure and regenerability.

These areas of research could contribute to addressing the persistent challenges in ODHP and lead to more efficient and selective catalytic systems.

该文献主要关注了一种通过火焰热解法(FP)制备的特定催化剂系统(VOx/SiO2)用于丙烷的氧化脱氢(ODHP)，而不是对各种催化剂系统进行广泛比较。然而，可以提取一些关键点：

1. FP制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂在有氧和无氧条件下都表现出了promising的ODHP选择性。

2. 在10 wt% V负载时达到最佳性能，在无氧条件下10%丙烷转化率时可达80%的选择性。

3. FP制备样品中VOx物种的高度分散有助于提高性能并减少积碳形成。

4. 高度V位点隔离对选择性有利，但在高负载时体相钒氧化物的分离降低了催化剂选择性。

该研究没有直接讨论软氧化剂的使用、腐蚀性问题或改善C-H键活化的策略。然而，它强调了催化剂制备方法在实现活性位点高度分散和隔离以提高ODHP性能方面的重要性。

该领域的未来研究可以集中在：
1. 探索FP制备技术用于其他金属氧化物催化剂。
2. 优化催化剂组成以平衡分散度和负载量。
3. 研究FP制备的催化剂在各种反应条件下的性能，包括使用软氧化剂。
4. 开发在高金属负载下保持高分散度和位点隔离的策略。
5. 研究催化剂结构与再生能力之间的关系。

这些研究领域可能有助于解决ODHP中持续存在的挑战，并导致更高效和选择性的催化系统。

The literature primarily focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly those prepared by flame pyrolysis (FP). It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides.

The FP-prepared VOx/SiO2 catalysts showed promising performance, especially under anaerobic conditions. The best results were obtained with 10 wt% V loading, achieving up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion. This high performance was attributed to the higher dispersion of VOx species in the FP-prepared samples.

The FP method allowed for the active component to be dispersed inside the inert silica matrix rather than deposited on the surface. This led to superior performance under anaerobic conditions due to the increased concentration of isolated VOx sites.

When compared to a sol-gel prepared catalyst, the FP-prepared catalyst showed similar behavior under anaerobic conditions but lower selectivity under co-feed conditions.

The literature does not directly address persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or discuss specific strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems. It focuses primarily on the preparation method and performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts rather than broader challenges in the field of ODHP.

For future research and development, the results suggest that further exploration of preparation methods that achieve high dispersion of active sites and isolation of VOx species could be beneficial. Additionally, investigating the performance of these catalysts under different reaction conditions (anaerobic vs. co-feed) could lead to optimized ODHP processes.

这篇文献主要关注在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中使用的钒氧化物催化剂，特别是那些通过火焰热解法(FP)制备的催化剂。它并没有提供包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统的全面比较。

FP制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂表现出很有前景的性能，尤其是在无氧条件下。最佳结果是在10 wt%的V负载量下获得的，在10%的丙烷转化率下达到了80%的选择性。这种高性能归因于FP制备的样品中VOx物种的高度分散性。

FP方法允许活性组分分散在惰性二氧化硅基质内部，而不是沉积在表面上。这导致了在无氧条件下由于孤立VOx位点浓度的增加而表现出优越的性能。

与溶胶-凝胶法制备的催化剂相比，FP制备的催化剂在无氧条件下表现出类似的行为，但在共进料条件下选择性较低。

这篇文献并没有直接讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性，也没有讨论改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改进反应系统的具体策略。它主要关注VOx/SiO2催化剂的制备方法和性能，而不是ODHP领域的更广泛挑战。

对于未来的研究和发展，结果表明，进一步探索能够实现活性位点高度分散和VOx物种隔离的制备方法可能是有益的。此外，研究这些催化剂在不同反应条件下（无氧vs共进料）的性能可能会导致ODHP过程的优化。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems beyond vanadium oxide on silica support. The study focuses on a specific preparation technique (flame pyrolysis) for VOx/SiO2 catalysts and their performance in ODHP.

The flame pyrolysis (FP) prepared VOx/SiO2 catalysts showed promising selectivity for propylene production, especially under anaerobic conditions. The best performance was achieved with 10 wt% V loading, reaching up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion under anaerobic conditions.

The FP preparation method allowed for higher vanadium dispersion compared to traditional impregnation methods, with highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix. This high dispersion was maintained up to 10 wt% V2O5 loading.

Compared to sol-gel prepared catalysts, the FP-prepared samples showed similar performance under anaerobic conditions but lower selectivity under co-feed conditions. However, the FP method allowed for higher vanadium loadings without V2O5 segregation, potentially leading to improved catalyst performance.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges in ODHP such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. It also does not discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

该文献并未对使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展进行全面分析，也没有比较除了钒氧化物/二氧化硅催化剂之外的其他催化剂系统。本研究主要集中在VOx/SiO2催化剂的特定制备技术（火焰热解）及其在ODHP中的性能。

火焰热解(FP)制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂在丙烯生产中表现出良好的选择性，特别是在无氧条件下。10 wt%的V负载量表现最佳，在无氧条件下，丙烷转化率为10%时，丙烯选择性可达80%。

与传统浸渍法相比，FP制备方法允许更高的钒分散度，V5+O基团高度分散并部分嵌入二氧化硅基质中。这种高分散度在V2O5负载量达到10 wt%时仍能保持。

与溶胶-凝胶法制备的催化剂相比，FP制备的样品在无氧条件下表现相似，但在共进料条件下选择性较低。然而，FP方法允许在不发生V2O5分离的情况下实现更高的钒负载量，这可能会导致催化剂性能的提升。

该研究没有直接讨论ODHP中持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。它也没有讨论改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力或革新反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略。这些方面需要进行超出本文献范围的进一步研究。
