[1] "VOx/SiO2 catalysts were prepared through an innovative flame pyrolysis (FP) technique and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Catalytic activity measured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed a promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared samples."

[3] "The best results were obtained with a 10 wt% V loading, which provided the best propylene yield among the samples, especially under anaerobic conditions (up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion)."

[4] "High activity is ascribed to vanadate species, either isolated or polymerized up to the formation of a VOx monolayer, whereas lower activity is usually associated with the presence of bulk V2O5."

[5] "Comparing the catalyst prepared with the solgel method containing 7 wt% V2O5 [30] and the V10Si catalyst reported here demonstrates that the two samples behaved similarly under anaerobic conditions (with very similar plots of selectivity to propylene as a function of conversion), but the solgel catalyst gave better selectivity than the FP catalyst under co-feed conditions."

This literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. The study focuses primarily on VOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared by flame pyrolysis (FP) technique.

The FP-prepared VOx/SiO2 catalysts showed promising selectivity for propane ODH under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The best performance was achieved with 10 wt% V loading, reaching up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion under anaerobic conditions.

The study suggests that high activity is associated with isolated or polymerized vanadate species up to the formation of a VOx monolayer, while bulk V2O5 leads to lower activity.

When compared to a catalyst prepared by sol-gel method, the FP-prepared catalyst showed similar performance under anaerobic conditions but lower selectivity under co-feed conditions.

The document does not discuss persistent challenges in the field, such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. It also does not elaborate on key areas for future research and development, strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

Given the limited scope of this study, a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in ODHP using soft oxidants and various catalyst systems cannot be provided based solely on this document.

这篇文献没有提供使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展的全面分析，也没有比较各种催化剂系统。该研究主要集中在通过火焰喷雾热解(FP)技术制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂上。

FP制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂在有氧和无氧条件下都表现出了良好的丙烷ODH选择性。最佳性能是在10 wt% V负载下实现的，在无氧条件下，在10%的丙烷转化率下达到了80%的选择性。

研究表明，高活性与单独或聚合的钒酸盐物种有关，直至形成VOx单层，而体相V2O5则导致较低的活性。

与溶胶-凝胶法制备的催化剂相比，FP制备的催化剂在无氧条件下表现相似，但在共进料条件下选择性较低。

该文档没有讨论该领域的持续挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。它也没有详细说明未来研究和开发的关键领域、改善C-H键活化的策略、增强催化剂再生能力或改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程。

鉴于这项研究的范围有限，仅基于这份文件无法提供使用软氧化剂和各种催化剂系统进行ODHP的最新进展的全面分析。
