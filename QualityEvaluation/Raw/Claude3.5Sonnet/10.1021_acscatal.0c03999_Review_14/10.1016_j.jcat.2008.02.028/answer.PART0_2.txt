[1] "VOx/SiO2 catalysts were prepared through an innovative flame pyrolysis (FP) technique and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "Catalytic activity measured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed a promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared samples."

[3] "The best results were obtained with a 10 wt% V loading, which provided the best propylene yield among the samples, especially under anaerobic conditions (up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion)."

[4] "This is likely related to the much higher dispersion of the VOx species in the FP-prepared samples, which also helps reduce the coke formation triggered by exposed surface acid sites."

[5] "The catalysts considered in the present work were prepared by FP, with the aim of developing systems in which the active component is dispersed inside the inert matrix (silica in the present case) instead of being deposited over it."

[6] "Comparing the catalyst prepared with the solgel method containing 7 wt% V2O5 [30] and the V10Si catalyst reported here demonstrates that the two samples behaved similarly under anaerobic conditions (with very similar plots of selectivity to propylene as a function of conversion), but the solgel catalyst gave better selectivity than the FP catalyst under co-feed conditions."

[7] "It is evident that the concomitant generation of the V and Si oxides achieved by the FP method led to a system that provides superior performance under anaerobic conditions due to the increased concentration of isolated VOx sites."

The literature primarily focuses on vanadium oxide catalysts supported on silica for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly those prepared by flame pyrolysis (FP). It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides.

The FP-prepared VOx/SiO2 catalysts showed promising performance, especially under anaerobic conditions. The best results were obtained with 10 wt% V loading, achieving up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion. This high performance was attributed to the higher dispersion of VOx species in the FP-prepared samples.

The FP method allowed for the active component to be dispersed inside the inert silica matrix rather than deposited on the surface. This led to superior performance under anaerobic conditions due to the increased concentration of isolated VOx sites.

When compared to a sol-gel prepared catalyst, the FP-prepared catalyst showed similar behavior under anaerobic conditions but lower selectivity under co-feed conditions.

The literature does not directly address persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or discuss specific strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems. It focuses primarily on the preparation method and performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts rather than broader challenges in the field of ODHP.

For future research and development, the results suggest that further exploration of preparation methods that achieve high dispersion of active sites and isolation of VOx species could be beneficial. Additionally, investigating the performance of these catalysts under different reaction conditions (anaerobic vs. co-feed) could lead to optimized ODHP processes.

这篇文献主要关注在氧化脱氢丙烷(ODHP)反应中使用的钒氧化物催化剂，特别是那些通过火焰热解法(FP)制备的催化剂。它并没有提供包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统的全面比较。

FP制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂表现出很有前景的性能，尤其是在无氧条件下。最佳结果是在10 wt%的V负载量下获得的，在10%的丙烷转化率下达到了80%的选择性。这种高性能归因于FP制备的样品中VOx物种的高度分散性。

FP方法允许活性组分分散在惰性二氧化硅基质内部，而不是沉积在表面上。这导致了在无氧条件下由于孤立VOx位点浓度的增加而表现出优越的性能。

与溶胶-凝胶法制备的催化剂相比，FP制备的催化剂在无氧条件下表现出类似的行为，但在共进料条件下选择性较低。

这篇文献并没有直接讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性，也没有讨论改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改进反应系统的具体策略。它主要关注VOx/SiO2催化剂的制备方法和性能，而不是ODHP领域的更广泛挑战。

对于未来的研究和发展，结果表明，进一步探索能够实现活性位点高度分散和VOx物种隔离的制备方法可能是有益的。此外，研究这些催化剂在不同反应条件下（无氧vs共进料）的性能可能会导致ODHP过程的优化。
