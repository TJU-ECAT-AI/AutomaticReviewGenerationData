[1] "VOx/SiO2 catalysts were prepared through an innovative flame pyrolysis (FP) technique and tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another."

[3] "Catalytic activity measured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed a promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared samples."

[4] "The best results were obtained with a 10 wt% V loading, which provided the best propylene yield among the samples, especially under anaerobic conditions (up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion)."

[5] "This is likely related to the much higher dispersion of the VOx species in the FP-prepared samples, which also helps reduce the coke formation triggered by exposed surface acid sites."

The literature does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems beyond the VOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared by flame pyrolysis. It also does not discuss persistent challenges like corrosiveness or elaborate on key areas for future research in improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

However, the study does present some relevant findings on VOx/SiO2 catalysts prepared by flame pyrolysis for ODHP:

1. The flame pyrolysis technique produced catalysts with highly dispersed V5+O active sites partially incorporated into the silica matrix.

2. These catalysts showed promising selectivity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

3. The best performance was achieved with 10 wt% V loading, reaching up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion under anaerobic conditions.

4. The high dispersion of VOx species in flame pyrolysis-prepared samples helped reduce coke formation.

5. The study suggests that the flame pyrolysis method allows for higher V concentrations without V2O5 segregation, leading to greater selectivity compared to traditionally prepared catalysts.

While these findings contribute to ODHP catalyst development, they do not address the full scope of the question regarding recent advances, challenges, and future research directions in the field.

该文献并未直接讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，也没有比较火焰热解法制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂以外的各种催化剂系统。它也没有讨论腐蚀性等持续存在的挑战，或详细阐述改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力等未来研究的关键领域。

然而，该研究确实对火焰热解法制备的VOx/SiO2催化剂用于ODHP提出了一些相关发现：

1. 火焰热解技术生产的催化剂具有高度分散的V5+O活性位，部分被纳入二氧化硅基质中。

2. 这些催化剂在有氧和无氧条件下都表现出良好的选择性。

3. 在10 wt%的V负载量下获得了最佳性能，在无氧条件下达到了10%丙烷转化率时80%的选择性。

4. 火焰热解法制备的样品中VOx物种的高度分散有助于减少积碳形成。

5. 研究表明，火焰热解法允许更高的V浓度而不会发生V2O5分离，与传统制备的催化剂相比，这导致了更高的选择性。

虽然这些发现对ODHP催化剂的开发有所贡献，但它们并未涵盖该领域最新进展、挑战和未来研究方向的全部范围。
