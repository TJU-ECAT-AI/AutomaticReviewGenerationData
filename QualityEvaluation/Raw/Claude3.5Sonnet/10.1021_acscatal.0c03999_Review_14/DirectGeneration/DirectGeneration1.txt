Recent advances in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results in improving catalyst selectivity and propylene yield. Researchers have explored various catalyst types, including metal oxides, mixed metal oxides, and supported metal catalysts, each offering unique advantages in terms of activity and stability. Despite these developments, persistent challenges remain, such as controlling the deep oxidation of propylene and minimizing coke formation on catalyst surfaces. Performance metrics like propylene selectivity, propane conversion, and catalyst lifetime continue to be key focus areas for optimization. Future research directions are likely to concentrate on the development of novel catalyst formulations that can effectively activate propane while suppressing undesired side reactions. Additionally, strategies for optimizing reaction systems may include the exploration of innovative reactor designs, the use of membrane technologies for selective product removal, and the integration of in-situ characterization techniques to better understand catalyst behavior under reaction conditions. As the demand for propylene continues to grow, addressing these challenges and pursuing these research directions will be crucial for making ODHP a commercially viable alternative to conventional propane dehydrogenation processes.
