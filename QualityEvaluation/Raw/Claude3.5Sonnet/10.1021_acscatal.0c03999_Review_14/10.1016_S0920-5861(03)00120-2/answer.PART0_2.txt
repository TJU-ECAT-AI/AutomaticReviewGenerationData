The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants across various catalyst systems. Instead, it focuses on the effects of CO2 and N2O as gas dopes on α-NiMoO4 catalysts for ODHP.

The study shows that both CO2 and N2O can modify the chemical state of active sites on NiMoO4 catalysts under reaction conditions. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the catalyst surface, likely through the formation of adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) from CO2 dissociation. This O(a) is more active as an oxidant than O2, which can lead to lower selectivity but higher conversion.

N2O, on the other hand, causes the catalytic sites to work in a more reduced state. It inhibits O2 adsorption, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and/or reducing the catalyst's oxidation rate. This results in increased yield and selectivity to propene, along with lower O2 consumption.

The study suggests that adjusting the concentration of these promoters (CO2 and N2O) could be a useful tool for modulating selectivity during the catalytic reaction. However, it does not discuss persistent challenges in the field such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties, nor does it elaborate on key areas for future research like improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

The research provides insight into how soft oxidants can influence ODHP catalysis, but it is limited to NiMoO4 catalysts and does not offer a broad comparison of various catalyst systems or address the full scope of challenges and future directions in ODHP research.

该文献并未提供使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的各种催化剂系统的最新进展的全面分析。相反,它关注CO2和N2O作为气体掺杂剂对α-NiMoO4催化剂进行ODHP的影响。

研究表明,CO2和N2O都可以在反应条件下改变NiMoO4催化剂上活性位点的化学状态。CO2增加了催化剂表面Mo的氧化态,可能是通过CO2解离形成吸附氧物种(O(a))。这种O(a)作为氧化剂比O2更活跃,可能导致选择性降低但转化率提高。

另一方面,N2O使催化位点处于更还原的状态。它抑制O2吸附,限制了非选择性氧物种的形成和/或降低了催化剂的氧化速率。这导致丙烯的产率和选择性增加,同时O2消耗降低。

研究表明,调整这些促进剂(CO2和N2O)的浓度可能是在催化反应过程中调节选择性的有用工具。然而,它并未讨论该领域持续存在的挑战,如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性,也没有详细阐述未来研究的关键领域,如改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力。

这项研究提供了软氧化剂如何影响ODHP催化的见解,但仅限于NiMoO4催化剂,没有提供各种催化剂系统的广泛比较,也没有涉及ODHP研究中的全面挑战和未来方向。
