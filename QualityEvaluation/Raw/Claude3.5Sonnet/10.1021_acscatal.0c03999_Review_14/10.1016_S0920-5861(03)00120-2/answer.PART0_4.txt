The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly focusing on the use of CO2 and N2O as gas promoters. The study examines their effects on NiMoO4 catalysts.

Key findings include:

1. CO2 promotes oxidation by forming adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) through dissociation on NiMoO4. This increases catalyst oxidation state and conversion.

2. N2O improves selectivity by working in a more reduced state, likely through inhibiting O2 adsorption and/or increasing catalyst reduction rate.

3. Both CO2 and N2O can oxidize propane to propene directly.

4. Adjusting promoter concentrations can modulate selectivity during catalytic reactions.

The study does not directly compare various catalyst systems or discuss challenges like corrosiveness. However, it demonstrates that soft oxidants can significantly impact catalyst performance in ODHP.

Key areas for future research suggested by this work include:

1. Optimizing promoter concentrations for ideal selectivity and conversion.
2. Investigating the mechanisms of O(a) formation and its role in C-H bond activation.
3. Exploring the potential of other soft oxidants as promoters.
4. Developing strategies to control catalyst oxidation state during reactions.

While the study doesn't explicitly address catalyst regenerability or reaction system renovation, the insights into dynamic surface processes during reactions could inform future work in these areas.

该文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，特别关注了CO2和N2O作为气体助剂的使用。研究考察了它们对NiMoO4催化剂的影响。

主要发现包括：

1. CO2通过在NiMoO4上解离形成吸附氧物种(O(a))来促进氧化。这增加了催化剂的氧化状态和转化率。

2. N2O通过在更还原的状态下工作来提高选择性，可能是通过抑制O2吸附和/或增加催化剂还原速率。

3. CO2和N2O都可以直接将丙烷氧化为丙烯。

4. 调整助剂浓度可以在催化反应过程中调节选择性。

该研究没有直接比较各种催化剂系统或讨论腐蚀性等挑战。然而，它证明了软氧化剂可以显著影响ODHP中的催化剂性能。

这项工作所建议的未来研究关键领域包括：

1. 优化助剂浓度以获得理想的选择性和转化率。
2. 研究O(a)形成的机制及其在C-H键活化中的作用。
3. 探索其他软氧化剂作为助剂的潜力。
4. 开发在反应过程中控制催化剂氧化状态的策略。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论催化剂再生能力或反应系统改造，但对反应过程中动态表面过程的洞察可能会为这些领域的未来工作提供信息。
