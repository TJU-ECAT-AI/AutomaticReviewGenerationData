[1] "With respect to the results obtained for the tests in the absence of CO2, the consequences of the addition of CO2 in the gas feed, which were verified in replicate experiments, are: (i) an increase in the conversion of propane at 723 K (18%), an increase at 673 K and no change at 753 K, (ii) an increase in the yield of propene at low temperature (18%) and a decrease at high temperature (8%), (iii) a decrease in the selectivity of propylene at all temperatures (10% on average)"

[2] "The addition of 300 ppm of N2O leads to: (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) a modest increase in the yield in propene (11%), (iii) an increase in the selectivity in propene (32%), (iv) a weak decrease in the selectivity in CO2 (7%)."

[3] "CO2 promotes oxidation probably via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4. Catalysts in presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion."

[4] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."

[5] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

The literature provides insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically CO2 and N2O, on NiMoO4 catalysts. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or discuss persistent challenges and future research directions as requested in the question.

The study shows that both CO2 and N2O act as promoters in the ODHP reaction, but with different effects:

1. CO2 as a promoter:
- Increases propane conversion at lower temperatures
- Increases propene yield at low temperatures but decreases it at high temperatures
- Decreases propene selectivity
- Promotes oxidation via formation of adsorbed oxygen species (O(a))
- Causes the catalyst to work in a higher oxidation state

2. N2O as a promoter:
- Decreases propane conversion
- Modestly increases propene yield
- Significantly increases propene selectivity
- Causes the catalyst to work in a more reduced state
- Improves selectivity by inhibiting O2 adsorption and/or increasing catalyst reduction rate

The study demonstrates that adjusting the concentration of these promoters can be a useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction. However, the literature does not address the persistent challenges in ODHP such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties, nor does it elaborate on key areas for future research and development in improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

这篇文献提供了使用软氧化剂（特别是CO2和N2O）在NiMoO4催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展。然而，它并没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，也没有讨论持续存在的挑战和未来研究方向，这些是问题中所要求的。

研究表明，CO2和N2O都作为ODHP反应的促进剂，但效果不同：

1. CO2作为促进剂：
- 在较低温度下增加丙烷转化率
- 在低温下增加丙烯产率，但在高温下降低产率
- 降低丙烯选择性
- 通过形成吸附氧物种（O(a)）促进氧化
- 使催化剂在更高的氧化态下工作

2. N2O作为促进剂：
- 降低丙烷转化率
- 略微增加丙烯产率
- 显著增加丙烯选择性
- 使催化剂在更低的氧化态下工作
- 通过抑制O2吸附和/或增加催化剂还原速率来提高选择性

研究表明，调整这些促进剂的浓度可以作为在催化反应过程中调节选择性的有用工具。然而，这篇文献并未涉及ODHP中持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性，也没有详细说明未来研究和开发的关键领域，如改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程。
