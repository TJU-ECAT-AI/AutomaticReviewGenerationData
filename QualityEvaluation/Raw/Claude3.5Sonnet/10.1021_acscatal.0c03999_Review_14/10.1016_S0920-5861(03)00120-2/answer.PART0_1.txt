[1] "Dynamic effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts are reported."

[2] "CO2 promotes oxidation probably via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4."

[3] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."

[4] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

The literature discusses the use of soft oxidants CO2 and N2O in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on NiMoO4 catalysts. It does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or discuss persistent challenges in the field.

CO2 promotes oxidation by forming adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) through dissociation on the catalyst surface. This increases conversion but may decrease selectivity at higher temperatures.

N2O improves selectivity by working in a more reduced state, possibly by inhibiting O2 adsorption or increasing the catalyst reduction rate. It can also directly oxidize propane to propene.

The study suggests that adjusting promoter concentrations could be a useful tool to modulate selectivity during catalytic reactions.

The literature does not address strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. It focuses primarily on the effects of CO2 and N2O as promoters in the ODHP reaction on NiMoO4 catalysts.

该文献讨论了在NiMoO4催化剂上使用CO2和N2O作为软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的情况。它没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，也没有讨论该领域持续存在的挑战。

CO2通过在催化剂表面解离形成吸附氧物种(O(a))来促进氧化。这增加了转化率，但在较高温度下可能会降低选择性。

N2O通过在更还原的状态下工作来提高选择性，可能是通过抑制O2吸附或增加催化剂还原速率。它还可以直接将丙烷氧化为丙烯。

研究表明，调整助剂浓度可能是在催化反应过程中调节选择性的有用工具。

该文献没有讨论改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略。它主要关注CO2和N2O作为助剂在NiMoO4催化剂上进行ODHP反应的效果。
