The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants across various catalyst systems. Instead, it focuses on the effects of CO2 and N2O as gas dopes on -NiMoO4 catalysts for ODHP.

The study shows that CO2 and N2O can modify the chemical state of active sites on NiMoO4 catalysts. CO2 promotes oxidation by forming adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) through dissociation on the catalyst surface. This increases the oxidation state of Mo and can improve propane conversion, but may decrease selectivity at higher temperatures.

N2O, on the other hand, causes catalytic sites to work in a more reduced state. It improves selectivity by inhibiting O2 adsorption and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. N2O can also act as a direct oxidant to produce propene.

The research suggests that adjusting the concentration of these promoters could be a useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction. However, the study does not address persistent challenges in the field or elaborate on key areas for future research and development in ODHP processes.

The literature's focus is on understanding the mechanistic processes in the presence of these gas dopes, rather than designing new high-performance catalysts or addressing broader challenges in ODHP. Therefore, it does not provide information on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

这篇文献并没有提供使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的各种催化剂系统的最新进展的全面分析。相反，它专注于研究CO2和N2O作为气体掺杂剂对-NiMoO4催化剂进行ODHP的影响。

研究表明，CO2和N2O可以改变NiMoO4催化剂上活性位点的化学状态。CO2通过在催化剂表面解离形成吸附氧物种(O(a))来促进氧化。这增加了Mo的氧化态，可以提高丙烷转化率，但在高温下可能会降低选择性。

另一方面，N2O使催化活性位点在更还原的状态下工作。它通过抑制O2吸附和/或增加催化剂的还原速率来提高选择性。N2O还可以作为直接氧化剂生成丙烯。

研究表明，调整这些促进剂的浓度可能是在催化反应过程中调节选择性的有用工具。然而，该研究并未涉及该领域的持续挑战，也没有详细阐述ODHP过程中未来研究和开发的关键领域。

该文献的重点是理解这些气体掺杂剂存在下的机理过程，而不是设计新的高性能催化剂或解决ODHP中更广泛的挑战。因此，它没有提供关于改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略信息。
