The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants across various catalyst systems. Instead, it focuses on the effects of CO2 and N2O as gas dopes on -NiMoO4 catalysts for ODHP.

The study shows that CO2 and N2O can modify the chemical state of active sites on NiMoO4 catalysts. CO2 promotes oxidation by forming adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) through dissociation on the catalyst surface. This increases the oxidation state of Mo and can improve propane conversion, but may decrease selectivity at higher temperatures.

N2O, on the other hand, causes catalytic sites to work in a more reduced state. It improves selectivity by inhibiting O2 adsorption and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. N2O can also act as a direct oxidant to produce propene.

The research suggests that adjusting the concentration of these promoters could be a useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction. However, the study does not address persistent challenges in the field or elaborate on key areas for future research and development in ODHP processes.

The literature's focus is on understanding the mechanistic processes in the presence of these gas dopes, rather than designing new high-performance catalysts or addressing broader challenges in ODHP. Therefore, it does not provide information on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

这篇文献并没有提供使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的各种催化剂系统的最新进展的全面分析。相反，它专注于研究CO2和N2O作为气体掺杂剂对-NiMoO4催化剂进行ODHP的影响。

研究表明，CO2和N2O可以改变NiMoO4催化剂上活性位点的化学状态。CO2通过在催化剂表面解离形成吸附氧物种(O(a))来促进氧化。这增加了Mo的氧化态，可以提高丙烷转化率，但在高温下可能会降低选择性。

另一方面，N2O使催化活性位点在更还原的状态下工作。它通过抑制O2吸附和/或增加催化剂的还原速率来提高选择性。N2O还可以作为直接氧化剂生成丙烯。

研究表明，调整这些促进剂的浓度可能是在催化反应过程中调节选择性的有用工具。然而，该研究并未涉及该领域的持续挑战，也没有详细阐述ODHP过程中未来研究和开发的关键领域。

该文献的重点是理解这些气体掺杂剂存在下的机理过程，而不是设计新的高性能催化剂或解决ODHP中更广泛的挑战。因此，它没有提供关于改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改造反应系统以优化ODHP过程的策略信息。

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants across various catalyst systems. Instead, it focuses on the effects of CO2 and N2O as gas dopes on α-NiMoO4 catalysts for ODHP.

The study shows that both CO2 and N2O can modify the chemical state of active sites on NiMoO4 catalysts under reaction conditions. CO2 increases the oxidation state of Mo at the catalyst surface, likely through the formation of adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) from CO2 dissociation. This O(a) is more active as an oxidant than O2, which can lead to lower selectivity but higher conversion.

N2O, on the other hand, causes the catalytic sites to work in a more reduced state. It inhibits O2 adsorption, limiting the formation of non-selective oxygen species and/or reducing the catalyst's oxidation rate. This results in increased yield and selectivity to propene, along with lower O2 consumption.

The study suggests that adjusting the concentration of these promoters (CO2 and N2O) could be a useful tool for modulating selectivity during the catalytic reaction. However, it does not discuss persistent challenges in the field such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties, nor does it elaborate on key areas for future research like improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

The research provides insight into how soft oxidants can influence ODHP catalysis, but it is limited to NiMoO4 catalysts and does not offer a broad comparison of various catalyst systems or address the full scope of challenges and future directions in ODHP research.

研究表明,CO2和N2O都可以在反应条件下改变NiMoO4催化剂上活性位点的化学状态。CO2增加了催化剂表面Mo的氧化态,可能是通过CO2解离形成吸附氧物种(O(a))。这种O(a)作为氧化剂比O2更活跃,可能导致选择性降低但转化率提高。

另一方面,N2O使催化位点处于更还原的状态。它抑制O2吸附,限制了非选择性氧物种的形成和/或降低了催化剂的氧化速率。这导致丙烯的产率和选择性增加,同时O2消耗降低。

研究表明,调整这些促进剂(CO2和N2O)的浓度可能是在催化反应过程中调节选择性的有用工具。然而,它并未讨论该领域持续存在的挑战,如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性,也没有详细阐述未来研究的关键领域,如改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力。

这项研究提供了软氧化剂如何影响ODHP催化的见解,但仅限于NiMoO4催化剂,没有提供各种催化剂系统的广泛比较,也没有涉及ODHP研究中的全面挑战和未来方向。

[1] "With respect to the results obtained for the tests in the absence of CO2, the consequences of the addition of CO2 in the gas feed, which were verified in replicate experiments, are: (i) an increase in the conversion of propane at 723 K (18%), an increase at 673 K and no change at 753 K, (ii) an increase in the yield of propene at low temperature (18%) and a decrease at high temperature (8%), (iii) a decrease in the selectivity of propylene at all temperatures (10% on average)"

[2] "The addition of 300 ppm of N2O leads to: (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) a modest increase in the yield in propene (11%), (iii) an increase in the selectivity in propene (32%), (iv) a weak decrease in the selectivity in CO2 (7%)."

[3] "CO2 promotes oxidation probably via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4. Catalysts in presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion."

The literature provides insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically CO2 and N2O, on NiMoO4 catalysts. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or discuss persistent challenges and future research directions as requested in the question.

The study shows that both CO2 and N2O act as promoters in the ODHP reaction, but with different effects:

1. CO2 as a promoter:
- Increases propane conversion at lower temperatures
- Increases propene yield at low temperatures but decreases it at high temperatures
- Decreases propene selectivity
- Promotes oxidation via formation of adsorbed oxygen species (O(a))
- Causes the catalyst to work in a higher oxidation state

2. N2O as a promoter:
- Decreases propane conversion
- Modestly increases propene yield
- Significantly increases propene selectivity
- Causes the catalyst to work in a more reduced state
- Improves selectivity by inhibiting O2 adsorption and/or increasing catalyst reduction rate

The study demonstrates that adjusting the concentration of these promoters can be a useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction. However, the literature does not address the persistent challenges in ODHP such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties, nor does it elaborate on key areas for future research and development in improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

研究表明，CO2和N2O都作为ODHP反应的促进剂，但效果不同：

1. CO2作为促进剂：
- 在较低温度下增加丙烷转化率
- 在低温下增加丙烯产率，但在高温下降低产率
- 降低丙烯选择性
- 通过形成吸附氧物种（O(a)）促进氧化
- 使催化剂在更高的氧化态下工作

2. N2O作为促进剂：
- 降低丙烷转化率
- 略微增加丙烯产率
- 显著增加丙烯选择性
- 使催化剂在更低的氧化态下工作
- 通过抑制O2吸附和/或增加催化剂还原速率来提高选择性

研究表明，调整这些促进剂的浓度可以作为在催化反应过程中调节选择性的有用工具。然而，这篇文献并未涉及ODHP中持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性，也没有详细说明未来研究和开发的关键领域，如改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程。

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly focusing on the use of CO2 and N2O as gas promoters. The study examines their effects on NiMoO4 catalysts.

Key findings include:

1. CO2 promotes oxidation by forming adsorbed oxygen species (O(a)) through dissociation on NiMoO4. This increases catalyst oxidation state and conversion.

2. N2O improves selectivity by working in a more reduced state, likely through inhibiting O2 adsorption and/or increasing catalyst reduction rate.

3. Both CO2 and N2O can oxidize propane to propene directly.

4. Adjusting promoter concentrations can modulate selectivity during catalytic reactions.

The study does not directly compare various catalyst systems or discuss challenges like corrosiveness. However, it demonstrates that soft oxidants can significantly impact catalyst performance in ODHP.

Key areas for future research suggested by this work include:

1. Optimizing promoter concentrations for ideal selectivity and conversion.
2. Investigating the mechanisms of O(a) formation and its role in C-H bond activation.
3. Exploring the potential of other soft oxidants as promoters.
4. Developing strategies to control catalyst oxidation state during reactions.

While the study doesn't explicitly address catalyst regenerability or reaction system renovation, the insights into dynamic surface processes during reactions could inform future work in these areas.
