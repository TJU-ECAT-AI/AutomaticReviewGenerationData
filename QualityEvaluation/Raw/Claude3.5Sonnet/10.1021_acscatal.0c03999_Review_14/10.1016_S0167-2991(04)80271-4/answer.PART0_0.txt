[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. However, it does discuss the use of CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation over chromium-based catalysts.

The study focuses on Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis. These catalysts showed good performance, with a propene yield above 15% and selectivity above 90%. The use of CO2 as an oxidant was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane.

The mechanism involves a redox cycle where Cr6+O4 tetrahedra dehydrogenate propane to propene, being reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra in the process. CO2 then reoxidizes the Cr3+O6 octahedra back to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, completing the cycle.

The study does not discuss persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. It also does not elaborate on key areas for future research like improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

The research demonstrates the potential of using CO2 as a soft oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, which could be an area for further development in ODHP processes. However, a more comprehensive review of other catalyst systems and recent advances in the field would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献并未提供关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展的全面分析，也没有比较各种催化剂系统。然而，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂在铬基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的情况。

研究重点关注通过直接水热合成制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂。这些催化剂表现出良好的性能，丙烯收率超过15%，选择性超过90%。使用CO2作为氧化剂被发现可以增强丙烷的脱氢。

其机理涉及一个氧化还原循环，其中Cr6+O4四面体将丙烷脱氢成丙烯，在此过程中被还原为Cr3+O6八面体。然后CO2将Cr3+O6八面体重新氧化回Cr6+O4四面体，完成循环。

该研究没有讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。它也没有详细阐述未来研究的关键领域，如改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力。

研究表明了使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢软氧化剂的潜力，这可能是ODHP过程进一步发展的一个领域。然而，需要对其他催化剂系统和该领域的最新进展进行更全面的回顾，才能充分回答这个问题。
