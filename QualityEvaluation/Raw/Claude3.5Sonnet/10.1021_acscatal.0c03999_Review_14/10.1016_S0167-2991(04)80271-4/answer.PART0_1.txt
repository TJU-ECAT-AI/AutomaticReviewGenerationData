The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. However, it does mention some relevant information about propane dehydrogenation:

1. CO2 was found to enhance propane dehydrogenation over silica-supported chromium oxide.

2. Chromium-based catalysts have been investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes with oxygen.

3. Cr-MCM-41 prepared by impregnation showed low selectivity and yield (< 5%) for propane ODH with oxygen.

4. A more recent SBA-15 supported chromium oxide catalyst showed good performance for propane dehydrogenation and ODH.

5. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 demonstrated a yield above 15% with high selectivity (> 90%) for propene in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane.

The document does not discuss persistent challenges, key areas for future research, or strategies for improving C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, or reaction system optimization specifically for ODHP processes. The focus is primarily on CO2 dehydrogenation of propane using Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.

该文献并未提供关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展的全面分析，也没有比较各种催化剂系统。然而，它确实提到了一些与丙烷脱氢相关的信息：

1. 发现CO2可以增强二氧化硅负载的铬氧化物对丙烷的脱氢作用。

2. 铬基催化剂已被研究用于低级烷烃与氧气的氧化脱氢。

3. 通过浸渍法制备的Cr-MCM-41在用氧气进行丙烷ODH时表现出低选择性和低产率（<5%）。

4. 最近研究的SBA-15负载的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢和ODH方面表现良好。

5. Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41在CO2脱氢丙烷反应中表现出高于15%的产率和高选择性（>90%）。

该文档没有讨论持续存在的挑战、未来研究的关键领域，或改进C-H键活化、催化剂再生能力或反应系统优化的策略，特别是针对ODHP过程。文章主要集中在使用Cr-MCM-41催化剂进行丙烷的CO2脱氢反应。
