[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "Although the dehydrogenation of C3H8 took place in the absence of CO2 to reach 10% of C3H8 conversion, the conversion of C3H8 increased remarkably with an increase in the partial pressure of CO2."

[4] "During the reaction over Cr-MCM-41 DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts with both Si/Cr ratios of 50, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreased, indicating an occurring of the deactivation of catalyst"

[5] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2."

[6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature primarily focuses on the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane using Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, rather than oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. However, some insights can be drawn from this research:

1. Performance: Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed promising performance for propane dehydrogenation, with yields above 15% and selectivity above 90% for propene. CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation process.

2. Catalyst systems: The study compared various metal-MCM-41 catalysts, with Cr-MCM-41 showing the highest activity. This suggests that transition metal oxides, particularly chromium-based catalysts, can be effective for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Challenges: Catalyst deactivation was observed during the reaction, indicating that maintaining catalyst stability is a persistent challenge in this field.

4. Future research areas:
   a) Improving catalyst regenerability: The study showed that Cr-MCM-41 could be easily regenerated by O2 treatment, while Cr/Cab-O-Sil could not. Developing catalysts with better regeneration properties is crucial.
   b) Optimizing reaction systems: The research demonstrated that CO2 partial pressure significantly affected propane conversion. Further investigation into reaction conditions and gas compositions could lead to process optimization.
   c) Enhancing C-H bond activation: The proposed mechanism involving the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species suggests that understanding and improving this cycle could enhance C-H bond activation.

While this study doesn't directly address all aspects of ODHP using soft oxidants, it provides valuable insights into catalyst design, performance evaluation, and reaction mechanisms that could be applied to future research in this area.

这篇文献主要关注使用Cr-MCM-41催化剂进行丙烷的CO2脱氢，而不是使用软氧化剂进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）。然而，我们可以从这项研究中得到一些见解：

1. 性能：Cr-MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢方面表现出良好的性能，丙烯的产率超过15%，选择性超过90%。CO2被发现可以增强脱氢过程。

2. 催化剂系统：研究比较了各种金属-MCM-41催化剂，其中Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性。这表明过渡金属氧化物，特别是基于铬的催化剂，可以有效地用于丙烷脱氢。

3. 挑战：在反应过程中观察到催化剂失活，表明保持催化剂稳定性是该领域持续存在的挑战。

4. 未来研究领域：
   a) 提高催化剂再生能力：研究表明，Cr-MCM-41可以通过O2处理轻松再生，而Cr/Cab-O-Sil则不能。开发具有更好再生性能的催化剂至关重要。
   b) 优化反应系统：研究表明，CO2分压显著影响丙烷转化率。进一步研究反应条件和气体组成可能会导致过程优化。
   c) 增强C-H键活化：提出的涉及Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的还原-氧化循环机制表明，理解并改进这一循环可能会增强C-H键活化。

虽然这项研究没有直接解决使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的所有方面，但它为催化剂设计、性能评估和反应机理提供了宝贵的见解，这些见解可以应用于该领域的未来研究。
