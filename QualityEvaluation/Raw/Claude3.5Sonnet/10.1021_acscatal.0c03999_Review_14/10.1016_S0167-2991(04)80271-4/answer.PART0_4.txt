[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes4 with oxygen."

[3] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with oxygen, but the selectivity to C3H6 was low and the yield of C3H6 was lower than 5%."

[4] "Recently, a SBA-15 supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (1) and showed good catalytic performances."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

The literature provides limited information on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. However, it does discuss some catalyst systems and their performance:

1. Silica-supported chromium oxide: Enhanced dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 as an oxidant.

2. Cr-MCM-41 prepared by impregnation: Used for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but showed low selectivity and yield (less than 5%) for propene.

3. SBA-15 supported chromium oxide: Applied to both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, showing good catalytic performance.

4. Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr ratio of 50: Demonstrated a yield above 15% with high selectivity (above 90%) for propene in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane.

The document does not provide comprehensive information on various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, or their comparative performance in terms of selectivity and conversion.

Regarding persistent challenges and key areas for future research, the literature does not directly address these topics. It does not discuss corrosiveness, inherent reaction properties, strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

The document focuses primarily on the performance of chromium-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, with limited discussion on oxidative dehydrogenation. More comprehensive and recent literature would be needed to fully address the questions posed about ODHP advances, challenges, and future research directions.

该文献对使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展提供了有限的信息。但是，它确实讨论了一些催化剂系统及其性能：

1. 二氧化硅负载的氧化铬：使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂，增强了丙烷的脱氢作用。

2. 通过浸渍法制备的Cr-MCM-41：用于丙烷与氧气的氧化脱氢，但对丙烯的选择性和产率较低（低于5%）。

3. SBA-15负载的氧化铬：应用于丙烷的脱氢和氧化脱氢，表现出良好的催化性能。

4. Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41：在丙烷的二氧化碳脱氢中，丙烯的产率超过15%，选择性高于90%。

该文档未提供各种催化剂系统（包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物）的综合信息，也未比较它们在选择性和转化率方面的性能。

关于持续存在的挑战和未来研究的关键领域，该文献并未直接涉及这些主题。它没有讨论腐蚀性、固有反应特性、改善C-H键活化的策略、提高催化剂再生能力或改进反应系统以优化ODHP过程。

该文档主要集中在铬基催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能，对氧化脱氢的讨论有限。需要更全面和最新的文献才能充分回答关于ODHP进展、挑战和未来研究方向的问题。
