[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

[4] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a comparison of various catalyst systems. However, it does discuss the use of CO2 as an oxidant for propane dehydrogenation over chromium-based catalysts.

The study focuses on Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis. These catalysts showed good performance, with a propene yield above 15% and selectivity above 90%. The use of CO2 as an oxidant was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane.

The mechanism involves a redox cycle where Cr6+O4 tetrahedra dehydrogenate propane to propene, being reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra in the process. CO2 then reoxidizes the Cr3+O6 octahedra back to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, completing the cycle.

The study does not discuss persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. It also does not elaborate on key areas for future research like improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

The research demonstrates the potential of using CO2 as a soft oxidant for propane dehydrogenation, which could be an area for further development in ODHP processes. However, a more comprehensive review of other catalyst systems and recent advances in the field would be needed to fully address the question.

该文献并未提供关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展的全面分析，也没有比较各种催化剂系统。然而，它确实讨论了使用CO2作为氧化剂在铬基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的情况。

研究重点关注通过直接水热合成制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂。这些催化剂表现出良好的性能，丙烯收率超过15%，选择性超过90%。使用CO2作为氧化剂被发现可以增强丙烷的脱氢。

其机理涉及一个氧化还原循环，其中Cr6+O4四面体将丙烷脱氢成丙烯，在此过程中被还原为Cr3+O6八面体。然后CO2将Cr3+O6八面体重新氧化回Cr6+O4四面体，完成循环。

该研究没有讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。它也没有详细阐述未来研究的关键领域，如改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力。

研究表明了使用CO2作为丙烷脱氢软氧化剂的潜力，这可能是ODHP过程进一步发展的一个领域。然而，需要对其他催化剂系统和该领域的最新进展进行更全面的回顾，才能充分回答这个问题。

该文献并未提供关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展的全面分析，也没有比较各种催化剂系统。然而，它确实提到了一些与丙烷脱氢相关的信息：

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

[4] "It is reasonable to suggest, therefore, that the terahedrally coordinated Cr6+ play an important role in the dehydrogenation."

[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra.

The document primarily focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a soft oxidant over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using various catalyst systems.

The study shows that Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, particularly those prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis, demonstrate good performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2. The catalyst with Si/Cr ratio of 50 achieved a propene yield above 15% with high selectivity exceeding 90%.

The mechanism involves a redox cycle between Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination and Cr3+ in octahedral coordination. During the reaction, propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are then reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. CO2 then reoxidizes the Cr3+O6 octahedra back to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, completing the cycle.

The document does not extensively discuss persistent challenges in the field or elaborate on key areas for future research and development. It also does not compare the performance of various catalyst systems beyond mentioning that Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among tested metal-MCM-41 catalysts.

To fully address the question, additional information from other sources would be needed to discuss recent advances in ODHP using soft oxidants, compare various catalyst systems, and elaborate on challenges and future research directions in the field.

该文档主要关注使用CO2作为软氧化剂在Cr-MCM-41催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢，而不是对使用各种催化剂系统进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展进行全面分析。

研究表明，Cr-MCM-41催化剂，特别是通过直接水热合成制备的催化剂，在CO2存在下的丙烷脱氢反应中表现出良好的性能。Si/Cr比为50的催化剂实现了超过15%的丙烯产率，选择性高达90%以上。

反应机理涉及Cr6+四面体配位和Cr3+八面体配位之间的氧化还原循环。在反应过程中，丙烷被Cr6+O4四面体脱氢成丙烯，然后Cr6+O4四面体被还原为Cr3+O6八面体。CO2随后将Cr3+O6八面体重新氧化为Cr6+O4四面体，完成循环。

文档并未广泛讨论该领域的持续挑战，也没有详细阐述未来研究和开发的关键领域。除了提到Cr-MCM-41在测试的金属-MCM-41催化剂中显示出最高活性外，它也没有比较各种催化剂系统的性能。

要全面回答这个问题，需要从其他来源获取额外信息，以讨论使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的最新进展，比较各种催化剂系统，并详细阐述该领域的挑战和未来研究方向。

[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[3] "Although the dehydrogenation of C3H8 took place in the absence of CO2 to reach 10% of C3H8 conversion, the conversion of C3H8 increased remarkably with an increase in the partial pressure of CO2."

[4] "During the reaction over Cr-MCM-41 DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts with both Si/Cr ratios of 50, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreased, indicating an occurring of the deactivation of catalyst"

[5] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2."

[6] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra.

The literature primarily focuses on the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane using Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, rather than oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. However, some insights can be drawn from this research:

1. Performance: Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed promising performance for propane dehydrogenation, with yields above 15% and selectivity above 90% for propene. CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation process.

2. Catalyst systems: The study compared various metal-MCM-41 catalysts, with Cr-MCM-41 showing the highest activity. This suggests that transition metal oxides, particularly chromium-based catalysts, can be effective for propane dehydrogenation.

3. Challenges: Catalyst deactivation was observed during the reaction, indicating that maintaining catalyst stability is a persistent challenge in this field.

4. Future research areas:
   a) Improving catalyst regenerability: The study showed that Cr-MCM-41 could be easily regenerated by O2 treatment, while Cr/Cab-O-Sil could not. Developing catalysts with better regeneration properties is crucial.
   b) Optimizing reaction systems: The research demonstrated that CO2 partial pressure significantly affected propane conversion. Further investigation into reaction conditions and gas compositions could lead to process optimization.
   c) Enhancing C-H bond activation: The proposed mechanism involving the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+ species suggests that understanding and improving this cycle could enhance C-H bond activation.

While this study doesn't directly address all aspects of ODHP using soft oxidants, it provides valuable insights into catalyst design, performance evaluation, and reaction mechanisms that could be applied to future research in this area.

这篇文献主要关注使用Cr-MCM-41催化剂进行丙烷的CO2脱氢，而不是使用软氧化剂进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP）。然而，我们可以从这项研究中得到一些见解：

1. 性能：Cr-MCM-41催化剂在丙烷脱氢方面表现出良好的性能，丙烯的产率超过15%，选择性超过90%。CO2被发现可以增强脱氢过程。

2. 催化剂系统：研究比较了各种金属-MCM-41催化剂，其中Cr-MCM-41显示出最高的活性。这表明过渡金属氧化物，特别是基于铬的催化剂，可以有效地用于丙烷脱氢。

3. 挑战：在反应过程中观察到催化剂失活，表明保持催化剂稳定性是该领域持续存在的挑战。

4. 未来研究领域：
   a) 提高催化剂再生能力：研究表明，Cr-MCM-41可以通过O2处理轻松再生，而Cr/Cab-O-Sil则不能。开发具有更好再生性能的催化剂至关重要。
   b) 优化反应系统：研究表明，CO2分压显著影响丙烷转化率。进一步研究反应条件和气体组成可能会导致过程优化。
   c) 增强C-H键活化：提出的涉及Cr6+和Cr3+物种之间的还原-氧化循环机制表明，理解并改进这一循环可能会增强C-H键活化。

虽然这项研究没有直接解决使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的所有方面，但它为催化剂设计、性能评估和反应机理提供了宝贵的见解，这些见解可以应用于该领域的未来研究。
