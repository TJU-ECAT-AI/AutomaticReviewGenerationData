The given literature does not contain information specifically related to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or comparisons of different catalyst systems for this reaction. The document focuses primarily on halogen-mediated processes for hydrocarbon functionalization and does not discuss ODHP in detail. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of recent advances in ODHP catalysts, their performance, or persistent challenges in this field based on the given text.

To properly address this question, additional literature sources specifically focused on ODHP would be needed. These sources should cover various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, as well as their performance in terms of selectivity and conversion. Information on challenges such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, along with future research directions in C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and reaction system optimization would also be required.

给定的文献中没有包含与使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)或不同催化剂系统在该反应中的性能比较相关的具体信息。该文档主要侧重于卤素介导的烃类官能化过程,并没有详细讨论ODHP。因此,我无法基于给定的文本提供关于ODHP催化剂最新进展、其性能或该领域持续存在的挑战的分析。

要妥善回答这个问题,需要额外的专门针对ODHP的文献来源。这些来源应该涵盖各种催化剂系统,包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物,以及它们在选择性和转化率方面的性能。还需要有关腐蚀性和固有反应特性等挑战的信息,以及C-H键活化、催化剂再生能力和反应系统优化等未来研究方向的信息。
