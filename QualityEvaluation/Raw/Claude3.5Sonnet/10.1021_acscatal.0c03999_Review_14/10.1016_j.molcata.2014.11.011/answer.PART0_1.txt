[1] "Catalytic systems based on supported or unsupported iron are a kind of active catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene [17]."

[2] "Among the studied catalysts, iron-containing zeolites with low iron loadings have been extensively reported [2,3,6,7]. Due to the stronger acidity of zeolites which favored coking and cracking reactions, the selectivity was rather low."

[3] "In order to further optimize the reaction results, many researchers have paid their attention to the use of supports with weak acidity, e.g.: Al2O3 or zeolites with high Si/Al [8]. Nevertheless, the selectivity was always improved at the expense of activity."

[4] "In comparison, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane provides an efficient way to convert propane to propylene with high selectivity. To date, most studies were focused on commercial Cr-based [911] and Pt-based [1214] catalysts."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or a detailed comparison of various catalyst systems. However, it does mention some relevant information about catalysts for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Iron-based catalysts: Both supported and unsupported iron catalysts are active in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Iron-containing zeolites with low iron loadings have been extensively studied, but their strong acidity leads to low selectivity due to coking and cracking reactions.

2. Catalysts with weak acidity: Researchers have explored supports with weak acidity, such as Al2O3 or zeolites with high Si/Al ratios, to improve selectivity. However, this improvement often comes at the cost of reduced activity.

3. Commercial catalysts: Most studies on catalytic dehydrogenation of propane have focused on commercial Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts, which provide high selectivity.

The document does not discuss persistent challenges, key areas for future research, or strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or optimizing ODHP processes. It also does not provide detailed information on the performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion.

该文献并未提供关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展的全面分析，也没有详细比较各种催化剂系统。然而，它确实提到了一些关于丙烷脱氢催化剂的相关信息：

1. 铁基催化剂：无论是负载型还是非负载型的铁催化剂都在丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应中表现活性。低铁负载量的含铁沸石已被广泛研究，但由于其强酸性导致焦化和裂解反应，因此选择性较低。

2. 弱酸性催化剂：研究人员探索了弱酸性载体，如Al2O3或高Si/Al比的沸石，以提高选择性。然而，这种改进通常以降低活性为代价。

3. 商业催化剂：大多数关于丙烷催化脱氢的研究集中在商业化的铬基和铂基催化剂上，这些催化剂提供了高选择性。

该文件没有讨论持续存在的挑战、未来研究的关键领域，或改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力以及优化ODHP过程的策略。它也没有提供各种催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面的详细性能信息。
