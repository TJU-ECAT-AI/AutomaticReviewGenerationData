[1] "An increased olefin demand (especially C2C4 olefins) is predicted for the coming years [1,2]; consequently industry is seeking alternative routes for the production of lower olefins, as the present production capacity will not meet the needs."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) can be a viable route for the production of olefins as the presence of oxygen counteracts the thermodynamic limitation and prevents coking."

[3] "Recently, oxidative conversion of LPG has been reported over LiDyClMgO catalysts: yields of olefins (mixture of butenes, propene, and ethene) as high as 50% were obtained [9,10]."

[4] "From the catalysts reported by Landau et al. (e.g., LiClDyMgO) we have shown that lithium was the only essential ingredient for a well-performing catalyst, thus providing a Cl-free oxidation catalyst [17]."

[5] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."

The provided literature does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems. The document focuses on a specific Li/Dy/MgO catalyst system for oxidative conversion of propane, rather than providing a broad overview of different catalysts or recent developments in the field.

However, the literature does mention some relevant points about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation is considered a viable route for olefin production, as it overcomes thermodynamic limitations and prevents coking.

2. Li-promoted magnesia catalysts (specifically Li/Dy/MgO) have shown promising results, with olefin yields up to 50% for propane oxidative conversion.

3. Lithium was identified as the essential ingredient for a well-performing catalyst, allowing for a chlorine-free oxidation catalyst.

The document does not discuss persistent challenges in the field, strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or optimizing ODHP processes. It also does not compare the performance of various catalyst systems or discuss the use of soft oxidants.

To properly answer the question, additional literature focusing on recent advances in ODHP, comparisons of different catalyst systems, and current challenges in the field would be needed.

提供的文献没有直接讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，也没有比较各种催化剂系统。该文档主要关注特定的Li/Dy/MgO催化剂系统用于丙烷的氧化转化，而不是提供不同催化剂或该领域最新发展的广泛概述。

然而，该文献确实提到了一些关于丙烷氧化脱氢的相关要点：

1. 氧化脱氢被认为是烯烃生产的可行路线，因为它克服了热力学限制并防止结焦。

2. 锂促进的氧化镁催化剂（特别是Li/Dy/MgO）显示出有前景的结果，丙烷氧化转化的烯烃产率高达50%。

3. 锂被确定为高性能催化剂的关键成分，允许使用无氯氧化催化剂。

该文档没有讨论该领域持续存在的挑战、改善C-H键活化的策略、提高催化剂再生能力或优化ODHP过程。它也没有比较各种催化剂系统的性能或讨论软氧化剂的使用。

要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的文献，重点关注ODHP的最新进展、不同催化剂系统的比较以及该领域当前的挑战。

The literature provided does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Instead, it focuses on lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts for oxidative conversion of lower alkanes.

However, based on the information available, we can discuss some aspects related to ODHP:

1. Catalyst performance: Lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts show promising results for oxidative conversion of propane, with yields up to 50% of olefins (propene and ethene). This suggests that these catalysts offer good selectivity and conversion for ODHP.

2. Catalyst composition: The study found that lithium was the essential ingredient for a well-performing catalyst, providing a chlorine-free oxidation catalyst. This indicates that main group element metal oxides can be effective for ODHP.

3. Challenges: The literature mentions some persistent challenges in alkane dehydrogenation, such as low conversion due to thermodynamic constraints and coking. These issues are likely relevant to ODHP as well.

4. Catalyst inhibition: Carbon dioxide was found to have a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction due to strong adsorption on the active sites. This highlights the importance of understanding and managing catalyst poisoning in ODHP processes.

The literature does not provide information on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems specifically for ODHP. To fully address the question, additional research on more recent advances in ODHP using soft oxidants and various catalyst systems would be necessary.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，也没有比较包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统。相反，它主要关注锂促进的氧化镁催化剂用于低碳烷烃的氧化转化。

然而，根据可用信息，我们可以讨论一些与ODHP相关的方面：

1. 催化剂性能：锂促进的氧化镁催化剂在丙烷氧化转化方面显示出有前景的结果，烯烃（丙烯和乙烯）产率高达50%。这表明这些催化剂对ODHP具有良好的选择性和转化率。

2. 催化剂组成：研究发现，锂是性能良好的催化剂的关键成分，提供了无氯的氧化催化剂。这表明主族元素金属氧化物可以有效用于ODHP。

3. 挑战：文献提到了烷烃脱氢的一些持续存在的挑战，如由于热力学限制导致的低转化率和结焦问题。这些问题可能与ODHP也相关。

4. 催化剂抑制：二氧化碳被发现对反应有强烈的抑制作用，这是由于在活性位点上的强吸附造成的。这突出了理解和管理ODHP过程中催化剂中毒的重要性。

文献没有提供关于改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或专门为ODHP改进反应系统的策略信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对使用软氧化剂和各种催化剂系统进行ODHP的最新进展进行额外研究。

The literature does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems. Instead, it focuses on lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts for oxidative conversion of propane. 

The paper reports that lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offer a viable alternative for propene and ethene production, with yields up to 50% of olefins. This performance is comparable to other reported catalysts like LiDyClMgO.

The mechanism proposed involves propane activation on the catalyst surface to generate propyl radicals, which then undergo gas-phase radical chain reactions. Alkane activation is identified as the rate-determining step.

Some challenges are mentioned, such as the strong inhibiting effect of carbon dioxide due to adsorption on active sites. However, the paper does not discuss corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability.

The literature does not provide information on other catalyst systems, persistent challenges in ODHP, or key areas for future research and development as requested in the question. To fully answer the question, additional sources covering recent advances in ODHP would be needed.

这篇文献并未直接讨论使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展,也没有比较各种催化剂体系。相反,它主要关注锂促进的氧化镁催化剂用于丙烷的氧化转化。

文章报道,锂促进的氧化镁催化剂为丙烯和乙烯生产提供了一种可行的替代方案,烯烃产率高达50%。这一性能与其他报道的催化剂(如LiDyClMgO)相当。

提出的机理包括丙烷在催化剂表面活化生成丙基自由基,然后在气相中进行自由基链反应。烷烃活化被确定为速率决定步骤。

文中提到了一些挑战,如由于吸附在活性位点上而导致的二氧化碳的强烈抑制作用。然而,该文并未讨论腐蚀性或改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。

这篇文献没有提供关于其他催化剂系统、ODHP持续存在的挑战,或未来研究和开发的关键领域的信息,这些都是问题中所要求的。要全面回答这个问题,需要额外的资料来源,涵盖ODHP的最新进展。
