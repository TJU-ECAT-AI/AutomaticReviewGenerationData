[1] "An increased olefin demand (especially C2C4 olefins) is predicted for the coming years [1,2]; consequently industry is seeking alternative routes for the production of lower olefins, as the present production capacity will not meet the needs."

[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) can be a viable route for the production of olefins as the presence of oxygen counteracts the thermodynamic limitation and prevents coking."

[3] "Recently, oxidative conversion of LPG has been reported over LiDyClMgO catalysts: yields of olefins (mixture of butenes, propene, and ethene) as high as 50% were obtained [9,10]."

[4] "From the catalysts reported by Landau et al. (e.g., LiClDyMgO) we have shown that lithium was the only essential ingredient for a well-performing catalyst, thus providing a Cl-free oxidation catalyst [17]."

[5] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."

The provided literature does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems. The document focuses on a specific Li/Dy/MgO catalyst system for oxidative conversion of propane, rather than providing a broad overview of different catalysts or recent developments in the field.

However, the literature does mention some relevant points about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane:

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation is considered a viable route for olefin production, as it overcomes thermodynamic limitations and prevents coking.

2. Li-promoted magnesia catalysts (specifically Li/Dy/MgO) have shown promising results, with olefin yields up to 50% for propane oxidative conversion.

3. Lithium was identified as the essential ingredient for a well-performing catalyst, allowing for a chlorine-free oxidation catalyst.

The document does not discuss persistent challenges in the field, strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or optimizing ODHP processes. It also does not compare the performance of various catalyst systems or discuss the use of soft oxidants.

To properly answer the question, additional literature focusing on recent advances in ODHP, comparisons of different catalyst systems, and current challenges in the field would be needed.

提供的文献没有直接讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，也没有比较各种催化剂系统。该文档主要关注特定的Li/Dy/MgO催化剂系统用于丙烷的氧化转化，而不是提供不同催化剂或该领域最新发展的广泛概述。

然而，该文献确实提到了一些关于丙烷氧化脱氢的相关要点：

1. 氧化脱氢被认为是烯烃生产的可行路线，因为它克服了热力学限制并防止结焦。

2. 锂促进的氧化镁催化剂（特别是Li/Dy/MgO）显示出有前景的结果，丙烷氧化转化的烯烃产率高达50%。

3. 锂被确定为高性能催化剂的关键成分，允许使用无氯氧化催化剂。

该文档没有讨论该领域持续存在的挑战、改善C-H键活化的策略、提高催化剂再生能力或优化ODHP过程。它也没有比较各种催化剂系统的性能或讨论软氧化剂的使用。

要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的文献，重点关注ODHP的最新进展、不同催化剂系统的比较以及该领域当前的挑战。
