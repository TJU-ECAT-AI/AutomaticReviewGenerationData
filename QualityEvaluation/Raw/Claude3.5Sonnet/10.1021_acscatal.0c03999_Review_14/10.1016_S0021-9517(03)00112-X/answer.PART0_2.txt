[1] "Oxidative conversion of lower alkanes over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offers a viable alternative for propene and ethene production. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."

The literature does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems. Instead, it focuses on lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts for oxidative conversion of propane. 

The paper reports that lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offer a viable alternative for propene and ethene production, with yields up to 50% of olefins. This performance is comparable to other reported catalysts like LiDyClMgO.

The mechanism proposed involves propane activation on the catalyst surface to generate propyl radicals, which then undergo gas-phase radical chain reactions. Alkane activation is identified as the rate-determining step.

Some challenges are mentioned, such as the strong inhibiting effect of carbon dioxide due to adsorption on active sites. However, the paper does not discuss corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability.

The literature does not provide information on other catalyst systems, persistent challenges in ODHP, or key areas for future research and development as requested in the question. To fully answer the question, additional sources covering recent advances in ODHP would be needed.

这篇文献并未直接讨论使用温和氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展,也没有比较各种催化剂体系。相反,它主要关注锂促进的氧化镁催化剂用于丙烷的氧化转化。

文章报道,锂促进的氧化镁催化剂为丙烯和乙烯生产提供了一种可行的替代方案,烯烃产率高达50%。这一性能与其他报道的催化剂(如LiDyClMgO)相当。

提出的机理包括丙烷在催化剂表面活化生成丙基自由基,然后在气相中进行自由基链反应。烷烃活化被确定为速率决定步骤。

文中提到了一些挑战,如由于吸附在活性位点上而导致的二氧化碳的强烈抑制作用。然而,该文并未讨论腐蚀性或改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。

这篇文献没有提供关于其他催化剂系统、ODHP持续存在的挑战,或未来研究和开发的关键领域的信息,这些都是问题中所要求的。要全面回答这个问题,需要额外的资料来源,涵盖ODHP的最新进展。
