[1] "Oxidative conversion of lower alkanes over lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts offers a viable alternative for propene and ethene production. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."

[2] "Recently, oxidative conversion of LPG has been reported over LiDyClMgO catalysts: yields of olefins (mixture of butenes, propene, and ethene) as high as 50% were obtained [9,10]."

[3] "From the catalysts reported by Landau et al. (e.g., LiClDyMgO) we have shown that lithium was the only essential ingredient for a well-performing catalyst, thus providing a Cl-free oxidation catalyst [17]."

[4] "Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane."

[5] "The difficulties in carrying out dehydrogenation of alkanes are diverse and are discussed in great detail elsewhere [4]. The main problems in the classical dehydrogenation process are the low conversion caused by thermodynamic constraints and coking."

The literature provided does not directly address recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or compare various catalyst systems including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides. Instead, it focuses on lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts for oxidative conversion of lower alkanes.

However, based on the information available, we can discuss some aspects related to ODHP:

1. Catalyst performance: Lithium-promoted magnesia catalysts show promising results for oxidative conversion of propane, with yields up to 50% of olefins (propene and ethene). This suggests that these catalysts offer good selectivity and conversion for ODHP.

2. Catalyst composition: The study found that lithium was the essential ingredient for a well-performing catalyst, providing a chlorine-free oxidation catalyst. This indicates that main group element metal oxides can be effective for ODHP.

3. Challenges: The literature mentions some persistent challenges in alkane dehydrogenation, such as low conversion due to thermodynamic constraints and coking. These issues are likely relevant to ODHP as well.

4. Catalyst inhibition: Carbon dioxide was found to have a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction due to strong adsorption on the active sites. This highlights the importance of understanding and managing catalyst poisoning in ODHP processes.

The literature does not provide information on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems specifically for ODHP. To fully address the question, additional research on more recent advances in ODHP using soft oxidants and various catalyst systems would be necessary.

所提供的文献并未直接讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，也没有比较包括过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在内的各种催化剂系统。相反，它主要关注锂促进的氧化镁催化剂用于低碳烷烃的氧化转化。

然而，根据可用信息，我们可以讨论一些与ODHP相关的方面：

1. 催化剂性能：锂促进的氧化镁催化剂在丙烷氧化转化方面显示出有前景的结果，烯烃（丙烯和乙烯）产率高达50%。这表明这些催化剂对ODHP具有良好的选择性和转化率。

2. 催化剂组成：研究发现，锂是性能良好的催化剂的关键成分，提供了无氯的氧化催化剂。这表明主族元素金属氧化物可以有效用于ODHP。

3. 挑战：文献提到了烷烃脱氢的一些持续存在的挑战，如由于热力学限制导致的低转化率和结焦问题。这些问题可能与ODHP也相关。

4. 催化剂抑制：二氧化碳被发现对反应有强烈的抑制作用，这是由于在活性位点上的强吸附造成的。这突出了理解和管理ODHP过程中催化剂中毒的重要性。

文献没有提供关于改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或专门为ODHP改进反应系统的策略信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对使用软氧化剂和各种催化剂系统进行ODHP的最新进展进行额外研究。
