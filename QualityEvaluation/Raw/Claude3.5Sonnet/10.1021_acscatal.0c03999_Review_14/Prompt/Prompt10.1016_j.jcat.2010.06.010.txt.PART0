Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions has been
applied to elucidate the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of a reduced
VOx(2.7 wt.%)/MCM-41 catalyst by gas-phase O2 or N2O. An electrophilic Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion
intermediate is formed from O2 probably via dissociation of a bi-atomic adsorbed oxygen species. This
radical is remarkably stable in inert atmosphere up to elevated temperatures but reacts partly with
C3H8 and almost completely with C3H6 and CO already at room temperature. In contrast, no such species
could be observed upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O. This might be due to the rapid for-
mation of nucleophilic O2 oxide ions, which are not EPR-active. The different electronic nature of these
oxygen intermediates is discussed as a reason for the higher propene selectivity obtained in propane oxi-
dative dehydrogenation over VOx/MCM-41 with N2O.

1. Introduction
Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the
corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis
research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and
abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern
petrochemical industry. However, due to low olefin yields, such
reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major
drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast con-
secutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides. Extensive
research has been done in the past to improve the catalyst selectiv-
ity, and the relevant results have been reviewed during last
10 years [14]. Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested
for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene,
high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials
possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best
performing ones [515]. Maximum propene yields up to 25% have
been obtained with these materials.
It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between
the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines
the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance. Mes-
oporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the
potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx
sites. As a result, propene selectivity increases while the opposite
effect was observed when VxOy surface clusters are present at high
vanadium loadings and/or supports with lower surface area
[6,10,13]. Furthermore, vanadium sites in tetrahedral oxygen coor-
dination, being the major species on VOx/MCM catalysts with low
vanadium loadings, appeared to be less active but more selective
than those in octahedral oxygen coordination [10]. Another advan-
tage of mesoporous MCM-41 is the rather large pores and low
intrinsic activity of highly dispersed VOx species for the ODP reac-
tion. As a result, mass transport within the pores does not limit the
target reaction ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore
system and, thus, reducing consecutive propene combustion. Be-
sides the structure of VOx species, surface acidbase properties
determine the catalytic performance insofar as strongly acidic
supports lower propene selectivities [16], while basic ones can im-
prove it [17,18]. When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular
oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi-
cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites
[19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain-
ing materials [13,2123]. A similar effect of N2O was also reported
for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium
magnesium oxide catalysts [24]. Based on a kinetic analysis of
the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the
ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida-
tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower
steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a con-
sequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is

suppressed. In these studies, it has also been found that the activity
of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising
agglomerization degree [14]. However, propene selectivities did
not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re-
mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and
small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites
were present. When the latter species were dominating, not only
a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida-
tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although
this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O
[14].
In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state
isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested
that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen
of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in
COx formation. However, only limited experimental information
is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are
formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species.
In early electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies, the forma-
tion of O
2 , O and O
3 anion radicals was postulated upon reac-
tion of gas-phase O2 with partially reduced V2O5/SiO2 catalysts
[2729]. The corresponding EPR spectra are characterized by
superhyperfine structure multiplets. This superhyperfine features
were interpreted as arising from the interaction of the unpaired
electron located on the oxygen anion radicals with the nuclear
spin of the 51V5+ cation, to which they were attached [2729].
These oxygen species showed both high thermal stability up to
473 K and reactivity for oxidation of H2, CH4 and CO already at
room temperature [29]. Based on this early work, similar EPR sig-
nals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite
[30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were as-
signed to V O
2

species. It was found that these species disap-
peared upon reaction with allyl alcohol or n-hexane. In a recent
DFT study, the reoxidation of reduced V3+ and V4+ sites with O2
and N2O was evaluated [32]. These calculations suggest that a per-
oxovanadate species is formed when O2 is adsorbed on a V3+ site.
The formed peroxovanadate can decompose to yield a VO3+ vana-
dyl species and gas-phase O2 or react with another reduced V3+
site to produce two vanadyl species. In contrast, when N2O reacts
with V3+, a vanadyl species is restored and N2 is formed. For ana-
lyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a
VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydro-
gen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site
and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates
[32]. In this DFT study, the formation of vanadium sites coordi-
nated by more than four oxygen ligands as well as vanadyl species
with tetravalent vanadium, which in fact have been experimen-
tally detected in VOx/MCM catalysts [10,33,34], were not taken
into account.
Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to ob-
tain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen
species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx
species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O. The same VOx/
MCM-41 catalyst used in this work has previously been thoroughly
characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro-
pane [13,14]. A turnover frequency of propane conversion of
0:016 molC3H8 mol
1
V s1 has been measured with O2 used as oxi-
dizing agent. In comparison, the respective value with N2O was
only half as high, while the propene selectivity was higher,
amounting to 80% with N2O but only to 50% with O2 at propane
conversion of approximately 10%. Since several of the previously
postulated oxygen species were paramagnetic, we applied EPR
spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions in order to
experimentally identify oxygen species formed from gaseous N2O
and O2 over VOx/MCM-41 and to explore the reactivity of these
species towards oxidation of C3H8, C3H6, and CO.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst
The preparation and characterization of the supported VOx/
MCM-41 catalyst with a vanadium content of 2.7% has been de-
scribed in detail in Ref. [13]. Briefly, the sample was prepared by
impregnating an MCM-41 support synthesized according to litera-
ture procedures with the appropriate amount of vanadyl acetyl
acetonate dissolved in toluene, followed by 12 h drying at 400 K
and subsequent calcination for 12 h at 823 K. The vanadium
loading was determined by ICP-OES after the calcination. The BET
surface area and the average pore diameter of this material amount
to 871 m2/g and 2.78 nm, respectively. The formation of the meso-
porous structure was confirmed by TEM analysis. UV-vis-DR and
Raman spectra confirmed the prevalence of single VOx surface sites
besides some small VOx clusters with VAOAV bonds, while the
presence of nanocrystalline V2O5 has been safely excluded. From
the BET surface area and the vanadium loading, an apparent
surface density of 0.37 V/nm2 has been estimated.
2.2. EPR measurements under controlled atmosphere conditions
EPR measurements were performed at 77 K on a Bruker ELEX-
SYS 500-10/12 cw-EPR spectrometer in X-band (microwave fre-
quency  9.5 GHz) using an ER 4102ST rectangular cavity, and in
Q-band (microwave frequency  35 GHz) using an ER 5106QT
low temperature cylindrical cavity. A modulation amplitude of
100 kHz and a microwave power of 6.3 mW was applied. The mag-
netic field was measured with respect to the standard 2,2-diphe-
nyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH).
Computer simulation of EPR spectra was performed with the
program SIM14S of Lozos et al. [35] using the spin Hamiltonian
H  lB  S  g  B0  SAI
1
in which lB is the Bohr magneton, S is the electron spin operator, g
is the g tensor, B0 is the magnetic field vector, A is the hyperfine ten-
sor and I is the nuclear spin operator.
17 mg of catalyst were filled into an EPR sample tube equipped
with fittings for connection to a vacuum/gas dosing line. Prior to
adsorption of O2 or N2O, the catalyst was treated in vacuum
(105 mbar) at 773 K for 30 min. During this treatment, the sample
color turned to dark gray due to reduction of V5+.
3. Results
3.1. Nature of oxygen species formed upon adsorption of O2 or N2O on
reduced VOx/MCM-41
The EPR spectrum of as-prepared VOx/MCM-41 is characterized
by a hyperfine structure (hfs) signal, which is typical for axially dis-
torted isolated V4+ species in octahedral or square-pyramidal coor-
dination (spectrum 1 in Fig. 1B). However, a broad underlying
singlet is also seen in this spectrum. This signal arises from mag-
netically interacting V4+ sites, suggesting that these species are
connected with each other via an oxygen bridge, i.e. the VOx/
MCM-41 catalyst does not possess exclusively isolated vanadium
sites. It should be stressed that the concentration of V4+ sites in
the as-prepared catalyst was significantly lower than that of V5+.
The latter species were reduced during high-temperature (773 K)
catalyst treatment in vacuum (105 mbar) as indicated by the
change of the sample color from white to gray. However, the EPR
signal belonging to V4+ species in octahedral or square-pyramidal
coordination disappeared almost completely (spectrum 2 in
Fig. 1B). Two reasons may be responsible for this effect: (1) change
112
E.V. Kondratenko, A. Brckner / Journal of Catalysis 274 (2010) 111116
to tetrahedral coordination of V4+ due to the removal of adsorbed
water and (2) deeper reduction to V3+. Both of these species are
not EPR-active at 77 K, due to short relaxation times [10,36]. More-
over, the zero-field splitting of V3+ with a total electron spin of S = 1
may be too large for an allowed spin transition to occur. The fact
that there is still a small rest of the V4+ signal seen after evacuation
at 773 K is an additional hint for the presence of some oligomer-
ized VxOy clusters, in which vanadium species are usually octahe-
drally coordinated.
In order to prove if reduced VOx species on MCM-41 can be oxi-
dized, gas-phase O2 (5 mbar) has been added to the reduced catalyst
at 77 K. A multiline spectrum occurred in the middle field range
(spectrum 3 in Fig. 1). This signal must be assigned to an oxygen rad-
ical directly bound to a V5+ atom since the line splitting comes from
the superhyperfine structure (shfs) coupling of the electron spin at
the oxygen radical with the nuclear spin of 51V5+ (S = 7/2). This sig-
nal becomes more pronounced after a short warming to 293 K
(spectrum 4 in Fig. 1A), indicating that more reduced vanadium
sites have been oxidized. The oxygen radical does not decay after
1 h storage in O2 at 293 K (spectrum 5 in Fig. 1A). Along with the
oxygen signal, the hfs signal of octahedral V4+ species partly reap-
peared after reoxidation of reduced VOx/MCM-41 (spectra 3 and 5
in Fig. 1B). Their formation can only be explained by electron
transfer from V3+ (not visible by EPR under the actual measurement
conditions) to oxygen, whereby octahedral V4+ is re-created.
For precise assignment of the shfs signal after oxygen adsorp-
tion in Fig. 1, the X-band spectrum has been reproduced by calcu-
lation using Eq. (1) (Table 1, Fig. 2). Excellent agreement between
the experimental and calculated sum spectrum could be obtained
by superimposing two axial subsignals (Fig. 2) with the spin Ham-
iltonian parameters listed in Table 1.
To further clarify the specific nature of the formed oxygen rad-
ical, the EPR spectrum after adsorption of 5 mbar O2 at 77 K on the
prereduced VOx/MCM-41 and short warming to 293 K has also
been measured in Q-band at 148 K. Compared to the X-band mea-
surements, higher microwave frequency and magnetic field in the
Q-band setup provide a better resolution of the g tensor compo-
nents. The corresponding spectrum is presented in Fig. 3. The g
and A tensor components are most precisely obtained from the
second derivative, in which the position of the shfs lines is re-
flected by minima and the broad background signal is suppressed.
Since only two groups of eight shfs lines are observed, it can be
concluded without any doubt that the oxygen radical species has
axial symmetry. Moreover, the group of shfs signals at lower field
shows approximately twice the intensity as the group at higher
field, indicating that g\ > g (Fig. 3). This is the typical situation
for O anion radicals [3638]. Therefore, this shfs signal is as-
signed to a Vn+  O species (n = 4 or 5). This assignment will be
further explained in Section 4.
In order to investigate the nature of oxygen species formed over
reduced VOx species from N2O, we repeated the above EPR exper-
iments with N2O. After adsorption of 6 mbar N2O at room temper-
ature, the hfs signal of V4+ increases, which clearly indicates that
V3+ formed during pretreatment in vacuum must have been oxi-

dized by N2O. This process is even more pronounced when N2O is
adsorbed at 323 K (Fig. 4, spectra 13). Yet, in contrast to the
respective experiment with O2 (compare Fig. 1), no shfs signal of
Vn+  O is observed. This, however, appears immediately, when
3 mbar of O2 are supplied in addition to the 6 mbar N2O (Fig. 4,
spectrum 4). This experiment strongly suggests that different oxy-
gen species are formed from O2 and N2O. N2O reoxidises reduced
VOx species yielding diamagnetic O2 species (lattice oxygen of
vanadia). This experimental result is in agreement with previous
DFT calculations [32].
3.2. Reactivity of adsorbed oxygen species against propane, propene
and carbon monoxide
The reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of re-
duced VOx species by O2 was investigated by in-situ EPR in the fol-
lowing way. After these oxygen species were formed as described
in Section 3.1, propane was fed to the EPR sample tube at different
temperatures for various times followed by quenching to 77 K.
Hereafter, EPR spectra were recorded at 77 K. In order to be sure
that the oxygen species reacted with C3H8 but did not thermally
disappear, the same procedure was performed in parallel with a
second sample using N2 (inert gas) instead of C3H8. Fig. 5 compares
the EPR spectra recorded during these two tests. It can be seen that
the intensity of the shfs signal decreases strongly already after 5
min contact with C3H8 at 293 K. This signal practically disappears
after further contact with C3H8 for 30 min at 293 K and for 5 min
at 303 K. When N2 was used instead of C3H8, the shfs signal was
still widely unchanged. This proves that C3H8 can react with
Vn+  O already at room temperature, while thermal decline in in-
ert gas requires much more severe conditions.
When C3H6 was used as reactant, the Vn+  O shfs signal is al-
ready gone at 293 K, leaving behind only the hyperfine structure
(hfs) signal arising from the coupling of the unpaired electron at
the V4+ with the nuclear spin of 51V (black line in Fig. 6). This shows
clearly that C3H6 is much more reactive than C3H8, since it con-
sumes the O species completely already at room temperature.
Interestingly, there is also a slight shift of the position of the hfs
lines upon reaction with C3H6 (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the local
coordination geometry of the V4+ site is changed upon removal of
O.
Besides C3H8 and C3H6, the interaction of the Vn+  O site with
CO was also studied (Fig. 7). It turns out that CO shows a similar
reactivity like C3H6. Only traces of the shfs signal remain after 5
min contact at 293 K with a mixture of 5% CO in He at 1 bar.
This signal completely disappeared after 30 min at 293 K.
4. Discussion
X-band shfs signals with similar multiline features like those in
Fig. 1 have been previously reported by Kazansky et al. after oxy-
gen adsorption on a partially reduced V2O5/SiO2 catalyst [27].
These signals have been phenomenologically attributed to a rhom-
bic V5+  O2
 species, formed upon electron transfer from V4+ to

O2. For comparison, the spectrum published in this previous paper
is plotted in Fig. 8A together with the spectrum recorded in the
present study after adsorption of 5 mbar of O2 at 77 K (spectrum
3 in Fig. 1A). Similarities of both signals are obvious. The following
spin Hamiltonian parameters were derived by Kazansky et al. [27]
from their EPR spectrum just by simple measuring: g1 = 2.023,
g2 = 2.011, g3 = 2.004, A1 = 9.7 G, A2 = 6.8 G, A3 = 5.9 G. However,
when we tried to reproduce their experimental spectrum by simu-
lation using these reported spin Hamiltonian parameters, no satis-
factory agreement was obtained (Fig. 8B). Thus, the assignment of
this EPR signal to a rhombic V5+  O2
 species appears to be highly
doubtful. We were not able either to fit our EPR spectrum in Fig. 1A
using rhombic g and A tensors, as appropriate for an O2
 species.
However, as mentioned in Section 3.1, an excellent fit could be ob-
tained by superimposing two subspectra with axial g tensor
parameters, one with and the other without shfs (Table 1, Fig. 3).
From this fit and in accordance with the experimental Q-band
spectrum, it is evident that g\ > g. According to theory [38], the
relation of the g values of an axial O species is g\ > g since
g = gzz  ge and g\ = gxx = gyy = ge + (2k/DE), k being the spin-orbit
coupling constant and DE being the energy difference between
the pz and the degenerate px and py orbitals of oxygen. This relation
is obeyed for a wide variety of oxide systems accommodating O
species [38] and holds also for spectra 35 in Fig. 1A. Therefore,
we assign the subline with shfs (component 1 in Table 1, Fig. 2C)
to a V5+  O species. Oxygen in this species is directly bound to
V5+ but has one electron less than a lattice oxide ion. Moreover,
there is no interaction between this oxygen and any paramagnetic
species. In other words, this V5+  O species should be an isolated
species
For the broad subsignal of component 2, the condition g\ > g is
also fulfilled (Table 1, Fig. 2D). The shape of this subline is very
similar to that of O species without shfs, e. g. in Mo/SiO2 catalysts
[29]. Taking into account these previous data and the formation of
V4+ after adsorption of O2 over reduced VOx/MCM-41 in our study
(Fig. 1B, spectra 3 and 5), the broad subsignal can be ascribed to a
OxV4+  O species. In contrast to the OxV5+  O species, the
superhyperfine structure in the spectrum of OxV4+  O is aver-
aged out due to the magnetic interaction between the electron
spins of O and V4+. We suggest that the OxV4+  O species is part
of a VOx aggregate consisting of at least two vanadium atoms with
O being in the bridging position between two vanadium atoms.
This agrees also with previous catalytic results, which suggest that
single VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters show
similar activity [14]. In summary, based on the present experimen-
tal and theoretical results, we ascribe the EPR signals with shfs and
without shfs to OxV5+  O and OxV4+  O species, respectively.
In the following, we discuss a mechanistic proposal for the for-
mation of EPR-active and non-active species upon reoxidation of
reduced VOx/MCM-41 with O2 and N2O based on the present
experiments and previous DFT results [32]. In agreement with
the DFT study, our experimental analysis proves that the reoxida-
tion of OxV4+ and OxV3+ by O2 is straightforward, because this hap-
pens even at 77 K. Fig. 9A summarizes main pathways and reaction
species upon reoxidation of OxV4+ and OxV3+ by O2. OxV4+  O2
 in
this scheme should be paramagnetic and, thus, EPR-active. The rea-
son that it was not observed in our study may be its very fast con-
version into a peroxovanadate species, OxV5    O2
2 , which is
energetically favoured [32]. The DFT calculations have also shown
that this peroxovanadate should not be stable above 800 K and
decompose to O@V5+O3 and  O2 or to two O@V5+O3, when a V3+
site is additionally involved. Likewise, the OxV5+  O species ob-
served in the EPR spectra could be formed by reaction of

conditions. Plot B shows the overall spectrum after 5 min storage at 303 K, while

with a second OxV4+ site. Obviously, this happens al-
ready at very low temperature. At elevated temperatures, the
OxV5+  O moiety declines by forming a vanadyl species.
Upon reoxidation of OxV4+, a OxV5+  O2
 species should ini-
tially be formed (Fig. 9A, bottom line). This species is suggested
to be very short-lived because its EPR signal was not detected. It
can react with another OxV4+ or OxV3+ species to yield OxV5+  O
and OxV4+  O. Both species are observed by EPR in our study
(Fig. 2, spectra C and D).
When N2O reacted with reduced VOx species, no EPR-active
oxygen radical species were detected. Obviously, a hypothetic
Vn+  O intermediate, if formed at all, is too short-lived in this
case. Possible reaction pathways are summarized in Fig. 9B.
According to DFT results in [32], the reoxidation of OxV4+ with
N2O requires a ca. 100 kJ/mol higher activation energy compared
to that of (O)xV3+. Therefore, it was assumed that only OxV3+ spe-
cies can be reoxidized by N2O in the temperature range from 77
to 300 K. Both OxV5+@O and OxV4+ originating from OxV3+ are
EPR-silent, while OxV4+@O was experimentally observed.
The difference in the nature of surface oxygen species formed
from O2 and N2O could also be the reason for the different catalytic
performance observed in the ODH of propane over VOx/MCM-41
with O2 and N2O [13,14]. The higher activity but lower propene
selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2
,

2 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally
proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with
propene even completely already at room temperature. Since the
primary step of interaction of gas-phase O2 with a reduced VOx site
should not depend on temperature, it can be safely expected that
such species are also formed under true ODH conditions and react
even faster with the hydrocarbons. In addition, peroxovanadates
are also highly reactive for consecutive propene oxidation to COx
as theoretically predicted in [32]. In contrast, such highly reactive
species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably
proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might
also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP
reaction with N2O.
Interestingly, the fact whether O species are formed from O2
or N2O seems to depend very much on the nature of the catalyst.
Thus, Panov et al. have shown that the highly active a-oxygen spe-
cies in FeZSM-5, being able to oxidize benzene to phenol at room
temperature with almost 100% selectivity, are O species, too.
However, in contrast to VOx/SiO2 catalysts, O species in FeZSM-
5 are exclusively formed upon reoxidation of prereduced Fe2+ sites
by N2O, but not by O2 [3942]. This surprising difference could be
related to the different redox potential of the active metal ions and/
or to the local pore environment, in which the latter are located.
Further research is certainly needed to clarify this issue.
5. Conclusions
By EPR measurements under controlled atmosphere conditions
at two different microwave frequencies (X- and Q-band), the for-
mation of a Vn+  O (n = 4, 5) radical anion species has been de-
tected on the surface of a prereduced 2.7 wt.% VOx/MCM-41
catalyst after contact with gas-phase O2 and identified by spectra
simulation. The previously claimed formation of a molecular
Vn+  O2
 oxygen radical [27] could not be confirmed. The
Vn+  O species was found to be surprisingly stable in inert N2
atmosphere, being weakly visible even after 30 min at 348 K. How-
ever, it reacts to a considerable extent with C3H8 already at room
temperature and is completely consumed by C3H6 and CO under
the same conditions. In contrast, neither such paramagnetic
Vn+  O site nor any other EPR-active oxygen radical species could
be detected upon reoxidation of the same prereduced VOx/MCM-
41 by N2O. Since it is well known that N2O readily deposits its oxy-
gen on the surface of partially reduced oxide by releasing N2, it is
probable that this happens on prereduced VOx/MCM as well. From
the fact that no O is evidenced by EPR, we conclude that transfer
of a second electron might be very fast and a diamagnetic O2
oxide ion is formed and incorporated in the catalyst structure.
The higher activity and lower selectivity observed in the ODH of
propane with O2 in comparison with N2O is attributed to the pres-
ence of highly reactive electrophilic O species in the former case
(which preferentially burn propene), while nucleophilic, less active
but more selective O2 ions serve as reactants in ODH of propane
with N2O.
