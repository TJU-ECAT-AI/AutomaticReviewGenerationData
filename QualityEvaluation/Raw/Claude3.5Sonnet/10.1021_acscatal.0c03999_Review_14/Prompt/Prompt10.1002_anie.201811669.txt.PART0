Halogen-Dependent Surface Confinement Governs Selective Alkane Functionalization to Olefins
Graphical Abstract
Stuck to the surface: A molecular level understanding of the selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by combining kinetic analysis and advanced operando techniques with theoretical modeling. The spectrum of products observed in oxybromination is a consequence of a surface-confined reaction and radical-chain pathways governing ethane activation. Key: photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA).
Abstract
The product distribution in direct alkane functionalization by oxyhalogenation strongly depends on the halogen of choice. We demonstrate that the superior selectivity to olefins over an iron phosphate catalyst in oxychlorination is the consequence of a surface-confined reaction. By contrast, in oxybromination alkane activation follows a gas-phase radical-chain mechanism and yields a mixture of alkyl bromide, cracking, and combustion products. Surface-coverage analysis of the catalyst and identification of gas-phase radicals in operando mode are correlated to the catalytic performance by a multi-technique approach, which combines kinetic studies with advanced characterization techniques such as prompt-gamma activation analysis and photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy. Rationalization of gas-phase and surface contributions by density functional theory reveals that the molecular level effects of chlorine are pivotal in determining the stark selectivity differences. These results provide strategies for unraveling detailed mechanisms within complex reaction networks.
The development of novel technologies for the selective functionalization of light alkanes is a critical step to enable the utilization of natural gas as an energy vector in the transition between the oil and the renewables era.1 This pivotal advancement is limited by our understanding of the mechanisms governing the heterogeneously catalyzed reactions for direct hydrocarbon upgrading, which can provide design criteria for active, selective, and stable catalysts. In the case of light-alkane functionalizationgenerally requiring high temperatures and/or aggressive reactantsthe level of complexity is further amplified by the possibility of gas-phase reaction pathways, in which highly reactive radical species and/or radical initiators are liberated from the surface to generate desired and undesired products.2 A high level of selectivity control could be achieved if alkane activation were confined on a catalyst surface. However, to unravel reaction pathways, as well as reactive intermediates in gaseous and solid phases, and to model complex and dynamic surfaces at the atomic level, the combined use of strong experimental evidence with advanced theoretical approaches is required. Catalytic oxychlorination, which involves the reaction of an alkane with HCl and O2, has recently demonstrated selective (95%) generation of ethylene from ethane over a wide range of catalyst families,3 while the use of HBr as a halide source results in a range of products comprising alkyl bromide, CH4, and carbon oxides, among others.4 To understand the mechanistic origin of such selectivity control, we combined kinetic studies with operando surface-coverage quantification by prompt-gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and monitoring of gas-phase radicals by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), ultimately rationalized at the molecular level by density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Figure1). An iron phosphate catalyst was chosen because of its ability to selectively (97%) generate ethylene and propylene via alkane oxychlorination.3 Performance assessments in ethane oxychlorination (EOC) and oxybromination (EOB), under variable temperatures (573853K), revealed that the light-off curve for oxybromination was shifted to about 150Ka lower temperature compared to that obtained in oxychlorination (Figure2a) and in agreement with previous observations on other materials.4b Characterization of the material before and after catalysis by means of N2 sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the textural properties and the crystallographic structure were preserved (Supporting Information, FigureS1, TableS2). A comparison of the selectivity patterns obtained at a similar alkane conversion level (ca. 20%) showed that C2H4 is the major product (selectivity ca. 95%) when HCl is used as a halide source, while oxybromination led to the formation of C2H5Br, CH4, carbon oxides, and C2H4 (Figure2b; FigureS2). Both reactions are believed to follow a consecutive mechanism, where the alkyl halide is the intermediate to the olefin (FigureS2). Nevertheless, the observed selectivity differences might be caused by the more kinetically favorable elimination of HCl compared to HBr over a catalyst surface, as shown in catalytic methyl halide coupling.5 To probe this hypothesis, we conducted ethyl halide dehydrohalogenation to C2H4 over FePO4 (FigureS3) and observed that the light-off curve for C2H5Cl dehydrochlorination was shifted by about 40K, to lower temperature, compared to C2H5Br. When O2 and HX were co-fed with ethyl halide over FePO4 (Figure2c), dehydrochlorination led mainly to C2H4, while a competition between polybromination and dehydrobromination was evident for ethyl bromide. Additionally, catalytic hydrogen halide oxidation and gas-phase ethane halogenation were investigated so as to measure the ability of the catalyst to produce molecular halogen and the intrinsic reactivity of the halogen with the alkane at comparable conditions to oxyhalogenation (Figure2a; FigureS4). While chlorine-based reactions occurred in distinct temperature regions, the bromine-based analogues overlapped, which indicates that adsorbed HCl cannot evolve as Cl2 from the catalyst under typical oxychlorination conditions, in contrast to Br2 that can be generated during oxybromination. These findings suggest that ethane oxychlorination could occur via a surface-driven mechanism in which the adsorbed chlorine species might be important for the catalyst performance. On the contrary, gas-phase bromination with in-situ-generated bromine species is likely the preferred pathway for ethane activation in oxybromination.

The dotted gray lines denote the yield of product j and the different symbols refer to the reaction temperature. Conditions in (a) and (b): C2H6:HX(X2):O2: Ar:He=6:6(3):3(0):4.5:80.5(86.5), FT=100cm3min1, Wcat=1g, P=1bar. Conditions in (c): C2H5X:HX:O2:Ar:He=F1:6:3:4.5:85.5, FT=100cm3min1, Wcat=1g, P=1bar.
To address the impact of the halogen coverage on the performance, we conducted PGAA spectroscopy under operando conditions (for the principle of PGAA see SchemeS1), for which FePO4 is a suitable material because of its moderate neutron-capture cross-section.6 The experimental setup comprises a continuous-flow tubular reactor, where the catalyst is non-destructively irradiated with cold neutrons7 that are captured by the nuclei of all atoms in the sampling volume during the oxyhalogenation reaction. The de-excitation of the thus formed compound nuclei results in emission of prompt γ-rays with element-specific energies and with intensities that are proportional to the number of emitting atoms (Figure1). The quantified halogen uptake with respect to iron, and at variable temperatures and inlet HX concentrations, is correlated with the yield of ethylene in Figure3. In particular, at the onset of oxychlorination, FePO4 exhibited approximately 4.1mmolClmolFe1 chlorine uptake, which corresponds to 76% of surface iron sites occupied by chlorine. A rise in reaction temperature led to an increase of the yield of ethylene while the chlorine uptake decreased to approximately 3mmolClmolFe1 (equivalent to 55% surface coverage) and remained constant at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the bromine uptake at the onset of oxybromination at 573K reached full coverage at approximately 5.4mmolBrmolFe1, which drastically decreased to 2.5mmolBrmolFe1 at 633K. Further increase in temperature to 723K did not allow bromine uptake quantification because of statistically negligible halogen content, as corroborated by the absence of bromine in the used catalyst by elemental analysis (TableS2). Interestingly, an increment of the halide feed resulted in an increased olefin yield that correlated with a higher halogen coverage in oxychlorination, while the opposite trend was observed in oxybromination. To translate these observations into causality correlations, density functional theory calculations were performed on the experimentally relevant (102) surface of trigonal FePO4 (FigureS1). Cl2 and Cl. desorption are endothermic by 2.70eV and 2.66eV, respectively, indicating that chlorine atoms are persistent on the surface. In contrast, bromine can desorb as Br2 (ΔE=2.10eV), and even more favorably as Br. (ΔE=1.52eV, Figure5; FigureS5). Therefore, the evolution of bromine species is much more energetically favored compared to chlorine species, which explains the lower surface bromination under comparable reaction conditions (Figures2a and 3; FigureS5). These results suggest that gas-phase pathways can be initiated by the formation of bromine radicals, which were evidenced by the detection of Br2, Br., and C2H5. radicals by operando PEPICO (Figure4; FiguresS6S11). This spectroscopic technique, whose principle is schematized in SchemeS2, has recently revealed evidence of the gas-phase radical-chain routes in methane oxybromination.2e Therein, the gaseous species exiting the PEPICO reactor form a molecular beam that is skimmed and ionized by monochromatic vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation to yield photoelectrons and photoions that are detected in delayed coincidence. In this way, isomer-selective identification of reactants and products is permitted, including radical intermediates in both ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination (Figures1 and 4; FiguresS6S11).8 In particular, the evolution of signals corresponding to reaction intermediates, as a function of temperature, was correlated with that of the reaction products; while the Br2 signal decreased sharply, signals associated with C2H5. and Br. radicals increased along with C2H5Br, until 600K. At higher temperatures, the signal corresponding to C2H5Br dropped to zero, while that of the radicals and C2H4 increased, which is consistent with a higher rate of dehydrobromination compared to ethyl bromide generation (Figure4; FigureS8). On the other hand, neither Cl2 nor Cl. radicals were observed under oxychlorination conditions in the investigated temperature range (Figure4; FigureS6), which is in line with the DFT results. Furthermore, C2H5Cl decreased sharply with temperature while C2H4 increased, corroborating the occurrence of a consecutive mechanism in which ethane is transformed into ethyl halide that is consequently dehydrohalogenated to C2H4, as supported by steady-state experiments (FigureS2). Finally, measurements conducted using an empty reactor showed no production of radicals or products (FiguresS10 and S11).

More details on the working principles of this technique are summarized in SchemeS2. The left and right panels illustrate the representative mass spectra of reactants, products, and intermediate radical species detected in ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over FePO4 at 723K and 593K, respectively. Conditions: C2H6:HX:O2:Ar=2:2:1:17, FT=22cm3min1, Wcat=0.05 or 0g, P=2×102bar. The photon energies at which the signals of each chemical species were recorded in all PEPICO experiments are shown in FiguresS6-S11.
Computational investigations at the molecular level revealed that all the elementary steps in the gas-phase pathways of oxybromination were barrierless. Additionally, ethane or ethyl bromide activation with a Br. radical, to form HBr, is endothermic by only 0.5eV, while recombination of the produced radicals with Br. to form C2H5Br or C2H4Br2, which is occurring with a comparable collision frequency as activation, is strongly exothermic (>2.5eV, FigureS13). This implies that, once a bromine radical evolves from the surface, it will directly activate ethane or ethyl bromide, or consume any hydrocarbon radicals by recombination, thereby allowing inordinate polybromination instead of ethylene generation. Additionally, this mechanism of ethane activation can explain the apparent lower activation energy for ethane conversion in oxybromination (Figure2a), which consistently opposes the DFT results for surface-catalyzed alkane activation in this reaction (FigureS14). Nonetheless, C2H5. radicals were observed by operando PEPICO in oxychlorination as well, and its signal increased with the reaction temperature (Figure4). Its occurrence in oxychlorination, in which the gas-phase contributions are negligible, points to its role as an intermediate in the surface-confined mechanism, while its spectroscopic detection can be rationalized owing to its easy desorption from the catalyst (endothermic by 0.47eV, Figure5; FiguresS5 and S14S18), and the low reaction pressures (ca. 2×102bar). In general, surface oxyhalogenation reactions require an Fe site with a neighboring oxygen and its halogenated counterpart (the latter are more prominent in oxychlorination, as determined by operando PGAA (Figure3)), which are responsible for ethane activation and for ethyl halide dehydrohalogenation, respectively (FigureS14, TableS3). In particular, the former site allows for halogen-independent H stripping from ethane (Ea=0.61eV, Figure5), which is however unlikely to catalyze H stripping from ethyl halide (Ea>2.10eV, FigureS14). Ethyl halide is formed through barrierless halogen addition to a surface-bound C2H5. species (Figures S14S18), which entails that only a small fraction evolves to the gas-phase provided a halogen atom is close. Further transformation of ethyl halide to ethylene requires a halogenated Fe site, where the halogen strips a hydrogen and generates the halide, thus closing the halogen cycle and highlighting the importance of surface halogen coverage for olefin formation. A chlorinated site favors this step by 0.18eV over the brominated analogue (FigureS14)in line with the observed 40K light-off temperature shift in the dehydrohalogenation of ethyl halide (FigureS3). Furthermore, Cl stripping from the C2H4X intermediate to form C2H4 (Ea=0.67eV) is favored over Br stripping (Ea=1.50eV, FigureS14). However, considering the different extent of surface halogenation in oxychlorination and oxybromination (as determined by operando PGAA) and the possibility that a halogenated site enables concerted H and Cl abstraction from ethyl halide (FigureS14), which is favored over the individual steps by 0.29eV, the most likely situation is that dehydrochlorination occurs in a concerted pathway on a chlorinated Fe site, while dehydrobromination occurs on an oxidic site in two individual steps (Figure5; FiguresS16S18). Notably, in addition to the critical role that the halogen assumes in ethyl halide activation, it is even indirectly involved in ethane activation with oxygen, as evidenced by the complete absence of C2H5. radicals in the PEPICO studies with halide-free feeds (FiguresS7 and S9), and corroborated by the promoting effect of chlorine in oxidative dehydrogenation.2a, 9 This can be explained by the change of the oxidation state of iron upon halogen adsorption and the resulting structural rearrangement of the surface (FigureS19), as indicated by a Bader charge analysis (TableS4).10 Thus, these changes of the electronic structure allow easier ethane activation when spectator halogen species are presentin contrast to a clean surface where the ethane activation has to overcome a 1.11eV larger energy barrier.

In conclusion, we unraveled the mechanistic origin of the distinct selectivity patterns between ethane oxychlorination and oxybromination over iron phosphate by a multi-technique approach, which combined evidence from steady-state kinetics and operando PGAA and PEPICO spectroscopies, and was ultimately rationalized with theoretical calculations. The sharp selectivity control in oxychlorination is achieved by a purely surface-driven functionalization of ethane into ethyl chloride, which is further dehydrochlorinated to ethylene over a ClFe center. In contrast, alkane activation to ethyl bromide in oxybromination occurs in the gas-phase with evolved bromine and bromine radical species, thus leaving a halogen-free surface that is more prone to additional cracking and combustion pathways. These results demonstrate that chlorine-based processes hold great potential for one-step olefin production in technical scale and provide guidelines for catalyst design for direct alkane-to-olefins transformation via oxyhalogenation. Furthermore, the findings provide a strategy for unraveling the mechanistic picture in a complex reaction network, which is the typical scenario encountered in virtually all hydrocarbon functionalization processes.
