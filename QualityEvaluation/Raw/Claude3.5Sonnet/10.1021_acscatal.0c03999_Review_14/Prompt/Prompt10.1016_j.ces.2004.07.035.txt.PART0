Abstract
Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking. Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the
feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has
been analysed. In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM)
coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied. The TEOM provides information on activity, deactivation, and regeneration by
simultaneous measurement of reaction and mass changes. In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene
yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively.
This catalytic process leads to the simultaneous valorization of C3H8 and N2O and can be economically applied for on-site propylene
production using a low-cost source of N2O, e.g. in tail-gases of chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration.

1. Introduction
Propylene is mainly produced as a co-product in ethy-
lene steam crackers and gasoline-making fluidized catalytic
crackers. However, the growing demand of this olefin in the
modern petrochemical industry requires the development of
on-purpose propylene technologies, such as propane dehy-
drogenation and metathesis of ethylene and butylene, which
currently account for 23% of the global production (Tullo,
2003). Many recent studies have explored the catalytic ox-
idative dehydrogenation of light alkanes as a potential route
to the corresponding alkenes. For the oxidative dehydro-
genation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are
based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields

in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant (Watson
and Ozkan, 2000; Liu et al., 2001; Buyevskaya and Baerns,
2002; Pak et al., 2002).
A recent study has shown the superior performance of
steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane
oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and
Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,
2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were
achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over
V and Mo-based catalysts with O2. This reaction leads to
the functionalization of propane, a relatively cheap and
abundant feedstock, and utilization of N2O, an environ-
mentally harmful gas. The remarkable performance of
Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as
a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined
iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic
oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane

(Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). A major draw-
back of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by
coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, al-
though the original catalytic activity was completely recov-
ered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min
(Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003).

On this basis, the present work was undertaken to evaluate
the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continu-
ous C3H6 production via ODHP with N2O using Fe-zeolites.
This was achieved in a configuration of two fixed-bed re-
actors in parallel with alternation of reaction and regener-
ation steps. The tapered element oscillating microbalance
(TEOM) technique was applied to evaluate catalytic perfor-
mance, deactivation, and regeneration, in order to rationally
design the cyclic process.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
The hydrothermal syntheses of FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite,
and Fe-beta have been described elsewhere (Prez-Ramrez
et al., 2002, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas,
2004). The as-synthesized samples were calcined in
air and activated in flowing steam (30 vol % H2O and
30 ml STP min1 of N2) at ambient pressure and 873 K
during 5 h. The iron content in the samples is very similar
(Table 1), enabling a direct comparison of catalytic perfor-
mances.

dN2O and C3H8 conversions were calculated from the amount of N2 formed and C3H8 reacted, respectively.
ePropene yield and selectivity were calculated as Y(C3H6) = C(C3H6)/Co(C3H8) and S(C3H6) = Y(C3H6)/X(C3H8), respectively, where C(C3H6)
is the outlet propene concentration at a certain time, Co(C3H8) is the inlet concentration of propane, and X(C3H8) is the conversion of propane.
fCoke content determined as Ccoke = mcoke/mo = (mt md)/mo, where mo is the initial sample amount. The total mass uptake mt measured
by the TEOM includes the amount of coke formed (mcoke) and the mass change of the gas density in the tapered element (md).
2.2. TEOM studies
Reaction, coke deactivation, and regeneration studies were
carried out in a Rupprecht and Patashnick TEOM 1500 pulse
mass analyser (Fig. 1). The TEOM consists of a microre-
actor (4 mm i.d.) with a high-resolution microbalance that
generates real-time measurements of mass changes during
gassolid reactions (Chen et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 1998; Gem-
bicki et al., 2003). The TEOM microbalance measures mass
changes based on inertial forces, presenting various key ad-
vantages over conventional gravimetric microbalances: (i)
a well-defined flow profile, eliminating possible (heat and
mass) diffusion and buoyancy phenomena, (ii) a very fast
response time resolution (0.1 s), and (iii) a high mass reso-
lution across the entire range of pressure and temperature.
The TEOM reactor was loaded with 30 mg of catalyst
(sieve fraction 125200 m), firmly packed between two
plugs of quartz wool. Prior to experiments the catalysts were
pretreated in flowing He at the reaction temperature for
2 h. When stable baseline was reached, He was replaced by
the reaction mixture, and mass changes and product gases
were continuously monitored. Equal flows of purge gas (He)
and reaction gas of 200 ml min1 were used (see Fig. 1)
and the feed gases were pretreated at 423 K. The ODHP
with N2O was carried out at 673773 K in a mixture of
100 mbar C3H8 and 100 mbar N2O in He at a total pressure
of P = 2 bar and a weight-hourly space velocity (WHSV)
of 400, 000 ml h1 g1
cat. The coke content (Ccoke) was de-
termined from the mass change measured during reaction,
accounting for the mass change caused by the change of gas
density in the tapered element when He was replaced by
the reaction mixture. The product gases were analysed by
an on-line micro-GC (Chrompack CP-2002) equipped with
a TCD, using Poraplot Q and Molsieve 5A columns.
Regeneration of the coked zeolites in air (200 ml min1)
was investigated by following mass changes in two ways:

2.3. Cyclically-operated reactor
Cyclic experiments for continuous propene production
were carried out in the set-up shown in Fig. 2, which ba-
sically consists of three feed sections: purge (He), reaction
(N2O + C3H8 in He), and regeneration (O2 + He), and
two parallel fixed-bed quartz reactors (4 mm i.d.) with inde-
pendent feed and temperature control. The feed section to
each reactor can be selected by means of an arrangement
of multi-port valves and a sequence of cycles can be fully
programmed. Cyclic experiments were conducted according
to the pattern in Fig. 3. After catalyst pretreatment in flow-
ing He at the reaction temperature (Trx), the reaction mix-
ture was fed to reactor 1. When the catalyst in this reactor
deactivates after a period of trx, the reaction mixture was
switched to reactor 2 and the temperature in reactor 1 was
increased to Trg in He. Once this temperature was reached
and stabilized, a mixture of 20 vol % O2 in He was intro-
duced for catalyst regeneration during a period of trg. Af-
terwards, the temperature in reactor 1 was decreased to Trx
and a new reaction step was initiated. This completes one
cycle (tcycle =trx +tp1 +trg +tp2), which is successively re-
peated. In order to ensure continuous production of propene,
the above steps were synchronized so that the reactor 2 is
under reaction during regeneration and purging of reactor
1 and vice versa (see sketches in Fig. 3). This can be ful-
filled if [trx]reactor1 = [tp1 + trg + tp2]reactor2. The conditions
applied in these tests were the same as in the TEOM experi-
ments. Micro-GC analysis (Agilent QUADH) monitored the
gas effluent from the catalytic reactor under reaction.

data after 2 min on stream (denoted as initial, to) and af-
ter 400 min on stream (denoted as residual or final, tf )
are summarized in Table 1. The initial performance of the
steam-activated iron zeolites was similar, regardless of the
host, the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the differ-
ent form(s) of extraframework iron species (Prez-Ramrez
and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields in the
range of 1922% at 723 K were achieved, with a similar de-
gree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectiv-
ity (ca. 50%), and complete N2O conversion. Other impor-
tant reaction products were CO2 and propionaldehyde, and
small concentrations of CO, C2H4, C2H6, CH4, acrolein,
and acetone were also detected. The interaction of C3H8
with the iron zeolites in the absence of N2O did not lead
to propene production, indicating the essential role of the
oxygen species from N2O for propane dehydrogenation.
The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the
zeolites
studied,
decreasing
in
the
order:
Fe-beta >
Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5. An excellent correlation is ob-
tained between the increase of coke content and the decrease
of propene yield with time on stream. This strongly suggests
that coke formation is responsible for catalyst deactivation,
causing poisoning of active iron species or pore blockage.
The yield of propene over Fe-beta rapidly decreases during
the first 5 min on stream and is completely deactivated after
50 min, with a subsequent plateau in the coking profile. The
rate deactivation of Fe-silicalite is significantly reduced,
which is coupled with the more gradual increase of the coke
content. FeZSM-5 exhibits a remarkable resistance towards
deactivation, showing an increase in propene yield from 22
to 25% during the first 20 min on stream. This high C3H6
yield is maintained during 75 min, whilst Fe-silicalite or
Fe-beta were severely or completely deactivated after this
period on stream. In addition, a residual propene yield of
8% was obtained over FeZSM-5 after 400 min on stream.
The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron
zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The
behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active
iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation.
In general, the sudden drop of the propylene yield takes
place at a characteristic time for each zeolite and coincides
with a decreased slope of the coking profile, reflecting a
lower rate of coke formation. Coke formation originates
from polymerization and dehydrogenation (condensation)
of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts
investigated. Ethylene concentrations in the product gas
were 15 times lower than propylene. These reactions leave
a layer of highly hydrogen deficient carbonaceous material
on the catalyst surface, making the active sites inaccessible.
Accordingly, the amount of coke should give an indication
of the catalyst efficiency towards ODHP. In agreement with
this, the final coke content in FeZSM-5 was ca. 3 times
higher than in Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta.
The influence of the reaction temperature on the catalytic
performance and time-scale for deactivation was investi-
gated over FeZSM-5 (Table 1 and Fig. 5). The initial N2O
conversion and 773 K increases from 76% at 673 K to 100%
at 723 K, while the increase in C3H8 conversion is much
less pronounced (from 40% to 50%) and does not increase
further at 773 K. The initial and residual conversion of re-
actants at 723 and 773 K was very similar and does not in-
crease further at 773 K. Although the initial (2022%) and
residual propene yields (710%) showed no significant dif-
ferences, the rate of deactivation is reduced with an increase
in temperature. At 773 K, a propene yield > 20% was pre-
served during 200 min, in contrast to the rapid deactivation
at 698 K (10 min). In all cases, the decrease of propene yield
is coupled with the decrease of C3H8 and N2O conversions.
The inflection point in the coking profiles at the time of the
drop of the propene yield at 673 and 723 K was not ob-
served at 773 K, where the slower decrease of propene yield
is coupled with a more gradual increase of the coke amount.
The final amount of coke at 723 and 773 K is compara-
ble, being 4 times higher than at 673 K. The lower rate of

deactivation at 773 K is associated with the high degree of
N2O conversion, showing a residual degree of conversion of
75% as compared to 25% and 15% at 723 and 673 K, respec-
tively. Upon N2O decomposition, adsorbed atomic oxygen
or desorbed O2 participates, at least partially, in the regen-
eration of the zeolite surface by oxidation of coke. This was
supported by the analysis of CO2 at the reactor outlet (not
shown). Ivanov et al. (2003) have concluded that N2O shows
a higher activity in coke oxidation than O2 for regeneration
of coke deposits in FeZSM-5 during the selective oxidation
of benzene to phenol with N2O.
3.2. Regeneration of coked zeolites
Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation poses the
problem of catalytic activity restoration, which is com-
monly reached via oxidative treatment of coke catalyst
with air or oxygen-containing mixtures at high tempera-
tures. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) as well
as isothermal oxidation experiments in air were carried out
in order to determine the optimal regeneration conditions
(temperature and duration) of the coke-deactivated zeolites.
The inset in Fig. 6 shows the weight loss during TPO ex-
periments over FeZSM-5 after ODHP reaction at 723 K for
400 min. Coke oxidation occurs in the temperature range of
650900 K, and the derivative of the weight loss shows a
maximum at 795 K and a shoulder at slightly higher tem-
perature. With these data, isothermal regeneration in the
temperature range of 723823 K can be applied to further
establish the duration of the regeneration step. The coke con-
version vs. time characteristics in Fig. 6 were obtained over
FeZSM-5 having the same initial coke amount (20 wt.%,
after ODHP at 723 K for 400 min). In good agreement with
TPO results, regeneration at 823 K is extremely fast, with a
total conversion of coke in ca. 2 min. The time needed for
complete combustion of coke is significantly increased at a
lower temperature, requiring ca. 50 and 100 min at 773 and
723 K, respectively.
3.3. Performance of regenerated zeolites
The results presented so far have been obtained over fresh
zeolite catalysts. It is important to analyse the catalytic per-
formance after various reaction and regeneration runs in

the TEOM with the same zeolite sample. The ODHP per-
formance of regenerated FeZSM-5 at 723 K is shown in
Fig. 5. This sample was obtained after reaction at 723 K dur-
ing 400 min, followed by a temperature ramp in He to 823 K
(10 K min1), air-regeneration at 823 K for 5 min, and cool-
ing in He to 723 K (10 K min1). In agreement with previ-
ous observations (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003),
the initial performance is completely recovered after regen-
eration. However, the regenerated catalyst deactivates much
faster than the fresh one, with a final amount of coke 4 times
lower in the regenerated catalyst. Remarkably, the resid-
ual propylene yield over fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 is
very similar. This behaviour was observed at regeneration
temperatures in the range of 723823 K. The performance
of regenerated FeZSM-5 was reproducible in subsequent
reactionregeneration steps (10 cycles were performed), so
the catalyst is apparently stabilized after the first cycle,
which induces certain irreversible changes in the catalyst.
Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be
caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest
case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactiva-
tion can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of ac-
tive sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites,
(iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space. The initial
and residual propene yield levels over FeZSM-5 were very
similar, suggesting that the number of active sites in the be-
ginning of the reaction and in steady-state conditions is not
reduced in the regenerated samples. However, the different
dynamics of deactivation may be related to a fraction of the
active species which is more susceptible towards deactiva-
tion or which is not participating in the reaction due to a re-
duced accessibility. A detailed characterization of the spent
and regenerated zeolites, as well as the mechanism, nature,
and location of coke formation is required to further assess
the deactivation mechanism, as well as to design measures
to maintain the remarkable stability of the fresh FeZSM-5
catalyst in the first period of the ODHP reaction.
3.4. Cyclic experiments for continuous propylene
production
The best action to decrease the rate of coke deactivation
is to tailor catalyst properties such as active phase, the tex-
ture, the diffusion length, and reaction conditions (Moulijn
et al., 2001). Following the results of Chaki et al. (2003),
addition of O2 in the feed may minimize or even suppress
the formation of carbonaceous deposits in the reaction of
C2H4 and N2O over FeZSM-5. Previous studies have con-
cluded that the ODH of propane with O2 leads to low C3H6
yields (< 5%) (Nowi
nska et al., 2003; Kondratenko and
Prez-Ramrez, 2004), which further highlights the speci-
ficity of N2O as monooxygen donor in the ODHP reac-
tion over Fe-zeolites. We have investigated the effect of
adding a relatively low oxygen amount to the reaction mix-
ture (C3H8/N2O/O2/He = 5/5/1/89) over Fe-silicalite at
723 K. The initial C3H8 conversion was very similar than in
C3H8/N2O/He=5/5/90 (ca. 40%), but the C3H6 selectivity
decreased from 52% to 30% (in favour of COx production).
Accordingly, a low initial propylene yield (12%) is obtained
in the presence of O2, as a consequence of cracking and
combustion of reaction intermediates leading to propene.
Alternatively, chemical reaction engineering solutions can
be applied to restore the catalyst activity, using dedicated
reactors with catalyst moving from a reaction zone and a
regeneration zone. There is a relation between time-scale
of deactivation and choice of reactor (Moulijn et al., 2001;
Gembicki et al., 2003). In this manuscript the feasibility
of a process for continuous propylene production has been
demonstrated in a cyclically-operated reactor with two fixed-
bed reactors in parallel (Fig. 2). In view of the rapid deac-
tivation of Fe-beta and Fe-silicalite, FeZSM-5 is the only
candidate to realistically evaluate the cyclic process. Fig. 7
clearly shows that propene yields > 20% can be maintained
over FeZSM-5 during 2000 min by alternation of the reaction
and regeneration cycles. The parameters of the sequence in
Fig. 3 were selected based on the TEOM experiments de-
scribed above. Particularly for the example in Fig. 7, reaction
was carried out at Trx =723 K for trx =25 min. The duration
of the regeneration step was 25 min and includes the com-
bustion of coke at Trg = 823 K for trg = 5 min as well as the
steps for conditioning the reactor temperature between reac-
tion and regeneration steps (tp1 + tp2 = 20 min). With these
settings, reaction and regeneration can be effective coupled
to ensure continuous propene production at the desired yield.
The cycle duration is then 50 min (40 cycles are shown in
Fig. 7). This novel catalytic process can be economically ap-
plied in tail-gases of specific chemical processes, e.g. those
using HNO3 as oxidizing agent, where N2O is produced in
high concentration (typically 2540 vol %).

production via N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation over
Fe-zeolites. Reaction takes place in reactors 14 and regeneration in
reactor 5.
In practical terms, it would be preferable to apply equal
reaction and regeneration temperatures. This cannot be
achieved with only two reactors in parallel, since a complete
catalyst regeneration at 723 K will require 100 min, 4 times
longer than the reaction period of 25 min, and thus effective
coupling for continuous propene production cannot be ac-
complished. This can be overcome with a battery of parallel
reactors (Fig. 8). This configuration is based on the cyclic
Catofin process (Lummus) for non-oxidative dehydrogena-
tion of alkanes into isobutylene, propylene, and amylenes
over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, where three to eight fixed-bed
reactors in parallel are alternatively on stream for reaction
and off stream for regeneration by coke burn-off (Badoni
et al., 1996; Moulijn et al., 2001). In this process, the cycle
time between reaction and regeneration mode is typically
between 10 and 30 min. This process integrates part of
the heat during regeneration (exothermic) in the reaction
(endothermic). In our case, however, both reaction and re-
generation processes are exothermic, which is less optimal
from a heat management standpoint. Other reactor config-
urations, commercially applied in alkane dehydrogenation,
include radial-flow moving-bed reactors connected in se-
ries (Oleflex, UOP), fluidized-bed reactor with regenerator
(FBD-4, Snamprogetti), or multiple fixed-bed tubular re-
actor in a firebox (STAR, Philips). Different engineering
options are possible for the same problem, depending on
factors such as choice of catalyst, relation between chosen
process conditions and catalyst deactivation, and company
experience.
4. Conclusions
A cyclically-operated process for continuous production
of propylene via ODHP with N2O over steam-activated iron
zeolites has been developed. Fe-zeolites are highly effi-
cient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
using N2O, with initial propene yields in the range of
2025% at 723773 K, but they deactivate due to coke
formation. The deactivation process is strongly influenced
by the zeolite host and the reaction temperature. TEOM
studies were essential to correlate activity and deactivation
by simultaneous measurements of reaction and coking, as
well as to appraise catalyst regeneration. This information
was used to rationally design the reaction and regeneration
sequences in the cyclic process. The continuous propene
production via a cyclically-operated process was demon-
strated over FeZSM-5, where propene yields > 20% were
achieved during a period of 2000 min, in a configuration
of two fixed-bed reactors in parallel with alternation of re-
action (at 723 K) and regeneration (at 823 K) cycles. This
novel catalytic process leads to the simultaneous function-
alization of C3H8 and utilization of N2O.
