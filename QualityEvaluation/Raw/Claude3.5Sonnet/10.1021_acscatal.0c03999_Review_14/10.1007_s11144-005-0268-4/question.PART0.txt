Abstract
Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in carbon dioxide was investigated over
promoted Cr/SiO2. The results showed that the catalysts were effective for the
reaction and CO2 in the feed promoted the catalytic activity. XRD, TPR and
microcalorimetric adsorption techniques were used to study the structure and
surface acidity of the catalysts.  It was found that the surface acidity decreased
with the increase of K in the Cr/SiO2 and led to the increase of selectivity toward
propylene. A propane conversion of 31% with 91% selectivity to propylene over
the 5%Cr-0.4%K/SiO2 catalyst was observed at 923 K with CO2 /C3H8 molar ratio
of 3.6.

INTRODUCTION
 
The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial
applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and
other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks. The
activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation
of alkanes have been known for many years, and recently the investigations of
the catalytic activity of Cr/SiO2 for the dehydrogenation of propane using
carbon dioxide as oxidant have been reported [18]. In the  dehydrogenation

reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting
propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke
formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the
concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction. In situ ESR
and UV-Vis DRS measurements [9] indicated that the active centers in the
CrOX/SiO2 catalysts for the reaction might be related to Cr5+ or Cr6+species,
which might be generated by the oxidation of Cr3+ species. One of the roles of
CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction. In this work, we
investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over silica
supported chromium oxide catalysts modified by alkali and alkaline earth
oxides.
EXPERIMENTAL
 
Supported chromium oxide was prepared by the incipient wetness
impregnation with aqueous solution of chromium nitrate. The Cr loading was
about 5 wt.%. Supported chromium oxide samples were then impregnated with
nitrates of alkali, alkaline earth or other transition metals. The samples were
dried at 393 K for 12 h and then calcined at 973 K in air for 6 h. A series of
potassium-doped Cr/SiO2 catalysts with loadings of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.0%,
were prepared.
 
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were conducted in a
fixed-bed reactor loaded with about 20 mg of a sample. The sample was
reduced in 5%H2/N2 flow at a rate of 20 mL/min from ambient temperature to
1023 K at a heating rate of 10 K/min. Microcalorimetric studies of the
adsorption of NH3 were carried out using a Tian-Calvet heat-flux apparatus,
which has been described elsewhere [10]. The microcalorimeter was connected
to a gas-handling and volumetric adsorption system, equipped with a Baratron
capacitance manometer for precision pressure measurement. The differential
heat of adsorption vs adsorbate coverage was obtained by measuring the heats
evolved while a dose of gas (25 mol) was admitted onto the catalyst and the
operation was continued until the surface was saturated by the adsorbate. Before
microcalorimetric measurements, the samples were typically dried under
vacuum at 573 K for 1 h, calcined in 500 Torr O2 at 723 K for 2 h, and
evacuated at 723 K for 2 h. Microcalorimetric adsorption of ammonia was
performed at 423 K.
 
The reactions of dehydrogenation of propane were carried out in a steady-
state microreactor system operating at atmospheric pressure. The typical feed
gas consisted of CO2 (or N2) and C3H8 with the molar ratio of 3.6. About 0.2 g
20  40 mesh catalyst was used in each run, which renders a gas hourly space
velocity of 2800 h-1. The reaction effluent was analyzed using an on-line gas

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
 
We first tested the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence
of carbon dioxide over chromia on different supports (Table 1). It is seen that
the unsupported chromia catalyst was not active comparing with the supported
ones. This revealed the importance of support for the reaction over chromia.
The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed selectivity to propylene of about 100%, but the
conversion of propane on this catalyst was low (4.8%) at 923 K. In contrast, the
5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst showed a high conversion of propane (46.5%), but the
selectivity to propylene was low (76.1%). The conversion of propane increased
while the selectivity to propylene decreased over the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst with
the increase of reaction temperature. This is apparent since the cracking reaction

aggravates at elevated temperatures to increase the formation of methane. In a
general way, the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst behaved quite well for the
dehydrogenation of propane in CO2. The conversion of propane and the
selectivity to propylene reached 27% and 85%, respectively, at 923 K. Table 1
also showed that the addition of Ni, La and Fe improved the selectivity of
propylene, with the compensation of decreased conversion of propane. The
catalyst with only Fe as the active component showed high cracking activity.
 
The dehydrogenation of propane with or without the presence of carbon
dioxide over Cr/SiO2 modified by alkali and alkaline-earth oxides were
investigated under similar conditions. The catalytic stabilities of the catalysts at
923 K  are shown in Fig. 1.  When the reaction was conducted in N2  (Fig. 1a),

the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2
catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of
propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of
carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b). For example, the initial conversion of propane was
increased from 14.7% in N2 to 31.3% in CO2 over the Cr-K/SiO2 catalyst at
923 K. In addition, the Cr-K/SiO2 catalyst maintained about 13% conversion of
propane after 180 min in CO2 without lowering the selectivity to propylene. It
was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the
dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon

deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present. This suggests that
CO2 favors the dehydrogenation of propane and inhibits carbon deposits. The
activity seemed to follow the order of Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 >
Cr-Ba/SiO2.
 
Table 2 shows the effect of K on the reaction behavior of the Cr-K/SiO2
catalysts at 923 K. It is seen that the conversion of propane was decreased,
while the selectivity to propylene was altered with the increase of K. There
might be an optimum K loading at which the catalytic reaction reached the
highest yield and selectivity to propylene. The optimized K loading seemed
around 0.2-0.4%. Higher loading of K decreased the selectivity to propylene,
which could reach 100% while maintaining 22% conversion of propane with
about 0.2% of K.
 
α-Cr2O3 phase was observed in the Cr/SiO2 catalysts by their XRD results
(not given). For the Cr-K/SiO2 catalysts, the XRD patterns showed the two
phases of  Cr2O3 and K2CrO4, indicating the surface reaction between Cr and K
to form K2CrO4. TPR profiles of the Cr/SiO2 and Cr-K/SiO2 catalysts are given
in Fig. 2. The Cr/SiO2 exhibited a main peak around 693 K and a shoulder peak
around 593 K. The temperatures of these peaks increased with the increase of K
loading. The results indicated that the addition of K decreased the redox
potential, which resulted in the lower conversion of propane.

The differential heats of adsorption of NH3 over the Cr/SiO2 and Cr-K/SiO2
catalysts are given in Fig.3. Silica showed the low adsorption heat of about 50
kJ/mol (not shown in Fig. 3), revealing  the weak surface acidity of silica [10].
The Cr/SiO2 showed the initial heat of about 82 kJ/mol and the saturation
coverage of about 325 mol/g for NH3 adsorption. This result indicated that the
dispersion of chromium oxides on the surface of SiO2 produced significant
amount of acid sites. The addition of K decreased the strength of the acid sites.
The 5%Cr-0.2%K/SiO2 showed the initial heat of 75 kJ/mol and the saturation
coverage of about 230 mol/g for NH3 adsorption. The number of acid sites was
further decreased to 140 mol/g when the loading of K was increased to 0.4%.
The acidic sites were almost disappeared when K loading was increased to 1%.

CONCLUSION
 
The modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts were found to be effective and selective for
the dehydrogenation of propane in CO2. The presence of CO2 promoted the
catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of
H2 and inhibiting the coke formation. Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal
oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the
redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of
propane and an increased selectivity to propylene. The effect depended on the
nature and loading of the alkali and alkaline-earth metals. The addition of K

significantly improved the selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The
optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2
catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane
of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K
with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6.
