[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[4] "The activity seemed to follow the order of Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2."

[5] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."

This literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant over modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts, rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using various catalyst systems. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete answer to the question based solely on this document.

However, some relevant insights from the literature include:

1. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in propane dehydrogenation shows promise, as it increases equilibrium conversion, maintains catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, and enhances propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

2. Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides were investigated. The activity order was found to be Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2.

3. The addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified surface properties, decreased redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

4. Optimizing the loading of promoters (e.g., K) can improve catalyst performance. For Cr-K/SiO2 catalysts, the optimal K loading was found to be around 0.2-0.4%, achieving propane conversion of 22-31% and propylene selectivity of 91-100% at 923 K.

The document does not discuss persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or specific strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, additional literature on ODHP using various catalyst systems and addressing current challenges would be needed.

这篇文献主要关注使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂在改性Cr/SiO2催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢制丙烯的研究，而不是提供关于使用各种催化剂系统进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展的全面分析。因此，仅基于这份文献，我无法对该问题提供完整的答案。

然而，从文献中可以得到一些相关的见解：

1. 使用CO2作为软氧化剂进行丙烷脱氢显示出很大潜力，因为它可以增加平衡转化率，通过抑制积碳来维持催化剂活性，并通过逆水气变换反应提高丙烷转化率。

2. 研究了用碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂。活性顺序为Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2。

3. 向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改变了表面性质，降低了氧化还原电位和表面酸度，导致丙烷转化率降低但丙烯选择性提高。

4. 优化助剂（如K）的负载量可以改善催化剂性能。对于Cr-K/SiO2催化剂，最佳K负载量在0.2-0.4%左右，在923 K下可实现22-31%的丙烷转化率和91-100%的丙烯选择性。

该文献未讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性，或改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及改进反应系统的具体策略。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的关于使用各种催化剂系统进行ODHP和解决当前挑战的文献。
