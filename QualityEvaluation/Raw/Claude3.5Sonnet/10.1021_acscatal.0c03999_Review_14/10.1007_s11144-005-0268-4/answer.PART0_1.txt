[1] "We first tested the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide over chromia on different supports (Table 1)."

[2] "The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed selectivity to propylene of about 100%, but the conversion of propane on this catalyst was low (4.8%) at 923 K."

[3] "In contrast, the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst showed a high conversion of propane (46.5%), but the selectivity to propylene was low (76.1%)."

[4] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[5] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present."

[6] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."

This literature primarily focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as a soft oxidant over various chromium-based catalysts. While it doesn't cover the full range of catalysts mentioned in the question, it does provide some insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants.

The study compares the performance of chromium catalysts on different supports, including TiO2, ZrO2, and SiO2. The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed high selectivity (100%) but low conversion (4.8%), while the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated high conversion (46.5%) but lower selectivity (76.1%). The Cr/SiO2 catalyst, when modified with alkali metals like potassium, showed a good balance of conversion and selectivity.

The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant improved both conversion and selectivity compared to using N2. CO2 also helped maintain catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation and reducing H2 concentration.

Challenges in this field, as indicated by the study, include catalyst deactivation and carbon deposition. The research shows that using CO2 as an oxidant can help address these issues.

For future research and development, the study suggests several key areas:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition: The addition of alkali metals (e.g., potassium) to Cr/SiO2 catalysts improved selectivity, indicating that further research into catalyst modifications could yield better results.

2. Improving C-H bond activation: While not explicitly mentioned, the varying performance of different catalysts suggests that enhancing C-H bond activation is a crucial area for improvement.

3. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: The study shows that CO2 helps maintain catalyst activity by preventing carbon deposition, suggesting that further research into oxidant selection and reaction conditions could improve catalyst longevity.

4. Optimizing reaction systems: The research demonstrates that reaction conditions, such as the presence of CO2, significantly affect ODHP processes. Future work could focus on fine-tuning these conditions for optimal performance.

While the study doesn't address all aspects of the question, it provides valuable insights into the use of soft oxidants (CO2) in ODHP and highlights the importance of catalyst design and reaction conditions in improving the process.

这篇文献主要关注使用CO2作为软氧化剂在各种铬基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢制丙烯的研究。虽然它没有涵盖问题中提到的所有催化剂，但确实为使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展提供了一些见解。

研究比较了不同载体上的铬催化剂的性能，包括TiO2、ZrO2和SiO2。5%Cr/TiO2催化剂显示出高选择性（100%）但低转化率（4.8%），而5%Cr/ZrO2催化剂表现出高转化率（46.5%）但较低的选择性（76.1%）。当用钾等碱金属改性时，Cr/SiO2催化剂在转化率和选择性之间显示出良好的平衡。

与使用N2相比，使用CO2作为软氧化剂能够提高转化率和选择性。CO2还通过抑制积碳形成和降低H2浓度来帮助维持催化剂活性。

研究表明，该领域的挑战包括催化剂失活和碳沉积。研究显示，使用CO2作为氧化剂可以帮助解决这些问题。

对于未来的研究和开发，该研究提出了几个关键领域：

1. 优化催化剂组成：向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属（如钾）提高了选择性，这表明对催化剂改性的进一步研究可能会产生更好的结果。

2. 改善C-H键活化：虽然没有明确提及，但不同催化剂的性能差异表明，提高C-H键活化是一个关键的改进领域。

3. 增强催化剂再生能力：研究表明，CO2通过防止碳沉积来帮助维持催化剂活性，这表明对氧化剂选择和反应条件的进一步研究可以提高催化剂寿命。

4. 优化反应系统：研究表明，反应条件（如CO2的存在）显著影响ODHP过程。未来的工作可以集中在微调这些条件以获得最佳性能。

虽然这项研究没有涉及问题的所有方面，但它为在ODHP中使用软氧化剂（CO2）提供了宝贵的见解，并强调了催化剂设计和反应条件在改进过程中的重要性。
