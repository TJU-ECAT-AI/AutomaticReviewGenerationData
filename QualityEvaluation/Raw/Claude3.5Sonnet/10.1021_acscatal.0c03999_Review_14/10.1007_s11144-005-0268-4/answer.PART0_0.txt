[1] "In this work, we investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over silica supported chromium oxide catalysts modified by alkali and alkaline earth oxides."

[2] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

[3] "The activity seemed to follow the order of Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2."

[4] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."

[5] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

The literature provides limited information on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant over modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

In terms of catalyst performance:

1. Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline earth oxides were effective for propane dehydrogenation in CO2.

2. The presence of CO2 enhanced both propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to reactions conducted in N2.

3. Catalyst activity order: Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2.

4. Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cr/SiO2 catalysts decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

5. Optimized K-modified catalysts (5%Cr-0.2-0.4%K/SiO2) showed propane conversion of 22-31% and propylene selectivity of 91-100% at 923 K.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges or future research directions for ODHP. However, it demonstrates the potential of using CO2 as a soft oxidant and the importance of catalyst modification to improve selectivity.

To fully answer the question, more comprehensive research on various catalyst systems, including other transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, would be needed. Additionally, information on challenges such as corrosiveness and strategies for improving C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and reaction system optimization is not provided in this specific literature.

这篇文献对于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展提供了有限的信息。该研究主要关注使用CO2作为氧化剂，在改性Cr/SiO2催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢。

就催化剂性能而言：

1. 经碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂对CO2中的丙烷脱氢反应有效。

2. 与在N2中进行的反应相比，CO2的存在提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 催化剂活性顺序：Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2。

4. 向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属和碱土金属氧化物降低了丙烷转化率，但提高了丙烯选择性。

5. 优化的K改性催化剂(5%Cr-0.2-0.4%K/SiO2)在923 K下表现出22-31%的丙烷转化率和91-100%的丙烯选择性。

这项研究没有直接讨论ODHP的持续挑战或未来研究方向。然而，它展示了使用CO2作为软氧化剂的潜力，以及改性催化剂提高选择性的重要性。

要全面回答这个问题，需要对各种催化剂系统进行更全面的研究，包括其他过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。此外，这篇特定文献中没有提供关于腐蚀性等挑战以及改善C-H键活化、催化剂再生能力和反应系统优化策略的信息。
