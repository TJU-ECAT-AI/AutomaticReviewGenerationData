[1] "In this work, we investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over silica supported chromium oxide catalysts modified by alkali and alkaline earth oxides."

[2] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min. In contrast, both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene were enhanced with the presence of carbon dioxide (Fig. 1b)."

The literature provides limited information on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The study focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant over modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

In terms of catalyst performance:

1. Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline earth oxides were effective for propane dehydrogenation in CO2.

2. The presence of CO2 enhanced both propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to reactions conducted in N2.

3. Catalyst activity order: Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2.

4. Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cr/SiO2 catalysts decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

5. Optimized K-modified catalysts (5%Cr-0.2-0.4%K/SiO2) showed propane conversion of 22-31% and propylene selectivity of 91-100% at 923 K.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges or future research directions for ODHP. However, it demonstrates the potential of using CO2 as a soft oxidant and the importance of catalyst modification to improve selectivity.

To fully answer the question, more comprehensive research on various catalyst systems, including other transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides, would be needed. Additionally, information on challenges such as corrosiveness and strategies for improving C-H bond activation, catalyst regenerability, and reaction system optimization is not provided in this specific literature.

[1] "We first tested the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of carbon dioxide over chromia on different supports (Table 1)."

[2] "The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed selectivity to propylene of about 100%, but the conversion of propane on this catalyst was low (4.8%) at 923 K."

[3] "In contrast, the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst showed a high conversion of propane (46.5%), but the selectivity to propylene was low (76.1%)."

[4] "When the reaction was conducted in N2 (Fig. 1a), the conversion of propane was low, and the Cr-Mg/SiO2 and Cr-Ca/SiO2 catalysts deactivated completely in 120 min.

This literature primarily focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using CO2 as a soft oxidant over various chromium-based catalysts. While it doesn't cover the full range of catalysts mentioned in the question, it does provide some insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants.

The study compares the performance of chromium catalysts on different supports, including TiO2, ZrO2, and SiO2. The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed high selectivity (100%) but low conversion (4.8%), while the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated high conversion (46.5%) but lower selectivity (76.1%). The Cr/SiO2 catalyst, when modified with alkali metals like potassium, showed a good balance of conversion and selectivity.

The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant improved both conversion and selectivity compared to using N2. CO2 also helped maintain catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation and reducing H2 concentration.

Challenges in this field, as indicated by the study, include catalyst deactivation and carbon deposition. The research shows that using CO2 as an oxidant can help address these issues.

For future research and development, the study suggests several key areas:

1. Optimizing catalyst composition: The addition of alkali metals (e.g., potassium) to Cr/SiO2 catalysts improved selectivity, indicating that further research into catalyst modifications could yield better results.

2. Improving C-H bond activation: While not explicitly mentioned, the varying performance of different catalysts suggests that enhancing C-H bond activation is a crucial area for improvement.

3. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: The study shows that CO2 helps maintain catalyst activity by preventing carbon deposition, suggesting that further research into oxidant selection and reaction conditions could improve catalyst longevity.

4. Optimizing reaction systems: The research demonstrates that reaction conditions, such as the presence of CO2, significantly affect ODHP processes. Future work could focus on fine-tuning these conditions for optimal performance.

While the study doesn't address all aspects of the question, it provides valuable insights into the use of soft oxidants (CO2) in ODHP and highlights the importance of catalyst design and reaction conditions in improving the process.

这篇文献主要关注使用CO2作为软氧化剂在各种铬基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢制丙烯的研究。虽然它没有涵盖问题中提到的所有催化剂，但确实为使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展提供了一些见解。

研究比较了不同载体上的铬催化剂的性能，包括TiO2、ZrO2和SiO2。5%Cr/TiO2催化剂显示出高选择性（100%）但低转化率（4.8%），而5%Cr/ZrO2催化剂表现出高转化率（46.5%）但较低的选择性（76.1%）。当用钾等碱金属改性时，Cr/SiO2催化剂在转化率和选择性之间显示出良好的平衡。

与使用N2相比，使用CO2作为软氧化剂能够提高转化率和选择性。CO2还通过抑制积碳形成和降低H2浓度来帮助维持催化剂活性。

研究表明，该领域的挑战包括催化剂失活和碳沉积。研究显示，使用CO2作为氧化剂可以帮助解决这些问题。

对于未来的研究和开发，该研究提出了几个关键领域：

1. 优化催化剂组成：向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属（如钾）提高了选择性，这表明对催化剂改性的进一步研究可能会产生更好的结果。

2. 改善C-H键活化：虽然没有明确提及，但不同催化剂的性能差异表明，提高C-H键活化是一个关键的改进领域。

3. 增强催化剂再生能力：研究表明，CO2通过防止碳沉积来帮助维持催化剂活性，这表明对氧化剂选择和反应条件的进一步研究可以提高催化剂寿命。

4. 优化反应系统：研究表明，反应条件（如CO2的存在）显著影响ODHP过程。未来的工作可以集中在微调这些条件以获得最佳性能。

虽然这项研究没有涉及问题的所有方面，但它为在ODHP中使用软氧化剂（CO2）提供了宝贵的见解，并强调了催化剂设计和反应条件在改进过程中的重要性。

This document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as a soft oxidant over Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it does offer insights into the performance of Cr-based catalysts.

The study shows that CO2 promotes catalytic activity and maintains catalyst stability by reducing H2 concentration and inhibiting coke formation. The addition of alkali and alkaline earth metal oxides to Cr/SiO2 catalysts modifies surface properties, decreasing redox potential and surface acidity. This results in decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

The most promising results were obtained with K-modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts. With an optimized K loading of 0.2-0.4%, these catalysts achieved propane conversion of 22-31% and propylene selectivity of 91-100% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6.

The document doesn't explicitly discuss persistent challenges or future research directions for ODHP. However, based on the results presented, some areas for future research could include:

1. Further optimization of catalyst composition and reaction conditions to improve both conversion and selectivity.
2. Investigation of other soft oxidants besides CO2.
3. Long-term stability studies of the catalysts.
4. Exploration of other transition metal or main group element oxides as catalysts or promoters.

The study doesn't address strategies for improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability. It also doesn't discuss renovating reaction systems beyond the use of CO2 as an oxidant. These could be potential areas for future research in ODHP processes.

这篇文献主要关注使用CO2作为软氧化剂，在经碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。虽然文献没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，但确实提供了Cr基催化剂性能的见解。

研究表明，CO2通过减少H2浓度和抑制积碳来促进催化活性并维持催化剂稳定性。向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属和碱土金属氧化物可以改变表面性质，降低氧化还原电位和表面酸度。这导致丙烷转化率降低但丙烯选择性增加。

最promising的结果是用K改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂获得的。在K负载优化为0.2-0.4%时，这些催化剂在923 K、CO2/C3H8比为3.6的条件下实现了22-31%的丙烷转化率和91-100%的丙烯选择性。

文献没有明确讨论ODHP的持续挑战或未来研究方向。然而，基于所呈现的结果，未来研究的一些领域可能包括：

1. 进一步优化催化剂组成和反应条件，以改善转化率和选择性。
2. 研究CO2以外的其他软氧化剂。
3. 催化剂的长期稳定性研究。
4. 探索其他过渡金属或主族元素氧化物作为催化剂或助剂。

该研究没有涉及改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力的策略。它也没有讨论除使用CO2作为氧化剂外的反应系统改造。这些可能是ODHP过程未来研究的潜在领域。

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

This literature focuses primarily on the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a soft oxidant over various Cr-based catalysts, particularly Cr/SiO2 modified with alkali and alkaline earth metals. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of different catalyst systems for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it does offer some insights into the performance of Cr-based catalysts.

The study shows that CO2 can act as an effective soft oxidant, increasing propane conversion and maintaining catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation. Different supports and promoters affect the performance of Cr-based catalysts:

1. Cr/TiO2 showed high selectivity (100%) but low conversion (4.8%).
2. Cr/ZrO2 showed high conversion (46.5%) but lower selectivity (76.1%).
3. Cr/SiO2 showed balanced performance with 27% conversion and 85% selectivity.

The addition of alkali and alkaline earth metals to Cr/SiO2 catalysts generally decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity. The optimum loading of potassium (K) was found to be 0.2-0.4%, resulting in propane conversion of 22-31% and propylene selectivity of 91-100%.

The study doesn't directly address persistent challenges like corrosiveness or discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability. However, it does highlight the importance of catalyst composition and promoters in balancing conversion and selectivity.

For future research and development, the study suggests focusing on:
1. Optimizing catalyst composition and promoters to balance conversion and selectivity.
2. Investigating the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in maintaining catalyst activity and inhibiting coke formation.
3. Exploring the effects of different supports and their interactions with active metal species.

While this study provides valuable insights into Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, more comprehensive research is needed to address the broader challenges and opportunities in ODHP using soft oxidants.

这篇文献主要关注使用CO2作为软氧化剂在各种Cr基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢反应，特别是被碱金属和碱土金属改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂。虽然它没有提供丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)不同催化剂系统的全面比较，但确实为Cr基催化剂的性能提供了一些见解。

研究表明，CO2可以作为有效的软氧化剂，提高丙烷转化率并通过抑制积碳来维持催化剂活性。不同的载体和助剂会影响Cr基催化剂的性能：

1. Cr/TiO2显示出高选择性(100%)但低转化率(4.8%)。
2. Cr/ZrO2显示出高转化率(46.5%)但较低的选择性(76.1%)。
3. Cr/SiO2表现均衡，转化率为27%，选择性为85%。

该研究没有直接讨论腐蚀性等持续存在的挑战，也没有讨论改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。然而，它确实强调了催化剂组成和助剂在平衡转化率和选择性方面的重要性。

对于未来的研究和开发，该研究建议关注：
1. 优化催化剂组成和助剂以平衡转化率和选择性。
2. 研究CO2作为软氧化剂在维持催化剂活性和抑制积碳方面的作用。
3. 探索不同载体及其与活性金属物种的相互作用。

This literature focuses on the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant over modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts, rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using various catalyst systems. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete answer to the question based solely on this document.

However, some relevant insights from the literature include:

1. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in propane dehydrogenation shows promise, as it increases equilibrium conversion, maintains catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, and enhances propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

2. Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified with alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides were investigated. The activity order was found to be Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2.

3. The addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified surface properties, decreased redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

4. Optimizing the loading of promoters (e.g., K) can improve catalyst performance. For Cr-K/SiO2 catalysts, the optimal K loading was found to be around 0.2-0.4%, achieving propane conversion of 22-31% and propylene selectivity of 91-100% at 923 K.

The document does not discuss persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or specific strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, additional literature on ODHP using various catalyst systems and addressing current challenges would be needed.

这篇文献主要关注使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂在改性Cr/SiO2催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢制丙烯的研究，而不是提供关于使用各种催化剂系统进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展的全面分析。因此，仅基于这份文献，我无法对该问题提供完整的答案。

然而，从文献中可以得到一些相关的见解：

1. 使用CO2作为软氧化剂进行丙烷脱氢显示出很大潜力，因为它可以增加平衡转化率，通过抑制积碳来维持催化剂活性，并通过逆水气变换反应提高丙烷转化率。

2. 研究了用碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂。活性顺序为Cr-K/SiO2 > Cr-Mg/SiO2 > Cr-Ca/SiO2 > Cr-Ba/SiO2。

3. 向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改变了表面性质，降低了氧化还原电位和表面酸度，导致丙烷转化率降低但丙烯选择性提高。

4. 优化助剂（如K）的负载量可以改善催化剂性能。对于Cr-K/SiO2催化剂，最佳K负载量在0.2-0.4%左右，在923 K下可实现22-31%的丙烷转化率和91-100%的丙烯选择性。

该文献未讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性，或改善C-H键活化、提高催化剂再生能力以及改进反应系统的具体策略。要全面回答这个问题，需要额外的关于使用各种催化剂系统进行ODHP和解决当前挑战的文献。
