[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed selectivity to propylene of about 100%, but the conversion of propane on this catalyst was low (4.8%) at 923 K. In contrast, the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst showed a high conversion of propane (46.5%), but the selectivity to propylene was low (76.1%)."

[4] "The conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene reached 27% and 85%, respectively, at 923 K."

[5] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."

This literature focuses primarily on the dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a soft oxidant over various Cr-based catalysts, particularly Cr/SiO2 modified with alkali and alkaline earth metals. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of different catalyst systems for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), it does offer some insights into the performance of Cr-based catalysts.

The study shows that CO2 can act as an effective soft oxidant, increasing propane conversion and maintaining catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation. Different supports and promoters affect the performance of Cr-based catalysts:

1. Cr/TiO2 showed high selectivity (100%) but low conversion (4.8%).
2. Cr/ZrO2 showed high conversion (46.5%) but lower selectivity (76.1%).
3. Cr/SiO2 showed balanced performance with 27% conversion and 85% selectivity.

The addition of alkali and alkaline earth metals to Cr/SiO2 catalysts generally decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity. The optimum loading of potassium (K) was found to be 0.2-0.4%, resulting in propane conversion of 22-31% and propylene selectivity of 91-100%.

The study doesn't directly address persistent challenges like corrosiveness or discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability. However, it does highlight the importance of catalyst composition and promoters in balancing conversion and selectivity.

For future research and development, the study suggests focusing on:
1. Optimizing catalyst composition and promoters to balance conversion and selectivity.
2. Investigating the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant in maintaining catalyst activity and inhibiting coke formation.
3. Exploring the effects of different supports and their interactions with active metal species.

While this study provides valuable insights into Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, more comprehensive research is needed to address the broader challenges and opportunities in ODHP using soft oxidants.

这篇文献主要关注使用CO2作为软氧化剂在各种Cr基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢反应，特别是被碱金属和碱土金属改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂。虽然它没有提供丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)不同催化剂系统的全面比较，但确实为Cr基催化剂的性能提供了一些见解。

研究表明，CO2可以作为有效的软氧化剂，提高丙烷转化率并通过抑制积碳来维持催化剂活性。不同的载体和助剂会影响Cr基催化剂的性能：

1. Cr/TiO2显示出高选择性(100%)但低转化率(4.8%)。
2. Cr/ZrO2显示出高转化率(46.5%)但较低的选择性(76.1%)。
3. Cr/SiO2表现均衡，转化率为27%，选择性为85%。

向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属和碱土金属通常会降低丙烷转化率但提高丙烯选择性。钾(K)的最佳负载量被发现为0.2-0.4%，导致丙烷转化率为22-31%，丙烯选择性为91-100%。

该研究没有直接讨论腐蚀性等持续存在的挑战，也没有讨论改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。然而，它确实强调了催化剂组成和助剂在平衡转化率和选择性方面的重要性。

对于未来的研究和开发，该研究建议关注：
1. 优化催化剂组成和助剂以平衡转化率和选择性。
2. 研究CO2作为软氧化剂在维持催化剂活性和抑制积碳方面的作用。
3. 探索不同载体及其与活性金属物种的相互作用。

虽然这项研究为丙烷脱氢的Cr基催化剂提供了宝贵的见解，但仍需要更全面的研究来解决使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的更广泛挑战和机会。
