Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information related to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or comparisons of various catalyst systems for this process. The document focuses on the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane to produce syngas over Ni/SiO2 catalysts. It does not discuss ODHP, propane, soft oxidants, or the specific catalyst systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The document primarily discusses the combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane to produce syngas over Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared with different nickel precursors. It does not address ODHP, catalyst systems for ODHP, challenges in the field, or future research directions related to ODHP. Therefore, the question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中没有关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的信息。该文档主要讨论了使用不同镍前体制备的Ni/SiO2催化剂上二氧化碳重整和甲烷部分氧化生成合成气的组合。它没有涉及ODHP、ODHP的催化剂系统、该领域的挑战或与ODHP相关的未来研究方向。因此，无法根据所提供的文档回答该问题。
