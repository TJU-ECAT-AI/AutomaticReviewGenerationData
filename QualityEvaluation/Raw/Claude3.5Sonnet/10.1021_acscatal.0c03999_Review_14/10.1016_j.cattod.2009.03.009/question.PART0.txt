1. Introduction
The production of syngas from methane is one of the most
promising utilization approaches of natural gas, which is now
recognized to be one of the potential substitute resources for
petroleum due to its abundant storage in the world. Nowadays, the
significant technologies for the synthesis gas production from
methane are based on endothermic reaction of carbon dioxide
reforming (CDR) [1,2], exothermic reaction of partial oxidation of
methane (POM) [3,4] and combination of these technologies
(CRPOM). Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and
preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable
product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process,
and (3) a safer operating environment.
The CRPOM was first studied in a fixed bed reactor by Vernon
et al. [5]. However, from an engineering point of view, fluidized bed
reactor was a good candidate for the CRPOM reaction [6], mainly
for its symmetrical heat diffusion and less carbon deposition. For
its good mechanical strength and high-surface area, spherical silica
(SiO2) is widely used as a catalyst support in fluidized bed reactor.
In recent years, Ni-based catalysts have attracted considerable
interest primarily due to their inexpensiveness and high activity
compared to noble-metal-based catalysts. In our previous works
[7,8], Ni/SiO2 catalysts modified by MOx (M: alkaline metal,
alkaline earth metal, rare earth metal) prepared with nitrate
precursor exhibited excellent resistance to carbon deposition and
stable catalytic performance in fluidized bed reactor. However, a
Ni/SiO2 catalyst without addition promoter MOx exhibited rapid
deactivation after a short time reaction [7,8]. Recently, we found
the Ni/SiO2 catalysts prepared with the nickel citrate precursor
were applied to the CRPOM reaction and showed a superior
catalytic performance [9]. It was also reported that nickel citrate
was a good precursor for preparation of highly dispersed Ni/
(Al)MCM-41 catalysts [10,11]. Systematic studies over the Ni/SiO2
prepared with different precursors were done using TPR and XRD
techniques in this paper.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Ni/SiO2
catalysts
were
prepared
with
incipient
wetness
impregnation. After impregnation, the samples were dried at
100 8C for 12 h and subsequently calcined in air at 700 8C for 4 h.
The Ni/SiO2 prepared with nickel nitrate and nickel citrate were
designated as ANiSN and ANiSC (A% is weight percent of Ni on the
catalysts), respectively.
The
nickel
citrate
precursor
was
prepared
as
following
procedure. An equal molar ratio of nickel carbonate and citric
acid was mixed together. De-ionized water was added into the
mixture, and then heated at 100 8C until nickel carbonate was
dissolved to form a green and transparent solution.

The reaction of combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane to produce syngas
(CRPOM) was tested over Ni/SiO2 catalysts which were prepared via incipient-wetness impregnation
using precursors of nickel citrate and nickel nitrate. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder
diffraction analysis (XRD) and H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) techniques. It was
shown that the nickel citrate precursor strengthened interaction between NiO and support to form nickel
silicate like species which could be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high
temperatures. The Ni/SiO2 prepared with the nickel citrate precursor exhibited good catalytic
performances for its highly dispersed metallic nickel derived from the nickel silicate species.

with 5% HNO3 aqueous solution for 48 h at room temperature and
then fully washed with de-ionized water until the filtrate was
neutrality. The size of SiO2 was selected between 60 and 80 mesh.
2.2. Catalytic reaction
The catalytic reaction was performed in a fluidized-bed
reactor
that
comprised
of
a
quartz
tube
(I.D. = 20 mm,
H = 750 mm) under atmospheric pressure at 700 8C. Prior to
reaction, 2 mL of catalyst was reduced at 700 8C for 60 min
under a flow of pure hydrogen at atmospheric pressure. A
reactant gas stream that consisted of CH4, CO2, and O2, with a
molar ratio of 1/0.4/0.3, was used with a gas hourly space
velocity (GHSV) of 9000 h1. The feed gases were controlled by
mass flow controllers. The effluent gas cooled in an ice trap was
analyzed with an online gas chromatograph equipped with a
packed column (TDX-01) and a thermal conductivity detector.
Under our reaction conditions, the oxygen in the feed gas was
completely consumed in all cases. The conversions and the
selectivities were calculated as the literature [7].
2.3. Catalyst characterization
2.3.1. X-ray powder diffraction analysis
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples were
obtained with an automated power X-ray diffractometer (Rigku-D/
max-2550/PC, Japan) equipped with a computer for data acquisi-
tion and analysis, using Cu Ka radiation, at 40 kV and 300 mA. The
reduced samples were prior reduced at 700 8C for 1 h and cooled to
room temperature in hydrogen atmosphere, but the fresh samples
were used directly after calcined in air at 700 8C for 4 h. The used
catalysts
were
cooled
from
reaction
temperature
to
room
temperature under the atmosphere of Ar in the fluidized bed
reactor. All the samples were ground to fine powder in an agate
mortar before XRD measurements. The crystallite size of metallic
nickel over supported nickel catalysts was estimated with the
Scherrer equation.
2.3.2. H2-temperature-programmed reduction
H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments
were performed in a fixed-bed reactor (I.D. = 4 mm). 50 mg sample
was used and reduced under a stream of 5% H2/N2 (20 ml/min)
from 50 8C to 800 8C at a ramp of 7 8C/min. Hydrogen consumption
of the TPR was detected by a TCD and its signal was transmitted to
a personal computer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic activity measurements
The catalytic activities of ANiSC and ANiSN are presented in
Fig. 1. For the ANiSC catalysts, the conversion of CH4 (XCH4) slightly
increased from 72.9% to 76.7% with the loading of Ni from 1% to 3%.
However, the XCH4 of ANiSN showed drastically increase from
33.8% to 72.2% with the A from 1 to 5. The XCH4 of ANiSC and ANiSN
reached a plateau as A = 3 and 5, respectively. Evidently, the
catalytic activity of ANiSC exhibited better than that of ANiSN,
especially for the catalysts with low nickel loadings.
The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance
of 3NiSC was investigated (shown in Fig. 2). The conversions and
selectivities increased with the reaction temperature. The XCH4,
XCO2, SH2 and SCO increased from 45.7%, 13.1%, 79.0% and 76.0% to
95.5%, 95.9%, 98.7% and 99.7%, respectively, as the reaction
temperature increased from 550 8C to 800 8C. High selectivity
and conversion could be achieved at high reaction temperatures.
This might be attributed to that low temperatures were inclined to
complete combustion of methane, and high temperatures were
prone to reforming and partial oxidation of methane [7].
The stabilities of 3NiSC and 3NiSN were also examined in Fig. 3.
The catalysts prepared from nitrate precursors displayed a rapid
decline of catalytic performance. The XCH4 of 3NiSN was from 58.5%
to 20.0% in 2 h reaction on stream. However, the NiSC showed a
superior stability and the XCH4 did not show any decline after 36 h
reaction on stream. The deactivation of the 3NiSN was not caused

by carbon deposition but might be caused by sintering of nickel
metal [8].
3.2. Catalyst characterization results
3.2.1. XRD study
The diffraction patterns for 3NiSC and 3NiSN catalysts are
shown in Fig. 4. The NiO and amorphous SiO2 phase was observed
only. NiO diffraction peaks of the 3NiSC were broader than those of
the 3NiSN, which indicated that the crystallite size of NiO over the
3NiSC was smaller than that of the 3NiSN.
The average crystallite sizes of metallic nickel over 3NiSC and
3NiSN catalysts, estimated by XRD and calculated using the
Scherrers equation, were presented in Fig. 5. The crystallite size
of metallic nickel over the 3NiSN and 3NiSC was about 30.6 nm and
3.9 nm. The crystallite size of metallic nickel over the 3NiSC after 6 h
reaction on stream was about 4.5 nm, which indicated that the
3NiSC showed excellent thermal stability. High dispersion of Ni over
the 3NiSC might be a main reason for its excellent catalytic activity.
3.2.2. H2-TPR results
Reduction behaviors of ANiSC catalysts ere exhibited in Fig. 6.
The trails of TPR could be classified three groups: a, b and g, which
were located at 400 8C, 560 8C and >700 8C, respectively. The a
and b peaks could be evidently observed as the A were >3 and >1,
and the peak areas increased with the loading of nickel. The peak
area of g reasonably increased with the A. The temperature of g
peak shifted to high temperature from 700 8C to 770 8C as the A
increased from 1 to 15. From above results, it could be deduced that
the a peak might be the reduction of nickel oxide which showed
negligible interaction with the support of SiO2. The b peak could be
ascribed to the reduction of nickel oxide which showed interaction
with the support of SiO2. The g peak was also observed in literature
[11] and was assigned to the reduction of the NiO species
chemically bounded with Al-MCM-41. But in this paper, the g peak
might be originated from the reduction of nickel silicate like
species [9]. The species over ANiSC catalysts detected by XRD were
NiO and amorphous silica (shown in Fig. 4). Therefore, the
assignment of g peak to the reduction of nickel silicate like was
reasonable. The species of nickel silicate like might be formed by a
strong interaction between NiO and SiO2. In order to elucidate the
TPR results, a simplified model was shown in Fig. 7. The model
exhibited that the nickel oxide which showed a weak interaction
with the support of SiO2 would be formed after the support was
covered by a layer of nickel silicate like species.
The TPR profiles of the ANiSN are depicted in Fig. 8. It can be seen
from Fig. 8 that there are great differences between the ANiSN and
the ANiSC. The ANiSN were completely reduced at <550 8C. The
reduction profiles could be divided into two groups: a peak and b
peak. The a peak and the b peak located at <440 and 460 8C. The
temperature of a peak shifted from 440 8C to 410 8C as the A
increased from 1 to 10, which indicated that the a peak might be
contributed to the reduction of large crystallite of nickel oxide which

is negligible weak interaction with SiO2. The b peak was caused by
the reduction of nickel oxide which interacted weakly with SiO2 [9].
Noticeably, no g peak was observed in the ANiSN, which meant that
no nickel silicate like species was form on the ANiSN. Comprehen-
sively considering XRD and H2-TPR results above, it could be
deduced that the nickel silicate like species originated from the NiO
strong interaction with the support of SiO2 could be reduced to small
crystallite metallic nickel. High dispersion of Ni over SiO2 might be a
crucial reason for high activity of ANiSC.
4. Conclusions
The
catalytic
performance
of
Ni/SiO2
was
significantly
depended on the precursors of nickel. The nickel nitrate precursor
resulted in large size particles of nickel and poor catalytic activity,
especially for low Ni-loading over Ni/SiO2 catalysts. However, as
the nickel citrate precursor was used, the superior catalytic activity
and stability were obtained over Ni/SiO2 catalysts. The strong
interaction between NiO and SiO2 formed nickel silicate like
species over the NiSC, which was the main reason for high nickel
dispersion and effectively prevention nickel particle from sintering
at high reaction temperatures.
