[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."

[5] "The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using N2O as a soft oxidant with steam-activated Fe-zeolites as catalysts. These catalysts show promising performance, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, which is comparable to state-of-the-art V and Mo-oxide catalysts using O2 as the oxidant. The Fe-zeolite catalysts also demonstrate higher space velocities, indicating their remarkable performance.

However, persistent challenges remain, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This is identified as a major drawback of the process, although high initial activity can be recovered through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K.

The study highlights several key areas for future research and development:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: The literature doesn't directly address this, but it's implied in the search for more efficient catalysts.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: While regeneration is possible, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coking or easier regeneration would be beneficial.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: The study shows that different zeolite structures (MFI vs BEA) affect deactivation rates, suggesting that optimizing the catalyst structure could lead to improved performance.

4. Understanding and mitigating coke formation: The research identifies propene condensation as the likely source of coke, indicating a need for strategies to minimize this side reaction.

5. Exploring different zeolite structures: The study demonstrates that MFI catalysts show lower deactivation rates than BEA structures, suggesting that further exploration of zeolite structures could yield improved catalysts.

These findings point to the need for continued research into catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and process optimization to further advance ODHP technology using soft oxidants.

该文献讨论了使用N2O作为软氧化剂和蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石作为催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展。这些催化剂表现出很有前景的性能，在723 K下实现了高达25%的丙烯产率，这与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进的V和Mo氧化物催化剂相当。Fe-沸石催化剂还表现出更高的空间速度，表明其性能卓越。

然而，持续存在的挑战仍然存在，特别是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。这被认为是该过程的一个主要缺点，尽管通过在773 K下用氧气再生可以恢复高初始活性。

研究强调了未来研究和开发的几个关键领域：

1. 改善C-H键活化：文献并没有直接提到这一点，但在寻找更高效的催化剂中暗示了这一点。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：虽然再生是可能的，但开发具有更好抗焦炭能力或更容易再生的催化剂将是有益的。

3. 优化反应系统：研究表明不同的沸石结构（MFI vs BEA）影响失活速率，这表明优化催化剂结构可能会带来性能改进。

4. 理解和减轻焦炭形成：研究确定丙烯缩合可能是焦炭的来源，表明需要策略来最小化这种副反应。

5. 探索不同的沸石结构：研究表明MFI催化剂比BEA结构表现出更低的失活速率，这表明进一步探索沸石结构可能会产生改进的催化剂。

这些发现指出了需要继续研究催化剂设计、反应机理和过程优化，以进一步推进使用软氧化剂的ODHP技术。
