[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

[2] "The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

[3] "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

[4] "The TEOM technique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deactivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."

[5] "Development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

The literature focuses specifically on N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using steam-activated Fe-zeolites, rather than providing a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems. However, it does offer some insights into recent advances and challenges in this field:

1. Performance: Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) show high efficiency for N2O-mediated ODHP, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K. This performance is comparable to state-of-the-art V and Mo-oxide catalysts using O2 as the oxidant.

2. Advantages: The Fe-zeolite catalysts demonstrate remarkably high activity, operating at space velocities an order of magnitude higher than typically reported in literature.

3. Challenges: The main drawback is catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. However, the initial high activity can be fully recovered through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K.

4. Future research directions:
   a) Improving catalyst stability and regenerability to address coke formation issues.
   b) Enhancing transport properties and active site accessibility, potentially through the development of mesopores in zeolites.
   c) Optimizing reaction systems for better monitoring and control of catalyst deactivation and coke formation, as demonstrated by the TEOM technique.

While the literature doesn't directly address C-H bond activation strategies or discuss the corrosiveness of oxidants, it highlights the importance of catalyst design and regeneration in improving ODHP processes. Future research could focus on developing more stable catalysts, improving regeneration methods, and optimizing reactor designs to minimize coking and enhance overall process efficiency.

该文献主要关注使用蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石进行N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP），而不是提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较。然而，它确实提供了该领域近期进展和挑战的一些见解：

1. 性能：蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA）在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出高效率，在723 K下丙烯收率可达25%。这一性能与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进的V和Mo氧化物催化剂相当。

2. 优势：Fe-沸石催化剂表现出显著的高活性，其操作空速比文献中典型报道的高出一个数量级。

3. 挑战：主要缺点是由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。但是，通过在773 K下用氧气再生，可以完全恢复初始高活性。

4. 未来研究方向：
   a) 提高催化剂稳定性和再生能力，以解决焦炭形成问题。
   b) 增强传输性能和活性位点可及性，可能通过在沸石中发展介孔来实现。
   c) 优化反应系统，以更好地监测和控制催化剂失活和焦炭形成，如TEOM技术所示。

虽然文献没有直接讨论C-H键活化策略或氧化剂的腐蚀性，但它强调了催化剂设计和再生在改进ODHP过程中的重要性。未来的研究可以集中在开发更稳定的催化剂、改进再生方法以及优化反应器设计，以最小化焦炭形成并提高整体过程效率。
