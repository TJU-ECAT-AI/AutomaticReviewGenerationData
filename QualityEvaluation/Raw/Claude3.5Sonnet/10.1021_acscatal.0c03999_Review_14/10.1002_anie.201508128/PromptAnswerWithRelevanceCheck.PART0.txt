<questions>

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically related to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The document primarily focuses on CO2 reduction by ethane using Pt- and Mo2C-based catalysts, discussing dry reforming and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. It does not provide information about ODHP catalysts, their performance, or challenges in that specific field.

The literature does touch on some related concepts, such as oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant. However, it does not provide sufficient information to answer the specific questions about ODHP catalysts, their selectivity and conversion, challenges in the field, or future research directions for ODHP processes.

To properly address the questions posed, a different set of scientific literature focusing specifically on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane would be needed.

给定的科学文献不包含特别关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的信息。该文档主要集中在使用Pt和Mo2C基催化剂进行CO2还原和乙烷，讨论了乙烷的干重整和氧化脱氢。它没有提供关于ODHP催化剂、它们的性能或该特定领域挑战的信息。

文献确实涉及了一些相关概念，如乙烷的氧化脱氢和使用CO2作为温和氧化剂。然而，它没有提供足够的信息来回答关于ODHP催化剂、它们的选择性和转化率、该领域的挑战或ODHP过程未来研究方向的具体问题。

为了正确回答所提出的问题，需要一套不同的、专门针对丙烷氧化脱氢的科学文献。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information about oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The document primarily focuses on the reduction of CO2 by ethane using two different types of catalysts: Pt-based and Mo2C-based. It does not discuss ODHP, propane, or the specific catalyst systems mentioned in the question. Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis of recent advances in ODHP, compare the performance of various catalyst systems, or discuss the challenges and future research directions for ODHP based on this literature.
