[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]. Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[2] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[3] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

[4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]."

[5] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat1 h1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat1 h1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nitrous oxide (N2O) as a soft oxidant, focusing primarily on iron-zeolite catalysts, particularly Fe-ZSM-5. The use of N2O instead of dioxygen as an oxidant has attracted considerable attention for ODHP reactions.

In terms of catalyst performance, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as an iron precursor has shown superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. A maximum initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1 was reported. Additionally, a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 were maintained for over 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

However, the literature also highlights persistent challenges in this field. These include:

1. Unclear reaction mechanism: The exact mechanism of ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites is not fully understood.

2. Catalyst deactivation: This remains a key issue in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.

The literature does not provide specific information on strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes. However, it suggests that understanding the reaction and deactivation mechanisms is crucial for addressing these challenges and further developing the ODHP process with N2O.

Key areas for future research and development, as implied by the literature, include:

1. Elucidating the reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites.
2. Understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation mechanisms.
3. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods and reaction conditions to improve performance and stability.

While the literature focuses on iron-zeolite catalysts, particularly Fe-ZSM-5, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides or main group element metal oxides for ODHP reactions.

该文献讨论了使用一氧化二氮（N2O）作为软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，主要关注铁沸石催化剂，特别是Fe-ZSM-5。使用N2O代替二氧作为氧化剂在ODHP反应中引起了广泛关注。

在催化剂性能方面，通过固态交换法使用茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5经过严格煅烧后，在N2O存在下的ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能。报告显示，初始丙烯收率最高可达30%，转化频率高达0.037 s-1。此外，在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的条件下，丙烷转化速率约为13 mmol gcat-1 h-1，丙烯生产速率约为6 mmol gcat-1 h-1，这种性能可以稳定维持40多小时。

然而，文献也强调了该领域持续存在的挑战，包括：

1. 反应机理不清：铁沸石上N2O存在下的ODHP反应的确切机理尚未完全理解。

2. 催化剂失活：无论使用二氧还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，这仍然是氧化脱氢反应中的一个关键问题。

文献没有提供改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或革新反应系统以优化ODHP过程的具体策略。但它表明，理解反应和失活机理对于解决这些挑战和进一步发展N2O存在下的ODHP过程至关重要。

文献暗示的未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 阐明铁沸石上N2O存在下ODHP反应的机理。
2. 理解并缓解催化剂失活机理。
3. 优化催化剂制备方法和反应条件，以提高性能和稳定性。

虽然文献主要关注铁沸石催化剂，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，但没有提供与其他催化剂系统（如过渡金属/金属氧化物或主族元素金属氧化物）在ODHP反应中的全面比较。
