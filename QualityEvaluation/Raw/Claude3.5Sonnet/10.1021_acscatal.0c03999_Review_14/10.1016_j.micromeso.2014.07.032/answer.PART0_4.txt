[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity."

[3] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

[4] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[5] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

The literature provided focuses specifically on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nitrous oxide as a soft oxidant over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts. While it doesn't offer a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it does highlight some recent advances and persistent challenges in this field:

1. Advances:
- Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as an iron precursor show promise for ODHP with N2O.
- The formation of stable mono-oxygen species on FeOAl sites leads to high selectivity for propylene production.
- A stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be maintained for over 40 hours under optimized conditions.

2. Challenges:
- The reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not fully understood.
- Catalyst deactivation remains a key issue, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.
- The specific nature and origin of coke formation, which leads to deactivation, are not fully understood.

3. Areas for future research:
- Further investigation into the reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O.
- Development of strategies to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst lifetime.
- Optimization of reaction conditions, such as the N2O/C3H8 ratio, to improve catalyst performance and longevity.

The literature does not provide information on other catalyst systems, corrosiveness issues, or specific strategies for improving C-H bond activation and enhancing catalyst regenerability. To fully address the question, additional research on these topics would be necessary.

这篇文献主要关注使用氧化亚氮作为软氧化剂在Fe-ZSM-5催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。虽然它没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，但确实强调了该领域的一些最新进展和持续存在的挑战：

1. 进展：
- 使用二茂铁作为铁前体通过固态交换法制备的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂在N2O的ODHP反应中表现出良好的前景。
- 在FeOAl位点上形成稳定的单氧物种导致丙烯生产的高选择性。
- 在优化条件下，可以维持约13 mmol gcat−1 h−1的稳定丙烷转化率和约6 mmol gcat−1 h−1的丙烯生产率超过40小时。

2. 挑战：
- N2O的ODHP反应机理尚未完全理解。
- 无论使用氧气还是氧化亚氮作为氧化剂，催化剂失活仍然是一个关键问题。
- 导致失活的焦炭形成的具体性质和来源尚未完全了解。

3. 未来研究方向：
- 进一步研究N2O的ODHP反应机理。
- 开发防止焦炭沉积和增加催化剂寿命的策略。
- 优化反应条件，如N2O/C3H8比例，以改善催化剂性能和寿命。

该文献没有提供有关其他催化剂系统、腐蚀性问题或改善C-H键活化和增强催化剂再生能力的具体策略的信息。要全面回答这个问题，需要对这些主题进行额外的研究。
