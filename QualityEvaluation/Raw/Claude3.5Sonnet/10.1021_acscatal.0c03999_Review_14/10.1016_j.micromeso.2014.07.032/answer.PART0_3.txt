[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[2] "Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity."

[3] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes."

[4] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

[5] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[6] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

The literature primarily focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nitrous oxide as a soft oxidant over Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it does offer insights into recent advances and challenges in this field:

1. Advances:
- Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared via solid-state exchange method show promising performance in ODHP with N2O.
- The formation of stable mono-oxygen species on FeOAl sites leads to high propylene selectivity.
- A stable propane conversion rate of 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and propylene production rate of 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be maintained for over 40 hours.

2. Challenges:
- The reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O is not fully understood.
- Catalyst deactivation remains a key issue, with accumulation of organic species (mainly alkylbenzenes) observed during the reaction.
- The specific nature of coke formation and its origin are not fully understood.

3. Areas for future research:
- Elucidating the detailed reaction mechanism of ODHP with N2O.
- Developing strategies to prevent coke deposition and increase catalyst lifetime.
- Optimizing the N2O/C3H8 ratio to balance conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability.
- Investigating the role of FeOAl species and their formation in Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts.

The literature doesn't directly address C-H bond activation strategies, catalyst regenerability, or renovation of reaction systems. However, these areas are implicitly suggested as important for future research based on the challenges identified in the ODHP process.

该文献主要关注使用一氧化二氮作为软氧化剂在Fe-ZSM-5催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）。虽然它没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，但确实为该领域的最新进展和挑战提供了见解：

1. 进展：
- 通过固态交换法制备的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂在N2O的ODHP反应中表现出良好的性能。
- FeOAl位点上形成的稳定单氧物种导致高丙烯选择性。
- 可以在40小时以上保持稳定的丙烷转化率13 mmol gcat−1 h−1和丙烯生产率6 mmol gcat−1 h−1。

2. 挑战：
- N2O的ODHP反应机理尚未完全理解。
- 催化剂失活仍然是一个关键问题，反应过程中观察到有机物（主要是烷基苯）的积累。
- 焦炭形成的具体性质及其来源尚未完全了解。

3. 未来研究领域：
- 阐明N2O的ODHP详细反应机理。
