[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion."

[2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."

[3] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."

[4] "The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion."

[5] "VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B)."

[6] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."

[7] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450 C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry."

[8] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."

[9] "Because of the extremely corrosive nature of sulfur or halogen, operando and in situ techniques are seldom used. The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP reactions using soft oxidants such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides.

Among the catalyst systems:

1. CrOx, a redox-type catalyst, exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550°C.
2. Ga2O3, a non-redox-type catalyst, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion.
3. VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be superior catalysts for N2O-ODHP.
4. Catalytic oxyhalogenation has achieved yields up to 55%.
5. Gaseous sulfur compounds have shown remarkable results, with C3H6 yields up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750°C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450°C.

Despite these advancements, persistent challenges remain in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants:

1. Corrosiveness: The corrosive nature of sulfur and halogen compounds makes it difficult to use operando and in situ techniques for catalyst characterization.
2. Inherent reaction properties: Each soft oxidant presents unique challenges due to its specific chemical properties.
3. Scalability: The potential for industrial-scale application requires addressing issues related to corrosion, recovery processes, and the need for suitable materials and reactors.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Designing catalysts that can effectively facilitate the activation of C-H bonds in C3H8.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts with good regenerability to maintain long-term performance.
3. Renovating reaction systems: Optimizing ODHP processes to reconcile industrial needs with the challenges of using various acid gases as soft oxidants.
4. Process engineering: Developing sophisticated process engineering solutions to address corrosion issues and recovery processes for sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products.
5. Materials development: Creating suitable materials for reactors and other components that can withstand the corrosive environment of ODHP reactions with soft oxidants.

These research directions aim to overcome the current limitations and advance ODHP technology using soft oxidants towards practical industrial applications.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了各种催化剂系统的良好结果。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物已被广泛研究，用于使用软氧化剂（如CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物）的ODHP反应。

在催化剂系统中：

1. CrOx，一种氧化还原型催化剂，在550°C时表现出较高的C3H6选择性和较高的C3H8转化率。
2. Ga2O3，一种非氧化还原型催化剂，在40%以下的转化率时表现出与CrOx相当的选择性。
3. VOx和含铁沸石被报道为N2O-ODHP的优秀催化剂。
4. 催化氧卤化已实现高达55%的产率。
