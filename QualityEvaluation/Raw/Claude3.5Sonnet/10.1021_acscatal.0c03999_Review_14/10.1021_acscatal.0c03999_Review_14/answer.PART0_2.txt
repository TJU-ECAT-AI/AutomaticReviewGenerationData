[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion."

[2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."

[3] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."

[4] "The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 95%98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A)."

[7] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."

[8] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450 C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry."

[10] "Because of the extremely corrosive nature of sulfur or halogen, operando and in situ techniques are seldom used. The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results across various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP reactions using soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides.

Among the catalysts, CrOx (a redox-type catalyst) exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550°C. VOx, another redox-type catalyst, achieves high C3H6 selectivity (95-98%) but at low conversion rates. The non-redox-type catalyst Ga2O3 shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion.

For N2O-ODHP, VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported as the most superior catalysts. Catalytic oxyhalogenation has shown promise, with yields up to 55%. Sulfur-mediated dehydrogenation has demonstrated significant potential, with C3H6 yields reaching 81% over Al2O3 at 750°C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450°C.

Despite these advances, persistent challenges remain in the field. The corrosive nature of some soft oxidants, particularly sulfur and halogens, limits the use of operando and in situ techniques. This corrosiveness also poses challenges for process scalability and requires the development of suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Designing catalysts that can better facilitate C-H bond activation in C3H8 while maintaining good regenerability.

2. Developing catalysts with improved stability and resistance to deactivation, especially for N2O-ODHP and sulfur-mediated processes.

3. Innovating reaction systems that can balance industrial process needs with the challenges of using various acid gases as oxidants.

4. Conducting more comprehensive characterization, stability tests, and kinetic studies, particularly for sulfur-based ODHP processes.

5. Exploring alternative technologies such as chemical looping and membrane reactors to enhance process efficiency and selectivity.

6. Performing techno-economic analyses to compare the best catalysts and processes with existing technologies.

These efforts aim to overcome the inherent reaction property challenges and optimize ODHP processes for potential industrial applications.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展在各种催化剂系统中显示了令人鼓舞的结果。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物已被广泛研究，用于使用CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂的ODHP反应。

在催化剂中，CrOx（一种氧化还原型催化剂）在550°C下的高C3H8转化率下表现出更高的C3H6选择性。另一种氧化还原型催化剂VOx在低转化率下实现了高C3H6选择性（95-98%）。非氧化还原型催化剂Ga2O3在40%以下的转化率下表现出与CrOx相当的选择性。

对于N2O-ODHP，VOx和含铁沸石被报道为最优越的催化剂。催化氧卤化显示出潜力，产率高达55%。硫介导的脱氢显示出显著潜力，C3H6产率在750°C下的Al2O3上达到81%，在450°C下的CoMo/Al2O3上达到93%。

尽管取得了这些进展，该领域仍然存在持续的挑战。一些软氧化剂（特别是硫和卤素）的腐蚀性限制了原位和操作中技术的使用。这种腐蚀性也对工艺可扩展性提出了挑战，需要开发适当的材料、反应器和复杂的工艺工程。

未来研究和发展的关键领域包括：

1. 设计能够更好地促进C3H8中C-H键活化同时保持良好再生能力的催化剂。

2. 开发具有改进的稳定性和抗失活性的催化剂，特别是针对N2O-ODHP和硫介导的过程。

3. 创新反应系统，平衡工业过程需求与使用各种酸性气体作为氧化剂的挑战。

4. 进行更全面的表征、稳定性测试和动力学研究，特别是针对基于硫的ODHP过程。

5. 探索化学循环和膜反应器等替代技术，以提高过程效率和选择性。

6. 进行技术经济分析，比较最佳催化剂和工艺与现有技术。

这些努力旨在克服固有反应特性的挑战，并优化ODHP工艺以用于潜在的工业应用。
