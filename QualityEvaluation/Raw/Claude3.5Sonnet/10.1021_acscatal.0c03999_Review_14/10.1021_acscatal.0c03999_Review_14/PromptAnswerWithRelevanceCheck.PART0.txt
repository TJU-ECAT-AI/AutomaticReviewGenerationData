Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. The performance of these catalysts is typically evaluated based on their selectivity and conversion rates.

For CO2ODHP, efforts have focused on redox-type and non-redox-type catalysts. Among these, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion, while VOx shows high C3H6 selectivity (95-98%) at low conversion. Ga2O3, a non-redox-type catalyst, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion.

In N2OODHP, VOx and Fe-containing zeolites have emerged as the most superior catalysts. These catalysts show activity at relatively lower temperatures (400°C) due to the absence of thermodynamic restraints.

Catalytic oxyhalogenation, particularly oxychlorination, has shown promise with yields up to 55%. CeO2 and metal phosphate-based catalysts demonstrate good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500°C).

Gaseous sulfur compounds have proven to be effective DHP mediators, with C3H6 yields reaching up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750°C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450°C.

Despite these advances, several challenges persist in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants:

1. Corrosiveness: The use of sulfur or halogen-based oxidants presents significant corrosion issues, limiting the application of operando and in situ techniques.

2. Inherent reaction properties: Each soft oxidant presents unique challenges due to its specific reaction characteristics.

3. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration: Rapid deactivation occurs in many catalyst systems, necessitating the development of more stable and regenerable catalysts.

4. Competitive adsorption: The balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption, as well as the inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption, needs to be optimized.

5. Reaction mechanisms: A comprehensive understanding of the entire reaction network, including side reactions, is still lacking.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Designing catalysts that can effectively activate the C-H bond in C3H8 while maintaining good regenerability.

2. Developing innovative reaction systems that can address the challenges associated with using various acid gases as oxidants.

3. Conducting more in-depth studies on reaction mechanisms, including the identification of key intermediates and dominant reaction pathways.

4. Improving catalyst stability and developing effective regeneration strategies, particularly for long-term industrial applications.

5. Exploring alternative technologies such as chemical looping and membrane reactors to enhance process efficiency and selectivity.

6. Conducting techno-economic analyses to compare the best catalysts and processes with existing technologies.

7. Utilizing theoretical studies and modeling approaches to guide experimental efforts and catalyst design, especially for corrosive or less-studied oxidants.

By addressing these challenges and focusing on these key areas, researchers aim to optimize ODHP processes using soft oxidants, potentially revolutionizing propane dehydrogenation chemistry and providing more efficient routes for C3H6 production.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了各种催化剂系统的promising结果。这些催化剂的性能通常根据其选择性和转化率来评估。

对于CO2ODHP，研究重点集中在氧化还原型和非氧化还原型催化剂上。其中，CrOx在较高的C3H8转化率下表现出更高的C3H6选择性，而VOx在低转化率下显示出高C3H6选择性（95-98%）。非氧化还原型催化剂Ga2O3在40%以下的转化率下显示出与CrOx相当的选择性。

在N2OODHP中，VOx和含铁沸石已成为最优越的催化剂。由于没有热力学限制，这些催化剂在相对较低的温度（400°C）下就表现出活性。

催化氧卤化，尤其是氧氯化，显示出promising前景，产率高达55%。CeO2和金属磷酸盐基催化剂表现出良好的选择性（高达95%）和转化率（在500°C下高达70%）。

气态硫化物已被证明是有效的DHP介质，在750°C下Al2O3上C3H6产率可达81%，在450°C下CoMo/Al2O3上可达93%。

尽管取得了这些进展，使用软氧化剂的ODHP领域仍然存在几个挑战：

1. 腐蚀性：使用硫基或卤素基氧化剂会带来显著的腐蚀问题，限制了原位和操作中技术的应用。

2. 固有反应特性：每种软氧化剂由于其特定的反应特性而带来独特的挑战。

3. 催化剂失活和再生：许多催化剂系统会快速失活，需要开发更稳定和可再生的催化剂。

4. 竞争性吸附：需要优化C3H8和CO2吸附之间的平衡，以及抑制强C3H6吸附。

5. 反应机理：对整个反应网络（包括副反应）的全面理解仍然不足。

未来研究和发展的关键领域包括：

1. 设计能够有效活化C3H8中C-H键同时保持良好再生能力的催化剂。

2. 开发创新的反应系统，以解决使用各种酸性气体作为氧化剂所带来的挑战。

3. 对反应机理进行更深入的研究，包括识别关键中间体和主导反应路径。

4. 改善催化剂稳定性并开发有效的再生策略，特别是针对长期工业应用。

5. 探索化学循环和膜反应器等替代技术，以提高过程效率和选择性。

6. 进行技术经济分析，比较最佳催化剂和过程与现有技术。

7. 利用理论研究和建模方法来指导实验努力和催化剂设计，特别是针对腐蚀性或研究较少的氧化剂。

通过解决这些挑战并专注于这些关键领域，研究人员旨在优化使用软氧化剂的ODHP过程，有可能革新丙烷脱氢化学，并为C3H6生产提供更高效的途径。

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results across various catalyst systems. Different soft oxidants, including CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides, have been explored with transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts.

For CO2ODHP, redox-type catalysts like CrOx have shown high C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550°C. Non-redox-type catalysts such as Ga2O3 have also demonstrated comparable selectivity at lower conversions. In N2OODHP, VOx and Fe-containing zeolites have emerged as superior catalysts, with Fe-containing zeolites showing activity at lower temperatures (400°C) due to the absence of thermodynamic restraints.

Catalytic oxyhalogenation, particularly oxychlorination over CeO2 and metal phosphate-based catalysts, has achieved high selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500°C). Sulfur-mediated dehydrogenation has shown remarkable potential, with C3H6 yields reaching 81% over Al2O3 at 750°C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450°C.

Despite these advances, several challenges persist in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants. These include:

1. Corrosiveness of certain oxidants (e.g., sulfur, halogens) limiting the use of operando and in situ techniques.
2. Inherent reaction properties affecting catalyst stability and regeneration.
3. Competitive adsorption between reactants and products.
4. Catalyst deactivation and the need for improved regenerability.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Designing catalysts that facilitate C-H bond activation in C3H8 while maintaining good regenerability.
2. Improving understanding of redox cycles in redox-type catalysts and reaction mechanisms.
3. Developing strategies to balance adsorption of reactants and products on catalyst surfaces.
4. Enhancing catalyst stability and regeneration capabilities.
5. Renovating reaction systems to address challenges associated with using various acid gases as oxidants.
6. Developing suitable materials, reactors, and process engineering solutions to handle corrosive oxidants and their byproducts.
7. Conducting more comprehensive characterization, stability tests, and kinetic studies, especially for sulfur-based ODHP processes.

These efforts aim to optimize ODHP processes, making them more efficient and viable for industrial applications while addressing the challenges posed by soft oxidants.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展在各种催化剂系统中显示出了令人鼓舞的结果。研究人员探索了包括CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物在内的不同软氧化剂，以及过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物作为催化剂。

对于CO2ODHP，氧化还原型催化剂如CrOx在550°C下显示出高C3H6选择性和较高的C3H8转化率。非氧化还原型催化剂如Ga2O3在较低转化率下也表现出相当的选择性。在N2OODHP中，VOx和含Fe沸石脱颖而出成为优秀的催化剂，其中含Fe沸石由于没有热力学限制，在较低温度（400°C）下就表现出活性。

催化氧卤化，特别是在CeO2和金属磷酸盐基催化剂上进行的氧氯化，已实现高选择性（高达95%）和转化率（在500°C下高达70%）。硫介导的脱氢显示出显著潜力，C3H6产率在750°C下Al2O3上达到81%，在450°C下CoMo/Al2O3上达到93%。

尽管取得了这些进展，使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的领域仍然面临几个挑战：

1. 某些氧化剂（如硫、卤素）的腐蚀性限制了原位和实时技术的使用。
2. 固有的反应特性影响催化剂稳定性和再生。
3. 反应物和产物之间的竞争吸附。
4. 催化剂失活和需要改善再生能力。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 设计能够促进C3H8中C-H键活化同时保持良好再生能力的催化剂。
2. 提高对氧化还原型催化剂中氧化还原循环和反应机理的理解。
3. 开发平衡催化剂表面反应物和产物吸附的策略。
4. 增强催化剂稳定性和再生能力。
5. 改进反应系统，以解决使用各种酸性气体作为氧化剂相关的挑战。
6. 开发适当的材料、反应器和工艺工程解决方案，以处理腐蚀性氧化剂及其副产品。
7. 进行更全面的表征、稳定性测试和动力学研究，特别是针对基于硫的ODHP过程。

这些努力旨在优化ODHP过程，使其在工业应用中更加高效和可行，同时解决软氧化剂带来的挑战。
