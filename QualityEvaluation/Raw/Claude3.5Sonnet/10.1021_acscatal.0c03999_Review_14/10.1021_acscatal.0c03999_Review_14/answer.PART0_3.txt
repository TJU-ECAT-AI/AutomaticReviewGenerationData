Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP reactions using soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides.

Among redox-type catalysts, CrOx demonstrates higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550°C. The non-redox-type catalyst Ga2O3 shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion. For N2OODHP, VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported as the most superior catalysts.

Catalytic oxyhalogenation has achieved yields up to 55% for single-step C3H6 production. Gaseous sulfur compounds have shown exceptional performance as DHP mediators, with C3H6 yields reaching 81% over Al2O3 at 750°C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450°C, indicating potential for revolutionizing propane dehydrogenation chemistry.

Despite these advances, persistent challenges remain in the field. The corrosive nature of sulfur and halogen compounds limits the use of operando and in situ techniques. Scalability and corrosion issues, combined with the need for recovery processes for sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products, require the development of suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Designing catalysts that can facilitate C-H bond activation in C3H8 with good regenerability.
2. Renovating reaction systems to reconcile industrial process needs with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases.
3. Developing catalysts with improved stability and resistance to deactivation.
4. Conducting comprehensive studies on reaction mechanisms and kinetics for different ODHP routes.
5. Addressing competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6 to optimize catalyst performance.
6. Exploring alternative technologies such as chemical looping and membrane reactors for process intensification and energy loss minimization.

These research directions aim to overcome the current limitations and optimize ODHP processes using soft oxidants for potential industrial applications.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了各种催化剂系统的promising结果。过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物已被广泛研究，用于使用CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂的ODHP反应。

在氧化还原型催化剂中，CrOx在550°C下表现出更高的C3H6选择性和较高的C3H8转化率。非氧化还原型催化剂Ga2O3在40%以下的转化率下显示出与CrOx相当的选择性。对于N2OODHP，VOx和含铁沸石被报道为最优秀的催化剂。

催化氧卤化作为单步C3H6生产的前景路线，已实现高达55%的产率。气态硫化物作为DHP介质表现出卓越的性能，在750°C下Al2O3上C3H6产率达到81%，在450°C下CoMo/Al2O3上达到93%，显示出革新丙烷脱氢化学的潜力。

尽管取得了这些进展，该领域仍然存在持续的挑战。硫和卤素化合物的腐蚀性限制了原位和在线技术的使用。可扩展性和腐蚀问题，加上需要回收硫、卤素或卤化氢产品的过程，要求开发适当的材料、反应器和复杂的工艺工程。

未来研究和发展的关键领域包括：

1. 设计能够促进C3H8中C-H键活化并具有良好再生能力的催化剂。
2. 改进反应系统，以协调工业过程需求与使用各种酸性气体相关的挑战。
3. 开发稳定性更好、抗失活能力更强的催化剂。
4. 对不同ODHP路线进行全面的反应机理和动力学研究。
5. 解决CO2、C3H8和C3H6之间的竞争性吸附问题，以优化催化剂性能。
6. 探索化学循环和膜反应器等替代技术，以实现过程强化和能量损失最小化。

这些研究方向旨在克服当前的限制，并优化使用软氧化剂的ODHP过程，以用于潜在的工业应用。
