[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion."

[2] "For CO2ODHP, the major efforts have been devoted toward exploring redox-type and nonredox-type catalysts and developing compositionstructurecatalysis relationship. As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."

[3] "VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B). Because of the absence of thermodynamic restraints, these Fe-containing zeolite catalysts show activity at a relatively lower temperature of 400 C."

[4] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved. (49,50) Specifically, oxychlorination chemistry over CeO2 and metal phosphate-based catalysts show good selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500 C) in comparison to conventional ODHP (Figure 32C)."

[5] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450 C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry."

[6] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."

[7] "Despite these achievements, there are still elusive points that need to be addressed in future studies: (i) Identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts. (ii) Reaction mechanisms. (iii) Competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6. (iv) Catalyst deactivation and regeneration."

[8] "Because of the extremely corrosive nature of sulfur or halogen, operando and in situ techniques are seldom used. The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results across various catalyst systems. Different soft oxidants, including CO2, N2O, sulfur-containing compounds, and halogens/halides, have been explored with transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides as catalysts.

For CO2ODHP, redox-type catalysts like CrOx have shown high C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550°C. Non-redox-type catalysts such as Ga2O3 have also demonstrated comparable selectivity at lower conversions. In N2OODHP, VOx and Fe-containing zeolites have emerged as superior catalysts, with Fe-containing zeolites showing activity at lower temperatures (400°C) due to the absence of thermodynamic restraints.

Catalytic oxyhalogenation, particularly oxychlorination over CeO2 and metal phosphate-based catalysts, has achieved high selectivity (up to 95%) and conversion (up to 70% at 500°C). Sulfur-mediated dehydrogenation has shown remarkable potential, with C3H6 yields reaching 81% over Al2O3 at 750°C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450°C.

Despite these advances, several challenges persist in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants. These include:

1. Corrosiveness of certain oxidants (e.g., sulfur, halogens) limiting the use of operando and in situ techniques.
2. Inherent reaction properties affecting catalyst stability and regeneration.
3. Competitive adsorption between reactants and products.
4. Catalyst deactivation and the need for improved regenerability.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Designing catalysts that facilitate C-H bond activation in C3H8 while maintaining good regenerability.
2. Improving understanding of redox cycles in redox-type catalysts and reaction mechanisms.
3. Developing strategies to balance adsorption of reactants and products on catalyst surfaces.
4. Enhancing catalyst stability and regeneration capabilities.
5. Renovating reaction systems to address challenges associated with using various acid gases as oxidants.
6. Developing suitable materials, reactors, and process engineering solutions to handle corrosive oxidants and their byproducts.
7. Conducting more comprehensive characterization, stability tests, and kinetic studies, especially for sulfur-based ODHP processes.

These efforts aim to optimize ODHP processes, making them more efficient and viable for industrial applications while addressing the challenges posed by soft oxidants.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展在各种催化剂系统中显示出了令人鼓舞的结果。研究人员探索了包括CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物在内的不同软氧化剂，以及过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物作为催化剂。

对于CO2ODHP，氧化还原型催化剂如CrOx在550°C下显示出高C3H6选择性和较高的C3H8转化率。非氧化还原型催化剂如Ga2O3在较低转化率下也表现出相当的选择性。在N2OODHP中，VOx和含Fe沸石脱颖而出成为优秀的催化剂，其中含Fe沸石由于没有热力学限制，在较低温度（400°C）下就表现出活性。

催化氧卤化，特别是在CeO2和金属磷酸盐基催化剂上进行的氧氯化，已实现高选择性（高达95%）和转化率（在500°C下高达70%）。硫介导的脱氢显示出显著潜力，C3H6产率在750°C下Al2O3上达到81%，在450°C下CoMo/Al2O3上达到93%。

尽管取得了这些进展，使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的领域仍然面临几个挑战：

1. 某些氧化剂（如硫、卤素）的腐蚀性限制了原位和实时技术的使用。
2. 固有的反应特性影响催化剂稳定性和再生。
3. 反应物和产物之间的竞争吸附。
4. 催化剂失活和需要改善再生能力。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 设计能够促进C3H8中C-H键活化同时保持良好再生能力的催化剂。
2. 提高对氧化还原型催化剂中氧化还原循环和反应机理的理解。
3. 开发平衡催化剂表面反应物和产物吸附的策略。
4. 增强催化剂稳定性和再生能力。
5. 改进反应系统，以解决使用各种酸性气体作为氧化剂相关的挑战。
6. 开发适当的材料、反应器和工艺工程解决方案，以处理腐蚀性氧化剂及其副产品。
7. 进行更全面的表征、稳定性测试和动力学研究，特别是针对基于硫的ODHP过程。

这些努力旨在优化ODHP过程，使其在工业应用中更加高效和可行，同时解决软氧化剂带来的挑战。
