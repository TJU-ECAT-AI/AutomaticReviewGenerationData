<questions>

Analyze the recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, comparing the performance of various catalyst systems (including transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion. Additionally, discuss the persistent challenges in this field, such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties, and elaborate on the key areas for future research and development, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, and renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information specifically addressing oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or comparing various catalyst systems for this process. The text focuses on propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. It does not discuss the requested topics of ODHP catalyst performance, challenges like corrosiveness, or future research directions for C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability. Therefore, this question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided literature.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献没有具体讨论使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)或比较该过程的各种催化剂系统。该文本主要关注在二氧化碳存在下使用含铬Beta沸石催化剂进行丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)。它没有讨论所要求的ODHP催化剂性能、腐蚀性等挑战,或未来C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的研究方向。因此,仅基于所提供的文献无法充分回答这个问题。

The given literature does not contain information directly relevant to answering the question about recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. The text focuses on propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, rather than ODHP with soft oxidants. It does not provide comparative analysis of various catalyst systems for ODHP, discuss challenges like corrosiveness, or elaborate on future research directions for ODHP processes. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered using only the information provided in this document.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献并不包含直接回答关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展这一问题的相关信息。文本主要关注使用含铬Beta沸石催化剂在二氧化碳存在下进行的丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)，而非使用软氧化剂的ODHP。它没有提供ODHP各种催化剂系统的比较分析，也没有讨论腐蚀性等挑战，或详细阐述ODHP工艺未来研究方向。因此，仅使用本文档提供的信息无法充分回答这个特定问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain information directly relevant to analyzing recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or comparing various catalyst systems for this process. The text focuses on propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, which is a different process from ODHP. The literature does not discuss the performance of various transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides in terms of selectivity and conversion for ODHP.

The document also does not address persistent challenges in ODHP such as corrosiveness and inherent reaction properties. It does not elaborate on key areas for future research and development in ODHP, including strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

To properly answer this question, additional literature specifically focused on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using soft oxidants would be required.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

提供的文献不包含直接相关的信息来分析使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展,或比较这一过程的各种催化剂系统。该文本主要关注使用含铬Beta沸石催化剂的CO2辅助丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH),这与ODHP是不同的过程。文献没有讨论各种过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在ODHP选择性和转化率方面的性能。

该文档也没有涉及ODHP的持续挑战,如腐蚀性和固有的反应特性。它没有详细阐述ODHP未来研究和开发的关键领域,包括改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或改造反应系统以优化ODHP工艺的策略。

要正确回答这个问题,需要额外的专门针对使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢的文献。

The provided literature does not contain information specifically addressing oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants or comparing various catalyst systems for this process. The text focuses on propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. It does not discuss the performance of different transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides for ODHP, nor does it address the challenges and future research directions for ODHP processes. The document is primarily concerned with the preparation and performance of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, which is a different process from ODHP.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

所提供的文献中没有特别涉及使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的信息，也没有比较各种催化剂系统在这一过程中的性能。文本主要集中在使用含铬Beta沸石催化剂在二氧化碳存在下进行丙烷脱氢(CO2-PDH)。它没有讨论不同过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物在ODHP中的性能，也没有涉及ODHP过程的挑战和未来研究方向。该文档主要关注含铬Beta沸石催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷脱氢中的制备和性能，这与ODHP是不同的过程。

The text focuses primarily on propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2 (CO2-PDH) using chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. It does not discuss the advances, challenges, or future research directions for ODHP as requested in the question.

The literature does mention some related topics, such as propane dehydrogenation and the use of CO2 as a co-reagent, but it does not provide sufficient information to answer the specific questions about ODHP using soft oxidants, comparisons of various catalyst systems, or the challenges and future research directions in this field.
