Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. Modified V and Mo oxides using O2 as the oxidant have demonstrated propene yields in the range of 10-30%. However, steam-activated Fe-zeolites using N2O as the oxidant have shown superior performance, achieving initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K, which is comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts with O2.

The performance of Fe-zeolites in N2O-mediated ODHP is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species that efficiently dehydrogenate propane. Among the Fe-zeolites studied, FeZSM-5 showed the best resistance to deactivation, followed by Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta.

Despite these advances, there are persistent challenges in ODHP. The main drawback of Fe-zeolites is deactivation by coke formation, which causes a rapid decrease in propene yield. Coke formation originates from polymerization and dehydrogenation of propene, the main olefin formed over all catalysts investigated.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further research is needed to enhance the efficiency of C-H bond activation to increase propane conversion and propene selectivity.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: While the original catalytic activity of Fe-zeolites can be completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coking or easier regeneration processes would be beneficial.

3. Renovating reaction systems: The development of cyclically-operated reactors with parallel fixed-bed reactors has shown promise for continuous propylene production. Further optimization of such systems and exploration of other reactor configurations could lead to more efficient ODHP processes.

4. Exploring new catalyst formulations: Continued research into novel catalyst compositions and structures may yield materials with improved performance and stability.

5. Optimizing reaction conditions: Further studies on the effects of temperature, pressure, and feed composition could help maximize propene yield and minimize catalyst deactivation.

Addressing these challenges and focusing on these key areas for research and development could lead to significant improvements in ODHP processes using soft oxidants.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展在各种催化剂系统中显示了有前景的结果。使用O2作为氧化剂的改性V和Mo氧化物已经显示出10-30%的丙烯产率。然而，使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石表现出更优越的性能，在773-798 K下达到24%的初始丙烯产率，这与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂报告的最高值相当。

Fe-沸石在N2O介导的ODHP中的性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性，以及沸石中某些铁形态协调反应性原子氧物种的能力，这些物种能够有效地脱氢丙烷。在研究的Fe-沸石中，FeZSM-5显示出最佳的抗失活性能，其次是Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-β沸石。

尽管取得了这些进展，ODHP仍然面临持续的挑战。Fe-沸石的主要缺点是由于焦炭形成而导致的失活，这会导致丙烯产率迅速下降。焦炭形成源于所有研究的催化剂上形成的主要烯烃丙烯的聚合和脱氢。

未来研究和发展的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：需要进一步研究以提高C-H键活化的效率，从而增加丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：虽然Fe-沸石的原始催化活性可以在纯氧中完全恢复，但开发具有更好抗焦性或更容易再生过程的催化剂将是有益的。

3. 改造反应系统：具有平行固定床反应器的循环操作反应器的开发已显示出连续丙烯生产的前景。进一步优化此类系统并探索其他反应器配置可能会导致更高效的ODHP过程。

4. 探索新的催化剂配方：继续研究新型催化剂成分和结构可能会产生性能和稳定性更好的材料。

5. 优化反应条件：进一步研究温度、压力和进料组成的影响可以帮助最大化丙烯产率并最小化催化剂失活。

解决这些挑战并关注这些关键的研究和发展领域可能会导致使用软氧化剂的ODHP过程的显著改进。
