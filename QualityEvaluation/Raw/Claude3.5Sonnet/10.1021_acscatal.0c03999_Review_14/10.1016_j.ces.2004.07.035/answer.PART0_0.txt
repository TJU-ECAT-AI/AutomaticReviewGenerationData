[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields in the range of 10–30% using O2 as the oxidant"

[2] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773–798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."

[5] "The best action to decrease the rate of coke deactivation is to tailor catalyst properties such as active phase, the texture, the diffusion length, and reaction conditions"

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. Transition metal oxides, particularly modified V and Mo oxides, have demonstrated propene yields of 10-30% using O2 as the oxidant. However, a significant breakthrough has been achieved with steam-activated Fe-zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, reaching initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the best results obtained with V and Mo-based catalysts.

The main challenges in this field include:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Fe-zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke formation, leading to a decrease in propene yield.

2. Regeneration requirements: While the original catalytic activity can be recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen, this adds complexity to the process.

3. Understanding deactivation mechanisms: The different deactivation behaviors of various iron zeolites are not yet fully understood, hindering targeted improvements.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further research is needed to enhance the efficiency of C-H bond activation in propane.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation or easier regeneration processes is crucial.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: Tailoring catalyst properties such as active phase, texture, and diffusion length, as well as optimizing reaction conditions, can help decrease the rate of coke deactivation.

4. Exploring novel catalyst formulations: Investigation of new catalyst compositions or structures that combine high activity with improved stability is necessary.

5. Understanding deactivation mechanisms: More in-depth studies on the nature of active sites and their sensitivity to coke formation could lead to better catalyst designs.

6. Process engineering: Development of innovative reactor designs or cyclic operation strategies to manage catalyst deactivation and regeneration more effectively.

These research directions aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP and pave the way for more efficient and economically viable processes for propylene production.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了各种催化剂系统的promising结果。过渡金属氧化物，特别是改性的V和Mo氧化物，使用O2作为氧化剂时表现出10-30%的丙烯收率。然而，使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石取得了重大突破，在773-798 K下达到了24%的初始丙烯收率，与V和Mo基催化剂获得的最佳结果相当。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 催化剂失活：Fe-沸石由于焦炭形成而迅速失活，导致丙烯收率下降。

2. 再生要求：虽然原始催化活性可以通过纯氧再生恢复，但这增加了过程的复杂性。

3. 理解失活机制：各种铁沸石的不同失活行为尚未完全理解，阻碍了有针对性的改进。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：需要进一步研究以提高丙烷C-H键活化的效率。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：开发具有更强抗焦炭形成能力或更易再生过程的催化剂至关重要。

3. 优化反应系统：调整催化剂性质（如活性相、结构和扩散长度）以及优化反应条件，可以帮助降低焦炭失活率。

4. 探索新型催化剂配方：研究结合高活性和改进稳定性的新催化剂组成或结构是必要的。

5. 理解失活机制：对活性位点的性质及其对焦炭形成的敏感性进行更深入的研究，可能导致更好的催化剂设计。

6. 工艺工程：开发创新的反应器设计或循环操作策略，以更有效地管理催化剂失活和再生。

这些研究方向旨在解决ODHP中持续存在的挑战，为更高效和经济可行的丙烯生产过程铺平道路。
