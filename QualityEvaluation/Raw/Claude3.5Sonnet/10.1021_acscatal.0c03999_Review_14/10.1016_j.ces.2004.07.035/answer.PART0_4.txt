[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields in the range of 1030% using O2 as the oxidant"

[2] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Prez-Ramrez and Kondratenko, 2003; Prez-Ramrez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

[5] "Coke formation originates from polymerization and dehydrogenation (condensation) of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."

[6] "The best action to decrease the rate of coke deactivation is to tailor catalyst properties such as active phase, the texture, the diffusion length, and reaction conditions"

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of Fe-zeolites and N2O as an oxidant. While traditional catalysts like modified V and Mo oxides using O2 as an oxidant have achieved propene yields of 10-30%, Fe-zeolites with N2O have demonstrated initial propene yields of up to 24% at 773-798 K, comparable to the best performances of V and Mo-based catalysts.

The main challenge in ODHP remains catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. This issue is particularly pronounced in Fe-zeolites, causing a rapid decrease in propene yield. However, the original catalytic activity can be fully recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 minutes. The rate of deactivation varies among different zeolites, with FeZSM-5 showing the best resistance to deactivation.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: This could involve further optimization of catalyst composition and structure to enhance the efficiency of propane activation.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: While current regeneration methods are effective, developing catalysts that are more resistant to coke formation or can be regenerated more easily would be beneficial.

3. Renovating reaction systems: The development of cyclically-operated processes, as demonstrated in the study, shows promise for continuous propylene production. Further optimization of these systems, including temperature management and reactor design, could lead to more efficient ODHP processes.

4. Tailoring catalyst properties: Focusing on active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions could help decrease the rate of coke deactivation.

5. Exploring alternative soft oxidants: While N2O has shown promise, investigation of other soft oxidants could potentially lead to even better performance or address other challenges in the process.

These research directions aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP, such as catalyst deactivation and the inherent reaction properties that lead to coke formation, while building on the recent advances in catalyst performance and process design.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了令人鼓舞的结果，特别是使用Fe-沸石和N2O作为氧化剂。虽然传统的催化剂如使用O2作为氧化剂的改性V和Mo氧化物已经实现了10-30%的丙烯产率，但使用N2O的Fe-沸石在773-798 K下已经展示出高达24%的初始丙烯产率，这与V和Mo基催化剂的最佳性能相当。

ODHP中的主要挑战仍然是由于积碳形成导致的催化剂失活。这个问题在Fe-沸石中尤为突出，导致丙烯产率迅速下降。然而，通过在773 K下纯氧中再生30分钟，可以完全恢复原始催化活性。不同沸石的失活速率各不相同，其中FeZSM-5表现出最佳的抗失活能力。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：这可能涉及进一步优化催化剂组成和结构，以提高丙烷活化的效率。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：虽然目前的再生方法是有效的，但开发更耐积碳或更容易再生的催化剂将是有益的。

3. 革新反应系统：研究中展示的周期性操作过程对连续丙烯生产显示出前景。进一步优化这些系统，包括温度管理和反应器设计，可能导致更高效的ODHP过程。

4. 调整催化剂性质：关注活性相、结构、扩散长度和反应条件可以帮助降低积碳失活速率。

5. 探索替代软氧化剂：虽然N2O已经显示出前景，但研究其他软氧化剂可能会带来更好的性能或解决过程中的其他挑战。

这些研究方向旨在解决ODHP中持续存在的挑战，如催化剂失活和导致积碳形成的固有反应特性，同时建立在催化剂性能和过程设计的最新进展之上。
