          "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields in the range of 10–30% using O2 as the oxidant"

"A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Pérez-Ramírez and Kondratenko, 2003; Pérez-Ramírez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773–798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

"The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

"The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems:

1. Modified V and Mo oxides: These catalysts show propene yields in the range of 10-30% using O2 as the oxidant.

2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites: These catalysts have demonstrated superior performance in N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts with O2.

The superior performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species that efficiently dehydrogenate propane.

Among the Fe-zeolites studied, FeZSM-5 showed the best resistance to deactivation, followed by Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta.

Overall, Fe-zeolites with N2O as the oxidant have shown the most promising results in terms of selectivity and conversion for ODHP reactions.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展在各种催化剂系统中显示了有前景的结果：

1. 改性的V和Mo氧化物：这些催化剂使用O2作为氧化剂时，丙烯产率在10-30%范围内。

2. 蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石：这些催化剂在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出优异的性能，在773-798 K下初始丙烯产率达到24%。这一性能与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂报道的最高值相当。

Fe-沸石的优异性能归因于N2O作为单氧供体的特异性，以及沸石中某些铁形态协调反应性原子氧物种的能力，这些物种能够有效地脱氢丙烷。

在研究的Fe-沸石中，FeZSM-5显示出最佳的抗失活性能，其次是Fe-硅酸盐和Fe-β沸石。

总的来说，以N2O为氧化剂的Fe-沸石在ODHP反应的选择性和转化率方面显示出最有前景的结果。

          "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

"Coke formation originates from polymerization and dehydrogenation (condensation) of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."

"The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."

"Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactivation can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of active sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites, (iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

          Persistent challenges in ODHP using soft oxidants include:

1. Catalyst deactivation: The main drawback of Fe-zeolites is rapid deactivation due to coke formation, causing a decrease in propene yield over time. Coke formation originates from polymerization and dehydrogenation of propene, the main olefin formed over all catalysts investigated.

2. Varying deactivation rates: Different zeolites exhibit different rates of deactivation, which cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behavior of FeZSM-5 suggests the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivities to coke deactivation.

3. Complex deactivation process: Catalyst deactivation is a complex process that may involve multiple phenomena, including:
   - Decrease in the number of active sites
   - Decrease in the quality of active sites
   - Decrease in the accessibility of pore space

4. Regeneration requirements: While the original catalytic activity can be recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 minutes, this adds complexity to the process.

5. Inherent reaction properties: The formation of coke from propene, which is the desired product, presents an inherent challenge in optimizing the reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

These challenges highlight the need for further research into catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and process optimization to improve the efficiency and stability of ODHP processes using soft oxidants.

          使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的持续挑战包括：

1. 催化剂失活：Fe-沸石的主要缺点是由于焦炭形成而导致的快速失活，这会导致丙烯产率随时间下降。焦炭形成源于所有研究的催化剂上形成的主要烯烃丙烯的聚合和脱氢。

2. 不同的失活速率：不同的沸石表现出不同的失活速率，目前还无法满意地解释这一现象。FeZSM-5的行为表明存在对焦炭失活敏感性不同的活性铁位点。

3. 复杂的失活过程：催化剂失活是一个复杂的过程，可能涉及多种现象，包括：
   - 活性位点数量的减少
   - 活性位点质量的降低
   - 孔隙空间可及性的降低

4. 再生要求：虽然原始催化活性可以通过在773 K下纯氧中再生30分钟来恢复，但这增加了过程的复杂性。

5. 固有的反应特性：从所需产物丙烯形成焦炭，这在优化反应条件和催化剂性质方面提出了固有的挑战。

这些挑战突显了需要进一步研究催化剂设计、反应机理和过程优化，以提高使用软氧化剂的ODHP过程的效率和稳定性。
