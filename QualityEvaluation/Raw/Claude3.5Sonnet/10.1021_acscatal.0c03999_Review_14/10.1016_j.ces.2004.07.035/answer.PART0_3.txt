[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields in the range of 10–30% using O2 as the oxidant"

[2] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Pérez-Ramírez and Kondratenko, 2003; Pérez-Ramírez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773–798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5. An excellent correlation is obtained between the increase of coke content and the decrease of propene yield with time on stream."

[5] "The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with different catalyst systems. The performance of various catalysts can be compared as follows:

1. Modified V and Mo oxides: These catalysts show propene yields in the range of 10-30% using O2 as the oxidant.

2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites: These catalysts have demonstrated superior performance in N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts with O2.

The main challenges in this field include:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Fe-zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke formation, causing a decrease in propene yield over time.

2. Regeneration requirements: While the original catalytic activity can be recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 minutes, this adds complexity to the process.

3. Varying deactivation rates: Different zeolites exhibit different rates of deactivation, with the order being Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further research is needed to enhance the efficiency of C-H bond activation in propane.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts with improved resistance to coking or easier regeneration processes would be beneficial.

3. Understanding deactivation mechanisms: More research is required to explain the different deactivation behaviors of various iron zeolites.

4. Optimizing reaction systems: Developing cyclically-operated processes or other innovative reactor designs could help maintain high propene yields over extended periods.

5. Exploring new catalyst formulations: Investigating other potential catalysts or modifications to existing ones could lead to improved performance and stability.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示了不同催化剂体系的promising结果。各种催化剂的性能可以比较如下：

1. 改性的V和Mo氧化物：这些催化剂使用O2作为氧化剂时，丙烯产率在10-30%范围内。

2. 蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石：这些催化剂在N2O介导的ODHP中表现出优异的性能，在773-798 K下初始丙烯产率达到24%。这一性能与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂报道的最高值相当。

该领域的主要挑战包括：

1. 催化剂失活：Fe-沸石由于结焦而快速失活，导致丙烯产率随时间下降。

2. 再生要求：虽然原始催化活性可以通过在773 K下纯氧气中再生30分钟来恢复，但这增加了过程的复杂性。

3. 不同的失活速率：不同的沸石表现出不同的失活速率，顺序为Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：需要进一步研究以提高丙烷C-H键活化的效率。

2. 增强催化剂再生能力：开发具有更强抗结焦能力或更容易再生过程的催化剂将是有益的。

3. 理解失活机制：需要更多研究来解释各种铁沸石的不同失活行为。

4. 优化反应系统：开发循环操作过程或其他创新的反应器设计可以帮助长期维持高丙烯产率。

5. 探索新的催化剂配方：研究其他潜在催化剂或对现有催化剂进行改进可能会带来性能和稳定性的提升。
