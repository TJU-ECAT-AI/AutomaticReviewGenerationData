[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields in the range of 10–30% using O2 as the oxidant"

[2] "A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Pérez-Ramírez and Kondratenko, 2003; Pérez-Ramírez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773–798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

[3] "A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

[4] "The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5. An excellent correlation is obtained between the increase of coke content and the decrease of propene yield with time on stream."

[5] "Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactivation can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of active sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites, (iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

[6] "A cyclically-operated process for continuous production of propylene via ODHP with N2O over steam-activated iron zeolites has been developed."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. Modified V and Mo oxides using O2 as the oxidant have demonstrated propene yields in the range of 10-30%. However, a significant advancement has been made with steam-activated Fe-zeolites using N2O as the oxidant, achieving initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K, which is comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts with O2.

The performance of different catalyst systems varies, with Fe-zeolites showing superior results. Among Fe-zeolites, the rate of deactivation decreases in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5. FeZSM-5 exhibits the best resistance to deactivation.

Persistent challenges in this field include catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which causes a rapid decrease in propene yield. However, the original catalytic activity can be completely recovered through regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 minutes.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further research is needed to enhance the efficiency of C-H bond activation in propane to increase propene yield.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: While regeneration is possible, developing catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation or easier regeneration processes would be beneficial.

3. Renovating reaction systems: A cyclically-operated process for continuous propylene production has been developed using steam-activated iron zeolites. Further optimization of such systems, including heat management and reactor configurations, could lead to more efficient ODHP processes.

4. Understanding and mitigating deactivation mechanisms: Research into the complex process of catalyst deactivation, including the decrease in the number and quality of active sites and the reduction of pore space accessibility, could lead to more stable catalysts.

5. Exploring alternative soft oxidants: While N2O has shown promising results, investigation of other soft oxidants might reveal even more efficient ODHP processes.

These research directions aim to address the challenges of catalyst stability, selectivity, and overall process efficiency in ODHP reactions.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展在各种催化剂系统中显示了令人鼓舞的结果。使用O2作为氧化剂的改性V和Mo氧化物已经展示了10-30%范围内的丙烯产率。然而，使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸汽活化Fe-沸石取得了重大进展，在773-798 K下实现了24%的初始丙烯产率，这与使用O2的V和Mo基催化剂报告的最高值相当。

不同催化剂系统的性能各不相同，Fe-沸石显示出优越的结果。在Fe-沸石中，失活率按以下顺序降低：Fe-beta > Fe-硅石 > FeZSM-5。FeZSM-5表现出最佳的抗失活能力。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，这会导致丙烯产率快速下降。然而，通过在773 K下纯氧中再生30分钟，可以完全恢复原始催化活性。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：需要进一步研究以提高丙烷中C-H键活化的效率，从而增加丙烯产率。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：虽然再生是可能的，但开发具有更好抗焦炭形成能力或更容易再生过程的催化剂将是有益的。

3. 革新反应系统：已经开发出使用蒸汽活化铁沸石的循环操作工艺，用于连续丙烯生产。进一步优化这些系统，包括热管理和反应器配置，可能会导致更高效的ODHP过程。

4. 理解和缓解失活机制：研究催化剂失活的复杂过程，包括活性位点数量和质量的减少以及孔隙空间可及性的降低，可能会导致更稳定的催化剂。

5. 探索替代软氧化剂：虽然N2O已显示出令人鼓舞的结果，但对其他软氧化剂的研究可能会揭示更高效的ODHP过程。

这些研究方向旨在解决ODHP反应中催化剂稳定性、选择性和整体过程效率的挑战。
