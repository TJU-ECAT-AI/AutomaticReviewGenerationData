Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results across various catalyst systems and oxidants. This review focuses on the performance of different catalysts, the role of soft oxidants, and the persistent challenges in the field.

1. Catalyst Systems and Performance:

Transition metal/metal oxides:
- CrOx-based catalysts: High C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550Â°C [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14]. CrOx/silica shows high activity but suffers from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
- VOx-based catalysts: High C3H6 selectivity (95-98%) but at low conversion rates [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14]. VOx supported on mesoporous silica materials (MCM, SBA) show improved performance [10.1021/jp070747c].
- NiMoO4 catalysts: Show promise with CO2 and N2O as promoters [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2].

Main group element metal oxides:
- Ga2O3: Shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14].
- Fe-zeolites: Demonstrate superior performance in N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K [10.1016/j.ces.2004.07.035].

Novel catalyst systems:
- Supported alkali metal chloride melts: Show excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane and propane [10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3].
- Metal sulfide catalysts: S-ZrO2 shows high propylene selectivity (86%) in sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) [10.1039/D0CY01039A].

2. Soft Oxidants and Their Effects:

- CO2: Enhances propane conversion, maintains catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, and promotes the reverse water-gas shift reaction [10.1007/s11144-005-0268-4].
- N2O: Improves propene selectivity by slowing down the reoxidation of reduced catalyst species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010].
- SO2: Acts as an effective oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, with iron oxides supported on activated carbon achieving high propylene yields [10.1007/BF02071147].
- Molecular chlorine: Identified as the most advantageous oxidizing agent based on thermodynamic calculations [10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018].

3. Persistent Challenges:

- Balancing selectivity and conversion: High propene selectivity often comes at the cost of low propane conversion, and vice versa [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5].
- Catalyst deactivation: Many catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke formation or reduction of active species [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
- Carbon oxide formation: Minimizing the formation of COx at high degrees of propane conversion remains a significant challenge [10.1021/jp070747c].
- Catalyst stability and regeneration: Some catalysts show poor regenerability after deactivation [10.1016/S0167-2991(04)80271-4].

4. Future Research Directions:

- Optimizing catalyst composition and structure: Developing catalysts with well-dispersed active species and improved stability [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5].
- Exploring novel soft oxidants and their combinations: Investigating the potential of new oxidants or mixtures to enhance selectivity and conversion [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2].
- Improving C-H bond activation strategies: Developing more efficient methods for selective propane activation.
- Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Focusing on catalyst designs that allow for easy regeneration and longer lifetimes.
- Optimizing reaction conditions: Fine-tuning temperature, pressure, and reactant ratios to maximize performance.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of ODHP using soft oxidants has shown significant progress in recent years, with various catalyst systems and oxidants demonstrating promising results. The use of soft oxidants, particularly N2O and CO2, has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance propene selectivity and mitigate some of the challenges associated with traditional ODHP processes. However, the persistent trade-off between selectivity and conversion remains a key hurdle.

Moving forward, research efforts should focus on developing multifunctional catalysts that can simultaneously activate propane, stabilize reaction intermediates, and suppress over-oxidation. This may involve exploring novel catalyst architectures, such as core-shell structures or hierarchical porous materials, that can provide spatial control over the reaction pathway. Additionally, the integration of in-situ characterization techniques and advanced computational modeling could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and guide the rational design of next-generation catalysts.

The use of soft oxidants opens up new possibilities for process intensification and energy efficiency. Future research could explore the potential of coupling ODHP with other reactions, such as CO2 utilization or hydrogen production, to create more sustainable and economically viable processes. Furthermore, the development of membrane reactors or other innovative reactor designs tailored for soft oxidant-mediated ODHP could lead to significant improvements in overall process efficiency.

As the field advances, it will be crucial to consider the scalability and long-term stability of these catalytic systems under industrial conditions. This may necessitate the development of novel synthesis methods for large-scale catalyst production and the implementation of advanced process control strategies to maintain optimal performance over extended periods.

In conclusion, while challenges remain, the continued exploration of soft oxidants and advanced catalyst designs in ODHP holds great promise for revolutionizing propylene production, potentially leading to more sustainable and efficient processes in the petrochemical industry.

The use of soft oxidants, particularly N2O and CO2, has led to improved selectivity and reduced coke formation compared to traditional O2-based systems. However, the persistent challenge of balancing high selectivity with high conversion rates remains a key focus for future research.

Moving forward, the development of advanced catalyst systems that can effectively utilize soft oxidants while maintaining stability and high performance is crucial. This may involve the design of multi-functional catalysts that combine the benefits of different active species or the exploration of novel support materials to enhance catalyst dispersion and stability.

Additionally, the integration of in-situ characterization techniques and advanced computational modeling could provide deeper insights into reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior under operating conditions. This knowledge could guide the rational design of next-generation catalysts and reaction systems.

Furthermore, the exploration of hybrid processes that combine ODHP with other technologies, such as membrane reactors or plasma-assisted catalysis, could open new avenues for process intensification and improved energy efficiency. As the demand for propylene continues to grow, the development of economically viable and sustainable ODHP processes using soft oxidants will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the petrochemical industry.
