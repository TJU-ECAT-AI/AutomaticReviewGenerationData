Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results across various catalyst systems. This review focuses on the performance of different catalysts, persistent challenges, and future research directions in ODHP processes.

Catalyst Types and Performance:

1. Transition Metal/Metal Oxides:
   - CrOx-based catalysts: High C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14]. CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
   - VOx-based catalysts: High C3H6 selectivity (95-98%) at low conversion rates [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14]. VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts show improved performance with well-dispersed vanadia species [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5].
   - Molybdenum-based catalysts: NiMoO4 catalysts show improved performance with CO2 and N2O as promoters [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2].

2. Main Group Element Metal Oxides:
   - Fe-zeolites: Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) show high efficiency with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005].
   - Ga2O3: Shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_14].

3. Supported Catalysts:
   - Mesoporous silica-supported catalysts: High surface area materials (up to 1000 m2/g) with dispersed VOx species show propene yields up to 25% [10.1016/j.jcat.2010.06.010].
   - Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15: Shows improved stability and performance in CO2-ODHP [10.1002/cctc.201200397].

4. Novel Catalyst Systems:
   - Supported alkali metal chloride melts: Show excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane and propane [10.1007/s11244-008-9102-3].
   - Metal sulfide catalysts: S-ZrO2 demonstrates high propylene selectivity (86%) in sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) [10.1039/D0CY01039A].

Soft Oxidants:
Various soft oxidants have been explored, including CO2, N2O, SO2, and halogens. N2O generally improves selectivity but decreases overall activity compared to O2 [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5]. CO2 enhances propane conversion and maintains catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation [10.1007/s11144-005-0268-4].

Persistent Challenges:
1. Balancing selectivity and conversion: High propylene selectivity often comes at the cost of low conversion rates [10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018].
2. Catalyst deactivation: Coke formation and active site reduction remain significant issues [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
3. Carbon oxide formation: Minimizing COx production at high propane conversion rates is still a challenge [10.1021/jp070747c].
4. Corrosion: Potential issues with halogen-based systems [10.1016/j.apcata.2015.05.018].

Future Research Directions:
1. Optimizing catalyst composition and structure: Developing catalysts with well-dispersed active species and improved stability [10.1016/S0926-860X(01)00836-5].
2. Enhancing C-H bond activation: Exploring novel catalyst formulations and reaction conditions to improve propane activation.
3. Improving catalyst regenerability: Developing strategies to address coke formation and active site reduction [10.1002/cctc.201200397].
4. Investigating synergistic effects of multiple soft oxidants: Combining different oxidants to optimize selectivity and conversion [10.1016/S0920-5861(03)00120-2].
5. Exploring novel reaction systems: Investigating alternative reactor designs and process configurations to enhance ODHP performance.


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of ODHP using soft oxidants has seen significant advancements in recent years, with various catalyst systems and oxidants showing promising results. The integration of novel materials, such as mesoporous supports and metal sulfide catalysts, with carefully selected soft oxidants has opened new avenues for improving selectivity and conversion rates. Moving forward, research efforts should focus on developing multifunctional catalysts that can effectively balance C-H bond activation, selective oxidation, and resistance to deactivation. Additionally, the exploration of hybrid systems combining different soft oxidants and in-situ catalyst regeneration techniques could lead to breakthroughs in ODHP performance. As the demand for propylene continues to grow, the development of more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes using soft oxidants will play a crucial role in meeting future industrial needs while minimizing environmental impact.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of ODHP using soft oxidants has shown significant progress in recent years, with various catalyst systems and oxidants demonstrating promising results. The use of soft oxidants, particularly CO2 and N2O, has emerged as a powerful strategy to improve selectivity and yield in ODHP reactions. However, challenges remain in balancing selectivity and conversion, as well as addressing catalyst deactivation and potential corrosion issues.

Future research efforts should focus on developing more robust and efficient catalyst systems that can maintain high performance over extended periods. This may involve exploring novel catalyst compositions, optimizing support materials, and fine-tuning the interplay between catalysts and soft oxidants. Additionally, investigating the potential of hybrid systems that combine multiple soft oxidants or incorporate advanced reactor designs could lead to breakthroughs in ODHP technology.

The integration of computational modeling and machine learning approaches could accelerate the discovery of optimal catalyst formulations and reaction conditions. Furthermore, exploring the scalability of these systems and addressing engineering challenges associated with large-scale implementation will be crucial for the industrial adoption of ODHP using soft oxidants.

As the demand for propylene continues to grow, the development of more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes using soft oxidants has the potential to revolutionize the chemical industry, offering significant economic and environmental benefits.
