Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of ODHP using soft oxidants has shown significant progress, with various catalyst systems and oxidants demonstrating promising results. The use of soft oxidants like N2O and CO2 has opened new avenues for improving selectivity and yield while addressing environmental concerns. The development of novel catalyst systems, such as supported molten salts and metal sulfides, offers potential for further improvements in ODHP performance.

Future research should focus on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of C-H bond activation and oxidant interactions with catalysts at the molecular level. This could lead to the design of more efficient and stable catalysts. Additionally, exploring the potential of hybrid systems combining different soft oxidants or catalyst types may yield synergistic effects. The integration of in-situ characterization techniques and advanced modeling approaches could provide deeper insights into catalyst behavior under reaction conditions, guiding the development of next-generation ODHP catalysts and processes.

2. Exploring novel combinations of soft oxidants and promoters to fine-tune catalyst oxidation states.
3. Developing strategies to maintain optimal catalyst reduction levels during reactions.
4. Investigating alternative soft oxidants and their synergistic effects with various catalyst systems.
5. Improving catalyst stability and resistance to deactivation.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The field of ODHP using soft oxidants has shown significant progress in recent years, with various catalyst systems and oxidants demonstrating promising results. The use of soft oxidants, particularly CO2 and N2O, has emerged as a powerful strategy to improve selectivity and yield in ODHP reactions. However, challenges remain in balancing selectivity and conversion, as well as addressing catalyst deactivation and potential corrosion issues.

Future research efforts should focus on developing more robust and efficient catalyst systems that can maintain high performance over extended periods. This may involve exploring novel catalyst compositions, optimizing support materials, and fine-tuning the interplay between catalysts and soft oxidants. Additionally, investigating the potential of hybrid systems that combine multiple soft oxidants or incorporate advanced reactor designs could lead to breakthroughs in ODHP technology.

The integration of computational modeling and machine learning approaches could accelerate the discovery of optimal catalyst formulations and reaction conditions. Furthermore, exploring the scalability of these systems and addressing engineering challenges associated with large-scale implementation will be crucial for the industrial adoption of ODHP using soft oxidants.

As the demand for propylene continues to grow, the development of more efficient and sustainable ODHP processes using soft oxidants has the potential to revolutionize the chemical industry, offering significant economic and environmental benefits.
