          [1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes4 with oxygen."

[3] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with oxygen, but the selectivity to C3H6 was low and the yield of C3H6 was lower than 5%."

[4] "Recently, a SBA-15 supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (1) and showed good catalytic performances."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[6] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

[7] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

[8] "During the reaction over Cr-MCM-41 DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts with both Si/Cr ratios of 50, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreased, indicating an occurring of the deactivation of catalyst"

[9] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2."

          The literature provides insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, focusing primarily on chromium-based catalysts. Key findings include:

1. Performance of various catalyst systems:
   - Silica-supported chromium oxide showed enhanced propane dehydrogenation with CO2 as an oxidant.
   - Cr-MCM-41 prepared by impregnation demonstrated low selectivity and yield (< 5%) for propane ODH with oxygen.
   - SBA-15 supported chromium oxide showed good catalytic performance for both dehydrogenation and ODH of propane.
   - Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 achieved a yield above 15% with high selectivity (> 90%) for propene in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane.

2. Reaction mechanism:
   - A redox cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.
   - CO2 acts as an oxidant, reoxidizing reduced Cr species and producing CO selectively.

3. Challenges and areas for improvement:
   - Catalyst deactivation was observed during the reaction, indicating the need for improved catalyst stability.
   - Regenerability varies among catalysts: Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated with O2 treatment, while Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recoverable.

While the study doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or extensively discuss persistent challenges, it offers valuable insights into catalyst design, performance evaluation, and reaction mechanisms that could inform future research in ODHP using soft oxidants.

          该文献提供了关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，主要集中在铬基催化剂上。主要发现包括：

1. 各种催化剂系统的性能：
   - 二氧化硅负载的氧化铬在使用CO2作为氧化剂时表现出增强的丙烷脱氢效果。
   - 通过浸渍法制备的Cr-MCM-41在使用氧气进行丙烷ODH时表现出低选择性和低产率（< 5%）。
   - SBA-15负载的氧化铬在丙烷的脱氢和ODH方面都表现出良好的催化性能。
   - Si/Cr比为50的Cr-MCM-41在CO2脱氢丙烷反应中实现了高于15%的产率和高选择性（> 90%）。

2. 反应机理：
   - Cr6+O4四面体和Cr3+O6八面体之间的氧化还原循环在Cr-MCM-41上使用CO2进行丙烷脱氢反应中起关键作用。
   - CO2作为氧化剂，重新氧化还原态的Cr物种并选择性地产生CO。

3. 挑战和需要改进的领域：
   - 在反应过程中观察到催化剂失活，表明需要提高催化剂稳定性。
   - 催化剂的再生能力各不相同：Cr-MCM-41可以通过O2处理轻松再生，而Cr/Cab-O-Sil无法恢复。

虽然该研究没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较或广泛讨论持续存在的挑战，但它为催化剂设计、性能评估和反应机理提供了有价值的见解，这可能会为使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的未来研究提供信息。
