          [1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]. Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[3] "Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity."

[4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]."

[5] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically nitrous oxide (N2O), have been reported. The main focus has been on iron-zeolite catalysts, particularly Fe-ZSM-5. Key findings include:

1. Use of N2O instead of dioxygen as an oxidant for ODHP.
2. Development of iron-zeolites, especially Fe-ZSM-5, as unique catalysts for ODHP with N2O.
3. Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as iron precursor shows superior performance.
4. Chemisorption of N2O on FeOAl species forms stable mono-oxygen species, leading to high propylene selectivity.
5. Achieved maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1.
6. Stable propane conversion rate of ~13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and propylene production rate of ~6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 maintained for over 40 hours with N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

While the literature focuses on Fe-ZSM-5, it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison with other catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides or main group element metal oxides for ODHP reactions.

          使用软氧化剂，特别是一氧化二氮（N2O）进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展已有报道。主要关注点在于铁沸石催化剂，尤其是Fe-ZSM-5。关键发现包括：

1. 使用N2O代替二氧作为ODHP的氧化剂。
2. 开发铁沸石，特别是Fe-ZSM-5，作为N2O存在下ODHP的独特催化剂。
3. 通过固态交换法使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5表现出优异的性能。
4. N2O在FeOAl物种上的化学吸附形成稳定的单氧物种，导致高丙烯选择性。
5. 达到最大初始丙烯收率30%，转化频率高达0.037 s-1。
6. 在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的条件下，丙烷转化速率稳定在约13 mmol gcat-1 h-1，丙烯生产速率约为6 mmol gcat-1 h-1，可稳定维持40多小时。

虽然文献主要关注Fe-ZSM-5，但没有提供与其他催化剂系统（如过渡金属/金属氧化物或主族元素金属氧化物）在ODHP反应中的全面比较。

          [1] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[2] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

[3] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes."

[4] "The accumulation rate and the specific constitution of alkylbenzenes are found to depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous oxide: lower N2O/C3H8 ratios result in formation of aromatics with smaller kinetic diameter, which are accumulated at a lower rate."

          Persistent challenges in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants include:

1. Unclear reaction mechanism: The exact mechanism of ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites is not fully understood.

2. Catalyst deactivation: This remains a key issue in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidant.

3. Coke formation: The accumulation of organic species, mainly alkylbenzenes, is observed during the reaction. The rate of accumulation and specific composition of these species depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous oxide.

4. Optimization challenges: Balancing the N2O/C3H8 ratio to minimize coke formation while maintaining high conversion and selectivity is a complex task.

5. Limited understanding of coke formation: The specific nature and origin of coke deposits are not fully understood, making it difficult to develop effective strategies to prevent deactivation.

The literature does not directly address issues of corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties beyond those mentioned above. Key areas for future research and development include elucidating the reaction mechanism, understanding and mitigating catalyst deactivation, and optimizing reaction conditions to balance performance and catalyst stability.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）领域的持续挑战包括：

1. 反应机理不清：铁沸石上N2O存在下ODHP反应的确切机理尚未完全理解。

2. 催化剂失活：无论使用二氧还是一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，这仍然是氧化脱氢反应中的一个关键问题。

3. 积碳形成：在反应过程中观察到有机物种（主要是烷基苯）的积累。这些物种的积累速率和具体组成取决于丙烷和一氧化二氮的相对分压。

4. 优化挑战：平衡N2O/C3H8比率以最小化积碳形成，同时保持高转化率和选择性是一项复杂的任务。

5. 对积碳形成的认识有限：焦炭沉积物的具体性质和来源尚未完全了解，这使得开发有效的防止失活策略变得困难。

文献没有直接讨论上述提到的以外的腐蚀性或固有反应特性问题。未来研究和开发的关键领域包括阐明反应机理、理解和缓解催化剂失活，以及优化反应条件以平衡性能和催化剂稳定性。
