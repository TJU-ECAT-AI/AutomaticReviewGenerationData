          "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

"The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

"Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."

"Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly N2O, have shown promising results with steam-activated Fe-zeolites as catalysts. These catalysts demonstrate high efficiency, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, which is comparable to state-of-the-art V and Mo-oxide catalysts using O2 as the oxidant. The Fe-zeolite catalysts show remarkable performance at space velocities an order of magnitude higher than typically reported in literature.

The steam activation process is crucial for catalyst performance, generating extraframework iron species responsible for the ODHP reaction. This highlights the importance of catalyst preparation methods in achieving high catalytic activities.

While the study focuses primarily on Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA structures), it provides a benchmark for comparison with other catalyst systems. The performance of these catalysts is comparable to transition metal/metal oxide catalysts (V and Mo-oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion, demonstrating the potential of main group element metal oxides (Fe-zeolites) in ODHP processes.

          使用软氧化剂，特别是N2O进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的近期进展显示了蒸汽活化的Fe-沸石作为催化剂的良好效果。这些催化剂表现出高效率，在723 K下实现高达25%的丙烯产率，这与使用O2作为氧化剂的最先进的V和Mo氧化物催化剂相当。Fe-沸石催化剂在比文献中通常报道的高一个数量级的空速下表现出卓越的性能。

蒸汽活化过程对催化剂性能至关重要，它生成了负责ODHP反应的骨架外铁物种。这突出了催化剂制备方法在获得高催化活性中的重要性。

虽然该研究主要集中在Fe-沸石（MFI和BEA结构）上，但它为与其他催化剂系统的比较提供了基准。这些催化剂的性能在选择性和转化率方面与过渡金属/金属氧化物催化剂（V和Mo氧化物）相当，展示了主族元素金属氧化物（Fe-沸石）在ODHP过程中的潜力。

          "A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

"Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."

"The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size."

"The TEOM technique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deactivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."

"Development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

          Persistent challenges in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants include:

1. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation: This is identified as a major drawback of the process, although high initial activity can be recovered through regeneration in oxygen at 773 K.

2. Inherent reaction properties: Coke deposits likely originate from the condensation of propene, the main product of the reaction, indicating a trade-off between desired product formation and catalyst stability.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: While not directly addressed, this is implied in the search for more efficient catalysts.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts with improved resistance to coking or easier regeneration methods would be beneficial.

3. Optimizing reaction systems: The study shows that different zeolite structures (MFI vs BEA) affect deactivation rates, suggesting that optimizing catalyst structure could lead to improved performance.

4. Understanding and mitigating coke formation: The research identifies propene condensation as the likely source of coke, indicating a need for strategies to minimize this side reaction.

5. Improving transport properties and active site accessibility: The development of mesopores in zeolites is suggested as a potential strategy to enhance catalyst performance.

6. Advanced monitoring techniques: The TEOM technique is highlighted as a valuable tool for simultaneously measuring reaction progress and coking, allowing for precise monitoring and correlation of catalyst deactivation and coke formation.

These findings point to the need for continued research into catalyst design, reaction mechanisms, and process optimization to further advance ODHP technology using soft oxidants.

          使用软氧化剂进行ODHP的领域中持续存在的挑战包括：

1. 由于积碳导致的催化剂失活：这被认为是该过程的一个主要缺点，尽管通过在773 K下用氧气再生可以恢复高初始活性。

2. 固有的反应特性：积碳很可能源于丙烯（反应的主要产物）的缩合，这表明在所需产物形成和催化剂稳定性之间存在权衡。

1. 改善C-H键活化：虽然没有直接提到，但在寻找更高效的催化剂中暗示了这一点。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：开发具有更好抗积碳能力或更容易再生的催化剂将是有益的。

3. 优化反应系统：研究表明不同的沸石结构（MFI vs BEA）影响失活速率，这表明优化催化剂结构可能会带来性能改进。

4. 理解和减轻积碳形成：研究确定丙烯缩合可能是积碳的来源，表明需要策略来最小化这种副反应。

5. 改善传输性能和活性位点可及性：建议通过在沸石中发展介孔作为潜在策略来增强催化剂性能。

6. 先进的监测技术：TEOM技术被强调为同时测量反应进程和积碳的有价值工具，允许精确监测和关联催化剂失活和积碳形成。

这些发现指出了需要继续研究催化剂设计、反应机理和过程优化，以进一步推进使用软氧化剂的ODHP技术。
