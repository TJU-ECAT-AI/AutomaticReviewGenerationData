          [1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[4] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[5] "The maximum promotional effect was observed if 0.5wt% Ni was loaded."

[6] "Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

[7] "By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."

[8] "If the ODHP reaction was dominant, the conversion of CO2 on the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst was 10% higher than that on the non-promoted catalyst."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems, particularly those based on transition metal oxides. The literature discusses CrOx/silica catalysts as promising materials due to their high activity in ODHP reactions. However, these catalysts face challenges with rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

To address these issues, researchers have explored various strategies:

1. Addition of O2 as a co-feed with CO2: This approach improved the oxidizing power and decreased the deactivation rate but significantly reduced the selectivity for propylene.

2. Use of CO2 as a soft oxidant: This helps eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase.

3. Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst: This system, prepared using a sequential impregnation method, showed promising results in decreasing catalyst deactivation. The optimal promotional effect was observed with 0.5 wt% Ni loading. The Ni-promoted catalyst demonstrated improved performance, with 10% higher CO2 conversion compared to the non-promoted catalyst and stable propylene production.

The mechanism behind the Ni-promoted catalyst's improved performance involves Ni dissociating CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which helps regenerate the reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+, maintaining the active sites for the ODHP reaction.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:
1. Catalyst deactivation
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion
3. Maintaining active sites

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving C-H bond activation strategies
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Optimizing reaction systems to balance selectivity and conversion
4. Exploring novel promoters or catalyst compositions
5. Investigating alternative soft oxidants

These advancements aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP and develop more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在改进催化剂系统，特别是基于过渡金属氧化物的催化剂。文献讨论了CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂作为有前景的材料，因为它们在ODHP反应中具有高活性。然而，这些催化剂面临着由于积碳沉积和活性Cr3+还原为非活性Cr2+而导致的快速失活问题。

为解决这些问题，研究人员探索了各种策略：

1. 添加O2作为CO2的共进料：这种方法改善了氧化能力并降低了失活率，但显著降低了丙烯的选择性。

2. 使用CO2作为软氧化剂：这有助于消除积碳沉积并重新氧化还原的活性相。

3. Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂：这种通过序列浸渍法制备的系统在降低催化剂失活方面显示出有希望的结果。观察到0.5 wt% Ni负载时获得最佳促进效果。Ni促进的催化剂表现出改进的性能，与未促进的催化剂相比，CO2转化率提高了10%，并且丙烯产量稳定。

Ni促进催化剂性能改善的机理涉及Ni将CO2解离为CO和活性氧（O*ads），这有助于将还原的Cr物种从Cr2+再生为Cr3+，维持ODHP反应的活性位点。

ODHP中持续存在的挑战包括：
1. 催化剂失活
2. 平衡选择性和转化率
3. 维持活性位点

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：
1. 改进C-H键活化策略
2. 提高催化剂再生能力
3. 优化反应系统以平衡选择性和转化率
4. 探索新型促进剂或催化剂组成
5. 研究替代软氧化剂

这些进展旨在解决ODHP中持续存在的挑战，并开发更高效和可持续的丙烯生产工艺。
