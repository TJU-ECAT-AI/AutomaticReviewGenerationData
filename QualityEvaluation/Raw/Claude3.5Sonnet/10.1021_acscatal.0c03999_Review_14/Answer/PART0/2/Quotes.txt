"The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

"In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

"A major drawback of Fe-zeolites in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation by coke. This causes a rapid decrease of the propene yield, although the original catalytic activity was completely recovered after regeneration in pure oxygen at 773 K for 30 min"

"Coke formation originates from polymerization and dehydrogenation (condensation) of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."

"The different deactivation behaviour of the various iron zeolites cannot be satisfactorily explained at this stage. The behaviour of FeZSM-5 points to the presence of active iron sites with different sensitivity for coke deactivation."

"Catalyst deactivation is a complex process, which may be caused by a series of various phenomena. In the simplest case, according to Moulijn et al. (2001), catalyst deactivation can be caused by: (i) a decrease in the number of active sites, (ii) a decrease in the quality of the active sites, (iii) a decrease of accessibility of the pore space."

"Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

"Thus, three factors are concluded to contribute to the excellent selectivity to olefins. The first and probably most important impact is related to the low concentration of accessible Lewis acid sites in the supported catalysts as discussed above. The second reason is associated with the high mobility of cations and anions within the melt reducing the interactions with the olefins. The third reason is the spatial isolation of the hypochlorite oxidation sites in and on the dynamic melt."

The provided quotes do not directly address persistent challenges or key areas for future research and development in ODHP. However, based on the information given, we can infer some potential areas for improvement:

[1] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present."

[2] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."

[3] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."

[1] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."

[2] "Because of the extremely corrosive nature of sulfur or halogen, operando and in situ techniques are seldom used. The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering."

[3] "Despite these achievements, there are still elusive points that need to be addressed in future studies: (i) Identification of redox cycles on redox-type catalysts. (ii) Reaction mechanisms. (iii) Competitive adsorption between CO2, C3H8, and C3H6. (iv) Catalyst deactivation and regeneration."

[4] "Besides, side reactions are involved in addition to CO2ODHP reaction, such as RWGS and reverse Boudouard reaction. Continuous efforts have been put forth to identify the intermediates and plausible reaction paths of each reaction by both experimental and computational approaches."

[5] "The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering."

[6] "Future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."

[1] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction. First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."

[2] "Another essential problem is the deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O. Catalyst deactivation is a key issue in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation, no matter whether dioxygen or nitrous oxide is used as oxidant."

[3] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes."

[4] "The accumulation rate and the specific constitution of alkylbenzenes are found to depend on the relative partial pressures of propane and nitrous oxide: lower N2O/C3H8 ratios result in formation of aromatics with smaller kinetic diameter, which are accumulated at a lower rate."

[1] "However, after years of research, achieving high propylene yields remains elusive due to overoxidation of the olefin product to CO and CO2."

[2] "The goal here is an exploratory study of the scope, fundamental chemistry, and mechanism of S2 as an oxidant for ODHP."

[3] "These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production."

[4] "Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts."

[5] "The findings reported in this study demonstrate that SODHP is a viable route to selective propylene formation over inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts. Further experimental and theoretical studies of SODHP catalyst development are ongoing."

"Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

"Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

"Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

"As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

"The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."

"There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

"Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

"The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2  2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol. is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization."

"Nowadays, a RuO2/TiO2 catalyst is proposed for the Deacon reaction that allows performing this process at temperatures below 300 C [1921]. Catalysts based on ruthenium also show good performance in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane [22]."

"A major drawback of this process is the catalyst deactivation by coke, although the high initial activity was completely recovered after regeneration of the coked zeolites in oxygen at 773 K [12]."

"Coke deposits likely originate by condensation of propene, the main olefin formed over all the catalysts investigated."

"The rate of deactivation over the MFI catalysts is significantly lower, and can be related to the absence of large cages in this zeolitic structure, since channels and intersections are of similar size."

"The TEOM technique presented here is a unique tool for the simultaneous measurement of reaction and coking, so that catalyst deactivation and coke formation can be precisely monitored and correlated."

"Development of mesopores in the zeolites investigated, e.g., by desilication in alkaline medium [14], can be advantageous to improve transport properties and active site accessibility."

"The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."
