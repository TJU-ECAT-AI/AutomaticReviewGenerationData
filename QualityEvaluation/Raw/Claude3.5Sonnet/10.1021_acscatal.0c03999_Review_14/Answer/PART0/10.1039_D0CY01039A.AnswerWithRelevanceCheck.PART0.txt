          [1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 (ODHP) is an approach that has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of propylene production."

[2] "Recently elemental sulfur, in the form of S2 vapor, has been implemented as a soft oxidant for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to enhance ethylene selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation."

[3] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."

[4] "Figure 7 shows the conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 to those of ODHP over some well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts in the literature. Although the reaction conditions are not exactly identical, it can be seen that the propylene selectivity over S-ZrO2 is comparable to the selectivities that have been reported for optimized traditional ODHP."

[5] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."

[6] "These results highlight that SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route to selective oxidative propylene production. Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the development of sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) systems. Elemental sulfur (S2) has been implemented as a soft oxidant to enhance selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation. Various metal sulfide catalysts have been investigated, showing unique reaction product distributions.

The performance of these catalysts varies widely in terms of selectivity and conversion. S-ZrO2 has shown the highest propylene selectivity at 86%, while PdS exhibited the lowest at 38%. The conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 is comparable to that of well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts used in traditional ODHP, despite differences in reaction conditions.

These results demonstrate that SODHP using metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route for selective oxidative propylene production. However, as SODHP is still in its early stages, there is significant potential for developing more active and selective catalysts through further research.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在硫-ODHP（SODHP）系统的开发上。元素硫（S2）被用作软氧化剂，通过调节过度氧化的热力学驱动力来提高选择性。研究人员对各种金属硫化物催化剂进行了探索，发现它们产生独特的反应产物分布。

这些催化剂在选择性和转化率方面的性能差异很大。S-ZrO2显示出最高的丙烯选择性，达到86%，而PdS的选择性最低，为38%。尽管反应条件有所不同，但S-ZrO2在SODHP中的转化率-选择性关系与传统ODHP中使用的知名过渡金属氧化物催化剂相当。

这些结果表明，使用金属硫化物催化剂的SODHP可以成为选择性氧化生产丙烯的有效途径。然而，由于SODHP仍处于早期阶段，通过进一步研究开发更活跃和选择性更高的催化剂仍有很大潜力。

          [1] "However, after years of research, achieving high propylene yields remains elusive due to overoxidation of the olefin product to CO and CO2."

[2] "The goal here is an exploratory study of the scope, fundamental chemistry, and mechanism of S2 as an oxidant for ODHP."

[3] "These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production."

[4] "Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts."

[5] "The findings reported in this study demonstrate that SODHP is a viable route to selective propylene formation over inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts. Further experimental and theoretical studies of SODHP catalyst development are ongoing."

          Persistent challenges in the field of ODHP include:
1. Overoxidation of the olefin product to CO and CO2, which has limited the achievement of high propylene yields despite years of research.
2. Understanding and optimizing the fundamental chemistry and mechanism of S2 as an oxidant for ODHP.
3. Developing more active and selective catalysts, as SODHP is still in its early stages of development.

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance propane conversion while maintaining high selectivity.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to ensure long-term stability and performance.
3. Optimizing reaction systems to maximize propylene yields and minimize unwanted side reactions.
4. Conducting further experimental and theoretical studies on SODHP catalyst development.
5. Exploring the potential of inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts for selective propylene formation.

These research directions aim to address the challenges in ODHP and improve the overall efficiency of propylene production using soft oxidants, particularly in the novel SODHP process.
