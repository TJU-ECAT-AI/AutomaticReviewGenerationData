The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically CO2 and N2O, on NiMoO4 catalysts. Key findings include:

1. CO2 as a promoter:
   - Increases propane conversion at lower temperatures
   - Increases propene yield at low temperatures but decreases it at high temperatures
   - Decreases propene selectivity
   - Promotes oxidation via formation of adsorbed oxygen species (O(a))
   - Causes the catalyst to work in a higher oxidation state

2. N2O as a promoter:
   - Decreases propane conversion
   - Modestly increases propene yield
   - Significantly increases propene selectivity (32%)
   - Causes the catalyst to work in a more reduced state
   - Improves selectivity by inhibiting O2 adsorption and/or increasing catalyst reduction rate

The study demonstrates that adjusting the concentration of these promoters can be a useful tool to modulate selectivity and activity during the catalytic reaction. The addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications to improve activity and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and deactivation.

However, the literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or discuss persistent challenges in the field such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. It also does not elaborate on key areas for future research and development in improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or renovating reaction systems to optimize ODHP processes.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems, particularly those based on transition metal oxides. The literature discusses CrOx/silica catalysts as promising materials due to their high activity in ODHP reactions. However, these catalysts face challenges with rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+.

To address these issues, researchers have explored various strategies:

1. Addition of O2 as a co-feed with CO2: This approach improved the oxidizing power and decreased the deactivation rate but significantly reduced the selectivity for propylene.

2. Use of CO2 as a soft oxidant: This helps eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase.

3. Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst: This system, prepared using a sequential impregnation method, showed promising results in decreasing catalyst deactivation. The optimal promotional effect was observed with 0.5 wt% Ni loading. The Ni-promoted catalyst demonstrated improved performance, with 10% higher CO2 conversion compared to the non-promoted catalyst and stable propylene production.

The mechanism behind the Ni-promoted catalyst's improved performance involves Ni dissociating CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which helps regenerate the reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+, maintaining the active sites for the ODHP reaction.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:
1. Catalyst deactivation
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion
3. Maintaining active sites

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving C-H bond activation strategies
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Optimizing reaction systems to balance selectivity and conversion
4. Exploring novel promoters or catalyst compositions
5. Investigating alternative soft oxidants

These advancements aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP and develop more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with high surface area mesoporous silica materials containing highly dispersed surface VOx species. These catalysts have demonstrated maximum propene yields of up to 25%.

The use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent instead of molecular oxygen has led to significant improvements in propene selectivity across various catalyst systems, including iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials.

When comparing O2 and N2O as oxidants:
- O2 shows higher activity but lower propene selectivity, likely due to the formation of highly reactive species such as OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22, and Vn+  O.
- N2O offers higher propene selectivity but lower activity. This is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, which suppresses consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides.
- With N2O, the reaction probably proceeds through the participation of nucleophilic oxide ions, contributing to higher propene selectivity.

Performance comparison:
- Using O2: Higher turnover frequency of propane conversion (0.016 molC3H8 mol-1V s-1), but lower propene selectivity (50% at 10% propane conversion).
- Using N2O: Lower turnover frequency (about half of O2), but higher propene selectivity (80% at 10% propane conversion).

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems:

1. Modified V and Mo oxides: These catalysts show propene yields in the range of 10-30% using O2 as the oxidant.

2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites: These catalysts have demonstrated superior performance in N2O-mediated ODHP, with initial propene yields of 24% at 773-798 K. This performance is comparable to the highest values reported for V and Mo-based catalysts with O2.

The superior performance of Fe-zeolites is attributed to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the ability of certain iron forms in the zeolite to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species that efficiently dehydrogenate propane.

Among the Fe-zeolites studied, FeZSM-5 showed the best resistance to deactivation, followed by Fe-silicalite and Fe-beta.

Overall, Fe-zeolites with N2O as the oxidant have shown the most promising results in terms of selectivity and conversion for ODHP reactions.

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using various catalyst systems:

1. Traditional mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (e.g., vanadium) show low alkene yields (below 40%) and extensive formation of CO and CO2 at higher conversions.

2. Halogen-promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 demonstrate high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes.

3. Supported alkali metal chlorides, especially in molten form, show excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane and propane. The order of selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD.

4. Supported alkali metal chloride melts provide a dynamic surface that minimizes interactions with highly reactive products, leading to high selectivity.

5. Maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is achieved above the melting temperature of the alkali metal chloride phase.

While the study doesn't specifically focus on soft oxidants, it highlights the potential of supported molten salt catalysts for improving ODHP performance.

2. Catalyst performance comparison:
   - Cr/TiO2: High selectivity (100%) but low conversion (4.8%)
   - Cr/ZrO2: High conversion (46.5%) but lower selectivity (76.1%)
   - Cr/SiO2: Balanced performance with 27% conversion and 85% selectivity

3. Catalyst modification: Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified surface properties, decreasing redox potential and surface acidity. This resulted in decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

4. Optimized performance: K-modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts (0.2-0.4% K loading) achieved 22-31% propane conversion and 91-100% propylene selectivity at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6.

The study demonstrates the potential of using CO2 as a soft oxidant and the importance of catalyst composition in balancing conversion and selectivity. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or address persistent challenges in the field.

While the research provides valuable insights into SO2-based ODHP using carbon catalysts, it does not offer a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or address all the specific challenges and future research directions mentioned in the question. The study primarily focuses on the role of sulfur and OCPs in propane dehydrogenation using SO2 as an oxidant.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. The performance of these catalysts is typically evaluated based on their selectivity and conversion rates.

Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP reactions using soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides.

For CO2ODHP:
- CrOx (redox-type catalyst) exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550°C.
- VOx (redox-type catalyst) achieves high C3H6 selectivity (95-98%) but at low conversion rates.
- Ga2O3 (non-redox-type catalyst) shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion.

For N2OODHP:
- VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported as the most superior catalysts.

Catalytic oxyhalogenation has shown promise with yields up to 55% for single-step C3H6 production.

While the study doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or extensively discuss persistent challenges, it offers valuable insights into catalyst design, performance evaluation, and reaction mechanisms that could inform future research in ODHP using soft oxidants.

The literature focuses on the use of N2O as a soft oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using nickel molybdate catalysts. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it offers insights into the effects of N2O on catalyst performance:

1. At low concentrations (300 ppm), N2O improves propylene yield and selectivity while decreasing propane conversion.
2. N2O induces reduction of Mo at the catalyst surface by inhibiting O2 adsorption, slowing down catalyst reoxidation.
3. Higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%) lead to decreased propylene selectivity, deeper reduction of the catalyst, and formation of carbonaceous products.
4. Adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O and CO2 can modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts during the reaction, affecting catalytic performance.

The study suggests that fine-tuning the oxidation state of catalysts through careful use of soft oxidants could be a promising strategy for optimizing ODHP processes. However, challenges persist in balancing catalyst reduction and oxidation states for optimal performance and preventing excessive catalyst reduction at higher N2O concentrations.

5. Achieved maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1.
6. Stable propane conversion rate of ~13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and propylene production rate of ~6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 maintained for over 40 hours with N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

While the literature focuses on Fe-ZSM-5, it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison with other catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides or main group element metal oxides for ODHP reactions.

The literature focuses on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings (0.5-9.5 wt%) using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

Key findings include:
1. Vanadium-based materials, specifically VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, are reported to be highly active and selective for ODP.
2. Replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant leads to decreased overall activity but increased selectivity towards propene formation at the same degree of propane conversion.
3. Isolated vanadium sites are beneficial for propene selectivity, but full coverage of the support with well-dispersed vanadia species is ideal for high performance.
4. Main products were propene, CO, and CO2 for both oxidants.
5. N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, resulting in lower steady-state concentration of active sites and higher propene selectivity.
6. Optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen is crucial for controlling selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

The study suggests that future research should focus on:

It also doesn't specifically discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the development of sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) systems. Elemental sulfur (S2) has been implemented as a soft oxidant to enhance selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation. Various metal sulfide catalysts have been investigated, showing unique reaction product distributions.

The performance of these catalysts varies widely in terms of selectivity and conversion. S-ZrO2 has shown the highest propylene selectivity at 86%, while PdS exhibited the lowest at 38%. The conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 is comparable to that of well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts used in traditional ODHP, despite differences in reaction conditions.

These results demonstrate that SODHP using metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route for selective oxidative propylene production. However, as SODHP is still in its early stages, there is significant potential for developing more active and selective catalysts through further research.

3. The nature of VOx species strongly influences catalyst performance, with more polymerized VOx species showing higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation.
4. While N2O improves selectivity, it generally leads to lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2.

The main persistent challenge is minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx), which is favored at high degrees of propane conversion due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane.

3. Higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%) lead to decreased propylene selectivity, deeper reduction of the catalyst, and formation of carbonaceous products.
4. Adjusting the concentration of promoters like N2O and CO2 can modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts during the reaction, affecting catalytic performance.

The study suggests that fine-tuning the oxidation state of catalysts through careful use of soft oxidants could be a promising strategy for optimizing ODHP processes. However, challenges persist in balancing catalyst reduction and oxidation states for optimal performance and preventing excessive catalyst reduction at higher N2O concentrations.

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Optimizing N2O concentrations for different catalyst systems
2. Investigating combinations of promoters to fine-tune catalyst oxidation states
3. Developing strategies to maintain optimal catalyst reduction levels during reaction
4. Exploring the use of other soft oxidants in combination with N2O
5. Improving catalyst regenerability to address deep reduction and carbonaceous product formation

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically nitrous oxide (N2O), have been reported. The main focus has been on iron-zeolite catalysts, particularly Fe-ZSM-5. Key findings include:

1. Use of N2O instead of dioxygen as an oxidant for ODHP.
2. Development of iron-zeolites, especially Fe-ZSM-5, as unique catalysts for ODHP with N2O.
3. Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as iron precursor shows superior performance.
4. Chemisorption of N2O on FeOAl species forms stable mono-oxygen species, leading to high propylene selectivity.
5. Achieved maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s-1.
6. Stable propane conversion rate of ~13 mmol gcat-1 h-1 and propylene production rate of ~6 mmol gcat-1 h-1 maintained for over 40 hours with N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

While the literature focuses on Fe-ZSM-5, it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison with other catalyst systems such as transition metal/metal oxides or main group element metal oxides for ODHP reactions.

The literature focuses on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings (0.5-9.5 wt%) using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

Key findings include:
1. Vanadium-based materials, specifically VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, are reported to be highly active and selective for ODP.
2. Replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant leads to decreased overall activity but increased selectivity towards propene formation at the same degree of propane conversion.
3. Isolated vanadium sites are beneficial for propene selectivity, but full coverage of the support with well-dispersed vanadia species is ideal for high performance.
4. Main products were propene, CO, and CO2 for both oxidants.
5. N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, resulting in lower steady-state concentration of active sites and higher propene selectivity.
6. Optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen is crucial for controlling selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

The study suggests that future research should focus on:
1. Designing catalytic surfaces with full coverage of well-dispersed active species.
2. Optimizing the concentration of active lattice oxygen.
3. Further exploring soft oxidants like N2O to improve selectivity.

While the study provides valuable insights into VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts and the use of N2O as a soft oxidant, it does not comprehensively cover various catalyst systems or address persistent challenges like corrosiveness. It also doesn't specifically discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on the development of sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) systems. Elemental sulfur (S2) has been implemented as a soft oxidant to enhance selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation. Various metal sulfide catalysts have been investigated, showing unique reaction product distributions.

The performance of these catalysts varies widely in terms of selectivity and conversion. S-ZrO2 has shown the highest propylene selectivity at 86%, while PdS exhibited the lowest at 38%. The conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 is comparable to that of well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts used in traditional ODHP, despite differences in reaction conditions.

These results demonstrate that SODHP using metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route for selective oxidative propylene production. However, as SODHP is still in its early stages, there is significant potential for developing more active and selective catalysts through further research.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of N2O as an oxidant compared to O2. The performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides (specifically molybdenum and vanadium oxides), has been studied.

Key findings include:
1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly on mesoporous silica materials (MCM, SBA), show improved performance compared to unsupported catalysts.
2. N2O as an oxidant demonstrates superior performance in terms of selectivity compared to O2, achieving higher primary C3H6 selectivity at low propane conversion and lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation.
3. The nature of VOx species strongly influences catalyst performance, with more polymerized VOx species showing higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation.
4. While N2O improves selectivity, it generally leads to lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2.

The main persistent challenge is minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx), which is favored at high degrees of propane conversion due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, but challenges remain. Various catalyst systems have been explored:

1. Traditional catalysts: Yield of propylene does not exceed 35%, which is economically insufficient.
2. Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides: Achieved a yield of 40%.
3. Pt-H3PMo12O40 catalyst: Showed high selectivity (94-96%) at 200°C, but with low conversion (approximately 20%).
4. Ru/TiO2 catalyst: Demonstrated 95% selectivity toward propylene at 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion at 400°C.

Soft oxidants being investigated include organochlorine compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, nitrous oxide, CO2, and halogens. Molecular chlorine has been identified as the most advantageous oxidizing agent based on thermodynamic calculations.

The performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion varies:
- Mixed metal oxides show improved yields compared to traditional catalysts.
- Heteropoly compounds offer high selectivity but suffer from low conversion rates.
- Ruthenium-based catalysts with molecular chlorine as an oxidant demonstrate a good balance between selectivity and conversion.

Persistent challenges include balancing high selectivity with high conversion rates, managing reaction temperatures, and addressing potential corrosion issues with halogen-based systems.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly N2O, have shown promising results with steam-activated Fe-zeolites as catalysts. These catalysts demonstrate high efficiency, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, which is comparable to state-of-the-art V and Mo-oxide catalysts using O2 as the oxidant. The Fe-zeolite catalysts show remarkable performance at space velocities an order of magnitude higher than typically reported in literature.

The steam activation process is crucial for catalyst performance, generating extraframework iron species responsible for the ODHP reaction. This highlights the importance of catalyst preparation methods in achieving high catalytic activities.

While the study focuses primarily on Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA structures), it provides a benchmark for comparison with other catalyst systems. The performance of these catalysts is comparable to transition metal/metal oxide catalysts (V and Mo-oxides) in terms of selectivity and conversion, demonstrating the potential of main group element metal oxides (Fe-zeolites) in ODHP processes.
