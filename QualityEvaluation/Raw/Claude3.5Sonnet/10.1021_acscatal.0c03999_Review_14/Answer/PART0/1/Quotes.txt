[1] "Dynamic effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts are reported."

[2] "CO2 promotes oxidation probably via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4."

[3] "In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts."

[4] "Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction."

[5] "With respect to the results obtained for the tests in the absence of CO2, the consequences of the addition of CO2 in the gas feed, which were verified in replicate experiments, are: (i) an increase in the conversion of propane at 723 K (18%), an increase at 673 K and no change at 753 K, (ii) an increase in the yield of propene at low temperature (18%) and a decrease at high temperature (8%), (iii) a decrease in the selectivity of propylene at all temperatures (10% on average)"

[6] "The addition of 300 ppm of N2O leads to: (i) a decrease in the conversion of propane (15%), (ii) a modest increase in the yield in propene (11%), (iii) an increase in the selectivity in propene (32%), (iv) a weak decrease in the selectivity in CO2 (7%)."

[7] "The addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications. Gaseous dopes added to the reactant feed of a reactor could improve activity and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and deactivation."

[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[4] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[5] "The maximum promotional effect was observed if 0.5wt% Ni was loaded."

[6] "Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

[7] "By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."

[8] "If the ODHP reaction was dominant, the conversion of CO2 on the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst was 10% higher than that on the non-promoted catalyst."

"Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene, high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]. Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."

"When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,2123]."

"Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a consequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."

"The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2, OxV5    O22 , and Vn+  O. The latter species was experimentally proven to be very active, reacting with propane partially and with propene even completely already at room temperature."

"In contrast, such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions. This might also be the reason for the higher propene selectivity in the ODP reaction with N2O."

"For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), promising formulations are based on modified V and Mo oxides, with propene yields in the range of 10–30% using O2 as the oxidant"

"A recent study has shown the superior performance of steam-activated Fe-zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation, Eq. (1) (Pérez-Ramírez and Kondratenko, 2003; Pérez-Ramírez and Gallardo-Llamas, 2004). Initial propene yields of 24% at 773–798 K were achieved, comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo-based catalysts with O2."

"The remarkable performance of Fe-zeolites has been related to the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined iron forms in the zeolite for coordinating reactive atomic oxygen species able to efficiently dehydrogenate propane"

"The rate of deactivation strongly differs among the zeolites studied, decreasing in the order: Fe-beta > Fe-silicalite > FeZSM-5."

"Lower alkenes such as ethene, propene and butene are important feedstocks in the chemical industry and their demand has been increasing continuously [1, 2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is a highly promising route for the large-scale production of alkenes."

"Over mixed oxides with redox active transition metal cations (such as vanadium), the alkene yield in ODH is well below 40% and extensive formation of CO and CO2 is generally observed at higher conversions [35]."

"In contrast, halogen promoted alkali and rare earth mixed oxides supported on MgO, SiO2, and ZrO2 show high yields of olefins during oxidative conversion of lower alkanes [611]."

"Recently, it was demonstrated that alkali metal chlorides supported on SiO2 or ZrO2 have also shown excellent catalytic performance in ODH of ethane, although catalyst stability was not satisfactory [14, 15]."

"Supported alkali metal chloride melts emerge as new group of catalysts for applications in which the surface concentration of accessible metal cations has to be minimized. The melt provides a dynamic surface that minimizes unsaturation of cations and anions minimizing interaction with highly reactive products."

"The order of the catalysts with respect to selectivity to olefins is Li-K-MD > Li-Na-MD > Li-MD > K-MD > Na-MD. The maximum selectivity to ethene (94%) in ODH of ethane and propene (70%) in ODH of propane is obtained above the temperature, at which the alkali metal chloride phase melts staying nearly constant thereafter."

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed selectivity to propylene of about 100%, but the conversion of propane on this catalyst was low (4.8%) at 923 K. In contrast, the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst showed a high conversion of propane (46.5%), but the selectivity to propylene was low (76.1%)."

[4] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."

[5] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

[6] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."

"It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

"As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2]."

"The significantly higher yield of propylene after the first pulse of RSO compared to R can be attributed to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2."

"Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-10] and elemental sulfur [3,11] can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

"It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises."

"Carrying out the reaction under flow conditions at a constant contact time indicates that propane conversion decreases with time (Table I). In this case the surface area of the catalyst diminishes and one can observe disbalance with respect to carbon. These data suggest that during the reaction OCP are formed on the catalyst surface."

"OCP deposition increases the portion of a stepwise mechanism (Fig. 2)."

"To establish the mechanism of participation of the oxidant propylene formation and OCP, pulses of either propane (R), or propane with an oxidizing agent (RSO) or separate pulses of propane and an oxidizing agent (R and SO) were admitted to the catalyst."

[1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion."

[2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."

[3] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."

[4] "The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 95%98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A)."

[5] "The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion."

[6] "VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B)."

[7] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."

[8] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450 C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry."

[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes4 with oxygen."

[3] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with oxygen, but the selectivity to C3H6 was low and the yield of C3H6 was lower than 5%."

[4] "Recently, a SBA-15 supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (1) and showed good catalytic performances."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[6] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

[7] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

[8] "During the reaction over Cr-MCM-41 DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts with both Si/Cr ratios of 50, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreased, indicating an occurring of the deactivation of catalyst"

[9] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2."

[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]. Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[3] "Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity."

[4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]."

[5] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

"For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based materials were reported to be very active and selective [1,4,5]."

"By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

"As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."

"A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."

"Since N2O decomposition, over the studied materials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."

"For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."

"Propene, CO and CO2 were the main products over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants."

"Higher propene selectivities were achieved in the presence of N2O over all catalytic materials at similar levels of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

"To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."

"The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 (ODHP) is an approach that has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of propylene production."

[2] "Recently elemental sulfur, in the form of S2 vapor, has been implemented as a soft oxidant for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to enhance ethylene selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation."

[3] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."

[4] "Figure 7 shows the conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 to those of ODHP over some well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts in the literature. Although the reaction conditions are not exactly identical, it can be seen that the propylene selectivity over S-ZrO2 is comparable to the selectivities that have been reported for optimized traditional ODHP."

[5] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."

[6] "These results highlight that SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route to selective oxidative propylene production. Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts."

"Promising catalyst formulations are based on relatively complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides. However, the main challenge is still to minimize the formation of carbon oxides (COx) that is favored at high degrees of propane conversion because of higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

"Several recent studies of the ODP reaction were dealt with VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) with specific surface area of ca. 1000 m2/g."

"In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O."

"Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

"Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

"Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over various catalysts is being developed [68]. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."

"The yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides [9]. The highest selectivity (94–96%) was achieved at 200◦C over Pt–H3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

"There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

"Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

"It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400◦C."

"Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

"The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

"Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."

"Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."

[1] "Dynamic effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts are reported."

[3] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."

[4] "The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 95%98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A)."

[5] "The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion."

[6] "VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B)."

[7] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."

[8] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450 C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry."

[1] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane2 or ethane3 over silica supported chromium oxide."

[2] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes4 with oxygen."

[3] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with oxygen, but the selectivity to C3H6 was low and the yield of C3H6 was lower than 5%."

[4] "Recently, a SBA-15 supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 (1) and showed good catalytic performances."

[5] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."

[6] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

[7] "It is concluded that during the reaction C3H8 is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+O6 octahedra. The reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+O4 tetrahedra and Cr3+O6 octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

[8] "During the reaction over Cr-MCM-41 DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil catalysts with both Si/Cr ratios of 50, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreased, indicating an occurring of the deactivation of catalyst"

[9] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2."

[1] "We report effects brought about by the introduction of N2O as gas dope in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."

[2] "At low concentration (300 ppm) of N2O, the conversion of propane decreases, the yield in propylene increases and the selectivity to propylene is improved."

[3] "N2O induces the reduction of Mo at the surface of the catalyst. This is supposed to occur through an inhibition of the adsorption of O2 because of the presence of N2O at the surface of the catalyst, which thus slows down the reoxidation rate of the catalyst."

[4] "At higher concentrations of N2O (110% in volume), the selectivity in propylene decreases, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further. The catalyst is more deeply reduced and carbonaceous products is formed."

[5] "This work shows that adjusting the concentration of promoters, like N2O and CO2, could be a useful tool to modulate the oxidation state of oxide catalysts at work during the catalytic reaction, and thus their catalytic performances."

[1] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention [213]. Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."

[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."

[3] "Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity."

[4] "In our previous work, Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained [20]."

[5] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

"For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based materials were reported to be very active and selective [1,4,5]."

"By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

"As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."

"A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."

"Since N2O decomposition, over the studied materials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."

"For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."

"Propene, CO and CO2 were the main products over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants."

"Higher propene selectivities were achieved in the presence of N2O over all catalytic materials at similar levels of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

"To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."

"The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 (ODHP) is an approach that has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of propylene production."

[2] "Recently elemental sulfur, in the form of S2 vapor, has been implemented as a soft oxidant for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to enhance ethylene selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation."

[3] "Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450 - 550C."

[4] "Figure 7 shows the conversion-selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 to those of ODHP over some well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts in the literature. Although the reaction conditions are not exactly identical, it can be seen that the propylene selectivity over S-ZrO2 is comparable to the selectivities that have been reported for optimized traditional ODHP."

[5] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."

[6] "These results highlight that SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route to selective oxidative propylene production. Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts."

"Promising catalyst formulations are based on relatively complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides. However, the main challenge is still to minimize the formation of carbon oxides (COx) that is favored at high degrees of propane conversion because of higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

"Several recent studies of the ODP reaction were dealt with VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) with specific surface area of ca. 1000 m2/g."

"In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O."

"Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

"Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

"Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

"The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over various catalysts is being developed [68]. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."

"The yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides [9]. The highest selectivity (94–96%) was achieved at 200◦C over Pt–H3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

"There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

"Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

"It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400◦C."

"Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with initial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."

"The propene yields achieved are similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo-oxides with O2 as the oxidant [17,18]. The space velocity in our experiments is one order of magnitude higher than typically applied in the literature, which is a clear indication of the remarkable performance of steamed iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O."

"Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."

"Extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, are thus responsible for the oxydehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide."
