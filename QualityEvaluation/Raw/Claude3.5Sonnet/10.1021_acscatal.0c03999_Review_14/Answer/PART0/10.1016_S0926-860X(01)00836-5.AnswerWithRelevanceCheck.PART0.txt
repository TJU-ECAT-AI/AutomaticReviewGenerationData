          "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based materials were reported to be very active and selective [1,4,5]."

"By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

"As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."

"A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."

"Since N2O decomposition, over the studied materials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."

"For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."

"Propene, CO and CO2 were the main products over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants."

"Higher propene selectivities were achieved in the presence of N2O over all catalytic materials at similar levels of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

"To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."

"The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

          The literature focuses on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings (0.5-9.5 wt%) using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

Key findings include:
1. Vanadium-based materials, specifically VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, are reported to be highly active and selective for ODP.
2. Replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant leads to decreased overall activity but increased selectivity towards propene formation at the same degree of propane conversion.
3. Isolated vanadium sites are beneficial for propene selectivity, but full coverage of the support with well-dispersed vanadia species is ideal for high performance.
4. Main products were propene, CO, and CO2 for both oxidants.
5. N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, resulting in lower steady-state concentration of active sites and higher propene selectivity.
6. Optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen is crucial for controlling selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

The study suggests that future research should focus on:
1. Designing catalytic surfaces with full coverage of well-dispersed active species.
2. Optimizing the concentration of active lattice oxygen.
3. Further exploring soft oxidants like N2O to improve selectivity.

While the study provides valuable insights into VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts and the use of N2O as a soft oxidant, it does not comprehensively cover various catalyst systems or address persistent challenges like corrosiveness. It also doesn't specifically discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability.

          这项研究主要关注使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，特别比较了使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂时，具有不同钒负载量（0.5-9.5重量%）的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的性能。

主要发现包括：
1. 钒基材料，特别是VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂，被报道对ODP具有高活性和选择性。
2. 用N2O替代O2作为氧化剂会导致整体活性降低，但在相同的丙烷转化度下，对丙烯形成的选择性增加。
3. 孤立的钒位有利于丙烯选择性，但用分散良好的钒氧化物完全覆盖载体表面是获得高性能的理想方案。
4. 两种氧化剂的主要产物都是丙烯、CO和CO2。
5. N2O的分解比O2的活化更难进行，导致活性位点的稳态浓度较低，丙烯选择性较高。
6. 优化活性晶格氧的稳态浓度对控制选择性氧化和燃烧反应至关重要。

该研究建议未来的研究应该关注：
1. 设计完全覆盖分散良好的活性物种的催化表面。
2. 优化活性晶格氧的浓度。
3. 进一步探索软氧化剂（如N2O）以提高选择性。

虽然该研究对VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂和使用N2O作为软氧化剂提供了有价值的见解，但它并未全面涵盖各种催化剂系统或解决持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性。它也没有具体讨论改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力的策略。
