          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."

[3] "The 5%Cr/TiO2 catalyst showed selectivity to propylene of about 100%, but the conversion of propane on this catalyst was low (4.8%) at 923 K. In contrast, the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst showed a high conversion of propane (46.5%), but the selectivity to propylene was low (76.1%)."

[4] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."

[5] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

[6] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."

          The literature provides insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using CO2 as a soft oxidant, focusing on chromium-based catalysts. Key findings include:

1. CO2 as a soft oxidant: CO2 increases equilibrium conversion, maintains catalyst activity by inhibiting coke formation, and enhances propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

2. Catalyst performance comparison:
   - Cr/TiO2: High selectivity (100%) but low conversion (4.8%)
   - Cr/ZrO2: High conversion (46.5%) but lower selectivity (76.1%)
   - Cr/SiO2: Balanced performance with 27% conversion and 85% selectivity

3. Catalyst modification: Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides to Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified surface properties, decreasing redox potential and surface acidity. This resulted in decreased propane conversion but increased propylene selectivity.

4. Optimized performance: K-modified Cr/SiO2 catalysts (0.2-0.4% K loading) achieved 22-31% propane conversion and 91-100% propylene selectivity at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6.

The study demonstrates the potential of using CO2 as a soft oxidant and the importance of catalyst composition in balancing conversion and selectivity. However, it does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or address persistent challenges in the field.

          这篇文献提供了使用CO2作为软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，主要关注铬基催化剂。主要发现包括：

1. CO2作为软氧化剂：CO2增加平衡转化率，通过抑制积碳维持催化剂活性，并通过逆水气变换反应提高丙烷转化率。

2. 催化剂性能比较：
   - Cr/TiO2：高选择性（100%）但低转化率（4.8%）
   - Cr/ZrO2：高转化率（46.5%）但较低选择性（76.1%）
   - Cr/SiO2：平衡性能，转化率27%，选择性85%

3. 催化剂改性：向Cr/SiO2催化剂中添加碱金属和碱土金属氧化物改变了表面性质，降低了氧化还原电位和表面酸度。这导致丙烷转化率降低但丙烯选择性提高。

4. 优化性能：K改性的Cr/SiO2催化剂（K负载量0.2-0.4%）在923 K、CO2/C3H8比为3.6的条件下实现了22-31%的丙烷转化率和91-100%的丙烯选择性。

该研究展示了使用CO2作为软氧化剂的潜力，以及催化剂组成在平衡转化率和选择性方面的重要性。然而，它没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，也没有讨论该领域持续存在的挑战。

[1] "It was found that there was carbon deposited on the used catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane without carbon dioxide. In contrast, no carbon deposit was observed on the catalysts when CO2 was present."

[2] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."

[3] "Addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modified the surface properties and decreased the redox potential and surface acidity, resulting in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene."
