          [1] "Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with soft oxidants over a variety of catalysts are reviewed in this work. Figure 32 summarizes and compares the catalytic performance of key catalysts explored in each reaction route in the form of the correlation between selectivity and conversion."

[2] "In general, transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from the main group elements have been extensively studied for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants, such as CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides."

[3] "As a representative of redox-type catalysts, CrOx exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion among all catalysts at 550 C, as presented in Figure 32A."

[4] "The catalytic performance of other redox-type catalysts, VOx, has not yet reached high C3H8 conversion at 550 C (i.e., >20%), though high C3H6 selectivity (i.e., 95%98%) is achieved at low conversion (Figure 32A)."

[5] "The non-redox-type catalyst, Ga2O3, shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion."

[6] "VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported to be the most superior catalysts for N2OODHP (Figure 32B)."

[7] "Catalytic oxyhalogenation is a promising route for single-step C3H6 production and yields of up to 55% have been achieved."

[8] "The gaseous sulfur compounds, on the other hand, act as effective DHP mediators because of their high affinity for hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule (Figure 32D). C3H6 yield rises up to 81% over Al2O3 at 750 C and 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450 C, indicating a potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results with various catalyst systems. The performance of these catalysts is typically evaluated based on their selectivity and conversion rates.

Transition metal/metal oxides and metal oxides from main group elements have been extensively studied for ODHP reactions using soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides.

For CO2ODHP:
- CrOx (redox-type catalyst) exhibits higher C3H6 selectivity at elevated C3H8 conversion at 550°C.
- VOx (redox-type catalyst) achieves high C3H6 selectivity (95-98%) but at low conversion rates.
- Ga2O3 (non-redox-type catalyst) shows comparable selectivity to CrOx below 40% conversion.

For N2OODHP:
- VOx and Fe-containing zeolites are reported as the most superior catalysts.

Catalytic oxyhalogenation has shown promise with yields up to 55% for single-step C3H6 production.

Sulfur-mediated dehydrogenation has demonstrated significant potential:
- C3H6 yields reaching 81% over Al2O3 at 750°C
- C3H6 yields reaching 93% over CoMo/Al2O3 at 450°C

These results indicate the potential to revolutionize propane dehydrogenation chemistry using soft oxidants.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展在各种催化剂系统中显示了令人鼓舞的结果。这些催化剂的性能通常根据其选择性和转化率来评估。

过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物已被广泛研究，用于使用CO2、N2O、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂的ODHP反应。

对于CO2ODHP：
- CrOx（氧化还原型催化剂）在550°C下的高C3H8转化率下表现出更高的C3H6选择性。
- VOx（氧化还原型催化剂）在低转化率下实现了高C3H6选择性（95-98%）。
- Ga2O3（非氧化还原型催化剂）在40%以下的转化率下表现出与CrOx相当的选择性。

对于N2OODHP：
- VOx和含铁沸石被报道为最优越的催化剂。

催化氧卤化显示出潜力，单步C3H6生产的产率高达55%。

硫介导的脱氢显示出显著潜力：
- C3H6产率在750°C下的Al2O3上达到81%
- C3H6产率在450°C下的CoMo/Al2O3上达到93%

这些结果表明使用软氧化剂革新丙烷脱氢化学的潜力。

          [1] "In general, future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."

[2] "Because of the extremely corrosive nature of sulfur or halogen, operando and in situ techniques are seldom used. The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering."

[4] "Besides, side reactions are involved in addition to CO2ODHP reaction, such as RWGS and reverse Boudouard reaction. Continuous efforts have been put forth to identify the intermediates and plausible reaction paths of each reaction by both experimental and computational approaches."

[5] "The potential scalability of the underlying process and corrosion issues combined with the recovery process of sulfur, halogen, or hydrogen halide products will require suitable materials, reactors, and sophisticated process engineering."

[6] "Future efforts should be devoted to designing catalysts that can facilitate the activation of the CH bond in C3H8 with good regenerability, as well as to renovating the reaction systems that can reconcile the need for industrial processes with challenges associated with utilizing various acid gases."

          Despite recent advances, several challenges persist in the field of ODHP using soft oxidants:

1. Corrosiveness: The use of sulfur or halogen-based oxidants presents significant corrosion issues, limiting the application of operando and in situ techniques.

2. Inherent reaction properties: Each soft oxidant presents unique challenges due to its specific reaction characteristics.

3. Catalyst deactivation and regeneration: Rapid deactivation occurs in many catalyst systems, necessitating the development of more stable and regenerable catalysts.

4. Competitive adsorption: The balance between C3H8 and CO2 adsorption, as well as the inhibition of strong C3H6 adsorption, needs to be optimized.

5. Reaction mechanisms: A comprehensive understanding of the entire reaction network, including side reactions, is still lacking.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Designing catalysts that can effectively activate the C-H bond in C3H8 while maintaining good regenerability.

2. Developing innovative reaction systems that can address the challenges associated with using various acid gases as oxidants.

3. Conducting more in-depth studies on reaction mechanisms, including the identification of key intermediates and dominant reaction pathways.
