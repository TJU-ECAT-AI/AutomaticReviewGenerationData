          "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over various catalysts is being developed [68]. The yield of propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation even over the best catalysts known to date does not exceed 35% which is not sufficient to satisfy the economic feasibility."

"The yield of 40% was achieved over Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides [9]. The highest selectivity (94–96%) was achieved at 200◦C over Pt–H3PMo12O40 catalyst at the conversion of approximately 20% [10]."

"There are attempts to use various organochlorine compounds [11,12], sulfur-containing compounds [13,14], nitrous oxide [15,16], CO2 [17], and halogens [18] as mild oxidants for the dehydrogenation of propane."

"Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

"It was found that Ru/TiO2 catalyst prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of titania with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution of K4[Ru2OCl10] revealed the highest catalytic activity. The selectivity toward propylene reached 95% at the propane conversion of 50% and the complete conversion of chlorine at 400◦C."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, but challenges remain. Various catalyst systems have been explored:

1. Traditional catalysts: Yield of propylene does not exceed 35%, which is economically insufficient.
2. Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O mixed oxides: Achieved a yield of 40%.
3. Pt-H3PMo12O40 catalyst: Showed high selectivity (94-96%) at 200°C, but with low conversion (approximately 20%).
4. Ru/TiO2 catalyst: Demonstrated 95% selectivity toward propylene at 50% propane conversion and complete chlorine conversion at 400°C.

Soft oxidants being investigated include organochlorine compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, nitrous oxide, CO2, and halogens. Molecular chlorine has been identified as the most advantageous oxidizing agent based on thermodynamic calculations.

The performance of various catalyst systems in terms of selectivity and conversion varies:
- Mixed metal oxides show improved yields compared to traditional catalysts.
- Heteropoly compounds offer high selectivity but suffer from low conversion rates.
- Ruthenium-based catalysts with molecular chlorine as an oxidant demonstrate a good balance between selectivity and conversion.

Persistent challenges include balancing high selectivity with high conversion rates, managing reaction temperatures, and addressing potential corrosion issues with halogen-based systems.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展显示出一些有希望的结果，但仍然存在挑战。研究人员已经探索了各种催化剂系统：

1. 传统催化剂：丙烯产率不超过35%，经济效益不足。
2. Mg/Dy/Li/Cl/O混合氧化物：实现了40%的产率。
3. Pt-H3PMo12O40催化剂：在200°C下显示出高选择性（94-96%），但转化率较低（约20%）。
4. Ru/TiO2催化剂：在400°C下，50%丙烷转化率和完全氯气转化的条件下，对丙烯的选择性达到95%。

正在研究的软氧化剂包括有机氯化物、含硫化合物、一氧化二氮、二氧化碳和卤素。根据热力学计算，分子氯被确定为最有利的氧化剂。

各种催化剂系统在选择性和转化率方面的性能各不相同：
- 混合金属氧化物相比传统催化剂显示出更高的产率。
- 杂多化合物提供高选择性，但转化率较低。
- 以分子氯为氧化剂的钌基催化剂在选择性和转化率之间展现出良好的平衡。

持续存在的挑战包括平衡高选择性和高转化率、管理反应温度，以及解决卤素基系统可能带来的腐蚀问题。

"Molecular chlorine turned out to be the most advantageous oxidizing agent in accordance with the thermodynamic calculations."

"The total enthalpy of the reaction: C3H8 + Cl2  2HCl + C3H6, r298 = 60.34 kJ/mol. is 60.34 kJ/mol only, which simplifies the task of waste-heat utilization."

"Nowadays, a RuO2/TiO2 catalyst is proposed for the Deacon reaction that allows performing this process at temperatures below 300 C [1921]. Catalysts based on ruthenium also show good performance in other reactions involving chlorine or its derivatives, such as the oxychlorination of methane and ethane [22]."

          Persistent challenges in ODHP include:

1. Corrosiveness: The use of chlorine-based oxidants, while effective, raises concerns about material compatibility and equipment corrosion.

2. Inherent reaction properties:
   - The reaction enthalpy for propane dehydrogenation using chlorine (60.34 kJ/mol) is relatively low, which simplifies waste-heat utilization but may limit the driving force for the reaction.
   - Balancing selectivity and conversion remains difficult, as shown by the trade-offs observed in different catalyst systems.

3. Temperature management: While some catalysts (e.g., RuO2/TiO2 for the Deacon reaction) allow for lower operating temperatures, many ODHP processes still require high temperatures, which can lead to energy efficiency issues and potential catalyst degradation.

4. Catalyst stability and regeneration: Maintaining catalyst performance over extended periods and developing efficient regeneration processes are ongoing challenges.

5. Environmental and safety concerns: The use of chlorine and other halogen-based oxidants raises environmental and safety issues that need to be addressed for large-scale implementation.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Develop catalysts that can more efficiently and selectively activate propane C-H bonds.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Design catalysts with improved stability and easier regeneration processes.

3. Renovating reaction systems: Optimize reactor designs and process conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing energy consumption and addressing safety concerns.

4. Exploring alternative soft oxidants: Investigate other mild oxidizing agents that can provide high selectivity and conversion while minimizing corrosion and safety issues.

5. Developing multifunctional catalysts: Combine different active sites to promote both C-H activation and selective oxidation.

6. Improving process integration: Develop more efficient heat recovery systems and explore opportunities for process intensification.

7. Addressing environmental concerns: Research ways to minimize or eliminate harmful emissions and develop closed-loop systems for oxidant recycling.
