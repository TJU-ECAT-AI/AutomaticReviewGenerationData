[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2]."

[3] "The significantly higher yield of propylene after the first pulse of RSO compared to R can be attributed to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2."

[4] "OCP deposition increases the portion of a stepwise mechanism (Fig. 2)."

[5] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-10] and elemental sulfur [3,11] can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

[6] "The results suggest that the sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP."

The literature provides limited information on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. However, it does discuss some aspects of propane dehydrogenation using SO2 as an oxidizing agent:

1. SO2 can be used as an oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, including propane.

2. Iron oxides supported on activated carbon catalysts can achieve high propylene yields in propane dehydrogenation by SO2.

3. The reaction involves both concerted and stepwise mechanisms, with oxidative condensation products (OCP) deposited on the catalyst surface increasing the contribution of the stepwise mechanism.

4. Sulfur plays a significant role in enhancing catalytic activity. Both sulfurized catalysts and elemental sulfur can selectively enhance hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

5. The concentration of sulfur in the catalyst affects its catalytic properties, with higher sulfur content generally leading to increased propylene yield.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems or discuss specific challenges and future research directions for ODHP. It focuses primarily on the role of sulfur and oxidative condensation products in propane dehydrogenation using SO2 as an oxidant. To fully address the question, additional research on recent advances in ODHP catalysts, challenges, and future directions would be necessary.

该文献对使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展提供了有限的信息。然而，它确实讨论了使用SO2作为氧化剂进行丙烷脱氢的一些方面：

1. SO2可用作碳氢化合物脱氢的氧化剂，包括丙烷。

2. 以活性炭为载体的氧化铁催化剂可以在SO2介导的丙烷脱氢反应中获得高收率的丙烯。

3. 该反应涉及协同和逐步两种机制，沉积在催化剂表面的氧化缩合产物（OCP）增加了逐步机制的贡献。

4. 硫在增强催化活性方面起着重要作用。含硫催化剂和元素硫都可以选择性地增强碳氢化合物的脱氢。

5. 催化剂中的硫浓度影响其催化性能，硫含量较高通常会导致丙烯产率增加。

该文献没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，也没有讨论ODHP的具体挑战和未来研究方向。它主要关注硫和氧化缩合产物在使用SO2作为氧化剂的丙烷脱氢中的作用。要全面回答这个问题，需要对ODHP催化剂的最新进展、挑战和未来方向进行额外的研究。
