[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2]."

[3] "To establish the mechanism of participation of the oxidant propylene formation and OCP, pulses of either propane (R), or propane with an oxidizing agent (RSO) or separate pulses of propane and an oxidizing agent (R and SO) were admitted to the catalyst."

[4] "The significantly higher yield of propylene after the first pulse of RSO compared to R can be attributed to the concerted mechanism of propane interaction with SO2. Its increase from pulse to pulse can be due to the accumulation of catalytically more active OCP on carbon."

[5] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-10] and elemental sulfur [3,11] can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

The literature provided focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using SO2 as a soft oxidant, primarily with carbon-based catalysts. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it does offer some insights into recent advances and challenges in ODHP:

1. Advances:
- SO2 is shown to be an effective oxidizing agent for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation, including propane.
- Iron oxides supported on activated carbon are mentioned as catalysts that can achieve high propylene yields.
- The study demonstrates that oxidative condensation products (OCP) formed during the reaction can enhance catalytic activity.
- The presence of sulfur in the catalyst system, either through sulfurized catalysts or elemental sulfur, can selectively enhance hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

2. Performance:
- The study shows that propylene yield increases with repeated pulses of propane and SO2 (RSO), indicating improved performance over time.
- The catalytic activity is found to be dependent on the concentration of sulfur in the sample.

3. Challenges and areas for future research:
- The study observes a decrease in propane conversion over time under flow conditions, suggesting issues with catalyst stability or coking.
- The mechanism of oxidant participation in propylene formation is not fully understood, requiring further investigation.
- The role of sulfur in enhancing catalytic activity needs more detailed exploration.
- Improving C-H bond activation is implicitly suggested as an area for improvement, given the focus on understanding the reaction mechanism.

4. Strategies for improvement:
- The study suggests that understanding and optimizing the formation of OCPs could be a strategy to enhance catalyst performance.
- Investigating the optimal sulfur concentration in catalysts could lead to improved selectivity and conversion.
- The pulse reaction technique used in the study could be further developed as a method to enhance catalyst regenerability and optimize the ODHP process.

While the document doesn't directly address all aspects of the question, such as corrosiveness or comparisons with transition metal/metal oxide catalysts, it provides valuable insights into the use of SO2 as a soft oxidant for ODHP and highlights several areas for future research and development in this field.
