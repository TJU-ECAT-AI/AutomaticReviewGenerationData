[1] "It is known that SO2 can be applied as an oxidizing agent for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons [1-4]."

[2] "As far as the dehydrogenation of propane by SO2 is concerned, it is known that the application of iron oxides supported on activated carbon as catalysts permits to obtain high yields of propylene [2]."

[3] "Carrying out the reaction under flow conditions at a constant contact time indicates that propane conversion decreases with time (Table I). In this case the surface area of the catalyst diminishes and one can observe disbalance with respect to carbon. These data suggest that during the reaction OCP are formed on the catalyst surface."

[4] "Since it is known that both sulfurized catalysts [9-10] and elemental sulfur [3,11] can selectively enhance the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, it was of particular interest to establish the dependence of catalytic activity on S concentration in the sample."

[5] "It is seen that with increasing amount of preadsorbed sulfur (for RSO it was determined approximately, since the analysis for elemental sulfur had not been performed) the propylene yield after an R pulse also rises. The results suggest that the sulfur concentration affects significantly the catalytic properties of OCP."

The literature provides limited information on recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants. However, it does discuss some aspects of propane dehydrogenation using SO2 as an oxidizing agent.

The study focuses on using carbon as a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation with SO2. It mentions that iron oxides supported on activated carbon can achieve high propylene yields in this reaction. The research demonstrates that oxidative condensation products (OCP) form on the catalyst surface during the reaction, which affects the catalyst's performance.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems for ODHP. However, it does highlight the importance of sulfur in enhancing the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. The study shows that increasing the amount of preadsorbed sulfur on the catalyst leads to higher propylene yields, suggesting that sulfur concentration significantly affects the catalytic properties of OCP.

The document does not directly address persistent challenges in the field, such as corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. It also does not explicitly discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation, enhancing catalyst regenerability, or optimizing ODHP processes.

However, the study does reveal some areas for potential future research:

1. Further investigation of the role of sulfur in enhancing catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Exploring the formation and properties of oxidative condensation products (OCP) on catalyst surfaces.
3. Optimizing catalyst composition and pretreatment to improve propylene yields.
4. Studying the long-term stability and regeneration of carbon-based catalysts in SO2-mediated propane dehydrogenation.

While the literature provides some insights into propane dehydrogenation using SO2 and carbon-based catalysts, it does not cover the full scope of recent advances in ODHP or address all the specific points mentioned in the question.

该文献对于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展提供了有限的信息。然而，它确实讨论了一些使用SO2作为氧化剂进行丙烷脱氢的方面。

研究重点是使用碳作为SO2丙烷脱氢的催化剂。它提到，活性炭负载的氧化铁可以在这种反应中获得高产率的丙烯。研究表明，在反应过程中，催化剂表面会形成氧化缩合产物（OCP），这会影响催化剂的性能。

文献没有对ODHP的各种催化剂系统进行全面比较。然而，它确实强调了硫在增强碳氢化合物脱氢方面的重要性。研究表明，增加催化剂上预吸附的硫量会导致更高的丙烯产率，这表明硫浓度显著影响OCP的催化性能。

该文件没有直接涉及该领域的持续挑战，如腐蚀性或固有的反应特性。它也没有明确讨论改善C-H键活化、增强催化剂再生能力或优化ODHP过程的策略。

然而，该研究确实揭示了一些潜在的未来研究领域：

1. 进一步研究硫在增强丙烷脱氢催化活性中的作用。
2. 探索催化剂表面氧化缩合产物（OCP）的形成和性质。
3. 优化催化剂组成和预处理，以提高丙烯产率。
4. 研究碳基催化剂在SO2介导的丙烷脱氢中的长期稳定性和再生。

虽然文献提供了一些关于使用SO2和碳基催化剂进行丙烷脱氢的见解，但它并没有涵盖ODHP的最新进展的全部范围，也没有涉及问题中提到的所有具体点。
