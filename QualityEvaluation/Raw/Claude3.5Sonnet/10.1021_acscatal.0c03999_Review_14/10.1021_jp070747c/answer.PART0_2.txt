[1] "Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

[2] "Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

[3] "Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that consecutive propene oxidation is strongly influenced by the nature of VOx species, too. The following order of catalyst ability for propene oxidation was found:"

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically comparing the performance of N2O and O2 as oxidizing agents over various VOx catalysts supported on silica-based materials (MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48).

Key findings include:

1. N2O generally shows superior performance compared to O2 in terms of selectivity, although overall catalytic activity is lower with N2O.

2. N2O improves ODHP performance by:
   a) Increasing primary C3H6 selectivity at low C3H8 conversion
   b) Reducing consecutive propene oxidation to COx

3. The nature of VOx species strongly influences catalyst performance, with more polymerized VOx species showing higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation.

4. The superior performance of N2O is attributed to:
   a) Slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species compared to O2
   b) Different nature of oxygen species formed (selective vs. non-selective)

Persistent challenges and areas for future research include:

1. Balancing selectivity and conversion, as N2O improves selectivity but reduces overall activity.

2. Understanding and optimizing C-H bond activation mechanisms.

3. Improving catalyst regenerability, especially for N2O-based systems with slower reoxidation kinetics.

4. Developing more efficient reaction systems to maximize the benefits of soft oxidants like N2O while addressing activity limitations.

5. Further investigation into the nature and role of different oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O, and their impact on selectivity and activity.

6. Exploring other soft oxidants and catalyst compositions to achieve optimal ODHP performance.

该文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，特别比较了N2O和O2作为氧化剂在各种硅基材料（MCM-41、SiO2和MCM-48）负载的VOx催化剂上的性能。

主要发现包括：

1. 与O2相比，N2O通常在选择性方面表现更优，尽管使用N2O时的整体催化活性较低。

2. N2O通过以下方式改善ODHP性能：
   a) 在低C3H8转化率下增加初级C3H6选择性
   b) 减少丙烯连续氧化生成COx

3. VOx物种的性质强烈影响催化剂性能，更多聚合的VOx物种对丙烯连续氧化表现出更高的活性。

4. N2O的优越性能归因于：
   a) 与O2相比，还原态VOx物种的再氧化速度较慢
   b) 形成的氧物种性质不同（选择性与非选择性）

持续存在的挑战和未来研究领域包括：

1. 平衡选择性和转化率，因为N2O提高了选择性但降低了整体活性。

2. 理解和优化C-H键活化机制。

3. 改善催化剂的再生能力，特别是针对再氧化动力学较慢的N2O体系。

4. 开发更高效的反应系统，以最大化软氧化剂（如N2O）的优势，同时解决活性限制问题。

5. 进一步研究O2和N2O形成的不同氧物种的性质和作用，及其对选择性和活性的影响。

6. 探索其他软氧化剂和催化剂组成，以实现最佳的ODHP性能。
