[1] "Promising catalyst formulations are based on relatively complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides. However, the main challenge is still to minimize the formation of carbon oxides (COx) that is favored at high degrees of propane conversion because of higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

[2] "Generally, the improving effect of the support material on catalytic performance of vanadia can be related to the following main factors: (1) supporting material helps to avoid the formation of nonselective V2O5 phase, (2) VOMe (Me is metal of the support) sites may be more selective than VOV ones, and (3) supporting material tunes acidbase properties of the resulting catalyst."

[3] "Besides the above-mentioned selectivity-determining factors, it is also well-known that the overall performance of oxide materials in oxidative reactions is determined by the applied oxidizing agent."

[4] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O."

[5] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[6] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of N2O as an oxidant compared to O2. The performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides (specifically molybdenum and vanadium oxides), has been studied.

In terms of selectivity and conversion, supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown improved performance compared to unsupported bulk V2O5. The support material plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic performance by preventing the formation of nonselective V2O5 phase, creating more selective VOMe sites, and tuning the acid-base properties of the catalyst.

The use of N2O as an oxidant has demonstrated superior performance compared to O2 in ODHP reactions. N2O improves propene selectivity by achieving higher primary C3H6 selectivity at low propane conversion and lowering the activity for consecutive propene oxidation.

Persistent challenges in this field include minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx), which is favored at high degrees of propane conversion due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane. The corrosiveness of the reaction environment and inherent reaction properties also pose challenges.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further studies on catalyst design and reaction mechanisms to enhance the selective activation of C-H bonds in propane.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts that maintain their activity and selectivity over longer periods and can be easily regenerated.

3. Renovating reaction systems: Optimizing ODHP processes by exploring novel reactor designs and reaction conditions that minimize consecutive oxidation reactions.

4. Understanding the role of oxidants: Further investigation into the mechanisms by which different oxidants, particularly soft oxidants like N2O, influence the reaction pathways and product selectivity.

5. Tuning support materials: Continued research on the effects of various support materials on the performance of active metal oxide species, focusing on their ability to enhance selectivity and conversion.

These research directions aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP and improve the overall efficiency and selectivity of the process for industrial applications.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展显示了promising的结果，特别是与O2相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂。研究了各种催化剂系统的性能，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物(特别是钼和钒氧化物)。

在选择性和转化率方面，负载型钒氧化物催化剂比未负载的体相V2O5表现出更好的性能。载体材料在增强催化性能方面起着关键作用，通过防止形成非选择性V2O5相，创造更选择性的VOMe位点，并调节催化剂的酸碱性质。

使用N2O作为氧化剂在ODHP反应中表现出优于O2的性能。N2O通过在低丙烷转化率下实现更高的初级C3H6选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性来提高丙烯选择性。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括最小化碳氧化物(COx)的形成，由于丙烯与丙烷相比具有更高的反应活性，在高丙烷转化程度下更容易形成COx。反应环境的腐蚀性和固有的反应特性也带来了挑战。

未来研究和发展的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：进一步研究催化剂设计和反应机理，以增强丙烷C-H键的选择性活化。

2. 提高催化剂再生能力：开发能够长期保持活性和选择性并易于再生的催化剂。

3. 革新反应系统：通过探索新型反应器设计和反应条件来优化ODHP过程，最小化连续氧化反应。

4. 理解氧化剂的作用：进一步研究不同氧化剂，特别是像N2O这样的软氧化剂，如何影响反应途径和产物选择性的机理。

5. 调节载体材料：继续研究各种载体材料对活性金属氧化物物种性能的影响，重点关注它们提高选择性和转化率的能力。

这些研究方向旨在解决ODHP中持续存在的挑战，并提高该过程在工业应用中的整体效率和选择性。
