[1] "Promising catalyst formulations are based on relatively complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides. However, the main challenge is still to minimize the formation of carbon oxides (COx) that is favored at high degrees of propane conversion because of higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

[2] "Several recent studies of the ODP reaction were dealt with VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) with specific surface area of ca. 1000 m2/g."

[3] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O."

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of N2O to O2 over various vanadium-based catalysts supported on silica materials. 

Key findings include:

1. Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica materials like MCM and SBA show promise for ODHP.

2. Replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant improves propene selectivity.

3. N2O provides two main benefits: higher primary propene selectivity at low propane conversion, and lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

4. The improved performance with N2O is attributed to its lower ability to reoxidize reduced VOx species compared to O2, leading to a higher degree of reduction of the catalyst.

5. N2O also produces fewer non-selective adsorbed oxygen species that promote propene combustion.

Persistent challenges include minimizing COx formation at higher propane conversions due to the higher reactivity of propene. 

Key areas for future research include:

1. Further understanding the nature of selective vs non-selective oxygen species from different oxidants.

2. Optimizing catalyst formulations and support materials to enhance C-H activation while limiting over-oxidation.

3. Developing strategies to maintain high catalyst reducibility during reaction.

4. Exploring other soft oxidants beyond N2O that may offer similar or improved benefits.

5. Reactor and process design to take advantage of the unique properties of soft oxidants like N2O.

Overall, the use of N2O as a soft oxidant shows promise for improving ODHP selectivity, but further work is needed to overcome remaining challenges and optimize the catalyst and reaction systems.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of N2O as an oxidant compared to O2. The performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides (specifically molybdenum and vanadium oxides), has been studied.

In terms of selectivity and conversion, supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown improved performance compared to unsupported bulk V2O5. The support material plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic performance by preventing the formation of nonselective V2O5 phase, creating more selective VOMe sites, and tuning the acid-base properties of the catalyst.

The use of N2O as an oxidant has demonstrated superior performance compared to O2 in ODHP reactions. N2O improves propene selectivity by achieving higher primary C3H6 selectivity at low propane conversion and lowering the activity for consecutive propene oxidation.

Persistent challenges in this field include minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx), which is favored at high degrees of propane conversion due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane. The corrosiveness of the reaction environment and inherent reaction properties also pose challenges.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Further studies on catalyst design and reaction mechanisms to enhance the selective activation of C-H bonds in propane.

2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Developing catalysts that maintain their activity and selectivity over longer periods and can be easily regenerated.

3. Renovating reaction systems: Optimizing ODHP processes by exploring novel reactor designs and reaction conditions that minimize consecutive oxidation reactions.

4. Understanding the role of oxidants: Further investigation into the mechanisms by which different oxidants, particularly soft oxidants like N2O, influence the reaction pathways and product selectivity.

5. Tuning support materials: Continued research on the effects of various support materials on the performance of active metal oxide species, focusing on their ability to enhance selectivity and conversion.

These research directions aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP and improve the overall efficiency and selectivity of the process for industrial applications.

[1] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."

The literature provides some insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of N2O versus O2 on silica-supported vanadia catalysts. 

The study shows that N2O performs better than O2 in terms of selectivity for propene. Specifically:

1. Using N2O instead of O2 leads to higher primary propene selectivity at low propane conversion.

2. N2O results in lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, which is a major challenge in ODHP.

3. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, leading to a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under reaction conditions.

4. Unlike O2, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that catalyze undesired propene oxidation to COx.

These findings suggest that using N2O as an oxidant can help address some of the persistent challenges in ODHP, particularly in improving selectivity and reducing unwanted consecutive oxidation.

However, the study is limited to silica-supported vanadia catalysts and does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems. It also does not directly address other challenges such as corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability.

For future research and development, the results suggest that further investigation into soft oxidants like N2O and their impact on the nature of active oxygen species could be a promising direction. Additionally, developing catalyst systems that can maintain a higher degree of reduction under reaction conditions might help optimize ODHP processes.

该文献为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）使用软氧化剂的最新进展提供了一些见解，特别是比较了N2O与O2在二氧化硅负载的钒催化剂上的性能。

研究表明，N2O在丙烯选择性方面的表现优于O2。具体来说：

1. 使用N2O代替O2可以在低丙烷转化率下获得更高的初级丙烯选择性。

2. N2O导致丙烯连续氧化生成COx的活性降低，这是ODHP中的一个主要挑战。

3. N2O重新氧化还原态VOx物种的速度比O2慢，导致在反应条件下VOx物种的还原程度更高。

4. 与O2不同，N2O不会产生非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种会催化不需要的丙烯氧化生成COx。

这些发现表明，使用N2O作为氧化剂可以帮助解决ODHP中的一些持续存在的挑战，特别是在提高选择性和减少不需要的连续氧化方面。

然而，这项研究仅限于二氧化硅负载的钒催化剂，没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较。它也没有直接解决其他挑战，如腐蚀性或改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。

对于未来的研究和开发，结果表明，进一步研究N2O等软氧化剂及其对活性氧物种性质的影响可能是一个有前景的方向。此外，开发能在反应条件下保持更高还原程度的催化剂系统可能有助于优化ODHP过程。

[1] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

[2] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."

[3] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."

The literature provides insights into the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using N2O as a soft oxidant compared to O2, focusing on VOx-based catalysts supported on silica materials. The study reveals that N2O offers superior performance in terms of selectivity compared to O2 for several reasons:

1. Slower reoxidation: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, leading to a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under reaction conditions.

2. Higher selectivity: The slower reoxidation by N2O results in higher primary propene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

3. Absence of nonselective oxygen species: N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze undesired consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or discuss other catalyst systems beyond VOx-based catalysts. However, it highlights the importance of understanding the nature of oxygen species and their role in determining selectivity and activity.

Key areas for future research and development based on this study could include:

1. Further investigation of the mechanism of N2O activation and oxygen transfer to understand how to optimize C-H bond activation while maintaining high selectivity.

2. Exploring other soft oxidants that may offer similar or better performance than N2O.

3. Developing catalysts that can maintain a higher degree of reduction under reaction conditions to improve selectivity.

4. Studying the regenerability of catalysts under N2O conditions compared to O2.

5. Optimizing reaction systems to take advantage of the slower reoxidation kinetics of N2O while maintaining high conversion rates.

这篇文献提供了关于使用N2O作为软氧化剂与O2相比进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的见解,重点研究了在硅基材料上负载的VOx催化剂。研究表明,N2O在选择性方面比O2表现更优,原因如下:

1. 再氧化速度较慢:N2O比O2更慢地再氧化还原的VOx物种,导致在反应条件下VOx物种的还原程度更高。

2. 更高的选择性:N2O的较慢再氧化导致更高的初级丙烯选择性,并抑制了丙烯连续氧化成COx的反应。

3. 无非选择性氧物种:N2O不产生非选择性吸附氧物种,而这些物种由O2形成,会催化不期望的丙烯连续氧化成COx的反应。

该研究没有直接讨论持续存在的挑战,如腐蚀性,也没有讨论VOx基催化剂以外的其他催化剂系统。然而,它强调了理解氧物种的性质及其在决定选择性和活性方面的作用的重要性。

基于这项研究,未来研究和开发的关键领域可能包括:

1. 进一步研究N2O活化和氧转移的机制,以了解如何优化C-H键活化同时保持高选择性。

2. 探索可能提供与N2O相似或更好性能的其他软氧化剂。

3. 开发在反应条件下能保持更高还原程度的催化剂,以提高选择性。

4. 研究在N2O条件下催化剂的再生能力与O2相比的情况。

5. 优化反应系统,以利用N2O较慢的再氧化动力学,同时保持高转化率。
