[1] "Promising catalyst formulations are based on relatively complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides. However, the main challenge is still to minimize the formation of carbon oxides (COx) that is favored at high degrees of propane conversion because of higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

[2] "Several recent studies of the ODP reaction were dealt with VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) with specific surface area of ca. 1000 m2/g."

[3] "In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O."

[4] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[5] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of N2O to O2 over various vanadium-based catalysts supported on silica materials. 

Key findings include:

1. Vanadium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica materials like MCM and SBA show promise for ODHP.

2. Replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant improves propene selectivity.

3. N2O provides two main benefits: higher primary propene selectivity at low propane conversion, and lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

4. The improved performance with N2O is attributed to its lower ability to reoxidize reduced VOx species compared to O2, leading to a higher degree of reduction of the catalyst.

5. N2O also produces fewer non-selective adsorbed oxygen species that promote propene combustion.

Persistent challenges include minimizing COx formation at higher propane conversions due to the higher reactivity of propene. 

Key areas for future research include:

1. Further understanding the nature of selective vs non-selective oxygen species from different oxidants.

2. Optimizing catalyst formulations and support materials to enhance C-H activation while limiting over-oxidation.

3. Developing strategies to maintain high catalyst reducibility during reaction.

4. Exploring other soft oxidants beyond N2O that may offer similar or improved benefits.

5. Reactor and process design to take advantage of the unique properties of soft oxidants like N2O.

Overall, the use of N2O as a soft oxidant shows promise for improving ODHP selectivity, but further work is needed to overcome remaining challenges and optimize the catalyst and reaction systems.

该文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展，特别是比较了N2O和O2在各种负载于二氧化硅材料上的钒基催化剂上的性能。

主要发现包括：

1. 负载在介孔二氧化硅材料(如MCM和SBA)上的氧化钒催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出良好的前景。

2. 用N2O替代O2作为氧化剂可以提高丙烯的选择性。

3. N2O提供两个主要优势：在低丙烷转化率下具有更高的初级丙烯选择性，以及对丙烯连续氧化生成COx的活性较低。

4. 与O2相比，N2O对还原态VOx物种的再氧化能力较弱，导致催化剂具有更高的还原程度，从而提高了性能。

5. N2O还产生较少的非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种会促进丙烯的燃烧。

持续存在的挑战包括在较高丙烷转化率下最小化COx的形成，这是由于丙烯的反应活性较高。

未来研究的关键领域包括：

1. 进一步理解不同氧化剂产生的选择性和非选择性氧物种的性质。

2. 优化催化剂配方和载体材料，以增强C-H键活化的同时限制过度氧化。

3. 开发策略以在反应过程中保持催化剂的高还原性。

4. 探索除N2O之外的其他软氧化剂，可能提供类似或更好的优势。

5. 反应器和工艺设计，以充分利用N2O等软氧化剂的独特性质。

总的来说，使用N2O作为软氧化剂显示出提高ODHP选择性的前景，但仍需进一步工作来克服剩余的挑战并优化催化剂和反应系统。
