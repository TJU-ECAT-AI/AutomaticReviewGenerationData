          "Promising catalyst formulations are based on relatively complex systems based on molybdenum and vanadium oxides. However, the main challenge is still to minimize the formation of carbon oxides (COx) that is favored at high degrees of propane conversion because of higher reactivity of propene as compared to propane."

"Several recent studies of the ODP reaction were dealt with VOx aggregates supported over mesoporous silica-based materials (MCM, SBA) with specific surface area of ca. 1000 m2/g."

"In our recent studies of the ODP reaction over alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, it was demonstrated that propene selectivity increases upon replacing O2 with N2O."

"Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

"Catalytic performance of differently structured VOx species supported over MCM-41, SiO2, and MCM-48 was determined using C3H8/O2/Ne = 40/20/40 and C3H8/N2O/Ne = 40/40/20 reaction mixtures."

"Irrespective of the structural difference of VOx species, the catalytic activity decreases when O2 is replaced by N2O."

          Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have shown promising results, particularly with the use of N2O as an oxidant compared to O2. The performance of various catalyst systems, including transition metal/metal oxides (specifically molybdenum and vanadium oxides), has been studied.

Key findings include:
1. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts, particularly on mesoporous silica materials (MCM, SBA), show improved performance compared to unsupported catalysts.
2. N2O as an oxidant demonstrates superior performance in terms of selectivity compared to O2, achieving higher primary C3H6 selectivity at low propane conversion and lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation.
3. The nature of VOx species strongly influences catalyst performance, with more polymerized VOx species showing higher activity for consecutive propene oxidation.
4. While N2O improves selectivity, it generally leads to lower overall catalytic activity compared to O2.

The main persistent challenge is minimizing the formation of carbon oxides (COx), which is favored at high degrees of propane conversion due to the higher reactivity of propene compared to propane.

          使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的最新进展显示了promising的结果，特别是与O2相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂。研究了各种催化剂系统的性能，包括过渡金属/金属氧化物(特别是钼和钒氧化物)。

主要发现包括：
1. 负载型钒氧化物催化剂，特别是在介孔二氧化硅材料(MCM, SBA)上的催化剂，比未负载的催化剂表现出更好的性能。
2. N2O作为氧化剂在选择性方面表现出优于O2的性能，在低丙烷转化率下实现更高的初级C3H6选择性，并降低连续丙烯氧化的活性。
3. VOx物种的性质强烈影响催化剂性能，更多聚合的VOx物种对丙烯连续氧化表现出更高的活性。
4. 虽然N2O提高了选择性，但与O2相比通常导致较低的整体催化活性。

持续存在的主要挑战是最小化碳氧化物(COx)的形成，由于丙烯与丙烷相比具有更高的反应活性，在高丙烷转化程度下更容易形成COx。

          "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

"Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

"Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

"As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

"The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."
