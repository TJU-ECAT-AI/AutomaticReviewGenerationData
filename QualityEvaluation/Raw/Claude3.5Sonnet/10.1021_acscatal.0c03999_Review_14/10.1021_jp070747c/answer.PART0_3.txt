[1] "For samples possessing highly dispersed VOx species, both of these ratios at a degree of propane conversion of ca. 2% decrease from ca. 0.1 to ca. 0.05 upon replacing O2 with N2O."

[2] "Two important improving effects of N2O on the ODP reaction should be especially emphasized: (1) a higher primary C3H6 selectivity (at near-to-zero degree of C3H8 conversion) is achieved and (2) lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation."

[3] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

[4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

The literature provides some insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly comparing the performance of N2O versus O2 on silica-supported vanadia catalysts. 

The study shows that N2O performs better than O2 in terms of selectivity for propene. Specifically:

1. Using N2O instead of O2 leads to higher primary propene selectivity at low propane conversion.

2. N2O results in lower activity for consecutive propene oxidation to COx, which is a major challenge in ODHP.

3. N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, leading to a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under reaction conditions.

4. Unlike O2, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species that catalyze undesired propene oxidation to COx.

These findings suggest that using N2O as an oxidant can help address some of the persistent challenges in ODHP, particularly in improving selectivity and reducing unwanted consecutive oxidation.

However, the study is limited to silica-supported vanadia catalysts and does not provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems. It also does not directly address other challenges such as corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability.

For future research and development, the results suggest that further investigation into soft oxidants like N2O and their impact on the nature of active oxygen species could be a promising direction. Additionally, developing catalyst systems that can maintain a higher degree of reduction under reaction conditions might help optimize ODHP processes.

该文献为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）使用软氧化剂的最新进展提供了一些见解，特别是比较了N2O与O2在二氧化硅负载的钒催化剂上的性能。

研究表明，N2O在丙烯选择性方面的表现优于O2。具体来说：

1. 使用N2O代替O2可以在低丙烷转化率下获得更高的初级丙烯选择性。

2. N2O导致丙烯连续氧化生成COx的活性降低，这是ODHP中的一个主要挑战。

3. N2O重新氧化还原态VOx物种的速度比O2慢，导致在反应条件下VOx物种的还原程度更高。

4. 与O2不同，N2O不会产生非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种会催化不需要的丙烯氧化生成COx。

这些发现表明，使用N2O作为氧化剂可以帮助解决ODHP中的一些持续存在的挑战，特别是在提高选择性和减少不需要的连续氧化方面。

然而，这项研究仅限于二氧化硅负载的钒催化剂，没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较。它也没有直接解决其他挑战，如腐蚀性或改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。

对于未来的研究和开发，结果表明，进一步研究N2O等软氧化剂及其对活性氧物种性质的影响可能是一个有前景的方向。此外，开发能在反应条件下保持更高还原程度的催化剂系统可能有助于优化ODHP过程。
