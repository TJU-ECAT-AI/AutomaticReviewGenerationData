[1] "As compared to O2, reoxidation of reduced VOx species with N2O is slower, since these species are fully oxidized after ca. 30 s on steam in N2O."

[2] "It is clear from Figure 5 that there is no significant difference in the spectra of fully oxidized VOx species and VOx species having been reoxidized for 5 s in an O2 flow after C3H8 pretreatment."

[3] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."

[4] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

[5] "Combining the results of in-situ UV/vis analysis and transient isotopic experiments with catalytic data, two important conclusions about the role of O2 and N2O in the ODP reaction were derived: (1) the ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species and (2) the nature of selective and nonselective oxygen species."

The literature provides insights into the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using N2O as a soft oxidant compared to O2, focusing on VOx-based catalysts supported on silica materials. The study reveals that N2O offers superior performance in terms of selectivity compared to O2 for several reasons:

1. Slower reoxidation: N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2, leading to a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under reaction conditions.

2. Higher selectivity: The slower reoxidation by N2O results in higher primary propene selectivity and suppresses consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

3. Absence of nonselective oxygen species: N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and catalyze undesired consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or discuss other catalyst systems beyond VOx-based catalysts. However, it highlights the importance of understanding the nature of oxygen species and their role in determining selectivity and activity.

Key areas for future research and development based on this study could include:

1. Further investigation of the mechanism of N2O activation and oxygen transfer to understand how to optimize C-H bond activation while maintaining high selectivity.

2. Exploring other soft oxidants that may offer similar or better performance than N2O.

3. Developing catalysts that can maintain a higher degree of reduction under reaction conditions to improve selectivity.

4. Studying the regenerability of catalysts under N2O conditions compared to O2.

5. Optimizing reaction systems to take advantage of the slower reoxidation kinetics of N2O while maintaining high conversion rates.

这篇文献提供了关于使用N2O作为软氧化剂与O2相比进行丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)的见解,重点研究了在硅基材料上负载的VOx催化剂。研究表明,N2O在选择性方面比O2表现更优,原因如下:

1. 再氧化速度较慢:N2O比O2更慢地再氧化还原的VOx物种,导致在反应条件下VOx物种的还原程度更高。

2. 更高的选择性:N2O的较慢再氧化导致更高的初级丙烯选择性,并抑制了丙烯连续氧化成COx的反应。

3. 无非选择性氧物种:N2O不产生非选择性吸附氧物种,而这些物种由O2形成,会催化不期望的丙烯连续氧化成COx的反应。

该研究没有直接讨论持续存在的挑战,如腐蚀性,也没有讨论VOx基催化剂以外的其他催化剂系统。然而,它强调了理解氧物种的性质及其在决定选择性和活性方面的作用的重要性。

基于这项研究,未来研究和开发的关键领域可能包括:

1. 进一步研究N2O活化和氧转移的机制,以了解如何优化C-H键活化同时保持高选择性。

2. 探索可能提供与N2O相似或更好性能的其他软氧化剂。

3. 开发在反应条件下能保持更高还原程度的催化剂,以提高选择性。

4. 研究在N2O条件下催化剂的再生能力与O2相比的情况。

5. 优化反应系统,以利用N2O较慢的再氧化动力学,同时保持高转化率。
