[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based materials were reported to be very active and selective [1,4,5]."

[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[3] "Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[4] "The rate of COx formation decreases strongly than the rate of propene formation when O2 is replaced by N2O. This effect is more pronounced for the catalytic materials with a high amount of vanadium oxide (4.69.5% wt.%)."

[5] "To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."

[6] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

This literature focuses primarily on vanadium-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly comparing the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it offers insights into the performance of VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

The study shows that replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant leads to:
1. Decreased overall activity
2. Increased selectivity towards propene formation
3. Reduced rates of product formation, especially COx

The key challenges and areas for future research in ODHP, based on this study, include:

1. Optimizing catalyst design: Creating catalytic surfaces fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid strong propene adsorption on the support surface.

2. Controlling the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen: This is crucial for balancing selective oxidation and combustion reactions. The study achieved this by using N2O instead of O2.

3. Improving C-H bond activation: While not explicitly discussed, this is implied in the need to optimize catalyst performance.

4. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: The study doesn't directly address this, but it's related to the redox properties of the catalysts discussed.

5. Renovating reaction systems: The study suggests that using N2O as an oxidant can be a strategy to optimize ODHP processes.

The persistent challenges of corrosiveness are not directly addressed in this literature. However, the study's focus on optimizing catalysts and oxidants suggests that these remain important areas for improvement in ODHP processes.

这篇文献主要关注了丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)中的钒基催化剂，特别比较了O2和N2O作为氧化剂的使用。虽然它没有提供各种催化剂系统的全面比较，但对VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂的性能提供了见解。

研究表明，用N2O替代O2作为氧化剂会导致：
1. 整体活性降低
2. 丙烯形成的选择性增加
3. 产物形成速率降低，特别是COx

基于这项研究，ODHP中的关键挑战和未来研究领域包括：

1. 优化催化剂设计：创建完全覆盖分散良好的钒物种的催化表面，以避免丙烯在载体表面的强吸附。

2. 控制活性晶格氧的稳态浓度：这对平衡选择性氧化和燃烧反应至关重要。该研究通过使用N2O代替O2实现了这一点。

3. 改善C-H键活化：虽然没有明确讨论，但这隐含在需要优化催化剂性能中。

4. 提高催化剂再生能力：该研究没有直接讨论这一点，但它与所讨论的催化剂的氧化还原性质有关。

5. 革新反应系统：该研究表明，使用N2O作为氧化剂可以作为优化ODHP过程的一种策略。

这篇文献没有直接讨论腐蚀性这一持续存在的挑战。然而，该研究对优化催化剂和氧化剂的关注表明，这些仍然是ODHP过程中需要改进的重要领域。
