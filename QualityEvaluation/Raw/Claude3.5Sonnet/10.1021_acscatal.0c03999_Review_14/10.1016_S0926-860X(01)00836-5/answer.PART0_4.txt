[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."

[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[3] "Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx. A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."

[4] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied materials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."

[5] "To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."

[6] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

This study focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadia loadings (0.5-9.5 wt%) and comparing the performance of two oxidants: O2 and N2O. The research does not cover a wide range of catalyst systems or discuss other transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides.

Key findings include:

1. N2O as an oxidant decreases overall activity but increases propene selectivity compared to O2.

2. Isolated vanadia sites improve propene selectivity, but full coverage of the support with well-dispersed vanadia species is ideal for high performance.

3. N2O decomposition is less favorable than O2 activation, resulting in lower steady-state concentration of active sites and higher propene selectivity.

4. Optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen is crucial for controlling selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges like corrosiveness or inherent reaction properties. However, it suggests that future research should focus on:

1. Designing catalytic surfaces with full coverage of well-dispersed active species.
2. Optimizing the concentration of active lattice oxygen.
3. Exploring soft oxidants like N2O to improve selectivity.

The research does not specifically discuss strategies for improving C-H bond activation or enhancing catalyst regenerability. However, the findings on the role of vanadia distribution and oxidant choice provide insights that could be applied to further optimize ODHP processes.

这项研究主要关注使用不同钒负载量（0.5-9.5 wt%）的VOx/-Al2O3催化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应，并比较了两种氧化剂O2和N2O的性能。该研究并未涵盖广泛的催化剂体系，也没有讨论其他过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物。

主要发现包括：

1. 与O2相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂会降低整体活性，但提高丙烯选择性。

2. 孤立的钒氧化物位点有利于提高丙烯选择性，但用分散良好的钒氧化物完全覆盖载体表面是获得高性能的理想方案。

3. N2O的分解比O2的活化更难进行，导致活性位点的稳态浓度较低，丙烯选择性较高。

4. 优化活性晶格氧的稳态浓度对控制选择性氧化和燃烧反应至关重要。

该研究并未直接讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性或固有反应特性。然而，它建议未来的研究应该关注：

1. 设计完全覆盖分散良好的活性物种的催化表面。
2. 优化活性晶格氧的浓度。
3. 探索软氧化剂（如N2O）以提高选择性。

该研究并未具体讨论改善C-H键活化或增强催化剂再生能力的策略。然而，关于钒氧化物分布和氧化剂选择作用的发现为进一步优化ODHP过程提供了见解。
