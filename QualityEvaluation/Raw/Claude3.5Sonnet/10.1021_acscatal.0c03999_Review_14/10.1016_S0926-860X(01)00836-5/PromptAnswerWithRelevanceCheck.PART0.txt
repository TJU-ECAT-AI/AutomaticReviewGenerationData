[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based materials were reported to be very active and selective [1,4,5]."

[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[3] "As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."

[4] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."

[5] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied materials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature provides some insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly focusing on vanadium-based catalysts and the use of N2O as an oxidant:

1. Catalyst systems: Vanadium-based materials are reported to be highly active and selective for ODP. The study focuses on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings.

2. Selectivity and conversion: Replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant leads to decreased overall activity but increased selectivity towards propene formation at the same degree of propane conversion.

3. Catalyst design strategies:
   - Isolated vanadium sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but do not fully cover the support surface.
   - High propene selectivity can be achieved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed vanadia species.
   - The steady-state concentration of active sites plays a crucial role in controlling selectivity.

4. Challenges and areas for improvement:
   - Optimizing the distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity.
   - Controlling the adsorption and further oxidation of propene on the support surface.
   - Enhancing the decomposition of N2O to improve overall activity while maintaining high selectivity.

5. Future research directions:
   - Developing catalysts with optimized vanadia dispersion and support coverage.
   - Investigating the use of non-acidic supports to minimize non-selective oxidation.
   - Further exploration of N2O as a soft oxidant and its impact on reaction mechanisms.
   - Studying the relationship between catalyst reducibility, electronic properties, and catalytic performance.

The study does not explicitly address challenges such as corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability. Future research could focus on these aspects to further optimize ODHP processes.

该文献提供了一些关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，特别关注钒基催化剂和使用N2O作为氧化剂：

1. 催化剂系统：据报道，钒基材料在ODP反应中具有高活性和选择性。研究重点关注了不同钒负载量的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂。

2. 选择性和转化率：用N2O替代O2作为氧化剂会导致整体活性下降，但在相同的丙烷转化程度下，丙烯生成的选择性会提高。

This literature focuses primarily on vanadium-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), particularly comparing the use of O2 and N2O as oxidants. While it doesn't provide a comprehensive comparison of various catalyst systems, it offers insights into the performance of VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

The study shows that replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant leads to:
1. Decreased overall activity
2. Increased selectivity towards propene formation
3. Reduced rates of product formation, especially COx

The key challenges and areas for future research in ODHP, based on this study, include:

1. Optimizing catalyst design: Creating catalytic surfaces fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid strong propene adsorption on the support surface.

2. Controlling the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen: This is crucial for balancing selective oxidation and combustion reactions. The study achieved this by using N2O instead of O2.

3. Improving C-H bond activation: While not explicitly discussed, this is implied in the need to optimize catalyst performance.

4. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: The study doesn't directly address this, but it's related to the redox properties of the catalysts discussed.

5. Renovating reaction systems: The study suggests that using N2O as an oxidant can be a strategy to optimize ODHP processes.

The persistent challenges of corrosiveness are not directly addressed in this literature. However, the study's focus on optimizing catalysts and oxidants suggests that these remain important areas for improvement in ODHP processes.

This document does not provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants across various catalyst systems. However, it does offer some insights on the use of vanadium-based catalysts and the comparison between O2 and N2O as oxidants.

The study focuses on vanadium-based materials, specifically VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, which are reported to be highly active and selective for ODP. The research compares the performance of these catalysts using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

When N2O was used instead of O2, the overall activity decreased, but the selectivity towards propene formation increased at the same degree of propane conversion. This suggests that N2O acts as a softer oxidant compared to O2, leading to improved selectivity.

The document highlights that optimizing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen is crucial for controlling selective oxidation and combustion reactions. This optimization was achieved by using N2O instead of O2.

For improving catalyst performance, the study suggests designing catalytic surfaces that are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species. This approach helps avoid strong adsorption of propene on the support surface, which can lead to undesired reactions.

The document does not directly address persistent challenges such as corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability. It also doesn't provide information on main group element metal oxides or discuss renovating reaction systems for ODHP process optimization.

In terms of future research directions, the study implies that further investigation into the use of soft oxidants like N2O and the optimization of vanadia distribution on catalyst surfaces could be promising areas for improving ODHP processes.

这份文档并没有对使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的各种催化剂系统的最新进展进行全面分析。然而，它确实提供了一些关于钒基催化剂的使用以及O2和N2O作为氧化剂的比较的见解。

该研究重点关注钒基材料，特别是VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂，据报道这些催化剂对ODP具有高活性和选择性。研究比较了这些催化剂使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂时的性能。

当使用N2O代替O2时，总体活性降低，但在相同的丙烷转化度下，对丙烯形成的选择性增加。这表明N2O作为一种较软的氧化剂，与O2相比可以提高选择性。

文档强调，优化活性晶格氧的稳态浓度对控制选择性氧化和燃烧反应至关重要。通过使用N2O代替O2实现了这种优化。

为了提高催化剂性能，研究建议设计完全覆盖有分散良好的钒氧化物物种的催化表面。这种方法有助于避免丙烯在支持表面上的强吸附，从而减少不希望发生的反应。

文档没有直接讨论持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性，或改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。它也没有提供关于主族元素金属氧化物的信息，也没有讨论改进ODHP过程优化的反应系统。

在未来研究方向方面，该研究暗示，进一步研究软氧化剂如N2O的使用以及优化催化剂表面上钒氧化物的分布可能是改进ODHP过程的有前景的领域。

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically comparing the performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst systems with varying vanadium loadings (0.5-9.5 wt%) using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

Key findings include:

1. N2O as an oxidant led to decreased overall activity but increased selectivity towards propene formation compared to O2.

2. Main products were propene, CO, and CO2 for both oxidants.

3. Higher propene selectivities were achieved with N2O at similar propane conversion levels.

4. Initial rates of product formation decreased when replacing O2 with N2O.

5. Optimal catalyst design involves fully covering surfaces with well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid propene adsorption on the support.

6. Using N2O instead of O2 helped optimize the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, controlling selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges like corrosiveness or elaborate on key areas for future research. However, it suggests that optimizing catalyst design and oxidant choice are important strategies for improving ODHP processes.

Future research could focus on:
1. Improving C-H bond activation through catalyst optimization
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Further exploring soft oxidants beyond N2O
4. Developing reaction systems that balance activity and selectivity

While the study provides valuable insights into VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts and the use of N2O as a soft oxidant, more comprehensive research on various catalyst systems and oxidants would be needed to fully address the question's scope.
