[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."

[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[3] "Propene, CO and CO2 were the main products over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials using oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants."

[4] "Higher propene selectivities were achieved in the presence of N2O over all catalytic materials at similar levels of propane conversion. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."

[5] "To achieve a high performance in ODP, it appears desirable to design catalytic surfaces which are fully covered by well-dispersed vanadia species for avoiding the strong adsorption of propene on the support surface."

[6] "The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, which takes part in propane and propene activation, should be optimised to control selective oxidation and combustion reactions. This was achieved by using N2O instead of O2."

The literature discusses recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, specifically comparing the performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalyst systems with varying vanadium loadings (0.5-9.5 wt%) using O2 and N2O as oxidants.

Key findings include:

1. N2O as an oxidant led to decreased overall activity but increased selectivity towards propene formation compared to O2.

2. Main products were propene, CO, and CO2 for both oxidants.

3. Higher propene selectivities were achieved with N2O at similar propane conversion levels.

4. Initial rates of product formation decreased when replacing O2 with N2O.

5. Optimal catalyst design involves fully covering surfaces with well-dispersed vanadia species to avoid propene adsorption on the support.

6. Using N2O instead of O2 helped optimize the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen, controlling selective oxidation and combustion reactions.

The study does not directly address persistent challenges like corrosiveness or elaborate on key areas for future research. However, it suggests that optimizing catalyst design and oxidant choice are important strategies for improving ODHP processes.

Future research could focus on:
1. Improving C-H bond activation through catalyst optimization
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Further exploring soft oxidants beyond N2O
4. Developing reaction systems that balance activity and selectivity

While the study provides valuable insights into VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts and the use of N2O as a soft oxidant, more comprehensive research on various catalyst systems and oxidants would be needed to fully address the question's scope.

该文献讨论了使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，特别比较了使用O2和N2O作为氧化剂时，具有不同钒负载量（0.5-9.5重量%）的VOx/-Al2O3催化剂系统的性能。

主要发现包括：

1. 与O2相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂导致整体活性降低，但丙烯形成的选择性增加。

2. 两种氧化剂的主要产物都是丙烯、CO和CO2。

3. 在相似的丙烷转化水平下，使用N2O可以获得更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 用N2O替代O2时，产物形成的初始速率降低。

5. 最佳催化剂设计涉及用分散良好的钒物种完全覆盖表面，以避免丙烯在载体上吸附。

6. 使用N2O代替O2有助于优化活性晶格氧的稳态浓度，控制选择性氧化和燃烧反应。

该研究没有直接涉及持续存在的挑战，如腐蚀性，也没有详细阐述未来研究的关键领域。然而，它表明优化催化剂设计和氧化剂选择是改进ODHP过程的重要策略。

未来研究可以关注：
1. 通过催化剂优化改善C-H键活化
2. 提高催化剂的再生能力
3. 进一步探索N2O以外的软氧化剂
4. 开发平衡活性和选择性的反应系统

虽然该研究对VOx/-Al2O3催化剂和使用N2O作为软氧化剂提供了有价值的见解，但需要对各种催化剂系统和氧化剂进行更全面的研究，以完全解答问题的范围。
