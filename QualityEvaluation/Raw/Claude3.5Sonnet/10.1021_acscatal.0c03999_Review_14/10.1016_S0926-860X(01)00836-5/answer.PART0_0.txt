[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), vanadium-based materials were reported to be very active and selective [1,4,5]."

[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."

[3] "As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."

[4] "A high selectivity to propene can be achieved by covering the support fully by well-dispersed vanadia species."

[5] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied materials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."

The literature provides some insights into recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants, particularly focusing on vanadium-based catalysts and the use of N2O as an oxidant:

1. Catalyst systems: Vanadium-based materials are reported to be highly active and selective for ODP. The study focuses on VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying vanadium loadings.

2. Selectivity and conversion: Replacing O2 with N2O as the oxidant leads to decreased overall activity but increased selectivity towards propene formation at the same degree of propane conversion.

3. Catalyst design strategies:
   - Isolated vanadium sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but do not fully cover the support surface.
   - High propene selectivity can be achieved by fully covering the support with well-dispersed vanadia species.
   - The steady-state concentration of active sites plays a crucial role in controlling selectivity.

4. Challenges and areas for improvement:
   - Optimizing the distribution of active sites on the catalyst surface to balance activity and selectivity.
   - Controlling the adsorption and further oxidation of propene on the support surface.
   - Enhancing the decomposition of N2O to improve overall activity while maintaining high selectivity.

5. Future research directions:
   - Developing catalysts with optimized vanadia dispersion and support coverage.
   - Investigating the use of non-acidic supports to minimize non-selective oxidation.
   - Further exploration of N2O as a soft oxidant and its impact on reaction mechanisms.
   - Studying the relationship between catalyst reducibility, electronic properties, and catalytic performance.

The study does not explicitly address challenges such as corrosiveness or strategies for improving C-H bond activation and catalyst regenerability. Future research could focus on these aspects to further optimize ODHP processes.

该文献提供了一些关于使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展，特别关注钒基催化剂和使用N2O作为氧化剂：

1. 催化剂系统：据报道，钒基材料在ODP反应中具有高活性和选择性。研究重点关注了不同钒负载量的VOx/γ-Al2O3催化剂。

2. 选择性和转化率：用N2O替代O2作为氧化剂会导致整体活性下降，但在相同的丙烷转化程度下，丙烯生成的选择性会提高。

3. 催化剂设计策略：
   - 孤立的钒位有利于丙烯选择性，但不能完全覆盖载体表面。
   - 通过将分散良好的钒氧化物物种完全覆盖载体可以获得高丙烯选择性。
   - 活性位的稳态浓度在控制选择性方面起着关键作用。

4. 挑战和改进领域：
   - 优化催化剂表面活性位的分布，以平衡活性和选择性。
   - 控制丙烯在载体表面的吸附和进一步氧化。
   - 增强N2O的分解以提高整体活性，同时保持高选择性。

5. 未来研究方向：
   - 开发具有优化钒氧化物分散度和载体覆盖率的催化剂。
   - 研究使用非酸性载体以最小化非选择性氧化。
   - 进一步探索N2O作为软氧化剂及其对反应机理的影响。
   - 研究催化剂可还原性、电子性质与催化性能之间的关系。

该研究并未明确提及腐蚀性等挑战，或改善C-H键活化和催化剂再生能力的策略。未来的研究可以集中在这些方面，以进一步优化ODHP过程。
