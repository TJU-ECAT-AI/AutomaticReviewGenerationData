Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems, particularly those based on transition metal oxides. The literature discusses CrOx/silica catalysts as promising materials due to their high activity in ODHP reactions. The active sites for these catalysts are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species.

However, CrOx/silica catalysts face challenges with rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and reduction of Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+. To address this issue, researchers have explored various strategies:

1. Addition of O2 as a co-feed with CO2: This approach improved the oxidizing power and decreased the deactivation rate but significantly reduced the selectivity for propylene.

2. Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst: The study reports on a novel catalyst prepared using a sequential impregnation method. The addition of 0.5 wt% Ni showed the maximum promotional effect.

The Ni-promoted catalyst demonstrated improved performance, with higher CO2 conversion and stable propylene production. The mechanism involves Ni dissociating CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr2+ species to active Cr3+ through reoxidation.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:
1. Catalyst deactivation
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion
3. Optimizing the oxidizing power of soft oxidants

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving C-H bond activation
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Optimizing reaction systems

Strategies to address these challenges may involve:
1. Developing new promoters or supports to stabilize active catalyst species
2. Exploring novel catalyst compositions to improve selectivity
3. Investigating reaction conditions and reactor designs to optimize ODHP processes

While the literature focuses on CrOx-based catalysts, future research should also consider other transition metal oxides and main group element metal oxides to expand the range of potential catalyst systems for ODHP reactions.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在改进催化剂系统，特别是基于过渡金属氧化物的催化剂。文献讨论了CrOx/硅胶催化剂作为有前景的材料，因为它们在ODHP反应中具有高活性。这些催化剂的活性位点是配位不饱和的Cr3+物种。

然而，CrOx/硅胶催化剂面临着由于积碳沉积和Cr3+还原为不活性Cr2+而导致的快速失活问题。为解决这个问题，研究人员探索了各种策略：

1. 添加O2作为CO2的共进料：这种方法改善了氧化能力并降低了失活率，但显著降低了丙烯的选择性。

2. Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂：研究报告了一种使用序贯浸渍法制备的新型催化剂。添加0.5 wt%的Ni显示了最大的促进效果。

Ni促进的催化剂表现出更好的性能，CO2转化率更高，丙烯生产更稳定。其机理涉及Ni将CO2解离为CO和O*ads，后者通过再氧化将还原的Cr2+物种再生为活性Cr3+。

ODHP中持续存在的挑战包括：
1. 催化剂失活
2. 平衡选择性和转化率
3. 优化软氧化剂的氧化能力

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：
1. 改善C-H键活化
2. 提高催化剂再生能力
3. 优化反应系统

应对这些挑战的策略可能包括：
1. 开发新的助剂或载体以稳定活性催化剂物种
2. 探索新型催化剂组成以提高选择性
3. 研究反应条件和反应器设计以优化ODHP过程

虽然文献主要关注基于CrOx的催化剂，但未来的研究还应考虑其他过渡金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，以扩大ODHP反应的潜在催化剂系统范围。

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems to enhance selectivity and conversion. The literature discusses CrOx/silica catalysts as promising materials for ODHP reactions due to their high activity. However, these catalysts face challenges such as rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and CrOx reduction.

To address these issues, researchers have explored various strategies. One approach involved adding O2 as a co-feed with CO2, which improved the oxidizing power and decreased the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts. However, this method resulted in a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity.

A notable advancement described in the literature is the development of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst. This catalyst, prepared using a sequential impregnation method, aims to decrease deactivation in the ODHP reaction. The optimal promotional effect was observed with a 0.5 wt% Ni loading.

The Ni-promoted catalyst demonstrated improved performance, maintaining stable catalytic activity and achieving higher CO2 conversion along with stable propylene production. The mechanism behind this improvement involves Ni dissociating CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which then regenerates the reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include catalyst deactivation, selectivity-conversion trade-offs, and the need for more efficient C-H bond activation. The corrosiveness of the reaction environment and inherent reaction properties also pose ongoing problems.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation strategies to enhance reaction efficiency.
2. Developing catalysts with better regenerability to maintain long-term performance.
3. Optimizing reaction systems to balance selectivity and conversion.
4. Exploring novel promoters or catalyst compositions to overcome current limitations.
5. Investigating the synergistic effects of multiple components in catalyst systems.
6. Developing more robust catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions.

These advancements aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems to enhance selectivity and conversion while addressing persistent challenges. The literature discusses the use of CrOx/silica catalysts, which show high activity in the ODHP reaction. However, these catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, converting the active Cr3+ state to the inactive Cr2+ state.

To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant. While CO2 helps maintain a higher oxidation state of surface Cr compared to its absence, its oxidizing ability is limited due to its thermodynamic stability.

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems to enhance selectivity and conversion while addressing challenges such as deactivation and coke deposition. The literature primarily discusses CrOx/silica catalysts and their Ni-promoted variants.

CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity in ODHP reactions but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant helps eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase. However, these catalysts still face challenges in maintaining stability and selectivity.

A significant advancement is the development of Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts. The addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst resulted in improved performance. This Ni-promoted catalyst showed a 10% higher CO2 conversion compared to the non-promoted catalyst and demonstrated stable propylene production. The promotional effect of Ni is attributed to its ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which helps regenerate the reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+, maintaining the active sites for the ODHP reaction.

Persistent challenges in this field include:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Despite improvements, catalysts still face issues with deactivation over time.
2. Selectivity-conversion trade-off: Enhancing conversion often leads to decreased selectivity, as seen with the addition of O2 to improve oxidizing power.
3. Maintaining active sites: Preventing the reduction of active Cr3+ sites to inactive Cr2+ remains a challenge.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Developing catalysts that can more efficiently activate the C-H bond in propane without compromising selectivity.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Further exploring promoters or catalyst designs that can continuously regenerate active sites during the reaction.
3. Optimizing reaction systems: Investigating novel reactor designs or process conditions that can balance the trade-off between selectivity and conversion.
4. Exploring other soft oxidants: Investigating alternatives to CO2 that may offer improved oxidizing capabilities while maintaining high selectivity.
5. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Conducting more in-depth studies on the reaction pathways and intermediates to guide catalyst design.

These advancements and future directions aim to address the inherent challenges in ODHP processes and move towards more efficient and sustainable propylene production methods.
