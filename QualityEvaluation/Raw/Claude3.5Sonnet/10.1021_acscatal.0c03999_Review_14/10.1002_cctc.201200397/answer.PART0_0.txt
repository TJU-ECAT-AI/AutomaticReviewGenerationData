[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Active sites of CrOx are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ in Cr species in dehydrogenation reactions."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[5] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[6] "The maximum promotional effect was observed if 0.5wt% Ni was loaded."

[7] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems, particularly those based on transition metal oxides. The literature discusses CrOx/silica catalysts as promising materials due to their high activity in ODHP reactions. The active sites for these catalysts are coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species.

However, CrOx/silica catalysts face challenges with rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and reduction of Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+. To address this issue, researchers have explored various strategies:

1. Addition of O2 as a co-feed with CO2: This approach improved the oxidizing power and decreased the deactivation rate but significantly reduced the selectivity for propylene.

2. Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst: The study reports on a novel catalyst prepared using a sequential impregnation method. The addition of 0.5 wt% Ni showed the maximum promotional effect.

The Ni-promoted catalyst demonstrated improved performance, with higher CO2 conversion and stable propylene production. The mechanism involves Ni dissociating CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr2+ species to active Cr3+ through reoxidation.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include:
1. Catalyst deactivation
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion
3. Optimizing the oxidizing power of soft oxidants

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving C-H bond activation
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Optimizing reaction systems

Strategies to address these challenges may involve:
1. Developing new promoters or supports to stabilize active catalyst species
2. Exploring novel catalyst compositions to improve selectivity
3. Investigating reaction conditions and reactor designs to optimize ODHP processes

While the literature focuses on CrOx-based catalysts, future research should also consider other transition metal oxides and main group element metal oxides to expand the range of potential catalyst systems for ODHP reactions.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在改进催化剂系统，特别是基于过渡金属氧化物的催化剂。文献讨论了CrOx/硅胶催化剂作为有前景的材料，因为它们在ODHP反应中具有高活性。这些催化剂的活性位点是配位不饱和的Cr3+物种。

然而，CrOx/硅胶催化剂面临着由于积碳沉积和Cr3+还原为不活性Cr2+而导致的快速失活问题。为解决这个问题，研究人员探索了各种策略：

1. 添加O2作为CO2的共进料：这种方法改善了氧化能力并降低了失活率，但显著降低了丙烯的选择性。

2. Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂：研究报告了一种使用序贯浸渍法制备的新型催化剂。添加0.5 wt%的Ni显示了最大的促进效果。

Ni促进的催化剂表现出更好的性能，CO2转化率更高，丙烯生产更稳定。其机理涉及Ni将CO2解离为CO和O*ads，后者通过再氧化将还原的Cr2+物种再生为活性Cr3+。

ODHP中持续存在的挑战包括：
1. 催化剂失活
2. 平衡选择性和转化率
3. 优化软氧化剂的氧化能力

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：
1. 改善C-H键活化
2. 提高催化剂再生能力
3. 优化反应系统

应对这些挑战的策略可能包括：
1. 开发新的助剂或载体以稳定活性催化剂物种
2. 探索新型催化剂组成以提高选择性
3. 研究反应条件和反应器设计以优化ODHP过程

虽然文献主要关注基于CrOx的催化剂，但未来的研究还应考虑其他过渡金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，以扩大ODHP反应的潜在催化剂系统范围。
