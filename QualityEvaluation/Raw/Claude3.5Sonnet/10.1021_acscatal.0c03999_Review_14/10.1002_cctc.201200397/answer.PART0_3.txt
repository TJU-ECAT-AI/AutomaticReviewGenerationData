[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."

[4] "However, CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."

[5] "Therefore, the development of a suitable promoter to activate CO2 that would enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 and also maintain a stable selectivity for propylene is highly desirable."

[6] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[7] "The maximum promotional effect was observed if 0.5wt% Ni was loaded."

[8] "Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems to enhance selectivity and conversion while addressing persistent challenges. The literature discusses the use of CrOx/silica catalysts, which show high activity in the ODHP reaction. However, these catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction, converting the active Cr3+ state to the inactive Cr2+ state.

To overcome these limitations, researchers have explored the use of CO2 as a soft oxidant. While CO2 helps maintain a higher oxidation state of surface Cr compared to its absence, its oxidizing ability is limited due to its thermodynamic stability. This has led to the development of promoters to activate CO2 and enhance its oxidizing ability while maintaining stable selectivity for propylene.

One significant advancement reported in the literature is the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst using a sequential impregnation method. This catalyst system shows promising results in decreasing deactivation during the ODHP reaction. The optimal promotional effect was observed with 0.5wt% Ni loading. The Ni promoter dissociates CO2 into CO and O*ads, which helps regenerate the reduced Cr2+ species to the active Cr3+ state through reoxidation.

Persistent challenges in this field include catalyst deactivation, coke deposition, and the inherent limitations of CO2 as a soft oxidant. Key areas for future research and development should focus on:

1. Improving C-H bond activation to enhance propane conversion.
2. Developing more effective promoters or catalyst compositions to activate CO2 and maintain catalyst stability.
3. Enhancing catalyst regenerability to prolong catalyst lifetime and maintain activity.
4. Optimizing reaction systems to balance conversion, selectivity, and catalyst stability.
5. Exploring novel support materials or catalyst architectures to improve overall performance.

By addressing these challenges and focusing on these key research areas, researchers can work towards developing more efficient and stable catalyst systems for ODHP processes using soft oxidants.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在改进催化剂系统，以提高选择性和转化率，同时解决持续存在的挑战。文献讨论了CrOx/硅胶催化剂的使用，这种催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高活性。然而，这些催化剂由于焦炭沉积和CrOx还原而迅速失活，将活性Cr3+状态转变为非活性Cr2+状态。

为了克服这些限制，研究人员探索了使用CO2作为软氧化剂。虽然CO2有助于维持表面Cr的较高氧化态，但由于其热力学稳定性，其氧化能力有限。这导致了开发促进剂来激活CO2并增强其氧化能力，同时保持丙烯的稳定选择性的需求。

文献报道的一个重要进展是使用序列浸渍法制备的Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂。这种催化剂系统在降低ODHP反应过程中的失活方面显示出令人promising的结果。观察到0.5wt%Ni负载时的最佳促进效果。Ni促进剂将CO2分解为CO和O*ads，有助于通过再氧化将还原的Cr2+物种再生为活性Cr3+状态。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括催化剂失活、焦炭沉积以及CO2作为软氧化剂的固有限制。未来研究和发展的关键领域应集中在：

1. 改善C-H键活化，以提高丙烷转化率。
2. 开发更有效的促进剂或催化剂组成，以激活CO2并保持催化剂稳定性。
3. 增强催化剂再生能力，延长催化剂寿命并保持活性。
4. 优化反应系统，平衡转化率、选择性和催化剂稳定性。
5. 探索新型支撑材料或催化剂结构，以改善整体性能。

通过解决这些挑战并关注这些关键研究领域，研究人员可以致力于开发更高效、更稳定的催化剂系统，用于使用软氧化剂的ODHP过程。
