[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[4] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[5] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

[6] "Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems to enhance selectivity and conversion while addressing persistent challenges. The literature primarily discusses CrOx-based catalysts, particularly CrOx/silica, which shows high activity in the ODHP reaction.

However, CrOx/silica catalysts face rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and reduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+. To address this issue, researchers have explored various strategies:

1. Addition of O2 as a co-feed with CO2: This approach improved the oxidizing power and decreased the deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst. However, it significantly reduced the selectivity for propylene.

2. Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst: This system, prepared using a sequential impregnation method, showed promising results in decreasing catalyst deactivation. The Ni promoter enhanced the catalytic stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction.

3. CO2 activation: The Ni-promoted catalyst demonstrated higher CO2 conversion and stable propylene production. Ni was found to dissociate CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which helps regenerate reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+, maintaining the active sites.

Persistent challenges in the field include:
1. Catalyst deactivation
2. Balancing selectivity and conversion
3. Efficient utilization of soft oxidants like CO2

Key areas for future research and development include:
1. Improving C-H bond activation
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability
3. Optimizing reaction systems for ODHP processes

Strategies to address these challenges may involve:
1. Developing novel promoters or support materials to improve catalyst stability
2. Fine-tuning catalyst composition and structure to enhance selectivity
3. Exploring new reaction conditions or process configurations to optimize ODHP performance

While the literature focuses on CrOx-based catalysts, future research should also investigate other transition metal/metal oxides and main group element metal oxides to broaden the range of effective catalyst systems for ODHP reactions using soft oxidants.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在改进催化剂系统，以提高选择性和转化率，同时解决持续存在的挑战。文献主要讨论了基于CrOx的催化剂，特别是CrOx/二氧化硅，它在ODHP反应中表现出高活性。

然而，CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂面临着由于积碳和活性Cr3+还原为非活性Cr2+而导致的快速失活问题。为解决这一问题，研究人员探索了各种策略：

1. 添加O2作为CO2的共进料：这种方法改善了氧化能力，降低了CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂的失活率。但是，它显著降低了对丙烯的选择性。

2. Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂：这种通过序列浸渍法制备的系统在降低催化剂失活方面显示出有希望的结果。Ni促进剂提高了ODHP反应中丙烯生产的催化稳定性。

3. CO2活化：Ni促进的催化剂表现出更高的CO2转化率和稳定的丙烯产量。发现Ni可以将CO2解离成CO和活性氧（O*ads），这有助于将还原的Cr物种从Cr2+再生为Cr3+，维持活性位点。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括：
1. 催化剂失活
2. 平衡选择性和转化率
3. 有效利用CO2等软氧化剂

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：
1. 改善C-H键活化
2. 提高催化剂再生能力
3. 优化ODHP过程的反应系统

解决这些挑战的策略可能涉及：
1. 开发新型促进剂或载体材料以改善催化剂稳定性
2. 微调催化剂组成和结构以提高选择性
3. 探索新的反应条件或工艺配置以优化ODHP性能

虽然文献主要集中在基于CrOx的催化剂上，但未来的研究还应该调查其他过渡金属/金属氧化物和主族元素金属氧化物，以扩大使用软氧化剂进行ODHP反应的有效催化剂系统范围。
