[1] "By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."

[2] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[4] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[5] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[6] "The maximum promotional effect was observed if 0.5wt% Ni was loaded."

[7] "If the ODHP reaction was dominant, the conversion of CO2 on the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst was 10% higher than that on the non-promoted catalyst."

[8] "Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems to enhance selectivity and conversion while addressing challenges such as deactivation and coke deposition. The literature primarily discusses CrOx/silica catalysts and their Ni-promoted variants.

CrOx/silica catalysts show high activity in ODHP reactions but suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and CrOx reduction. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant helps eliminate coke deposition and reoxidize the reduced active phase. However, these catalysts still face challenges in maintaining stability and selectivity.

A significant advancement is the development of Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalysts. The addition of 0.5 wt% Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst resulted in improved performance. This Ni-promoted catalyst showed a 10% higher CO2 conversion compared to the non-promoted catalyst and demonstrated stable propylene production. The promotional effect of Ni is attributed to its ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which helps regenerate the reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+, maintaining the active sites for the ODHP reaction.

Persistent challenges in this field include:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Despite improvements, catalysts still face issues with deactivation over time.
2. Selectivity-conversion trade-off: Enhancing conversion often leads to decreased selectivity, as seen with the addition of O2 to improve oxidizing power.
3. Maintaining active sites: Preventing the reduction of active Cr3+ sites to inactive Cr2+ remains a challenge.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation: Developing catalysts that can more efficiently activate the C-H bond in propane without compromising selectivity.
2. Enhancing catalyst regenerability: Further exploring promoters or catalyst designs that can continuously regenerate active sites during the reaction.
3. Optimizing reaction systems: Investigating novel reactor designs or process conditions that can balance the trade-off between selectivity and conversion.
4. Exploring other soft oxidants: Investigating alternatives to CO2 that may offer improved oxidizing capabilities while maintaining high selectivity.
5. Understanding reaction mechanisms: Conducting more in-depth studies on the reaction pathways and intermediates to guide catalyst design.

These advancements and future directions aim to address the inherent challenges in ODHP processes and move towards more efficient and sustainable propylene production methods.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在改进催化剂系统，以提高选择性和转化率，同时解决诸如失活和积碳等挑战。文献主要讨论了CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂及其镍促进变体。

CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高活性，但由于积碳沉积和CrOx还原而快速失活。使用CO2作为软氧化剂有助于消除积碳沉积并重新氧化还原的活性相。然而，这些催化剂在保持稳定性和选择性方面仍面临挑战。

一个重要的进展是开发了镍促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂。向CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂中添加0.5 wt%的镍显著改善了性能。这种镍促进的催化剂比未促进的催化剂表现出10%更高的CO2转化率，并展示了稳定的丙烯产量。镍的促进作用归因于其将CO2解离成CO和活化氧（O*ads）的能力，这有助于将还原的铬物种从Cr2+重新生成为Cr3+，维持ODHP反应的活性位点。

该领域持续存在的挑战包括：

1. 催化剂失活：尽管有所改进，催化剂仍面临随时间推移而失活的问题。
2. 选择性-转化率权衡：提高转化率往往导致选择性下降，如添加O2以提高氧化能力时所见。
3. 维持活性位点：防止活性Cr3+位点还原为非活性Cr2+仍然是一个挑战。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改善C-H键活化：开发能更有效活化丙烷中C-H键而不损害选择性的催化剂。
2. 增强催化剂再生能力：进一步探索能在反应过程中持续再生活性位点的促进剂或催化剂设计。
3. 优化反应系统：研究新型反应器设计或工艺条件，以平衡选择性和转化率之间的权衡。
4. 探索其他软氧化剂：研究CO2的替代品，可能提供更好的氧化能力，同时保持高选择性。
5. 理解反应机理：对反应途径和中间体进行更深入的研究，以指导催化剂设计。

这些进展和未来方向旨在解决ODHP过程中固有的挑战，朝着更高效和可持续的丙烯生产方法迈进。
