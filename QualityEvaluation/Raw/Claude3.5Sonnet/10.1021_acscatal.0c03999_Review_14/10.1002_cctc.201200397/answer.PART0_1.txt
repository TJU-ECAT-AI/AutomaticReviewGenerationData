[1] "CrOx/silica is considered as a promising material owing to its high activity among other active materials in the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."

[3] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2. Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."

[4] "Here, we report on the preparation of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst by using a sequential impregnation method to decrease the deactivation of the catalyst in the ODHP reaction."

[5] "The maximum promotional effect was observed if 0.5wt% Ni was loaded."

[6] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

Recent advances in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using soft oxidants have focused on improving catalyst systems to enhance selectivity and conversion. The literature discusses CrOx/silica catalysts as promising materials for ODHP reactions due to their high activity. However, these catalysts face challenges such as rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and CrOx reduction.

To address these issues, researchers have explored various strategies. One approach involved adding O2 as a co-feed with CO2, which improved the oxidizing power and decreased the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts. However, this method resulted in a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity.

A notable advancement described in the literature is the development of a Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst. This catalyst, prepared using a sequential impregnation method, aims to decrease deactivation in the ODHP reaction. The optimal promotional effect was observed with a 0.5 wt% Ni loading.

The Ni-promoted catalyst demonstrated improved performance, maintaining stable catalytic activity and achieving higher CO2 conversion along with stable propylene production. The mechanism behind this improvement involves Ni dissociating CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which then regenerates the reduced Cr species from Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation.

Persistent challenges in ODHP include catalyst deactivation, selectivity-conversion trade-offs, and the need for more efficient C-H bond activation. The corrosiveness of the reaction environment and inherent reaction properties also pose ongoing problems.

Key areas for future research and development include:

1. Improving C-H bond activation strategies to enhance reaction efficiency.
2. Developing catalysts with better regenerability to maintain long-term performance.
3. Optimizing reaction systems to balance selectivity and conversion.
4. Exploring novel promoters or catalyst compositions to overcome current limitations.
5. Investigating the synergistic effects of multiple components in catalyst systems.
6. Developing more robust catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions.

These advancements aim to address the persistent challenges in ODHP and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.

使用软氧化剂进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）的最新进展主要集中在改进催化剂系统以提高选择性和转化率。文献讨论了CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂作为ODHP反应的有前景材料，因为它们具有高活性。然而，这些催化剂面临着诸如因积碳沉积和CrOx还原导致的快速失活等挑战。

为了解决这些问题，研究人员探索了各种策略。一种方法涉及将O2作为CO2的共进料添加，这提高了氧化能力并降低了CrOx/二氧化硅催化剂的失活率。但是，这种方法导致C3H6选择性显著降低。

文献中描述的一个显著进展是开发了一种Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂。这种催化剂使用顺序浸渍法制备，旨在降低ODHP反应中的失活。观察到0.5 wt% Ni负载时获得最佳促进效果。

Ni促进的催化剂表现出改进的性能，保持稳定的催化活性，并实现更高的CO2转化率以及稳定的丙烯产量。这种改进的机制涉及Ni将CO2分解为CO和活化氧（O*ads），然后通过再氧化将还原的Cr物种从Cr2+再生为Cr3+。

ODHP中持续存在的挑战包括催化剂失活、选择性-转化率权衡以及需要更高效的C-H键活化。反应环境的腐蚀性和固有的反应特性也带来持续的问题。

未来研究和开发的关键领域包括：

1. 改进C-H键活化策略以提高反应效率。
2. 开发具有更好再生能力的催化剂以保持长期性能。
3. 优化反应系统以平衡选择性和转化率。
4. 探索新型促进剂或催化剂组成以克服当前限制。
5. 研究催化剂系统中多组分的协同效应。
6. 开发更加稳健的催化剂，能够承受苛刻的反应条件。

这些进展旨在解决ODHP中持续存在的挑战，为更高效和可持续的丙烯生产工艺铺平道路。
