3.2. BEA Zeolite-Based Catalysts
Similar to MFI materials, BEA topologic zeolites can also be synthesized under a wide range of SAR values, which are another typical support for PDH catalysts. De Cola et al. (51) investigated the PDH activity over a set of PtZn containing zeolites with various topologies and preparation methods. Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction. Various Zn species (including Zn2+, Zn(OH)+, (Zn-O-Zn)2+, (Zn-(O-Zn)n)2+ and ZnO nanoparticles) may exist after the ion-exchange process, and the different Zn statuses largely depend on the zeolite topologies. In particular, the catalysts with Na-Beta support possess a smaller amount of isolated Zn2+ sites, which inhibits the aromatization side-reactions and coke deposits compared to other topological counterparts (MFI, MEL, LTL, and FAU). The optimized 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta catalyst achieves a propane conversion of 30% and a propylene selectivity of 90% during a 63 h reaction, which approaches the thermodynamic equilibrium conversions under given conditions (555 C, undiluted propane). By adjusting the acid treatment conditions (acid concentration, treatment duration and temperature), Beta zeolites could be dealuminated (deAl) to varying extents, resulting in deAl-Beta with arbitrary SAR or even pure silica Beta zeolite (Si-Beta). The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species (Figure 6a). Besides, the resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits. Chen et al. (103) first reported the use of Si-Beta zeolites supported ZnOx for the PDH reaction. Abundant silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of small ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm), while the impregnated ZnOx on Al-Beta supports tends to form large ZnO nanoparticles (7 nm). The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%. Chens group further investigated V, Co, and PtSn species loaded on Si-Beta zeolites, (54,104,106) which also exhibit a higher metal dispersion and superior PDH performance than the counterparts with Al-Beta or Al2O3 supports. It is noted that an obvious induction period with the form of increased propane conversion was observed for the Co/Si-Beta system. (104) Such induction periods can be eliminated after H2 prereduction. The characterizations reveal that the highly dispersed CoOx clusters would be reduced to ultrasmall metallic Co clusters under reductive conditions (e.g., H2 treatment or PDH reaction), which account for the induction periods. The optimal 0.5Co/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits a propylene formation TOF of 32.9 h1, which is superior to the previous Co catalysts with SiO2, ZrSiO2, and Al2O3 supports (TOF values were 115 h1).
Yue et al. (107) synthesized the Sn/Si-Beta catalysts via a similar dealumination-impregnation procedure. The impregnated Sn species was incorporated within a Si-Beta framework, which acts as Lewis acid sites to catalyze CH cleavage in PDH. It was found that the dehydrogenation rate was dependent on the Lewis acidity, while the Bronsted acidity contributes to the cracking rate but is independent of the dehydrogenation rate. The Na+ doping treatment weakens the Bronsted acidity of Sn-Beta catalysts without affecting the Lewis acidity. As a result, the propane conversion over Na-Sn-Beta catalysts remains unchanged compared to Sn-Beta, while the propylene selectivity is greatly improved. Among the catalysts with various Sn loadings, the Sn-Beta-30 sample with a Si/Sn ratio of 30 exhibits a propane conversion of 40% with a propylene selectivity of 92% at 630 C. No obvious conversion loss was observed throughout the 72 h stability test (Figure 6b). The DFT calculations reveal, on a closed -Sn-(OSi)4 site, the direct PDH mechanism is energetically and kinetically more favorable than the indirect (stepwise) PDH mechanism. Moreover, the open (-Sn-(OH)n-(OSi)4-n) sites possess a smaller energy barrier in the first dehydrogenation (170189 kJ·mol1) step compared to closed -Sn-(OSi)4 sites with a barrier of 203 kJ·mol1, suggesting open sites with higher flexibility contribute to propane activation.
The above studies suggest that abundant vacant T-sites in Si-Beta zeolites contribute to the metal dispersion as reactive sites, which exhibits promising PDH performance. In addition to acting as reactive sites, the introduced heteroatom could also act as anchor sites for impregnated Pt species, resulting in a Pt-oxide interface or PtxMy alloy. This helps modify the geometric and electronic structure of Pt species, which potentially improves the PDH performance. Ma et al. (36) reported the synthesis of Sn-Beta zeolites through a secondary hydrothermal process using Si-Beta as the silica source and SnCl4 as the tin source. The resulting Sn-Beta zeolites possess abundant framework Sn species, which enables all impregnated Pt species to be encapsulated within the Si-Beta channels due to the strong PtSn interactions (Figure 6c). After impregnation, the resulting Pt-Sn-Beta-P sample possesses highly dispersed and homogeneous Pt species (particle size ranged from 0.2 to 1 nm) within zeolite channels (Figure 6d). In comparison, the Pt-Si-Beta-P sample with Si-Beta (without framework Sn species) support possesses large and heterogeneous Pt nanoparticles (320 nm) located both in zeolite channels and on external surface of zeolites. The detailed XAS characterizations confirm that the skeleton Sn species contribute to form the (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-O-[PtCl5] moiety, which is crucial for producing subnanometric Pt sites during impregnation. The influence of different calcination procedures was further investigated. The Pt species would agglomerate into PtSn nanoparticles in air calcination, and subsequent H2 reduction leads to the formation of PtxSny alloys. In comparison, the direct H2 reduction of Pt-Si-Beta-P leads to the formation of subnanometric Pt species within the Si-Beta channels in the form of (SiO)2Sn(II)-Ptn(1<n<15). The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C (Figure 6e). Qi et al. (37) reported that the impregnation of Zn species on Si-Beta results in Zn-OH nests, which could anchor the isolated Pt atoms. The HAADF-STEM images visualize the highly isolated Pt atoms in catalyst, and the distance between Pt atoms is much larger than that in PtZn alloys. In the meantime, the nonmutant in situ XAS spectra indicate that the Pt coordination environment stoichiometrically changed during thermal treatment. These two features confirm the existence of highly isolated Pt sites and exclude them from the formation of PtZn alloys. After treatment in He at 823 K, the Pt species would be reduced to a nearly zerovalent state, while Zn exists with an average valence state of +1. Further detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting data reveal each Pt atom coordinates with about 6 Zn atoms to form (-Si-O-Zn)46-Pt coordination, which effectively contributes to the Pt dispersion and stabilization toward near 100% propylene selectivity and catalytic stability throughout the 160 h PDH test.
3.3. Other Topologic Zeolite-Based Catalysts
Apart from MFI and BEA, other topological zeolites have relatively fewer applications in the PDH reaction. Liu et al. (27) reported the encapsulation of well-dispersed Pt sites within purely siliceous MCM-22 zeolites (MWW topology) during swelling of the layered MWW-structured ITQ-1 by an expanding surfactant. For the resulting Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, most of the Pt species exist as single atoms and 0.7 nm clusters encapsulated within the hemicages and supercages. After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550 C, the Pt@MCM-22 sample retains about 90% of its initial activity, while the conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 sample exhibits more than 40% activity loss. Afterward, the encapsulated Pt species in Pt@MCM-22 would grow into 12 nm nanoparticles. Gong et al. (141) employed the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to introduce well-defined Zn species onto ZSM-5 and Y zeolites. The isolated ZnOH+ site was the predominant species on both ZSM-5 and Y zeolites after the first ALD cycle. The increased ALD cycles lead to the formation of ZnOx clusters on Y zeolite, while the ZnOH+ species could be retained on ZSM-5 zeolite because the diethyl zinc precursor cannot enter the ZSM-5 micropores after the first ALD cycle. The Zn deposition on Y zeolites completely eliminates the Bronsted acid sites and greatly increases the amount of strong Lewis acid sites, while only part of Bronsted acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolites were removed after Zn deposition. Due to the decreased amount of ZnOH+ species, the ZnY catalysts exhibit lower propane conversion than Zn-ZSM-5, while the propylene selectivity is largely enhanced due to low Bronsted acidity.
Recently, Yuan et al. (108,109) investigated the Ga/In speciation on CHA zeolites and the structurefunction relationships in PDH. The combined DRIFT spectra and pulse titration experiments demonstrate that the Ga2O3/In2O3 species would displace the protos of Bronsted acid sites to form isolated extraframework Ga+/In+ sites upon H2 reduction. The in situ DRIFT spectra and DFT calculations indicate that the isolated Ga+ sites can form GaHx species at 150500 C upon H2 reduction, and the higher temperature of 550 C leads to GaHx decomposition. There is no InHx species in the In-CHA system upon H2 treatment. As a result, the isolated Ga+/In+ sites were deemed as the PDH active center. The DRIFT spectra and pulse titration experiments show that the water molecules could oxidize Ga+ but not In+, suggesting the Ga+ is more susceptible to oxidation. Accordingly, it was indicated the Ga+ sites can better stabilize the intermediates due to propane CH cleavage (Ga+  [HGa3+C3H7]+) and therefore leads to the 43 times reaction rate of Ga-CHA than In-CHA. (108)
Zhou et al. (55) reported that the SUZ-4 supported PtSnNa catalyst exhibits a PDH stability superior to that of the counterpart with ZSM-5 support. The authors developed a dibenzothiophene poisoning experiment to investigate the Pt distribution. Specifically, dibenzothiophene has a molecule diameter larger than the micropore sizes of these two zeolites, and thus the dibenzothiophene molecules can only poison the surface Pt, while the Pt sites inside the zeolite channels remained untouched. The dibenzothiophene poisoning experiment indicates that Pt species mainly disperse on the external surface of SUZ-4 support, while more Pt species locate within the pores of ZSM-5 support. Variation in Pt distributions results in different coke distributions. Coke species in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 primarily locate inside ZSM-5 channels and cover the Pt sites, while most of coke deposits in PtSnNa/SUZ-4 locate on the zeolite surface and therefore lead to superior stability. Zhang et al. (57) reported the passivation effect of the NaX zeolite framework on PDH performance over encapsulated Pt clusters. The hydrothermally synthesized Pt@NaX catalyst with encapsulated Pt clusters exhibits a propane consumption TOF of 0.41 s1, which is inferior to the impregnated Pt/NaX catalyst consisting of superficial Pt clusters (TOF = 4.15 s1). Besides, the zeolitic framework surrounding the encapsulated Pt species suppressed propylene desorption, which reduces propylene selectivity and increases coke deposits.
Apart from these silicate and aluminosilicate zeolites, there are also a few PDH systems based on silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. Fei et al. reported that PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield. (142) O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions. (56) Similar to the above-described PtSn/ZSM-5 systems (132,133) the role of Sn in PtSn/SAPO-34 was understood by modification of the Pt sites electronic density and transfer of coke deposits from Pt to support. (56) It should be noted that stable and abundant framework P atoms are one unique feature of such a class of silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. In this context, the highly dispersed and ultrastable metal phosphides may be constructed based on silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, which potentially improve the PDH performance, especially in propylene selectivity, compared to the metal/oxide sites.
