<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain specific information about zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document primarily focuses on metal-based catalysts (such as Pt) and metal oxide catalysts (such as VOx) for PDH reactions. It does not discuss the preparation methods, composition, or topology of zeolite catalysts and their influence on PDH performance. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided information.

给定的文献中没有包含关于沸石基催化剂,特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石,在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的具体信息。该文档主要关注PDH反应的金属基催化剂(如Pt)和金属氧化物催化剂(如VOx)。它没有讨论沸石催化剂的制备方法、成分或拓扑结构及其对PDH性能的影响。因此,无法根据所提供的信息回答这个问题。
