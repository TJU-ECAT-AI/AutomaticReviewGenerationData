<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain specific information about zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document primarily focuses on metal-based catalysts (such as Pt) and metal oxide catalysts (such as VOx) for PDH reactions. It does not discuss the preparation methods, composition, or topology of zeolite catalysts and their influence on PDH performance. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided information.

给定的文献中没有包含关于沸石基催化剂,特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石,在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的具体信息。该文档主要关注PDH反应的金属基催化剂(如Pt)和金属氧化物催化剂(如VOx)。它没有讨论沸石催化剂的制备方法、成分或拓扑结构及其对PDH性能的影响。因此,无法根据所提供的信息回答这个问题。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain specific information about zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses mainly on metal-based (e.g., Pt) and metal oxide-based (e.g., VOx, CrOx) catalysts for PDH. It does not discuss the preparation methods, composition, or topology of zeolite catalysts and their influence on PDH performance.

However, the document does mention some general principles that could be relevant to zeolite catalysts as well:

1. Highly dispersed active sites tend to improve selectivity and stability.
2. Confinement of active species within porous structures can enhance stability by preventing sintering.
3. The support material can influence the electronic properties and dispersion of active sites.
4. Defect engineering and doping can be used to modify catalyst properties.

To properly answer the question about zeolite-based catalysts for PDH, additional literature specifically focused on this topic would be needed.

提供的文献中不包含关于沸石基催化剂，特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的具体信息。该文档主要关注金属基(如Pt)和金属氧化物基(如VOx、CrOx)催化剂用于PDH。它没有讨论沸石催化剂的制备方法、组成或拓扑结构及其对PDH性能的影响。

然而，该文档确实提到了一些可能与沸石催化剂相关的一般原则：

1. 高度分散的活性位点往往可以提高选择性和稳定性。
2. 将活性物种限制在多孔结构内可以通过防止烧结来增强稳定性。
3. 载体材料可以影响活性位点的电子性质和分散度。
4. 缺陷工程和掺杂可用于改变催化剂性质。

要正确回答关于沸石基催化剂用于PDH的问题，需要额外专门针对这个主题的文献。
