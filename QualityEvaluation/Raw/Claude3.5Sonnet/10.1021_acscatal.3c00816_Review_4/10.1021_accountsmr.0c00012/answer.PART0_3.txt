<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not contain specific information about zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document focuses mainly on metal-based catalysts (such as Pt and its alloys) and metal oxide catalysts (such as VOx, ZrO2, and GaOx) for PDH reactions. It does not discuss the influence of preparation methods, composition, or zeolite topology on the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions. Therefore, this specific question cannot be answered based on the given information.

所提供的文献中没有关于沸石基催化剂，特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的具体信息。该文档主要集中在金属基催化剂（如Pt及其合金）和金属氧化物催化剂（如VOx、ZrO2和GaOx）用于PDH反应。它没有讨论制备方法、成分或沸石拓扑结构对PDH反应中沸石基催化剂性能的影响。因此，基于给定的信息无法回答这个具体问题。
