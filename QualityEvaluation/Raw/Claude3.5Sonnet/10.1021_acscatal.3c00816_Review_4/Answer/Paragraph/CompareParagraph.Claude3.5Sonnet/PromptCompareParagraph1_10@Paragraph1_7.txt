Zeolite-based catalysts have gained significant attention in the field of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their unique porous structure and tunable properties. Various preparation methods, including hydrothermal synthesis, post-synthesis modification, and template-free approaches, have been employed to develop efficient zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions. Characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and temperature-programmed desorption are commonly used to analyze the structural and chemical properties of these catalysts. Among the different zeolite types, BEA topology zeolites have shown promising results due to their large pore size and high acid site density, which facilitate propane diffusion and activation. Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites, on the other hand, offer enhanced hydrothermal stability and moderate acidity, making them suitable for long-term PDH operations. Comparative studies have revealed that the performance of zeolite catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by factors such as Si/Al ratio, metal loading, and pore structure, with BEA and SAPO zeolites often exhibiting superior propylene selectivity and catalyst stability compared to other zeolite types.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite topology:
BEA-type zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites [10.1002/cctc.201801708]. This structure facilitates better dispersion and stabilization of metal species. For silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, SAPO-34 (CHA topology) shows superior performance compared to other zeolites, providing weak surface acidity and excellent shape selectivity for propylene [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

2. Preparation methods:
a) Dealumination: Removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, allowing for better accommodation and anchoring of metal species [10.1002/cctc.201801708].
b) Two-step post-synthesis: For Sn-Beta zeolites, a procedure involving dealumination of H-Beta followed by incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through impregnation is effective [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019].
c) Sequential impregnation: This method is commonly used for preparing bimetallic catalysts, such as PtSn/SAPO-34, allowing for better control of metal dispersion and interaction with the support [10.1021/ie901465s].

3. Composition:
a) Metal loading: Optimal metal loading varies depending on the specific catalyst system. For example, 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite showed high performance [10.1002/cctc.201801708], while 0.5 wt% Co on SiBeta demonstrated excellent results [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037].
b) Bimetallic systems: PtSn catalysts often show improved performance and stability compared to monometallic catalysts [10.1039/D0CS00814A].
c) Promoters: The addition of promoters like Na or La can enhance catalyst performance [10.1016/j.cej.2011.11.055].

4. Acidity control:
Dealumination reduces the number of strong acid sites in the zeolite, which effectively minimizes side reactions and enhances propylene selectivity [10.1002/cctc.201801708]. The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites is crucial, with a high L/B ratio being beneficial for PDH [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019].

5. Metal-support interactions:
Strong interactions between metal species and the zeolite support contribute to improved catalyst stability and performance. For example, the interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework leads to high dispersion of Pt species [10.1039/C9CY01907C].

6. Confinement effect:
The zeolite structure helps confine and stabilize active metal species, inhibiting sintering and coke formation. This effect is particularly pronounced in BEA and SAPO-34 zeolites [10.1039/C9CY01907C, 10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

These factors collectively contribute to improved catalyst performance in PDH reactions. For instance, Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts prepared via an improved post-synthesis method exhibited propene formation rates of 2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ with >99% selectivity at 550°C [10.1039/C9CY01907C]. Similarly, PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts achieved propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The research on zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions has shown significant progress, particularly in the development of BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The interplay between preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology offers numerous opportunities for catalyst optimization.

Future research directions may include:
1. Exploring novel synthesis methods to create hierarchical pore structures in BEA and SAPO zeolites, potentially improving mass transfer and catalyst stability.
2. Investigating the use of advanced characterization techniques, such as operando spectroscopy, to gain deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of active sites during PDH reactions.
3. Developing strategies for precise control of metal species distribution and size within zeolite frameworks, possibly through atomic layer deposition or advanced encapsulation techniques.
4. Exploring the potential of zeolite-based catalysts for other dehydrogenation reactions, leveraging the knowledge gained from PDH studies.
5. Investigating the long-term stability and regeneration of zeolite-based catalysts under industrial conditions, focusing on minimizing deactivation and extending catalyst lifetime.

These future directions could lead to the development of more efficient and stable catalysts for PDH reactions, potentially revolutionizing propylene production in the petrochemical industry.
