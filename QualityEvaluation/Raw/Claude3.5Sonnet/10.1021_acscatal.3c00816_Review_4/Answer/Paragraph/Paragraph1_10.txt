Zeolite-based catalysts have gained significant attention in the field of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to their unique porous structure and tunable properties. Various preparation methods, including hydrothermal synthesis, post-synthesis modification, and template-free approaches, have been employed to develop efficient zeolite catalysts for PDH reactions. Characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and temperature-programmed desorption are commonly used to analyze the structural and chemical properties of these catalysts. Among the different zeolite types, BEA topology zeolites have shown promising results due to their large pore size and high acid site density, which facilitate propane diffusion and activation. Silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) zeolites, on the other hand, offer enhanced hydrothermal stability and moderate acidity, making them suitable for long-term PDH operations. Comparative studies have revealed that the performance of zeolite catalysts in PDH reactions is influenced by factors such as Si/Al ratio, metal loading, and pore structure, with BEA and SAPO zeolites often exhibiting superior propylene selectivity and catalyst stability compared to other zeolite types.
