   - Bimetallic systems, particularly PtSn, show improved performance and stability [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].
   - Optimal metal loadings are crucial: for example, 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn in Beta zeolites [10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028].
   - The Si/Al ratio significantly affects catalyst performance, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26) often yielding the best results [10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028].

3. Zeolite topology:
   - BEA-type zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, providing larger pores than ZSM-5 and facilitating better dispersion of metal species [10.1002/cctc.201801708].
   - SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite with CHA topology, shows superior performance due to its unique structure, weak surface acidity, and excellent shape selectivity for propylene [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

4. Metal-support interactions:
   - Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) can be regulated by altering defect amounts in supports [10.1039/D0CS00814A].
   - Framework-Sn in Beta zeolites can anchor Pt precursors, forming confined Pt subnanometric clusters with improved stability [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022].

5. Acidity control:
   - Reducing Brønsted acidity or controlling its distribution within the zeolite structure improves catalyst performance [10.1021/ie901465s].
   - The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (L/B ratio) is crucial, with a high L/B ratio beneficial for PDH [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019].

6. Confinement effect:
   - Zeolite pores and electronic effects of additives (e.g., Sn) inhibit coke formation and sintering of metal clusters [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022].
   - The confinement of metal species in zeolite frameworks leads to improved dispersion and stability [10.1039/C9CY01907C].

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity (up to 99%), high conversion rates (40-72%), and excellent catalyst stability (maintaining activity for over 250 hours) in PDH reactions using BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolite-based catalysts [10.1039/C9CY01907C] [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation has shown significant progress, particularly in the areas of BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. The synergistic effects of carefully tailored preparation methods, optimized compositions, and strategic metal-support interactions have led to catalysts with remarkable performance and stability.

Looking forward, several promising research directions emerge:

1. Advanced characterization techniques: Developing and applying more sophisticated in-situ and operando spectroscopic methods could provide deeper insights into the dynamic behavior of active sites during PDH reactions, enabling further optimization of catalyst designs.

2. Hierarchical zeolites: Exploring the potential of hierarchical zeolite structures that combine micropores and mesopores could enhance mass transfer properties while maintaining the shape-selective advantages of zeolites.

3. Single-atom catalysts: Further investigation into the preparation and stabilization of single-atom catalysts within zeolite frameworks could lead to highly efficient and stable PDH catalysts with maximized atom utilization.

4. Machine learning and high-throughput experimentation: Implementing these techniques could accelerate the discovery and optimization of novel zeolite-based catalysts for PDH, potentially uncovering unexpected synergies between composition, structure, and performance.

5. Green synthesis methods: Developing more environmentally friendly and cost-effective methods for zeolite synthesis and modification could make these advanced catalysts more accessible for industrial applications.

6. Multifunctional catalysts: Designing zeolite-based catalysts that can perform PDH in tandem with other valuable transformations could lead to more efficient and integrated chemical processes.

By pursuing these research directions, the field of zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation has the potential to achieve even higher levels of performance, stability, and sustainability, paving the way for more efficient and environmentally friendly production of propylene.

Zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) have been extensively studied, with various preparation methods, compositions, and zeolite topologies significantly influencing their performance. This review focuses on BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, while also drawing insights from other zeolite types.

BEA Topologic Zeolites:
BEA zeolites have shown promising results in PDH reactions due to their unique structure and properties. Key factors contributing to their performance include:

1. Dealumination: Removing lattice Al atoms from β zeolite creates vacant T-atom sites and silanol nests, which serve as efficient anchor sites for metal species [10.1002/cctc.201801708]. This process reduces strong acid sites, minimizing side reactions and enhancing propylene selectivity.

2. Metal loading and composition: Various metal combinations have been studied, with PtSn being particularly effective. For instance, 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta achieved stable conversion close to thermodynamic equilibrium (29% at 555°C) with >90% propene selectivity for at least 63 hours [10.1016/j.apcata.2006.03.028]. Low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) resulted in propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity over 92% at 600°C [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037].

3. Preparation methods: Advanced techniques like framework-Sn anchoring of Pt precursors have led to the formation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta), achieving 90% of maximum propane conversion over 250 hours at 99% propene selectivity [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022].

4. Confinement effect: The BEA structure provides a shape-selective reaction space, promoting propene molecule diffusion while inhibiting side reactions and coke formation [10.1039/C9CY01907C].

Silicoaluminophosphate Zeolites:
SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite with CHA topology, has shown superior performance in PDH reactions compared to some aluminosilicate zeolites:

1. Shape selectivity: The microporous structure of SAPO-34 provides excellent shape selectivity for propylene, enhancing selectivity [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

2. Acidity control: SAPO-34 has weak Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, contributing to selective conversion of intermediates to propylene and reducing unwanted side reactions [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

3. Hydrothermal stability: Si-based acid sites in SAPO-34 make it more resistant to hydrothermal treatment compared to ZSM-5 [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

4. Coke resistance: SAPO-34 supported catalysts form about 30% less coke compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalyst stability [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

5. Performance: PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts have achieved propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% [10.1016/j.catcom.2009.07.008].

Comparison and Key Factors:
Both BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites offer unique advantages for PDH reactions. Key factors contributing to improved performance across zeolite types include:

1. Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species and the zeolite framework enhance catalyst stability and performance [10.1039/D1CY00738F].

2. Acidity control: Modulating the strength and distribution of acid sites is crucial for optimizing propylene selectivity and reducing side reactions [10.1016/j.jcat.2020.12.019].

3. Metal dispersion: Achieving high dispersion of metal species, often as subnanometric clusters or single atoms, significantly improves catalyst performance [10.1038/nmat4757].

4. Bimetallic systems: Combinations like PtSn have shown synergistic effects, enhancing both activity and stability [10.1039/D0CS00814A].

5. Preparation methods: Advanced techniques such as atomic layer deposition, ion exchange, and in-situ crystallization can lead to improved metal dispersion and catalyst stability [10.1039/C5CP05043J].


Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions has seen significant progress, with both BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites showing promising results. The unique properties of these zeolites, combined with advanced preparation methods and optimal metal compositions, have led to catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability.

Future research directions may focus on:
1. Further exploration of novel zeolite structures and compositions tailored specifically for PDH reactions.
2. Development of more precise control over metal species distribution and size within zeolite frameworks.
3. In-depth investigation of the synergistic effects between different metal species and zeolite supports.
4. Advanced characterization techniques to better understand the nature of active sites and reaction mechanisms.
5. Scaling up promising catalyst systems for industrial applications while maintaining their exceptional performance.

By continuing to refine our understanding of the complex interplay between zeolite structure, composition, and preparation methods, we can expect further improvements in PDH catalyst performance, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable propylene production processes.
