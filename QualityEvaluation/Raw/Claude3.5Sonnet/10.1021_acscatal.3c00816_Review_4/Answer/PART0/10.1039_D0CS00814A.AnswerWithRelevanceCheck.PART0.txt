          [1] "Bert M. Weckhuysen and coworkers summarized the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) on metals and metal oxides before 2014, providing a very comprehensive introduction."

[2] "0.44 wt% Pt1 wt% Sn@MFI 0.44 450 1.7 C3H8 = 24, N2 = 7 70.0 48.0 90.0 65 5.5 0.0143"

[5] "KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).66,83 As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h. The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters."

[6] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

[7] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h)."

[8] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."

[9] "Recently, Jeffrey T. Miller and coworkers demonstrated a clear subsurface effect over two different intermetallic PtMn catalysts with different subsurfaces."

[10] "Recently, several regulation strategies of SMSI have been newly developed."

[11] "Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal, metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on thermally and chemically stable oxides are readily formed upon calcination and reduction."

[12] "The partial substitution of metal cations M2+/M3+ with two different kinds of metal ions could also produce a bimetallic catalyst with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys and modulate the interaction between Pt and supports."

[13] "Altering the defect amounts of supports has been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI."

[14] "Recently, a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for the PDH reaction has been synthesized by An-Hui Lu and coworkers, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets as a support that is rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions."

[15] "Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated OH sites."

[16] "Additionally, altering the defect amounts of supports has been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI. For Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts, previous results have shown that coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+ penta) sites abounding on the (100) facets of the γ-Al2O3 surface serve as anchoring sites of Pt."

          The literature provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for MFI, MCM-22, and SAPO-34 topologies. However, specific information on BEA topology is limited.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite topology: MFI (ZSM-5) and MCM-22 are commonly used. SAPO-34 (CHA topology) is also mentioned.

2. Composition: Most catalysts contain platinum (Pt) as the active metal, often promoted with tin (Sn), sodium (Na), or potassium (K). Pt loading is typically low (0.4-0.5 wt%).

3. Preparation methods:
   - Innovative approaches to generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms within purely siliceous MCM-22 during zeolite growth.
   - Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations for high metal dispersion.
   - Embedding Pt and Sn within the zeolite structure (e.g., KPtSn@MFI) to maintain atomic dispersion.

4. Metal-support interactions:
   - Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) can be regulated by altering defect amounts in supports.
   - Coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites on γ-Al2O3 serve as anchoring sites for Pt.

5. Bimetallic systems:
   - PtSn catalysts show improved performance and stability.
   - Partial substitution of metal cations with two different kinds of metal ions can produce highly dispersed metal/metal alloys.

6. Performance factors:
   - Atomic dispersion of Pt is crucial for catalyst stability and performance.
   - The interaction between Pt and Sn, particularly when Sn is partially reduced, plays a role in controlling Pt dispersion and exposure.
   - Zeolite structure helps in confining and stabilizing active metal species.
   - Propylene selectivity ranges from 79% to 96%, with MFI-based catalysts generally showing higher selectivity.
   - Conversion rates vary widely, from 15% to 70%.

7. Stability:
   - KPtSn@MFI catalysts demonstrated high catalytic performance maintained over at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.
   - The stability, as indicated by the deactivation rate constant (kd), varies significantly between catalysts.

While these insights provide a general understanding of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, more specific research on BEA topology and a comprehensive comparison of different zeolite types would be needed to fully address the question.

          文献为我们提供了关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中性能的见解，特别是针对MFI、MCM-22和SAPO-34拓扑结构。然而，关于BEA拓扑结构的具体信息有限。

影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：常用的有MFI（ZSM-5）和MCM-22。还提到了SAPO-34（CHA拓扑结构）。

2. 组成：大多数催化剂含有铂（Pt）作为活性金属，通常用锡（Sn）、钠（Na）或钾（K）进行促进。Pt的负载量通常较低（0.4-0.5 wt%）。

3. 制备方法：
   - 在沸石生长过程中，在纯硅MCM-22内生成Pt纳米粒子和单原子Pt的创新方法。
   - 使用具有可交换金属阳离子的矿物型前驱体，以获得高金属分散度。
   - 将Pt和Sn嵌入沸石结构中（如KPtSn@MFI），以保持原子分散性。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：
   - 通过改变载体中的缺陷数量可以调节强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）。
   - γ-Al2O3表面上的配位不饱和五配位Al3+位点作为Pt的锚定位点。

5. 双金属系统：
   - PtSn催化剂显示出改进的性能和稳定性。
   - 用两种不同的金属离子部分替代金属阳离子可以产生高度分散的金属/金属合金。

6. 性能因素：
   - Pt的原子分散性对催化剂的稳定性和性能至关重要。
   - Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，特别是当Sn部分还原时，在控制Pt的分散和暴露方面发挥作用。
   - 沸石结构有助于限制和稳定活性金属物种。
   - 丙烯选择性范围从79%到96%，基于MFI的催化剂通常表现出更高的选择性。
   - 转化率差异很大，从15%到70%不等。

7. 稳定性：
   - KPtSn@MFI催化剂在至少三个反应-再生循环中保持高催化性能，没有明显的失活。
   - 稳定性，以失活率常数（kd）表示，在不同催化剂之间差异显著。

虽然这些见解为我们提供了对沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中的一般理解，但要全面回答问题，还需要对BEA拓扑结构进行更具体的研究，并对不同类型的沸石进行全面比较。
