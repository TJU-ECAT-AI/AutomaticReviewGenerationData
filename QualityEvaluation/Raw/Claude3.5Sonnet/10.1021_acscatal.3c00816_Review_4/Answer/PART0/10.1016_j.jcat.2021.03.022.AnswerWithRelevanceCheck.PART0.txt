          [1] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."

[2] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

[3] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

[4] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals"

[5] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."

[6] "Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts"

[7] "Specially, the solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]  species was revealed in the present study, which is the first report disclosing how framework Sn atoms are interacting with Pt species."

[8] "The location of subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) within pores wall of *BEA crystals in the form of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115) were also revealed."

[9] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

          The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite selection: Microporous zeolites with crystalline structure, large surface area, and well-defined pore channels provide an intrinsic confinement effect, making them excellent carriers for metal catalysts.

2. Framework-Sn anchoring: Utilizing framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation leads to the formation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters.

3. Confinement effect: Zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn inhibit coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, resulting in excellent stability in PDH reactions.

4. Metal additives: Adding a second metal, such as Sn to Pt catalysts, enhances performance by providing both geometric effects (preventing Pt active site collision) and electronic effects (electron transfer to Pt atoms).

5. Specific active sites: The formation of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] species and their subsequent reduction to (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15) within the pore walls of BEA crystals contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

6. Joint confinement effect: The combination of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

7. Pt catalysts: Supported Pt catalysts are preferred for PDH processes due to their activity for C-H activation and lower activity for unfavorable C-C cracking.

These factors contribute to maintaining high propane conversion rates (90% of maximum conversion over 250 hours) and excellent propene selectivity (99%) in PDH reactions using Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts.

          在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂的性能有显著影响，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 沸石选择：具有晶体结构、大比表面积和明确孔道的微孔沸石提供了内在的限域效应，使其成为金属催化剂的优秀载体。

2. 骨架Sn锚定：利用Beta沸石中的骨架Sn在浸渍过程中锚定铂前驱体，形成Sn-Beta限制的Pt亚纳米簇。

3. 限制效应：沸石孔道和Sn的电子效应抑制了焦炭形成和超细Pt簇的烧结，从而在PDH反应中获得优异的稳定性。

4. 金属添加剂：添加第二种金属（如在Pt催化剂中添加Sn）可以提高性能，既提供几何效应（防止Pt活性位点碰撞）又提供电子效应（向Pt原子转移电子）。

5. 特定活性位点：在BEA晶体孔壁中形成(Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]物种，并随后还原为(Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15)，这contributes to了催化剂的有效性。

6. 联合限制效应：Sn和沸石拓扑结构的组合产生了高活性、高选择性和高稳定性的PDH反应催化剂。

7. Pt催化剂：负载型Pt催化剂因对C-H活化具有活性，而对不利的C-C断裂活性较低，而被优先用于PDH过程。

这些因素有助于在使用Pt@Sn-Beta催化剂的PDH反应中保持高丙烷转化率（250小时内保持最大转化率的90%）和优异的丙烯选择性（99%）。
