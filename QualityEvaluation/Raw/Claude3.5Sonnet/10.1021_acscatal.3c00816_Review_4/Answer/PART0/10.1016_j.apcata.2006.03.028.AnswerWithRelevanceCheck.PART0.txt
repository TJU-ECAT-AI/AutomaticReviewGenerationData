          [1] "PtZn-containing zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y were tested as catalysts in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 555 C."

[2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%."

[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

[4] "Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, platinum by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6."

[5] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[6] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[7] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7  nSi/nAl  26)."

[8] "PtZn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[9] "A large fraction of isolated Zn2+ cations causes aromatization in the 10-membered-ring zeolites ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 and coke formation with rapid deactivation in the 12-membered-ring zeolites L and Y."

[10] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topology zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: Zinc introduction by aqueous ion exchange followed by platinum impregnation generally produces better catalysts than simultaneous impregnation of both metals. Ion exchange reduces zinc loss and pore blocking during catalyst activation and propane conversion.

2. Composition: The optimal catalyst contains 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn. The Si/Al ratio is crucial, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26) yielding the best results.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered ring zeolites, particularly Beta (BEA) and mordenite, show the highest and most stable conversion levels. The spacious pore structure of Beta allows for better dispersion of metal species and reduced coking.

4. Zinc species distribution: Slightly over-exchanged zeolites perform better than strongly over-exchanged or impregnated ones. This suggests that a balance of different zinc species (e.g., Zn2+, ZnO, Zn(OH)+) is crucial for catalyst performance.

The best-performing catalyst was 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, which achieved stable conversion close to thermodynamic equilibrium (29% at 555°C) with >90% propene selectivity for at least 63 hours. This performance is attributed to the optimal combination of preparation method, composition, zeolite topology, and Si/Al ratio.

Factors contributing to catalyst deactivation include volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase, and coking. These issues were mitigated by using the optimal preparation methods and compositions mentioned above.

The study does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing instead on aluminosilicate zeolites with various topologies.

          制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，特别是对BEA拓扑结构的沸石。影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：通过水相离子交换引入锌，然后浸渍铂，通常比同时浸渍两种金属产生更好的催化剂。离子交换减少了催化剂活化和丙烷转化过程中的锌损失和孔道堵塞。

2. 成分：最佳催化剂含有0.5 wt%的铂和1.6-2.6 wt%的锌。Si/Al比至关重要，中等比例(8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26)产生最佳结果。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：12元环沸石，特别是Beta (BEA)和丝光沸石，显示出最高和最稳定的转化水平。Beta的宽敞孔道结构允许更好的金属物种分散和减少结焦。

4. 锌物种分布：轻度过量交换的沸石比强过量交换或浸渍的沸石表现更好。这表明不同锌物种(如Zn2+、ZnO、Zn(OH)+)的平衡对催化剂性能至关重要。

性能最佳的催化剂是0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta，它在555°C下实现了接近热力学平衡的稳定转化(29%)，丙烯选择性>90%，至少持续63小时。这种性能归因于制备方法、成分、沸石拓扑结构和Si/Al比的最佳组合。

导致催化剂失活的因素包括金属锌的挥发、PtZn金属相的烧结和结焦。通过使用上述最佳制备方法和成分，这些问题得到了缓解。

该研究没有具体提到硅铝磷酸盐沸石，而是集中研究了具有各种拓扑结构的铝硅酸盐沸石。
