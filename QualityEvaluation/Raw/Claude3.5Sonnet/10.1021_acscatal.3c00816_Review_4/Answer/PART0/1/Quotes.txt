[1] "Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "Our previous work discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. The powder H-ZSM-5 was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.123 M La(NO3)3 at 80 C at first, then dried at 80 C for 3 h, calcined in an air flow at 500 C, 550 C, 600 C, 650 C and 700 C for 4 h, respectively."

[4] "In our experiments, the catalyst when the calcination temperature of La was 650 C showed the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene was about 34.3% over 82 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 C."

[5] "To explain these, it should first be noted that the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particle and the acid site) may work collaboratively. From this, it is assumed that an optimum ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites over the catalyst should exist."

[6] "As for the Z700 sample, it exhibits the much larger reduction peaks of Sn species at high temperature, suggesting that in this case more amounts of Sn0 components have produced. Similarly, this behavior may be linked with the severe dealumination of the catalyst, which in consequence weakens the interactions between Sn species and the carrier."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."

[2] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn-based SAPO-34 zeolite supported catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method, with calcined SAPO-34 powder."

[4] "The silico-aluminophosphate zeolite SAPO-34 is a microporous sieve with a chabasite-like structure (structural code CHA), has an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene"

[5] "The structure, acidity and catalytic properties of SAPO-34 depend on the number and distribution of Si in the framework"

[6] "Its Si based acid sites make it resistant to hydrothermal treatment and gives superiority over ZSM-5, where dealumination occur frequently"

[7] "The amount of coke formed over the SAPO-34 supported catalysts was about 30% less than ZSM-5 supported catalysts, after 8 h reaction."

[8] "Accordingly, it was found that SAPO-34 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts have both weak Bronsted and Lewis acid sites."

[1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."

[2] "β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."

[4] "The left vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species, attributable to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups."

[5] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[6] "The dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Thus, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 catalyst can be greatly enhanced."

[7] "After loading with Zn species, ZnO particles can be well accommodated into vacant T-atom sites in the DeAlβ framework, and thus, producing into a large amount of SN ZnO with the catalytic capacity for PDH in Znβ catalyst."

[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process"

[2] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[3] "The Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

[1] "ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are synthesized by performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to HZSM-5 and HY using diethyl zinc and water as the precursors."

[2] "Introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."

[3] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."

[4] "These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites."

[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

[1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[3] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[4] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

[5] "The d-band center of the Pt50 clusters confined in the zeolite shifts to a lower value compared with that in the gas phase, which is consistent with the Pt L3-edge XANES and Pt 4d XPS results shown in Fig. 1f and S8, respectively. The Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane, and thus a lower propane conversion was achieved over Pt@NaX compared with that over Pt/NaX."

[6] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."

[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y were tested as catalysts in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 555 C."

[2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%."

[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

[4] "Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, platinum by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6."

[5] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[6] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[7] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7  nSi/nAl  26)."

[8] "PtZn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[9] "A large fraction of isolated Zn2+ cations causes aromatization in the 10-membered-ring zeolites ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 and coke formation with rapid deactivation in the 12-membered-ring zeolites L and Y."

[10] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

[1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species"

[3] "Besides, the resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits."

[4] "Abundant silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of small ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm), while the impregnated ZnOx on Al-Beta supports tends to form large ZnO nanoparticles (7 nm)."

[5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."

[6] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C"

[7] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

[8] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."
          [3] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."
          [4] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."
          [5] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts of different metallic contents were prepared by sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34"

[4] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

[5] "It is impressive that the Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metallic sites to support, and in this way improves catalyst stability."

[6] "It is observed that the Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity. With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined"

[7] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."

[8] "The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support. It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support. Moreover, Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[2] "The Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by dealumination of H-beta and then the introduction of Sn species via dry impregnation."

[3] "As illustrated in Scheme 1, firstly, H-beta zeolite was completely dealuminated and then mixed with the calculated amount of Sn precursors. After calcination, the Sn precursors decomposed and reacted with the silanols produced by dealumination of the zeolite. Finally, Pt precursors were dispersed onto the Sn-Si-beta support by strong interaction between Pt and Sn after H2 reduction."

[4] "As shown in Fig. 1a, all the samples display similar diffraction patterns with a typical BEA topology, revealing that the dealumination and metal incorporation do not disturb the structure of the zeolite beta framework."

[5] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."

[6] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."

[7] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."

[8] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[3] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

[4] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."

[5] "The gradual decrease of Eapp for C3H8 dehydrogenation on In-CHA(12, 1.0) from 190 to 109 kJ mol1 as the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0 is consistent with the fact that In+ dominates the reaction since the BAS density decreases, although it slightly increases as the In/Al ratio is increased to 1.7."

"Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C. Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

"We have presented a new strategy to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite with exceptional high stability, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors."

"As has been presented above, incorporation of Pt in the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22 leads to isolated Pt atoms and Pt clusters on the cups located at the external surface and also probably in the internal space of MCM-22."

"It should be remarked that no significant loss of Pt in the Pt@MCM-22 sample is observed by ICP after five cycles of propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."

[4] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."

[5] "With the properties of high surface area, well-crystallized structure and high thermal stability, dealuminated Beta zeolites (SiBeta) have been intensively used as an ideal support to attach transition metal species"

[1] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."

[2] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

[3] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

[4] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals"

[5] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."

[6] "Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts"

[7] "Specially, the solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]  species was revealed in the present study, which is the first report disclosing how framework Sn atoms are interacting with Pt species."

[8] "The location of subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) within pores wall of *BEA crystals in the form of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115) were also revealed."

[9] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

[1] "Bert M. Weckhuysen and coworkers summarized the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) on metals and metal oxides before 2014, providing a very comprehensive introduction."

[2] "0.44 wt% Pt1 wt% Sn@MFI 0.44 450 1.7 C3H8 = 24, N2 = 7 70.0 48.0 90.0 65 5.5 0.0143"

[3] "0.5 wt% Pt1 wt% Na/SnZSM-5 0.5 590 3.0 C3H8 = 80, H2 = 20 41.7 39.1 96.0 9 5.4 0.0120"

[4] "0.45 wt% Pt0.94 wt% Sn/siltSAPO-34 0.45 585 5.0 C3H8 = 83, H2 = 17 38.2 15.0 79.0 8 7.6 0.1562"

[5] "KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).66,83 As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h. The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters."

[6] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

[7] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h)."

[8] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."

[9] "Recently, Jeffrey T. Miller and coworkers demonstrated a clear subsurface effect over two different intermetallic PtMn catalysts with different subsurfaces."

[10] "Recently, several regulation strategies of SMSI have been newly developed."

[11] "Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal, metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on thermally and chemically stable oxides are readily formed upon calcination and reduction."

[12] "The partial substitution of metal cations M2+/M3+ with two different kinds of metal ions could also produce a bimetallic catalyst with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys and modulate the interaction between Pt and supports."

[13] "Altering the defect amounts of supports has been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI."

[14] "Recently, a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for the PDH reaction has been synthesized by An-Hui Lu and coworkers, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets as a support that is rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions."

[15] "Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated OH sites."

[16] "Additionally, altering the defect amounts of supports has been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI. For Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts, previous results have shown that coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+ penta) sites abounding on the (100) facets of the γ-Al2O3 surface serve as anchoring sites of Pt."

[1] "Dumesic and co-workers reported PtSn supported on zeolite K-L to be a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst in the selective dehydrogenation of isobutane."

          [2] "Recently, Azzam et al. studied how the structure of zeolite L affected the stability of a Pt/K-L catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane."

          [3] "Iglesia et al. found Pt supported on Na[Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites to be highly selective and stable catalysts in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

          [4] "These authors claim that the replacement of the framework Al3+ for Fe3+ ions is essential for the Pt precursor to anchor inside the 10-member ring zeolite channels, which in turn is necessary to obtain subnanometric Pt clusters after reduction."

          [5] "Further modifications of the catalyst involving the neutralization of the residual acid sites with Cs after Pt reduction improved the selectivity of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation of n-pentane and n-heptane."

[1] "We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[4] "After 6 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases to ca. 40%. It is noticeable that its propylene selectivity remains at ca. 98% during the whole reaction, which is hard to realize at such a high propane conversion."

[5] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[6] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[7] "It is notable that the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[8] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."

[9] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

[10] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[1] "SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."

[3] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[5] "PtSnNa catalysts supported on either the SUZ-4 or the ZSM-5 zeolite (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) were prepared by sequentially impregnating the H-SUZ-4 or H-ZSM-5 with an aqueous mixture of H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 (H2PtCl6 = 5 mg/mL, SnCl4 = 5.85 mg/mL) and with aqueous NaCl (0.5 mol/L)."

[1] "Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "Our previous work discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. The powder H-ZSM-5 was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.123 M La(NO3)3 at 80 C at first, then dried at 80 C for 3 h, calcined in an air flow at 500 C, 550 C, 600 C, 650 C and 700 C for 4 h, respectively."

[4] "In our experiments, the catalyst when the calcination temperature of La was 650 C showed the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene was about 34.3% over 82 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 C."

[5] "To explain these, it should first be noted that the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particle and the acid site) may work collaboratively. From this, it is assumed that an optimum ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites over the catalyst should exist."

[6] "As for the Z700 sample, it exhibits the much larger reduction peaks of Sn species at high temperature, suggesting that in this case more amounts of Sn0 components have produced. Similarly, this behavior may be linked with the severe dealumination of the catalyst, which in consequence weakens the interactions between Sn species and the carrier."

[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."

[2] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn-based SAPO-34 zeolite supported catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method, with calcined SAPO-34 powder."

[4] "The silico-aluminophosphate zeolite SAPO-34 is a microporous sieve with a chabasite-like structure (structural code CHA), has an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene"

[5] "The structure, acidity and catalytic properties of SAPO-34 depend on the number and distribution of Si in the framework"

[6] "Its Si based acid sites make it resistant to hydrothermal treatment and gives superiority over ZSM-5, where dealumination occur frequently"

[7] "The amount of coke formed over the SAPO-34 supported catalysts was about 30% less than ZSM-5 supported catalysts, after 8 h reaction."

[8] "Accordingly, it was found that SAPO-34 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts have both weak Bronsted and Lewis acid sites."

[1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."

[2] "β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."

[4] "The left vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species, attributable to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups."

[5] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[6] "The dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Thus, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 catalyst can be greatly enhanced."

[7] "After loading with Zn species, ZnO particles can be well accommodated into vacant T-atom sites in the DeAlβ framework, and thus, producing into a large amount of SN ZnO with the catalytic capacity for PDH in Znβ catalyst."

[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process"

[2] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[3] "The Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

[1] "ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are synthesized by performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to HZSM-5 and HY using diethyl zinc and water as the precursors."

[2] "Introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."

[3] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."

[4] "These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites."

[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

[1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[3] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[4] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

[5] "The d-band center of the Pt50 clusters confined in the zeolite shifts to a lower value compared with that in the gas phase, which is consistent with the Pt L3-edge XANES and Pt 4d XPS results shown in Fig. 1f and S8, respectively. The Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane, and thus a lower propane conversion was achieved over Pt@NaX compared with that over Pt/NaX."

[6] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."

[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y were tested as catalysts in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 555 C."

[2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%."

[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

[4] "Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, platinum by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6."

[5] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[6] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[7] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7  nSi/nAl  26)."

[8] "PtZn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[9] "A large fraction of isolated Zn2+ cations causes aromatization in the 10-membered-ring zeolites ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 and coke formation with rapid deactivation in the 12-membered-ring zeolites L and Y."

[10] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

[1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species"

[3] "Besides, the resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits."

[4] "Abundant silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of small ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm), while the impregnated ZnOx on Al-Beta supports tends to form large ZnO nanoparticles (7 nm)."

[5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."

[6] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C"

[7] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

[8] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

[1] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."
          [2] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."
          [3] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."
          [4] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."
          [5] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

[1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts of different metallic contents were prepared by sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34"

[4] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

[5] "It is impressive that the Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metallic sites to support, and in this way improves catalyst stability."

[6] "It is observed that the Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity. With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined"

[7] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."

[8] "The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support. It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support. Moreover, Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."

[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[2] "The Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by dealumination of H-beta and then the introduction of Sn species via dry impregnation."

[3] "As illustrated in Scheme 1, firstly, H-beta zeolite was completely dealuminated and then mixed with the calculated amount of Sn precursors. After calcination, the Sn precursors decomposed and reacted with the silanols produced by dealumination of the zeolite. Finally, Pt precursors were dispersed onto the Sn-Si-beta support by strong interaction between Pt and Sn after H2 reduction."

[4] "As shown in Fig. 1a, all the samples display similar diffraction patterns with a typical BEA topology, revealing that the dealumination and metal incorporation do not disturb the structure of the zeolite beta framework."

[5] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."

[6] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."

[7] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."

[8] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[3] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

[4] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."

[5] "The gradual decrease of Eapp for C3H8 dehydrogenation on In-CHA(12, 1.0) from 190 to 109 kJ mol1 as the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0 is consistent with the fact that In+ dominates the reaction since the BAS density decreases, although it slightly increases as the In/Al ratio is increased to 1.7."

"Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C. Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

"We have presented a new strategy to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite with exceptional high stability, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors."

"As has been presented above, incorporation of Pt in the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22 leads to isolated Pt atoms and Pt clusters on the cups located at the external surface and also probably in the internal space of MCM-22."

"It should be remarked that no significant loss of Pt in the Pt@MCM-22 sample is observed by ICP after five cycles of propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."

[4] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."

[5] "With the properties of high surface area, well-crystallized structure and high thermal stability, dealuminated Beta zeolites (SiBeta) have been intensively used as an ideal support to attach transition metal species"

[1] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."

[2] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

[3] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

[4] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals"

[5] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."

[6] "Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts"

[7] "Specially, the solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]  species was revealed in the present study, which is the first report disclosing how framework Sn atoms are interacting with Pt species."

[8] "The location of subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) within pores wall of *BEA crystals in the form of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115) were also revealed."

[9] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

[1] "Bert M. Weckhuysen and coworkers summarized the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) on metals and metal oxides before 2014, providing a very comprehensive introduction."

[2] "0.44 wt% Pt1 wt% Sn@MFI 0.44 450 1.7 C3H8 = 24, N2 = 7 70.0 48.0 90.0 65 5.5 0.0143"

[3] "0.5 wt% Pt1 wt% Na/SnZSM-5 0.5 590 3.0 C3H8 = 80, H2 = 20 41.7 39.1 96.0 9 5.4 0.0120"

[4] "0.45 wt% Pt0.94 wt% Sn/siltSAPO-34 0.45 585 5.0 C3H8 = 83, H2 = 17 38.2 15.0 79.0 8 7.6 0.1562"

[5] "KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).66,83 As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h. The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters."

[6] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

[7] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h)."

[8] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."

[9] "Recently, Jeffrey T. Miller and coworkers demonstrated a clear subsurface effect over two different intermetallic PtMn catalysts with different subsurfaces."

[10] "Recently, several regulation strategies of SMSI have been newly developed."

[11] "Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal, metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on thermally and chemically stable oxides are readily formed upon calcination and reduction."

[12] "The partial substitution of metal cations M2+/M3+ with two different kinds of metal ions could also produce a bimetallic catalyst with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys and modulate the interaction between Pt and supports."

[13] "Altering the defect amounts of supports has been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI."

[14] "Recently, a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for the PDH reaction has been synthesized by An-Hui Lu and coworkers, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets as a support that is rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions."

[15] "Surface organometallic chemistry brings about the generation of well-defined surface species on various supports by colonising tailored molecular precursors on supports with segregated OH sites."

[16] "Additionally, altering the defect amounts of supports has been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI. For Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts, previous results have shown that coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+ penta) sites abounding on the (100) facets of the γ-Al2O3 surface serve as anchoring sites of Pt."

[1] "Dumesic and co-workers reported PtSn supported on zeolite K-L to be a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst in the selective dehydrogenation of isobutane."

          [2] "Recently, Azzam et al. studied how the structure of zeolite L affected the stability of a Pt/K-L catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane."

          [3] "Iglesia et al. found Pt supported on Na[Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites to be highly selective and stable catalysts in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

          [4] "These authors claim that the replacement of the framework Al3+ for Fe3+ ions is essential for the Pt precursor to anchor inside the 10-member ring zeolite channels, which in turn is necessary to obtain subnanometric Pt clusters after reduction."

          [5] "Further modifications of the catalyst involving the neutralization of the residual acid sites with Cs after Pt reduction improved the selectivity of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation of n-pentane and n-heptane."

[1] "We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[4] "After 6 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases to ca. 40%. It is noticeable that its propylene selectivity remains at ca. 98% during the whole reaction, which is hard to realize at such a high propane conversion."

[5] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[6] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[7] "It is notable that the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[8] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."

[9] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

[10] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[1] "SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."

[3] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

[5] "PtSnNa catalysts supported on either the SUZ-4 or the ZSM-5 zeolite (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) were prepared by sequentially impregnating the H-SUZ-4 or H-ZSM-5 with an aqueous mixture of H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 (H2PtCl6 = 5 mg/mL, SnCl4 = 5.85 mg/mL) and with aqueous NaCl (0.5 mol/L)."
