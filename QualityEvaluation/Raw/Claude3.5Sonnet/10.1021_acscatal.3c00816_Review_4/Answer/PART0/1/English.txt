The literature provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for ZSM-5 topology:

1. Zeolite topology: Three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 were found to be better catalytic supports than mesoporous materials like SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature.

2. Composition: The addition of promoters, specifically La, to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts resulted in higher propane conversion and propene selectivity. The catalyst is bifunctional, with metal particles and acid sites working collaboratively.

3. Preparation method: Sequential impregnation was used, with La(NO3)3 impregnation followed by calcination at various temperatures, then impregnation with Pt, Sn, and Na precursors.

4. Calcination temperature: The calcination temperature of La significantly affected catalyst performance, with 650°C showing the best activity and stability. Too high calcination temperature (e.g., 700°C) can lead to severe dealumination, weakening interactions between metal species and the carrier.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Appropriate pore geometry (3D microporous structure)
- Suitable promoters (La in this case)
- Optimal calcination temperature (650°C for La)
- Proper metal loading and composition
- Balancing the number of active sites and acid sites
- Strong metal-support interactions
- Preventing dealumination and maintaining catalyst structure

The study doesn't provide specific information on BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH reactions. Further research would be needed to compare these with the ZSM-5 based catalysts described in the literature.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study focuses on SAPO-34 as a support for PtSn-based catalysts.

Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst was prepared using a sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34 powder.

Composition: The catalyst contains both Pt and Sn metals supported on SAPO-34 zeolite. The number and distribution of Si in the SAPO-34 framework influence its structure, acidity, and catalytic properties.

Zeolite topology: SAPO-34 has a chabasite-like structure (CHA topology) with microporous channels, providing excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Shape selectivity: The microporous structure of SAPO-34 provides an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene, enhancing selectivity.

2. Acidity: SAPO-34 and its supported catalysts have weak Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which contribute to the selective conversion of intermediates to propylene and reduce unwanted side reactions.

3. Surface area: SAPO-34 supported catalysts have a larger surface area compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalytic performance.

4. Hydrothermal stability: The Si-based acid sites in SAPO-34 make it more resistant to hydrothermal treatment compared to ZSM-5, which is prone to dealumination.

5. Coke resistance: SAPO-34 supported catalysts form less coke (about 30% less) compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalyst stability.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts, resulting in higher propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefins selectivity (>97%) compared to other zeolite-based catalysts like PtSn/ZSM-5.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Removing lattice Al atoms from the β zeolite framework creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. This process allows for better accommodation and anchoring of metal species, particularly ZnO nanoclusters.

2. Metal loading: The optimal catalyst was found to be 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite. This composition provided a balance between the number of active sites and the prevention of bulk ZnO formation.

3. Zeolite topology: BEA-type β zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites. This structure facilitates better dispersion and stabilization of ZnO nanoclusters.

4. Acidity control: Dealumination reduces the number of strong acid sites in the zeolite, which effectively minimizes side reactions and enhances propylene selectivity.

5. Metal-support interaction: The reaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the dealuminated β zeolite framework leads to the formation of well-dispersed, small ZnO nanoclusters that act as active sites for PDH.

These factors collectively contribute to the high catalytic performance of the optimized catalyst, resulting in a high initial propane conversion of around 53%, superior propylene selectivity of about 93%, and good stability and reusability. The absence of strong acid sites and the presence of well-dispersed ZnO nanoclusters are particularly crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites like Sn-Beta. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Preparation method: A two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of H-Beta and incorporation of Sn species into the framework is used to create Sn-Beta zeolites. This method allows for better control of Sn incorporation and distribution.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) showed the best results in PDH reactions.

3. Acid site distribution: The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (L/B ratio) is crucial. A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH, as Lewis acid sites catalyze dehydrogenation while Brønsted acid sites promote undesired cracking reactions.

4. Single-site Sn structure: The incorporation of isolated Sn atoms into the zeolite framework creates single-site catalysts, which contribute to improved activity and selectivity.

5. Ion exchange: Na+ exchange of Sn-Beta (Na-Sn-Beta) further improved catalytic performance by reducing Brønsted acidity while maintaining Lewis acidity.

These factors lead to improved propylene selectivity (up to 92%), high conversion rates (40% for Na-Sn-Beta-30), and excellent catalyst stability (no detectable deactivation for 72 hours under harsh reaction conditions).

Although the literature does not directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites modified with ZnO for propane conversion:

1. Preparation method: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) allows precise control over ZnO deposition, resulting in highly dispersed ZnO species on zeolites.

2. Composition: ZnO introduction significantly improves catalytic activity. The balance between ZnO species (for dehydrogenation) and Brønsted acid sites (for oligomerization and cyclization) is crucial.

3. Zeolite topology: Y zeolite shows higher selectivity to propylene, while ZSM-5 achieves high selectivities to aromatics, due to differences in pore structures and acid site distributions.

4. Key factors for improved performance:
   a. ZnO species promote dehydrogenation reactions
   b. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective than larger ZnO clusters
   c. 1-2 ALD cycles perform better than multiple cycles
   d. Balance between Lewis acid sites (from ZnO) and Brønsted acid sites

5. Catalyst stability: Rapid deactivation occurs due to coke formation, presenting a challenge for long-term use.

These findings, while specific to ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites, provide insights that may be applicable to optimizing other zeolite-based catalysts, including those with BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate compositions, for PDH reactions.

The study primarily focuses on NaX zeolite-based catalysts rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it provides valuable insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Preparation methods: 
   - Pt@NaX: synthesized via in situ crystallization, with Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages.
   - Pt/NaX: prepared via traditional incipient impregnation, with Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior.

2. Composition and topology effects:
   - Location of Pt clusters (exterior vs. interior) significantly affects performance.
   - Zeolite framework interaction influences the electronic properties of Pt clusters.

3. Catalyst performance:
   - Propane conversion: Pt/NaX showed remarkably higher conversion than Pt@NaX at 520°C and 550°C.
   - Propylene selectivity: Pt/NaX maintained a stable 67.0% selectivity, while Pt@NaX only achieved 43.0%.
   - Turnover frequency (TOF): Pt/NaX demonstrated a 1100% enhancement compared to Pt@NaX.

4. Catalyst stability:
   - Pt/NaX exhibited higher stability with less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%).

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. Location of Pt clusters: Exterior placement (Pt/NaX) led to better activity and selectivity.
2. Electronic properties: The d-band center of Pt clusters confined in zeolite shifted to a lower value, affecting propane activation.
3. Zeolite framework effect: The surrounding framework in Pt@NaX passivated the Pt clusters, reducing their activity.
4. Product desorption: Easier propylene desorption from Pt/NaX contributed to higher selectivity.

While this study focuses on NaX zeolites, the principles of how preparation methods, metal-zeolite interactions, and electronic properties affect catalyst performance could potentially be applied to other zeolite types, including BEA and silicoaluminophosphates, for optimizing PDH catalysts.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topology zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: Zinc introduction by aqueous ion exchange followed by platinum impregnation generally produces better catalysts than simultaneous impregnation of both metals. Ion exchange reduces zinc loss and pore blocking during catalyst activation and propane conversion.

2. Composition: The optimal catalyst contains 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn. The Si/Al ratio is crucial, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26) yielding the best results.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered ring zeolites, particularly Beta (BEA) and mordenite, show the highest and most stable conversion levels. The spacious pore structure of Beta allows for better dispersion of metal species and reduced coking.

4. Zinc species distribution: Slightly over-exchanged zeolites perform better than strongly over-exchanged or impregnated ones. This suggests that a balance of different zinc species (e.g., Zn2+, ZnO, Zn(OH)+) is crucial for catalyst performance.

The best-performing catalyst was 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, which achieved stable conversion close to thermodynamic equilibrium (29% at 555°C) with >90% propene selectivity for at least 63 hours. This performance is attributed to the optimal combination of preparation method, composition, zeolite topology, and Si/Al ratio.

Factors contributing to catalyst deactivation include volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase, and coking. These issues were mitigated by using the optimal preparation methods and compositions mentioned above.

The study does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing instead on aluminosilicate zeolites with various topologies.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation methods: Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation results in higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation, leading to better catalyst performance and stability.

2. Zeolite composition: Dealumination of Beta zeolites creates silanol nests, which act as efficient anchor sites for metal species, improving their dispersion and stabilization. Si-Beta zeolites, free of Bronsted acid sites, suppress side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits, enhancing propylene selectivity.

3. Metal dispersion and particle size: Silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of smaller metal nanoparticles (e.g., 3 nm ZnO), while Al-Beta supports tend to form larger nanoparticles (e.g., 7 nm ZnO). Smaller particles generally lead to better catalytic performance.

4. Metal loading and combinations: Proper metal loading and combinations can significantly enhance catalyst performance. For example, Zn/Si-Beta catalysts show superior propane conversion (55%) and propylene selectivity (90%) compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. PtSn-Beta catalysts exhibit even higher propylene selectivity (99%) and excellent stability over extended periods (250 hours at 500°C).

5. Zeolite topology: Different zeolite topologies affect metal species distribution and catalytic performance. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites like SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibit superior propylene selectivity compared to aluminosilicate zeolites like ZSM-5. PtSn/SAPO-34 shows 70-95% propylene selectivity, while PtSn/ZSM-5 only achieves 40% under identical conditions.

6. Acidity control: Reducing Bronsted acidity or controlling its distribution within the zeolite structure can improve catalyst performance. SAPO-34, with Bronsted acid sites primarily in side pores, demonstrates better coke resistance than ZSM-5, as these sites are less reactive for undesired cracking reactions.

These factors collectively contribute to the enhanced performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, with BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites showing particularly promising results in terms of propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

The study focuses on Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, several key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance in PDH reactions can be identified:

          1. Preparation method: Hydrothermal synthesis was used to incorporate cerium into the ZSM-5 framework, influencing the zeolite's morphology and textural properties.

          2. Composition: The optimal cerium content was found to be 0.76 wt%, resulting in the highest reaction activity and stability.

          3. Metal dispersion: Ce-modification promoted better dispersion of metallic particles (Pt and Sn) on the support.

          4. Acidity modification: Cerium substitution decreased the strength of weak acid sites.

          5. Metal-support interaction: Ce-modification enhanced the interaction between Sn species and the support.

          6. Hydrogen adsorption: The Ce-modified material improved the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperatures.

          7. Coke resistance: Cerium facilitated the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst stability.

          These factors collectively contributed to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. While the study doesn't directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, similar principles of metal dispersion, acidity modification, and enhanced metal-support interactions could potentially be applied to other zeolite-based catalysts to improve their performance in PDH reactions.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows superior performance compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5 or amorphous supports. Its unique structure provides weak surface acidity and excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

2. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared using a sequential impregnation method, which allows for better control of metal dispersion and interaction with the support.

3. Composition: The presence of both Pt and Sn in the catalyst is crucial. The optimal ratio of these metals, particularly Sn content (around 1 wt%), contributes to improved catalyst performance, stability, and propylene selectivity.

4. Acidity: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si), are responsible for catalytic activity. The weak acidity of SAPO-34 helps achieve higher propylene selectivity without promoting undesired side reactions.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between Pt, Sn, and the SAPO-34 support plays a significant role in catalyst stability and activity. Sn modifies Pt ensembles, facilitates carbon deposit transfer, and improves overall catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by:
- Providing shape selectivity for propylene formation
- Minimizing unwanted side reactions due to weak acidity
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
- Promoting the desired dehydrogenation pathway through optimal metal-support interactions
- Improving resistance to coke formation

The unique properties of SAPO-34 as a support, combined with the synergistic effects of Pt and Sn, result in a catalyst system that offers superior performance in PDH reactions compared to other zeolite-based catalysts.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts, particularly Pt/Sn-Si-beta, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: An improved post-synthesis method involving complete dealumination of H-beta zeolite, followed by dry impregnation of Sn species, and finally, dispersion of Pt precursors onto the Sn-Si-beta support.

2. Composition: Incorporation of Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and highly dispersed Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH, promoting propene molecule diffusion while inhibiting side reactions and coke formation.

4. Strong metal-support interactions: The strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework leads to high dispersion of Pt species and improved catalyst stability.

5. Confinement effect: The confinement of Sn in the Si-beta framework, along with strong Pt-Sn interactions, inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

These factors collectively contribute to excellent catalytic performance, with high propene formation rates (2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 550°C and 3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 600°C), high propene selectivity (>99%), and outstanding stability over multiple reaction cycles.

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, it provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite is reported to be superior to other frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions. The unique structure of CHA contributes to improved catalyst performance.

2. Composition:
   - Si/Al ratio: A higher Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolites is beneficial for PDH reactions, decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.
   - In/Al ratio: As the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0, the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation decreases, indicating that In+ species dominate the reaction.
   - Al content: An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates.

3. Preparation method: In-CHA catalysts are prepared by reducing In2O3 located on the external surface of H-CHA zeolite, leading to the formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions.

4. Performance:
   - Propylene selectivity: In-CHA shows better C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - Stability: In-CHA demonstrates better stability than other In-based catalysts.
   - Activation energy: In-CHA has a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol), contributing to its improved performance.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:
1. The unique CHA zeolite structure
2. Optimized Si/Al and In/Al ratios
3. Formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions
4. Low activation energy for dehydrogenation and high activation energy for cracking
5. Minimal coke formation

While the literature does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), it provides insights on MCM-22 zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Preparation method: A novel strategy is presented to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors. This method incorporates Pt into the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22, resulting in isolated Pt atoms and clusters on both the external surface and internal spaces.

2. Zeolite topology: The study focuses on MCM-22 zeolite with MWW topology. This structure allows for the incorporation of Pt species in different locations, including external cups and internal supercages.

3. Catalyst performance: Pt@MCM-22 shows higher activity and significantly better stability compared to conventionally impregnated Pt/MCM-22-imp in propane dehydrogenation.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Size and distribution of Pt species: Subnanometric Pt clusters and single atoms are highly dispersed within the zeolite structure.
2. Confinement effect: Pt species are stabilized by the zeolite framework, particularly in internal cavities.
3. Thermal stability: After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 retains 90% of its initial activity, while Pt/MCM-22-imp loses over 40%.
4. Pt retention: No significant loss of Pt is observed in Pt@MCM-22 after multiple PDH cycles, indicating strong metal-support interactions.

While the study doesn't provide specific information on propylene selectivity, the improved activity and stability of Pt@MCM-22 suggest that careful control of metal species size and distribution within zeolite structures can significantly enhance catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation method: The study uses a two-step post-synthesis method to prepare VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings from 0.5 to 10 wt%.

2. Composition: The V loading amount significantly affects catalyst performance. The 3VSiBeta catalyst (3 wt% V loading) shows optimal performance, with about 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. Zeolite topology: Dealuminated Beta zeolites (SiBeta) with BEA topology are used as the support due to their high surface area, well-crystallized structure, and high thermal stability. These properties make SiBeta an ideal support for attaching transition metal species.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Acidic sites: Catalytic activity shows a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which come from interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support.

2. Isolated VOx species: The 3VSiBeta catalyst, containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, showed optimal performance.

3. Aggregation degree of VOx species: This determines propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both increasing with higher V loading.

4. Stability: The catalyst remains stable after several regeneration cycles, indicating good reusability.

These factors collectively contribute to the improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions using zeolite-based catalysts. The study does not provide specific information about silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite selection: Microporous zeolites with crystalline structure, large surface area, and well-defined pore channels provide an intrinsic confinement effect, making them excellent carriers for metal catalysts.

2. Framework-Sn anchoring: Utilizing framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation leads to the formation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters.

3. Confinement effect: Zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn inhibit coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, resulting in excellent stability in PDH reactions.

4. Metal additives: Adding a second metal, such as Sn to Pt catalysts, enhances performance by providing both geometric effects (preventing Pt active site collision) and electronic effects (electron transfer to Pt atoms).

5. Specific active sites: The formation of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] species and their subsequent reduction to (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15) within the pore walls of BEA crystals contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

6. Joint confinement effect: The combination of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

7. Pt catalysts: Supported Pt catalysts are preferred for PDH processes due to their activity for C-H activation and lower activity for unfavorable C-C cracking.

These factors contribute to maintaining high propane conversion rates (90% of maximum conversion over 250 hours) and excellent propene selectivity (99%) in PDH reactions using Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts.

The literature provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for MFI, MCM-22, and SAPO-34 topologies. However, specific information on BEA topology is limited.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite topology: MFI (ZSM-5) and MCM-22 are commonly used. SAPO-34 (CHA topology) is also mentioned.

2. Composition: Most catalysts contain platinum (Pt) as the active metal, often promoted with tin (Sn), sodium (Na), or potassium (K). Pt loading is typically low (0.4-0.5 wt%).

3. Preparation methods:
   - Innovative approaches to generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms within purely siliceous MCM-22 during zeolite growth.
   - Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations for high metal dispersion.
   - Embedding Pt and Sn within the zeolite structure (e.g., KPtSn@MFI) to maintain atomic dispersion.

4. Metal-support interactions:
   - Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) can be regulated by altering defect amounts in supports.
   - Coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites on γ-Al2O3 serve as anchoring sites for Pt.

5. Bimetallic systems:
   - PtSn catalysts show improved performance and stability.
   - Partial substitution of metal cations with two different kinds of metal ions can produce highly dispersed metal/metal alloys.

6. Performance factors:
   - Atomic dispersion of Pt is crucial for catalyst stability and performance.
   - The interaction between Pt and Sn, particularly when Sn is partially reduced, plays a role in controlling Pt dispersion and exposure.
   - Zeolite structure helps in confining and stabilizing active metal species.
   - Propylene selectivity ranges from 79% to 96%, with MFI-based catalysts generally showing higher selectivity.
   - Conversion rates vary widely, from 15% to 70%.

7. Stability:
   - KPtSn@MFI catalysts demonstrated high catalytic performance maintained over at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.
   - The stability, as indicated by the deactivation rate constant (kd), varies significantly between catalysts.

While these insights provide a general understanding of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, more specific research on BEA topology and a comprehensive comparison of different zeolite types would be needed to fully address the question.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information specifically about BEA topology zeolites or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the performance of other zeolite-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions:

          1. Composition: PtSn supported on zeolite K-L and Pt supported on Na[Fe]ZSM-5 have been reported as highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

          2. Zeolite topology: The structure of zeolite L has been found to affect the stability of Pt/K-L catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

          3. Preparation methods: Replacing framework Al3+ with Fe3+ ions in ZSM-5 zeolites is crucial for anchoring Pt precursors inside the 10-member ring zeolite channels, leading to the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters after reduction.

          4. Improving selectivity: Neutralizing residual acid sites with Cs after Pt reduction has been shown to improve the selectivity of zeolite-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

          5. Key factors: The literature suggests that the following factors contribute to improved catalyst performance:
             - Proper metal support interactions (e.g., PtSn on K-L zeolite)
             - Appropriate zeolite structure and topology
             - Modification of zeolite framework composition (e.g., Fe3+ substitution for Al3+)
             - Control of acid sites (e.g., neutralization with Cs)
             - Formation of small, well-dispersed metal clusters within zeolite channels

          While these insights are valuable, it's important to note that the information provided is limited and does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Treating Beta zeolite with concentrated nitric acid creates T-vacant sites and reduces acidity, which is beneficial for PDH reactions. This modification enhances the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite.

2. Metal loading: Low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) results in highly dispersed CoOx species confined in the created T-sites (silanols).

3. Preparation method: Catalysts are prepared using Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air, leading to the formation of highly active CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH.

4. Reduction treatment: Prereduction of the catalyst under optimum conditions allows for the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles, which are highly active for PDH and shorten the induction period.

5. Acidity control: The very weak acidity of the modified zeolite support contributes to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

6. Confinement of active species: Easily reducible CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta contribute to improved catalytic performance.

7. Regeneration stability: The catalyst shows excellent regeneration stability, maintaining its activity over multiple cycles. Deactivation is primarily caused by carbon deposits rather than cobalt sintering.

These factors collectively result in a highly active and selective catalyst for PDH reactions. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrated propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity over 92% at 600°C, which is superior to other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The catalyst also showed good stability, with propane conversion around 40% and propylene selectivity maintaining at 98% after 6 hours on stream.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Zeolite type and acidity: SUZ-4-supported catalysts showed better performance than ZSM-5-supported catalysts due to higher catalytic activity and stability. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented the impregnation of Pt precursors into the zeolite, while the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed more precursor to enter the zeolite tunnels.

2. Metal distribution: The distribution of Pt particles on the zeolite surface affects catalyst performance. Pt particles on PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition.

3. Metal-support interactions: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 led to lessened interactions between Sn oxides and the support, making it easier for Sn oxides to reduce to the metallic state. This reduction decreased the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

4. Preparation method: Catalysts were prepared by sequentially impregnating the zeolites with platinum, tin, and sodium precursors. The composition of the catalysts (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) plays a crucial role in their performance.

5. Promoters: The addition of Na as a promoter improved both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by influencing the distribution and state of active metal particles, preventing carbon deposition, and modulating the acidity of the catalyst surface. While the literature does not specifically discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions, these principles could likely be applied to understand their performance as well.

The literature provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for ZSM-5 topology:

1. Zeolite topology: Three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 were found to be better catalytic supports than mesoporous materials like SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature.

2. Composition: The addition of promoters, specifically La, to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts resulted in higher propane conversion and propene selectivity. The catalyst is bifunctional, with metal particles and acid sites working collaboratively.

3. Preparation method: Sequential impregnation was used, with La(NO3)3 impregnation followed by calcination at various temperatures, then impregnation with Pt, Sn, and Na precursors.

4. Calcination temperature: The calcination temperature of La significantly affected catalyst performance, with 650°C showing the best activity and stability. Too high calcination temperature (e.g., 700°C) can lead to severe dealumination, weakening interactions between metal species and the carrier.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Appropriate pore geometry (3D microporous structure)
- Suitable promoters (La in this case)
- Optimal calcination temperature (650°C for La)
- Proper metal loading and composition
- Balancing the number of active sites and acid sites
- Strong metal-support interactions
- Preventing dealumination and maintaining catalyst structure

The study doesn't provide specific information on BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH reactions. Further research would be needed to compare these with the ZSM-5 based catalysts described in the literature.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study focuses on SAPO-34 as a support for PtSn-based catalysts.

Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst was prepared using a sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34 powder.

Composition: The catalyst contains both Pt and Sn metals supported on SAPO-34 zeolite. The number and distribution of Si in the SAPO-34 framework influence its structure, acidity, and catalytic properties.

Zeolite topology: SAPO-34 has a chabasite-like structure (CHA topology) with microporous channels, providing excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Shape selectivity: The microporous structure of SAPO-34 provides an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene, enhancing selectivity.

2. Acidity: SAPO-34 and its supported catalysts have weak Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which contribute to the selective conversion of intermediates to propylene and reduce unwanted side reactions.

3. Surface area: SAPO-34 supported catalysts have a larger surface area compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalytic performance.

4. Hydrothermal stability: The Si-based acid sites in SAPO-34 make it more resistant to hydrothermal treatment compared to ZSM-5, which is prone to dealumination.

5. Coke resistance: SAPO-34 supported catalysts form less coke (about 30% less) compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalyst stability.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts, resulting in higher propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefins selectivity (>97%) compared to other zeolite-based catalysts like PtSn/ZSM-5.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Removing lattice Al atoms from the β zeolite framework creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. This process allows for better accommodation and anchoring of metal species, particularly ZnO nanoclusters.

2. Metal loading: The optimal catalyst was found to be 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite. This composition provided a balance between the number of active sites and the prevention of bulk ZnO formation.

3. Zeolite topology: BEA-type β zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites. This structure facilitates better dispersion and stabilization of ZnO nanoclusters.

4. Acidity control: Dealumination reduces the number of strong acid sites in the zeolite, which effectively minimizes side reactions and enhances propylene selectivity.

5. Metal-support interaction: The reaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the dealuminated β zeolite framework leads to the formation of well-dispersed, small ZnO nanoclusters that act as active sites for PDH.

These factors collectively contribute to the high catalytic performance of the optimized catalyst, resulting in a high initial propane conversion of around 53%, superior propylene selectivity of about 93%, and good stability and reusability. The absence of strong acid sites and the presence of well-dispersed ZnO nanoclusters are particularly crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites like Sn-Beta. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Preparation method: A two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of H-Beta and incorporation of Sn species into the framework is used to create Sn-Beta zeolites. This method allows for better control of Sn incorporation and distribution.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) showed the best results in PDH reactions.

3. Acid site distribution: The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (L/B ratio) is crucial. A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH, as Lewis acid sites catalyze dehydrogenation while Brønsted acid sites promote undesired cracking reactions.

4. Single-site Sn structure: The incorporation of isolated Sn atoms into the zeolite framework creates single-site catalysts, which contribute to improved activity and selectivity.

5. Ion exchange: Na+ exchange of Sn-Beta (Na-Sn-Beta) further improved catalytic performance by reducing Brønsted acidity while maintaining Lewis acidity.

These factors lead to improved propylene selectivity (up to 92%), high conversion rates (40% for Na-Sn-Beta-30), and excellent catalyst stability (no detectable deactivation for 72 hours under harsh reaction conditions).

Although the literature does not directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites modified with ZnO for propane conversion:

1. Preparation method: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) allows precise control over ZnO deposition, resulting in highly dispersed ZnO species on zeolites.

2. Composition: ZnO introduction significantly improves catalytic activity. The balance between ZnO species (for dehydrogenation) and Brønsted acid sites (for oligomerization and cyclization) is crucial.

3. Zeolite topology: Y zeolite shows higher selectivity to propylene, while ZSM-5 achieves high selectivities to aromatics, due to differences in pore structures and acid site distributions.

4. Key factors for improved performance:
   a. ZnO species promote dehydrogenation reactions
   b. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective than larger ZnO clusters
   c. 1-2 ALD cycles perform better than multiple cycles
   d. Balance between Lewis acid sites (from ZnO) and Brønsted acid sites

5. Catalyst stability: Rapid deactivation occurs due to coke formation, presenting a challenge for long-term use.

These findings, while specific to ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites, provide insights that may be applicable to optimizing other zeolite-based catalysts, including those with BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate compositions, for PDH reactions.

The study primarily focuses on NaX zeolite-based catalysts rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it provides valuable insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Preparation methods: 
   - Pt@NaX: synthesized via in situ crystallization, with Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages.
   - Pt/NaX: prepared via traditional incipient impregnation, with Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior.

2. Composition and topology effects:
   - Location of Pt clusters (exterior vs. interior) significantly affects performance.
   - Zeolite framework interaction influences the electronic properties of Pt clusters.

3. Catalyst performance:
   - Propane conversion: Pt/NaX showed remarkably higher conversion than Pt@NaX at 520°C and 550°C.
   - Propylene selectivity: Pt/NaX maintained a stable 67.0% selectivity, while Pt@NaX only achieved 43.0%.
   - Turnover frequency (TOF): Pt/NaX demonstrated a 1100% enhancement compared to Pt@NaX.

4. Catalyst stability:
   - Pt/NaX exhibited higher stability with less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%).

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. Location of Pt clusters: Exterior placement (Pt/NaX) led to better activity and selectivity.
2. Electronic properties: The d-band center of Pt clusters confined in zeolite shifted to a lower value, affecting propane activation.
3. Zeolite framework effect: The surrounding framework in Pt@NaX passivated the Pt clusters, reducing their activity.
4. Product desorption: Easier propylene desorption from Pt/NaX contributed to higher selectivity.

While this study focuses on NaX zeolites, the principles of how preparation methods, metal-zeolite interactions, and electronic properties affect catalyst performance could potentially be applied to other zeolite types, including BEA and silicoaluminophosphates, for optimizing PDH catalysts.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topology zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: Zinc introduction by aqueous ion exchange followed by platinum impregnation generally produces better catalysts than simultaneous impregnation of both metals. Ion exchange reduces zinc loss and pore blocking during catalyst activation and propane conversion.

2. Composition: The optimal catalyst contains 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn. The Si/Al ratio is crucial, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26) yielding the best results.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered ring zeolites, particularly Beta (BEA) and mordenite, show the highest and most stable conversion levels. The spacious pore structure of Beta allows for better dispersion of metal species and reduced coking.

4. Zinc species distribution: Slightly over-exchanged zeolites perform better than strongly over-exchanged or impregnated ones. This suggests that a balance of different zinc species (e.g., Zn2+, ZnO, Zn(OH)+) is crucial for catalyst performance.

The best-performing catalyst was 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, which achieved stable conversion close to thermodynamic equilibrium (29% at 555°C) with >90% propene selectivity for at least 63 hours. This performance is attributed to the optimal combination of preparation method, composition, zeolite topology, and Si/Al ratio.

Factors contributing to catalyst deactivation include volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase, and coking. These issues were mitigated by using the optimal preparation methods and compositions mentioned above.

The study does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing instead on aluminosilicate zeolites with various topologies.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation methods: Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation results in higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation, leading to better catalyst performance and stability.

2. Zeolite composition: Dealumination of Beta zeolites creates silanol nests, which act as efficient anchor sites for metal species, improving their dispersion and stabilization. Si-Beta zeolites, free of Bronsted acid sites, suppress side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits, enhancing propylene selectivity.

3. Metal dispersion and particle size: Silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of smaller metal nanoparticles (e.g., 3 nm ZnO), while Al-Beta supports tend to form larger nanoparticles (e.g., 7 nm ZnO). Smaller particles generally lead to better catalytic performance.

4. Metal loading and combinations: Proper metal loading and combinations can significantly enhance catalyst performance. For example, Zn/Si-Beta catalysts show superior propane conversion (55%) and propylene selectivity (90%) compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. PtSn-Beta catalysts exhibit even higher propylene selectivity (99%) and excellent stability over extended periods (250 hours at 500°C).

5. Zeolite topology: Different zeolite topologies affect metal species distribution and catalytic performance. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites like SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibit superior propylene selectivity compared to aluminosilicate zeolites like ZSM-5. PtSn/SAPO-34 shows 70-95% propylene selectivity, while PtSn/ZSM-5 only achieves 40% under identical conditions.

6. Acidity control: Reducing Bronsted acidity or controlling its distribution within the zeolite structure can improve catalyst performance. SAPO-34, with Bronsted acid sites primarily in side pores, demonstrates better coke resistance than ZSM-5, as these sites are less reactive for undesired cracking reactions.

These factors collectively contribute to the enhanced performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, with BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites showing particularly promising results in terms of propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

The study focuses on Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, several key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance in PDH reactions can be identified:

          1. Preparation method: Hydrothermal synthesis was used to incorporate cerium into the ZSM-5 framework, influencing the zeolite's morphology and textural properties.

          2. Composition: The optimal cerium content was found to be 0.76 wt%, resulting in the highest reaction activity and stability.

          3. Metal dispersion: Ce-modification promoted better dispersion of metallic particles (Pt and Sn) on the support.

          4. Acidity modification: Cerium substitution decreased the strength of weak acid sites.

          5. Metal-support interaction: Ce-modification enhanced the interaction between Sn species and the support.

          6. Hydrogen adsorption: The Ce-modified material improved the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperatures.

          7. Coke resistance: Cerium facilitated the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst stability.

          These factors collectively contributed to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. While the study doesn't directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, similar principles of metal dispersion, acidity modification, and enhanced metal-support interactions could potentially be applied to other zeolite-based catalysts to improve their performance in PDH reactions.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows superior performance compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5 or amorphous supports. Its unique structure provides weak surface acidity and excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

2. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared using a sequential impregnation method, which allows for better control of metal dispersion and interaction with the support.

3. Composition: The presence of both Pt and Sn in the catalyst is crucial. The optimal ratio of these metals, particularly Sn content (around 1 wt%), contributes to improved catalyst performance, stability, and propylene selectivity.

4. Acidity: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si), are responsible for catalytic activity. The weak acidity of SAPO-34 helps achieve higher propylene selectivity without promoting undesired side reactions.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between Pt, Sn, and the SAPO-34 support plays a significant role in catalyst stability and activity. Sn modifies Pt ensembles, facilitates carbon deposit transfer, and improves overall catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by:
- Providing shape selectivity for propylene formation
- Minimizing unwanted side reactions due to weak acidity
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
- Promoting the desired dehydrogenation pathway through optimal metal-support interactions
- Improving resistance to coke formation

The unique properties of SAPO-34 as a support, combined with the synergistic effects of Pt and Sn, result in a catalyst system that offers superior performance in PDH reactions compared to other zeolite-based catalysts.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts, particularly Pt/Sn-Si-beta, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: An improved post-synthesis method involving complete dealumination of H-beta zeolite, followed by dry impregnation of Sn species, and finally, dispersion of Pt precursors onto the Sn-Si-beta support.

2. Composition: Incorporation of Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and highly dispersed Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH, promoting propene molecule diffusion while inhibiting side reactions and coke formation.

4. Strong metal-support interactions: The strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework leads to high dispersion of Pt species and improved catalyst stability.

5. Confinement effect: The confinement of Sn in the Si-beta framework, along with strong Pt-Sn interactions, inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

These factors collectively contribute to excellent catalytic performance, with high propene formation rates (2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 550°C and 3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 600°C), high propene selectivity (>99%), and outstanding stability over multiple reaction cycles.

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, it provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite is reported to be superior to other frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions. The unique structure of CHA contributes to improved catalyst performance.

2. Composition:
   - Si/Al ratio: A higher Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolites is beneficial for PDH reactions, decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.
   - In/Al ratio: As the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0, the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation decreases, indicating that In+ species dominate the reaction.
   - Al content: An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates.

3. Preparation method: In-CHA catalysts are prepared by reducing In2O3 located on the external surface of H-CHA zeolite, leading to the formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions.

4. Performance:
   - Propylene selectivity: In-CHA shows better C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - Stability: In-CHA demonstrates better stability than other In-based catalysts.
   - Activation energy: In-CHA has a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol), contributing to its improved performance.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:
1. The unique CHA zeolite structure
2. Optimized Si/Al and In/Al ratios
3. Formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions
4. Low activation energy for dehydrogenation and high activation energy for cracking
5. Minimal coke formation

While the literature does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), it provides insights on MCM-22 zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Preparation method: A novel strategy is presented to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors. This method incorporates Pt into the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22, resulting in isolated Pt atoms and clusters on both the external surface and internal spaces.

2. Zeolite topology: The study focuses on MCM-22 zeolite with MWW topology. This structure allows for the incorporation of Pt species in different locations, including external cups and internal supercages.

3. Catalyst performance: Pt@MCM-22 shows higher activity and significantly better stability compared to conventionally impregnated Pt/MCM-22-imp in propane dehydrogenation.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Size and distribution of Pt species: Subnanometric Pt clusters and single atoms are highly dispersed within the zeolite structure.
2. Confinement effect: Pt species are stabilized by the zeolite framework, particularly in internal cavities.
3. Thermal stability: After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 retains 90% of its initial activity, while Pt/MCM-22-imp loses over 40%.
4. Pt retention: No significant loss of Pt is observed in Pt@MCM-22 after multiple PDH cycles, indicating strong metal-support interactions.

While the study doesn't provide specific information on propylene selectivity, the improved activity and stability of Pt@MCM-22 suggest that careful control of metal species size and distribution within zeolite structures can significantly enhance catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation method: The study uses a two-step post-synthesis method to prepare VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings from 0.5 to 10 wt%.

2. Composition: The V loading amount significantly affects catalyst performance. The 3VSiBeta catalyst (3 wt% V loading) shows optimal performance, with about 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. Zeolite topology: Dealuminated Beta zeolites (SiBeta) with BEA topology are used as the support due to their high surface area, well-crystallized structure, and high thermal stability. These properties make SiBeta an ideal support for attaching transition metal species.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Acidic sites: Catalytic activity shows a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which come from interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support.

2. Isolated VOx species: The 3VSiBeta catalyst, containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, showed optimal performance.

3. Aggregation degree of VOx species: This determines propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both increasing with higher V loading.

4. Stability: The catalyst remains stable after several regeneration cycles, indicating good reusability.

These factors collectively contribute to the improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions using zeolite-based catalysts. The study does not provide specific information about silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite selection: Microporous zeolites with crystalline structure, large surface area, and well-defined pore channels provide an intrinsic confinement effect, making them excellent carriers for metal catalysts.

2. Framework-Sn anchoring: Utilizing framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation leads to the formation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters.

3. Confinement effect: Zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn inhibit coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, resulting in excellent stability in PDH reactions.

4. Metal additives: Adding a second metal, such as Sn to Pt catalysts, enhances performance by providing both geometric effects (preventing Pt active site collision) and electronic effects (electron transfer to Pt atoms).

5. Specific active sites: The formation of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] species and their subsequent reduction to (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15) within the pore walls of BEA crystals contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

6. Joint confinement effect: The combination of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

7. Pt catalysts: Supported Pt catalysts are preferred for PDH processes due to their activity for C-H activation and lower activity for unfavorable C-C cracking.

These factors contribute to maintaining high propane conversion rates (90% of maximum conversion over 250 hours) and excellent propene selectivity (99%) in PDH reactions using Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts.

The literature provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for MFI, MCM-22, and SAPO-34 topologies. However, specific information on BEA topology is limited.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite topology: MFI (ZSM-5) and MCM-22 are commonly used. SAPO-34 (CHA topology) is also mentioned.

2. Composition: Most catalysts contain platinum (Pt) as the active metal, often promoted with tin (Sn), sodium (Na), or potassium (K). Pt loading is typically low (0.4-0.5 wt%).

3. Preparation methods:
   - Innovative approaches to generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms within purely siliceous MCM-22 during zeolite growth.
   - Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations for high metal dispersion.
   - Embedding Pt and Sn within the zeolite structure (e.g., KPtSn@MFI) to maintain atomic dispersion.

4. Metal-support interactions:
   - Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) can be regulated by altering defect amounts in supports.
   - Coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites on γ-Al2O3 serve as anchoring sites for Pt.

5. Bimetallic systems:
   - PtSn catalysts show improved performance and stability.
   - Partial substitution of metal cations with two different kinds of metal ions can produce highly dispersed metal/metal alloys.

6. Performance factors:
   - Atomic dispersion of Pt is crucial for catalyst stability and performance.
   - The interaction between Pt and Sn, particularly when Sn is partially reduced, plays a role in controlling Pt dispersion and exposure.
   - Zeolite structure helps in confining and stabilizing active metal species.
   - Propylene selectivity ranges from 79% to 96%, with MFI-based catalysts generally showing higher selectivity.
   - Conversion rates vary widely, from 15% to 70%.

7. Stability:
   - KPtSn@MFI catalysts demonstrated high catalytic performance maintained over at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.
   - The stability, as indicated by the deactivation rate constant (kd), varies significantly between catalysts.

While these insights provide a general understanding of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, more specific research on BEA topology and a comprehensive comparison of different zeolite types would be needed to fully address the question.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information specifically about BEA topology zeolites or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does offer some insights into the performance of other zeolite-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions:

          1. Composition: PtSn supported on zeolite K-L and Pt supported on Na[Fe]ZSM-5 have been reported as highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.

          2. Zeolite topology: The structure of zeolite L has been found to affect the stability of Pt/K-L catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

          3. Preparation methods: Replacing framework Al3+ with Fe3+ ions in ZSM-5 zeolites is crucial for anchoring Pt precursors inside the 10-member ring zeolite channels, leading to the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters after reduction.

          4. Improving selectivity: Neutralizing residual acid sites with Cs after Pt reduction has been shown to improve the selectivity of zeolite-based catalysts in dehydrogenation reactions.

          5. Key factors: The literature suggests that the following factors contribute to improved catalyst performance:
             - Proper metal support interactions (e.g., PtSn on K-L zeolite)
             - Appropriate zeolite structure and topology
             - Modification of zeolite framework composition (e.g., Fe3+ substitution for Al3+)
             - Control of acid sites (e.g., neutralization with Cs)
             - Formation of small, well-dispersed metal clusters within zeolite channels

          While these insights are valuable, it's important to note that the information provided is limited and does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Treating Beta zeolite with concentrated nitric acid creates T-vacant sites and reduces acidity, which is beneficial for PDH reactions. This modification enhances the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite.

2. Metal loading: Low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) results in highly dispersed CoOx species confined in the created T-sites (silanols).

3. Preparation method: Catalysts are prepared using Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air, leading to the formation of highly active CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH.

4. Reduction treatment: Prereduction of the catalyst under optimum conditions allows for the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles, which are highly active for PDH and shorten the induction period.

5. Acidity control: The very weak acidity of the modified zeolite support contributes to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

6. Confinement of active species: Easily reducible CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta contribute to improved catalytic performance.

7. Regeneration stability: The catalyst shows excellent regeneration stability, maintaining its activity over multiple cycles. Deactivation is primarily caused by carbon deposits rather than cobalt sintering.

These factors collectively result in a highly active and selective catalyst for PDH reactions. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrated propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity over 92% at 600°C, which is superior to other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The catalyst also showed good stability, with propane conversion around 40% and propylene selectivity maintaining at 98% after 6 hours on stream.

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Zeolite type and acidity: SUZ-4-supported catalysts showed better performance than ZSM-5-supported catalysts due to higher catalytic activity and stability. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented the impregnation of Pt precursors into the zeolite, while the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed more precursor to enter the zeolite tunnels.

2. Metal distribution: The distribution of Pt particles on the zeolite surface affects catalyst performance. Pt particles on PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition.

3. Metal-support interactions: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 led to lessened interactions between Sn oxides and the support, making it easier for Sn oxides to reduce to the metallic state. This reduction decreased the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

4. Preparation method: Catalysts were prepared by sequentially impregnating the zeolites with platinum, tin, and sodium precursors. The composition of the catalysts (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) plays a crucial role in their performance.

5. Promoters: The addition of Na as a promoter improved both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by influencing the distribution and state of active metal particles, preventing carbon deposition, and modulating the acidity of the catalyst surface. While the literature does not specifically discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions, these principles could likely be applied to understand their performance as well.
