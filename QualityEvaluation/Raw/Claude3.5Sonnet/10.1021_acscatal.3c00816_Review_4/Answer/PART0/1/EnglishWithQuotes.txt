Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:\n\n1. Dealumination: Treating Beta zeolite with concentrated nitric acid creates T-vacant sites and reduces acidity, which is beneficial for PDH reactions. This modification enhances the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite.\n\n2. Metal loading: Low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) results in highly dispersed CoOx species confined in the created T-sites (silanols).\n\n3. Preparation method: Catalysts are prepared using Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air, leading to the formation of highly active CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH.\n\n4. Reduction treatment: Prereduction of the catalyst under optimum conditions allows for the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles, which are highly active for PDH and shorten the induction period.\n\n5. Acidity control: The very weak acidity of the modified zeolite support contributes to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.\n\n6. Confinement of active species: Easily reducible CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta contribute to improved catalytic performance.\n\n7. Regeneration stability: The catalyst shows excellent regeneration stability, maintaining its activity over multiple cycles. Deactivation is primarily caused by carbon deposits rather than cobalt sintering.\n\nThese factors collectively result in a highly active and selective catalyst for PDH reactions. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrated propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity over 92% at 600°C, which is superior to other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The catalyst also showed good stability, with propane conversion around 40% and propylene selectivity maintaining at 98% after 6 hours on stream.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2019.12.037"},
{"Quotes": "[1] \"SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability.\"\n\n[2] \"In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition.\"\n\n[3] \"This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite.

Zeolite type and acidity: SUZ-4-supported catalysts showed better performance than ZSM-5-supported catalysts due to higher catalytic activity and stability. The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented the impregnation of Pt precursors into the zeolite, while the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed more precursor to enter the zeolite tunnels.\n\n2. Metal distribution: The distribution of Pt particles on the zeolite surface affects catalyst performance. Pt particles on PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition.\n\n3. Metal-support interactions: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 led to lessened interactions between Sn oxides and the support, making it easier for Sn oxides to reduce to the metallic state. This reduction decreased the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.\n\n4. Preparation method: Catalysts were prepared by sequentially impregnating the zeolites with platinum, tin, and sodium precursors. The composition of the catalysts (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) plays a crucial role in their performance.\n\n5. Promoters: The addition of Na as a promoter improved both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.\n\nThese factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by influencing the distribution and state of active metal particles, preventing carbon deposition, and modulating the acidity of the catalyst surface. While the literature does not specifically discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions, these principles could likely be applied to understand their performance as well.", "Doi": "10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62750-5"},
