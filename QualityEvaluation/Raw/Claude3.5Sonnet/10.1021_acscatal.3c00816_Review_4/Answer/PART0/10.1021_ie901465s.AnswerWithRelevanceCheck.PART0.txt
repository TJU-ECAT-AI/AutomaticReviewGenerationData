          [1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts of different metallic contents were prepared by sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34"

[4] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

[5] "It is impressive that the Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metallic sites to support, and in this way improves catalyst stability."

[6] "It is observed that the Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity. With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined"

[7] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."

[8] "The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support. It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support. Moreover, Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."

          The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows superior performance compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5 or amorphous supports. Its unique structure provides weak surface acidity and excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

2. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared using a sequential impregnation method, which allows for better control of metal dispersion and interaction with the support.

3. Composition: The presence of both Pt and Sn in the catalyst is crucial. The optimal ratio of these metals, particularly Sn content (around 1 wt%), contributes to improved catalyst performance, stability, and propylene selectivity.

4. Acidity: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si), are responsible for catalytic activity. The weak acidity of SAPO-34 helps achieve higher propylene selectivity without promoting undesired side reactions.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between Pt, Sn, and the SAPO-34 support plays a significant role in catalyst stability and activity. Sn modifies Pt ensembles, facilitates carbon deposit transfer, and improves overall catalyst performance.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by:
- Providing shape selectivity for propylene formation
- Minimizing unwanted side reactions due to weak acidity
- Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
- Promoting the desired dehydrogenation pathway through optimal metal-support interactions
- Improving resistance to coke formation

The unique properties of SAPO-34 as a support, combined with the synergistic effects of Pt and Sn, result in a catalyst system that offers superior performance in PDH reactions compared to other zeolite-based catalysts.

          沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到与制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构相关的几个因素的影响：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34作为硅铝磷酸盐沸石，相比其他沸石如ZSM-5或无定形载体表现出更优异的性能。其独特的结构提供了弱表面酸性和对丙烯的优秀形状选择性。

2. 制备方法：双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂采用序贯浸渍法制备，这种方法可以更好地控制金属分散度和与载体的相互作用。

3. 组成：催化剂中同时存在Pt和Sn至关重要。这些金属的最佳比例，特别是Sn含量（约1 wt%），有助于提高催化剂性能、稳定性和丙烯选择性。

4. 酸性：SAPO-34中的Brønsted酸性位点基于两种不同的羟基（Al和Si的OH桥），负责催化活性。SAPO-34的弱酸性有助于实现更高的丙烯选择性，同时不会促进不需要的副反应。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：Pt、Sn与SAPO-34载体之间的相互作用在催化剂稳定性和活性方面起着重要作用。Sn修饰Pt集合体，促进碳沉积物转移，提高整体催化剂性能。

这些因素通过以下方式提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性：
- 为丙烯形成提供形状选择性
- 由于弱酸性而最小化不需要的副反应
- 增强金属分散度和稳定性
- 通过最佳的金属-载体相互作用促进所需的脱氢途径
- 提高抗积碳能力

SAPO-34作为载体的独特性质，结合Pt和Sn的协同作用，形成了一个在PDH反应中性能优于其他沸石基催化剂的催化体系。
