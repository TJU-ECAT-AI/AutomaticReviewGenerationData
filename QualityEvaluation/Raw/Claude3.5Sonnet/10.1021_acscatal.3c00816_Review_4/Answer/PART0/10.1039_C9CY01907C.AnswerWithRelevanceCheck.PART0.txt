          [1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[2] "The Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by dealumination of H-beta and then the introduction of Sn species via dry impregnation."

[3] "As illustrated in Scheme 1, firstly, H-beta zeolite was completely dealuminated and then mixed with the calculated amount of Sn precursors. After calcination, the Sn precursors decomposed and reacted with the silanols produced by dealumination of the zeolite. Finally, Pt precursors were dispersed onto the Sn-Si-beta support by strong interaction between Pt and Sn after H2 reduction."

[4] "As shown in Fig. 1a, all the samples display similar diffraction patterns with a typical BEA topology, revealing that the dealumination and metal incorporation do not disturb the structure of the zeolite beta framework."

[5] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."

[6] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."

[7] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."

[8] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts, particularly Pt/Sn-Si-beta, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: An improved post-synthesis method involving complete dealumination of H-beta zeolite, followed by dry impregnation of Sn species, and finally, dispersion of Pt precursors onto the Sn-Si-beta support.

2. Composition: Incorporation of Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta), and highly dispersed Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH, promoting propene molecule diffusion while inhibiting side reactions and coke formation.

4. Strong metal-support interactions: The strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework leads to high dispersion of Pt species and improved catalyst stability.

5. Confinement effect: The confinement of Sn in the Si-beta framework, along with strong Pt-Sn interactions, inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

These factors collectively contribute to excellent catalytic performance, with high propene formation rates (2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 550°C and 3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 600°C), high propene selectivity (>99%), and outstanding stability over multiple reaction cycles.

          制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了BEA拓扑结构沸石基催化剂，特别是Pt/Sn-Si-beta，在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。对丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性改善有贡献的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：采用改进的后合成方法，包括H-beta沸石的完全脱铝，随后进行Sn物种的干浸渍，最后将Pt前驱体分散到Sn-Si-beta载体上。

2. 组成：将四面体配位状态的Sn物种掺入脱铝beta（Si-beta）骨架中，同时Pt物种以超小纳米簇的形式高度分散。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：BEA型结构为PDH提供了形状选择性反应空间，促进丙烯分子的扩散，同时抑制副反应和积碳形成。

4. 强金属-载体相互作用：Pt与限制在Si-beta骨架中的Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用导致Pt物种高度分散，提高了催化剂稳定性。

5. 限制效应：Sn在Si-beta骨架中的限制以及强Pt-Sn相互作用抑制了积碳形成和Pt簇的烧结。

这些因素共同促进了优异的催化性能，在550°C下实现了2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹的丙烯生成速率，在600°C下达到3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹，丙烯选择性>99%，并在多个反应周期中表现出卓越的稳定性。
