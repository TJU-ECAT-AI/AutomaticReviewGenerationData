          [1] "We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[4] "After 6 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases to ca. 40%. It is noticeable that its propylene selectivity remains at ca. 98% during the whole reaction, which is hard to realize at such a high propane conversion."

[5] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[6] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[7] "It is notable that the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[8] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."

[9] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

[10] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Treating Beta zeolite with concentrated nitric acid creates T-vacant sites and reduces acidity, which is beneficial for PDH reactions. This modification enhances the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite.

2. Metal loading: Low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) results in highly dispersed CoOx species confined in the created T-sites (silanols).

3. Preparation method: Catalysts are prepared using Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air, leading to the formation of highly active CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH.

4. Reduction treatment: Prereduction of the catalyst under optimum conditions allows for the formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles, which are highly active for PDH and shorten the induction period.

5. Acidity control: The very weak acidity of the modified zeolite support contributes to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

6. Confinement of active species: Easily reducible CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta contribute to improved catalytic performance.

7. Regeneration stability: The catalyst shows excellent regeneration stability, maintaining its activity over multiple cycles. Deactivation is primarily caused by carbon deposits rather than cobalt sintering.

These factors collectively result in a highly active and selective catalyst for PDH reactions. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst demonstrated propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity over 92% at 600°C, which is superior to other reported Co catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts. The catalyst also showed good stability, with propane conversion around 40% and propylene selectivity maintaining at 98% after 6 hours on stream.

          制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对BEA拓扑沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：用浓硝酸处理Beta沸石创造了T空位并降低酸度，这对PDH反应有利。这种修饰改善了沸石的结构和酸性质。

2. 金属负载：在脱铝的Beta沸石(SiBeta)上使用低钴负载量(0.5 wt%)可得到高度分散的CoOx物种，这些物种被限制在所创造的T位点(硅醇)中。

3. 制备方法：使用Dzwigaj方法制备催化剂，然后在空气中高温煅烧，形成高活性的CoSiBeta催化剂用于PDH。

4. 还原处理：在最佳条件下对催化剂进行预还原，可形成超小尺寸的Co颗粒，这些颗粒对PDH具有高活性，并缩短了诱导期。

5. 酸度控制：改性沸石载体的极弱酸度通过促进丙烯脱附，有助于获得优异的丙烯选择性。

6. 活性物种的限制：限制在SiBeta硅醇中的易还原CoOx物种有助于提高催化性能。

7. 再生稳定性：催化剂显示出优异的再生稳定性，在多个循环中保持其活性。失活主要是由碳沉积引起的，而不是钴的烧结。

这些因素共同作用，产生了一种对PDH反应具有高活性和高选择性的催化剂。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂在600°C下表现出高达72%的丙烷转化率和超过92%的丙烯选择性，优于其他报道的Co催化剂，可与工业催化剂相媲美。该催化剂还表现出良好的稳定性，在反应6小时后，丙烷转化率保持在约40%，丙烯选择性维持在98%。
