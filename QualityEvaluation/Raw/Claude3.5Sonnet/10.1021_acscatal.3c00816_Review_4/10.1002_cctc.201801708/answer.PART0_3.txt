[1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."

[2] "β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."

[4] "Moreover, the left vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species, attributable to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups."

[5] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[6] "Additionally, dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. This process allows for better accommodation and anchoring of metal species, such as zinc.

2. Metal loading: The optimal catalyst was found to be 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite, which exhibited high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

3. Zeolite topology: BEA-type β zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites. This structure contributes to better catalytic performance.

4. Acidity control: Dealumination allows for easy adjustment of the zeolite's acidity. The absence of strong acid sites in dealuminated β zeolite reduces side reactions, leading to higher propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

5. Formation of small ZnO nanoclusters: The dealuminated β zeolite supports the formation of small ZnO nanoclusters, which are highly active in PDH reactions.

6. Silanol groups: These groups play a crucial role in interacting with metal species, leading to well-dispersed and anchored active sites.

By optimizing these factors, the catalyst achieved high initial propane conversion (around 53%), superior propylene selectivity (about 93%), high stability, and satisfactory reusability. The study demonstrates that dealuminated β zeolite is an excellent support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters, which are highly effective for PDH reactions.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：从沸石骨架中去除铝原子会创造与硅羟基相关的空缺T原子位点。这个过程允许更好地容纳和锚定金属物种，如锌。

2. 金属负载：最佳催化剂被发现是在脱铝β沸石上负载10wt%的锌，表现出高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：BEA型β沸石具有三维结构，有12元环通道系统，孔径比ZSM-5沸石更大。这种结构有助于提高催化性能。

4. 酸度控制：脱铝允许轻松调节沸石的酸度。脱铝β沸石中强酸位的缺失减少了副反应，导致更高的丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

5. 小型ZnO纳米簇的形成：脱铝β沸石支持小型ZnO纳米簇的形成，这些纳米簇在PDH反应中高度活跃。

6. 硅羟基：这些基团在与金属物种相互作用中起关键作用，导致活性位点的良好分散和锚定。

通过优化这些因素，催化剂实现了高初始丙烷转化率（约53%），优异的丙烯选择性（约93%），高稳定性和令人满意的可重复使用性。该研究表明，脱铝β沸石是获得良好分散的小型ZnO纳米簇的优秀载体，这些纳米簇对PDH反应高度有效。
