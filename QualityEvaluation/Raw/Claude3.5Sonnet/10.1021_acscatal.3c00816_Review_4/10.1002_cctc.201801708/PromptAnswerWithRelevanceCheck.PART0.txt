[1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."

[2] "β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."

[4] "It is revealed that the SN ZnO supported on dealuminated β exhibited high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "Afterward, 1g of DeAlβ zeolite was added into the zinc acetate solution with desired Zn content and stirred at room temperature for 12h. The mixture was dried at 80C overnight, and subsequently calcined in air at 600C for 6h with a heating rate of 10Cmin1."

[6] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[7] "After loading with Zn species, ZnO particles can be well accommodated into vacant T-atom sites in the DeAlβ framework, and thus, producing into a large amount of SN ZnO with the catalytic capacity for PDH in Znβ catalyst."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework. This process creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, which serve as ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters (SN ZnO).

2. Zinc loading method: The optimal catalyst was prepared by adding dealuminated β zeolite (DeAlβ) into zinc acetate solution, followed by drying and calcination. This method allows ZnO particles to be well accommodated into vacant T-atom sites in the DeAlβ framework.

3. Zinc content: The optimal catalyst contained 10 wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite.

4. Zeolite topology: β zeolites with BEA-type structure feature three-dimensional 12-ring channel systems and have larger pores than ZSM-5 zeolites, which contributes to better catalytic performance.

5. Formation of small ZnO nanoclusters: The dealumination process and subsequent Zn loading method promote the formation of a large amount of SN ZnO with high catalytic capacity for PDH.

These factors collectively contribute to the high catalytic performance of the Zn/DeAlβ catalyst, resulting in high propane conversion (around 53%), superior propylene selectivity (about 93%), high stability, and satisfactory reusability in PDH reactions. The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite also helps reduce side reactions, further improving propylene selectivity.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：通过去除框架中的晶格铝原子，可以容易地调节BEA型β沸石的酸度。这个过程创造了与硅羟基相关的空缺T原子位点，为获得分散良好的小型氧化锌纳米簇(SN ZnO)提供了理想的支撑。

2. 锌负载方法：最佳催化剂是通过将脱铝β沸石(DeAlβ)加入醋酸锌溶液中，然后干燥和煅烧制备而成。这种方法使氧化锌颗粒能够很好地容纳在DeAlβ框架的空缺T原子位点中。

3. 锌含量：最佳催化剂含有10 wt%的锌负载在脱铝β沸石上。

4. 沸石拓扑结构：具有BEA型结构的β沸石具有三维12元环通道系统，孔径比ZSM-5沸石更大，这有助于提高催化性能。

5. 小型氧化锌纳米簇的形成：脱铝过程和随后的锌负载方法促进了大量具有高PDH催化能力的SN ZnO的形成。

这些因素共同促进了Zn/DeAlβ催化剂的高催化性能，在PDH反应中表现出高丙烷转化率（约53%）、优异的丙烯选择性（约93%）、高稳定性和良好的可重复使用性。脱铝β沸石中强酸位的缺失也有助于减少副反应，进一步提高丙烯选择性。

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. This process adjusts the acidity of the zeolite and provides anchoring points for metal species.

2. Metal loading: Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite show high catalytic performance. The optimal catalyst contains 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite.

3. Zeolite topology: BEA-type β zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites. This structure facilitates the dispersion and stabilization of metal species.

4. Acidity control: Dealumination removes strong acid sites, reducing side reactions and enhancing propylene selectivity.

5. Metal-support interaction: The reaction between metal species and silanol groups in the vacant T-atom sites leads to well-dispersed and stable active sites.

These factors contribute to high propane conversion (around 53%), superior propylene selectivity (about 93%), and improved catalyst stability and reusability. The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite reduces side reactions, further enhancing propylene selectivity.

While the literature does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, the principles of metal dispersion, acidity control, and pore structure optimization likely apply to other zeolite types as well.
