[1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."

[2] "β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."

[4] "It is revealed that the SN ZnO supported on dealuminated β exhibited high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for PDH."

[5] "Additionally, dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability."

[6] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:

1. Dealumination: Removing lattice Al atoms from the BEA-type β zeolite framework allows for easy adjustment of acidity and creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. This process helps in obtaining well-dispersed small ZnO nanoclusters (SN ZnO) supported on the zeolite.

2. Support structure: β zeolites with BEA topology feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites. This structure provides a suitable environment for dispersing and anchoring ZnO nanoclusters.

3. Zinc loading: The optimal catalyst was found to have 10 wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite, which exhibited high catalytic performance.

4. Absence of strong acid sites: Dealumination removes strong acid sites, which helps to suppress side reactions and improve propylene selectivity.

5. Formation of small ZnO nanoclusters: The interaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the dealuminated β zeolite framework leads to the formation of highly dispersed SN ZnO, which act as catalytically active sites for PDH.

These factors collectively contribute to the high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. The optimal catalyst showed a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93%, along with high stability and satisfactory reusability.

While the literature does not specifically discuss silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, the principles of dealumination, control of acidity, and formation of well-dispersed active metal species could potentially be applied to other zeolite types to improve their performance in PDH reactions.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响，特别是对BEA拓扑结构的沸石而言。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：从BEA型β沸石骨架中去除晶格Al原子，可以轻松调节酸度，并创造与硅醇基相关的空T原子位点。这个过程有助于在沸石上获得分散良好的小型ZnO纳米簇(SN ZnO)。

2. 载体结构：具有BEA拓扑结构的β沸石具有三维结构，12元环通道系统，孔径比ZSM-5沸石更大。这种结构为分散和锚定ZnO纳米簇提供了合适的环境。

3. 锌负载量：最佳催化剂被发现是在脱铝β沸石上负载10 wt%的Zn，表现出高催化性能。

4. 缺乏强酸位：脱铝去除了强酸位，有助于抑制副反应并提高丙烯选择性。

5. 小型ZnO纳米簇的形成：Zn物种与脱铝β沸石骨架中的硅醇基之间的相互作用导致高度分散的SN ZnO的形成，这些SN ZnO作为PDH的催化活性位点。

这些因素共同促进了催化剂的高催化活性、丙烯选择性和稳定性。最佳催化剂显示出约53%的高初始丙烷转化率和约93%的优异丙烯选择性，同时具有高稳定性和令人满意的可重复使用性。

虽然文献中没有具体讨论硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但脱铝、酸度控制和形成良好分散的活性金属物种的原理可能适用于其他类型的沸石，以提高它们在PDH反应中的性能。
