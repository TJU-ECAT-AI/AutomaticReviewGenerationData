[1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."

[2] "β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."

[4] "The left vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species, attributable to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups."

[5] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[6] "The dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Thus, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 catalyst can be greatly enhanced."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Removing aluminum atoms from the zeolite framework creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. This process adjusts the acidity of the zeolite and provides anchoring points for metal species.

2. Metal loading: Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite show high catalytic performance. The optimal catalyst contains 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite.

3. Zeolite topology: BEA-type β zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites. This structure facilitates the dispersion and stabilization of metal species.

4. Acidity control: Dealumination removes strong acid sites, reducing side reactions and enhancing propylene selectivity.

5. Metal-support interaction: The reaction between metal species and silanol groups in the vacant T-atom sites leads to well-dispersed and stable active sites.

These factors contribute to high propane conversion (around 53%), superior propylene selectivity (about 93%), and improved catalyst stability and reusability. The absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite reduces side reactions, further enhancing propylene selectivity.

While the literature does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, the principles of metal dispersion, acidity control, and pore structure optimization likely apply to other zeolite types as well.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，尤其是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：从沸石骨架中去除铝原子，创造与硅羟基相关的空缺T原子位点。这个过程调节了沸石的酸性，并为金属物种提供了锚定点。

2. 金属负载：负载在脱铝β沸石上的小型ZnO纳米簇显示出高催化性能。最佳催化剂含有10wt%的锌负载在脱铝β沸石上。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：BEA型β沸石具有三维结构，带有12元环通道系统，孔径比ZSM-5沸石更大。这种结构有利于金属物种的分散和稳定。

4. 酸度控制：脱铝去除了强酸位点，减少了副反应，提高了丙烯选择性。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：金属物种与空缺T原子位点中的硅羟基之间的反应导致了分散良好且稳定的活性位点。

这些因素共同贡献了高丙烷转化率（约53%）、优异的丙烯选择性（约93%）以及改善的催化剂稳定性和可重复使用性。脱铝β沸石中强酸位点的缺失减少了副反应，进一步提高了丙烯选择性。

虽然文献没有特别提到硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但金属分散、酸度控制和孔结构优化的原理可能也适用于其他类型的沸石。
