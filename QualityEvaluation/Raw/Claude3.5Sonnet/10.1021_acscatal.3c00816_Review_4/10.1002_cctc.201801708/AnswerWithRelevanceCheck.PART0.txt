          [1] "Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance."

[2] "β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites."

[3] "The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework."

[4] "The left vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species, attributable to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups."

[5] "As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53% and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93% at a space velocity of 4000cm3gcat1h1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability."

[6] "The dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Thus, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 catalyst can be greatly enhanced."

[7] "After loading with Zn species, ZnO particles can be well accommodated into vacant T-atom sites in the DeAlβ framework, and thus, producing into a large amount of SN ZnO with the catalytic capacity for PDH in Znβ catalyst."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Dealumination: Removing lattice Al atoms from the β zeolite framework creates vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups. This process allows for better accommodation and anchoring of metal species, particularly ZnO nanoclusters.

2. Metal loading: The optimal catalyst was found to be 10wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite. This composition provided a balance between the number of active sites and the prevention of bulk ZnO formation.

3. Zeolite topology: BEA-type β zeolites feature a three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems and larger pores compared to ZSM-5 zeolites. This structure facilitates better dispersion and stabilization of ZnO nanoclusters.

4. Acidity control: Dealumination reduces the number of strong acid sites in the zeolite, which effectively minimizes side reactions and enhances propylene selectivity.

5. Metal-support interaction: The reaction between Zn species and silanol groups in the dealuminated β zeolite framework leads to the formation of well-dispersed, small ZnO nanoclusters that act as active sites for PDH.

These factors collectively contribute to the high catalytic performance of the optimized catalyst, resulting in a high initial propane conversion of around 53%, superior propylene selectivity of about 93%, and good stability and reusability. The absence of strong acid sites and the presence of well-dispersed ZnO nanoclusters are particularly crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity and reducing unwanted side reactions.

          制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石。影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：从β沸石骨架中移除格子铝原子，创造与硅羟基相关的空T原子位点。这个过程允许更好地容纳和锚定金属物种，特别是ZnO纳米簇。

2. 金属负载：最佳催化剂被发现是在脱铝β沸石上负载10wt%的Zn。这种组成在活性位点数量和防止大块ZnO形成之间取得了平衡。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：BEA型β沸石具有三维结构，带有12元环通道系统，孔径比ZSM-5沸石更大。这种结构有利于ZnO纳米簇的更好分散和稳定。

4. 酸度控制：脱铝减少了沸石中强酸位的数量，有效地最小化了副反应，提高了丙烯选择性。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：Zn物种与脱铝β沸石骨架中的硅羟基之间的反应导致形成分散良好的小ZnO纳米簇，这些纳米簇作为PDH的活性位点。

这些因素共同促进了优化催化剂的高催化性能，导致初始丙烷转化率约为53%，优异的丙烯选择性约为93%，以及良好的稳定性和可重复使用性。强酸位的缺失和分散良好的ZnO纳米簇的存在对于实现高丙烯选择性和减少不需要的副反应特别重要。
