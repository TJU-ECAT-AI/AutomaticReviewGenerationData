[1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species"

[3] "Besides, the resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits."

[4] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."

[5] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C"

[6] "Fei et al. reported that PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

[7] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation methods: Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation leads to higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation. This method improves catalyst performance and stability.

2. Zeolite composition: Dealumination of Beta zeolites creates silanol nests, which act as anchor sites for metal species, improving their dispersion and stabilization. Si-Beta zeolites, free of Bronsted acid sites, suppress side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits, leading to better catalyst performance.

3. Metal loading: Proper metal loading and combination can significantly enhance catalyst performance. For example, Zn/Si-Beta catalysts show superior propane conversion (55%) and propylene selectivity (90%) compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. PtSn-Beta catalysts exhibit even higher propylene selectivity (99%) and excellent stability.

4. Zeolite topology: Different zeolite topologies affect metal species distribution and catalytic performance. For instance, PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) shows much higher propylene selectivity (70-95%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts (40%) under identical conditions.

5. Acidity control: Reducing Bronsted acidity or controlling its distribution within the zeolite structure can improve catalyst performance. SAPO-34, with Bronsted acid sites primarily in side pores, demonstrates better coke-resistance than ZSM-5.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, higher conversion rates, and enhanced catalyst stability by optimizing metal dispersion, reducing side reactions, and minimizing coke formation. The choice of zeolite topology, metal combination, and preparation method should be carefully considered to achieve the desired PDH performance.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。以下是提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素：

1. 制备方法：锌离子交换后进行铂浸渍比逐步浸渍法能获得更高的铂分散度和更低的锌损失。这种方法提高了催化剂的性能和稳定性。

2. 沸石成分：Beta沸石的脱铝形成硅羟基巢穴，作为金属物种的锚定点，提高了其分散性和稳定性。无Bronsted酸位的Si-Beta沸石抑制了副反应裂解和降低了积碳，从而提高了催化剂性能。

3. 金属负载：适当的金属负载和组合可显著提高催化剂性能。例如，Zn/Si-Beta催化剂表现出优于Zn/Al-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率（55%）和丙烯选择性（90%）。PtSn-Beta催化剂甚至表现出更高的丙烯选择性（99%）和优异的稳定性。

4. 沸石拓扑结构：不同的沸石拓扑结构影响金属物种分布和催化性能。例如，在相同条件下，PtSn/SAPO-34（CHA拓扑结构）表现出比PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂更高的丙烯选择性（70-95%对比40%）。

5. 酸度控制：降低Bronsted酸度或控制其在沸石结构中的分布可以提高催化剂性能。SAPO-34的Bronsted酸位主要存在于侧孔中，表现出比ZSM-5更好的抗积碳性能。

这些因素通过优化金属分散、减少副反应和最小化积碳形成，从而提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。为了达到理想的PDH性能，应该仔细考虑沸石拓扑结构、金属组合和制备方法的选择。
