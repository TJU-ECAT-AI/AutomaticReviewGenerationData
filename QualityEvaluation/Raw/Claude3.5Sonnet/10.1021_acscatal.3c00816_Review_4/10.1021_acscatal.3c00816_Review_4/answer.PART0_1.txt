[1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species"

[3] "Besides, the resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits."

[4] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."

[5] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C"

[6] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

[7] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation methods: Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation results in higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation. This improved dispersion leads to better catalyst performance.

2. Zeolite composition: Dealumination of Beta zeolites creates silanol nests, which act as anchor sites for metal species, improving their dispersion and stabilization. Si-Beta zeolites, free of Bronsted acid sites, suppress side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits.

3. Metal loading: Zn/Si-Beta catalysts show superior propane conversion (55%) and propylene selectivity (90%) compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalysts exhibit even higher performance with 47% propane conversion and 99% propylene selectivity, along with excellent stability over 250 hours.

4. Zeolite topology: PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) demonstrates higher propylene selectivity (70-95%) compared to PtSn/ZSM-5 (40%), resulting in doubled propylene yield. The CHA topology of SAPO-34 provides better coke-resistance due to the location of Bronsted acid sites in side pores, making them inert for undesired cracking reactions.

5. Metal-support interactions: The introduction of framework Sn species in Beta zeolites enables better encapsulation and dispersion of Pt species, leading to improved catalyst performance and stability.

These factors collectively contribute to enhancing propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions for various zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：锌离子交换后进行铂浸渍，与逐步浸渍相比，可获得更高的铂分散度和更低的锌损失。这种改进的分散性导致更好的催化剂性能。

2. 沸石组成：Beta沸石的脱铝形成硅醇巢，作为金属物种的锚定位点，改善其分散性和稳定性。不含Bronsted酸位点的Si-Beta沸石抑制了副反应裂解和焦炭沉积。

3. 金属负载：Zn/Si-Beta催化剂显示出优于Zn/Al-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率（55%）和丙烯选择性（90%）。Pt-Sn-Beta-R催化剂表现更佳，丙烷转化率达47%，丙烯选择性高达99%，并在250小时内保持出色的稳定性。

4. 沸石拓扑结构：PtSn/SAPO-34（CHA拓扑结构）展现出比PtSn/ZSM-5更高的丙烯选择性（70-95%对40%），使丙烯产率翻倍。SAPO-34的CHA拓扑结构提供了更好的抗焦性，因为其Bronsted酸位点主要存在于侧孔中，对不需要的裂解反应惰性。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：在Beta沸石中引入骨架Sn物种能够更好地包覆和分散Pt物种，从而提高催化剂性能和稳定性。

这些因素共同作用，提高了各种沸石基催化剂（特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石）在PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。
