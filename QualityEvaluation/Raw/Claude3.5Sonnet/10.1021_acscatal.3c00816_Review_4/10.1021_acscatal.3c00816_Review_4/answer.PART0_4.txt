[1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species"

[3] "Abundant silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of small ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm), while the impregnated ZnOx on Al-Beta supports tends to form large ZnO nanoparticles (7 nm)."

[4] "The Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C"

[5] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

[6] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Preparation methods: Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation results in higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation. This improves catalyst stability and performance.

2. Composition: Dealumination of Beta zeolites creates silanol nests, which act as anchor sites for metal species, improving their dispersion and stabilization. Si-Beta supports lead to smaller metal nanoparticles compared to Al-Beta supports, enhancing catalytic performance.

3. Zeolite topology: BEA topologic zeolites, particularly Si-Beta, show excellent performance in PDH reactions. The Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst achieves high propane conversion (47%) and propylene selectivity (99%) with excellent stability.

4. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites: PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits superior propylene selectivity and yield compared to PtSn/ZSM-5. The unique structure of SAPO-34, with Brønsted acid sites primarily in side pores, contributes to better coke-resistance and improved catalytic performance.

5. Metal-support interactions: The introduction of heteroatoms (e.g., Sn, Zn) into the zeolite framework can act as anchor sites for metal species, forming metal-oxide interfaces or alloys that modify the geometric and electronic structure of active sites, potentially improving PDH performance.

These factors collectively contribute to enhanced propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions over zeolite-based catalysts.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：锌离子交换后进行铂浸渍，与逐步浸渍相比，可获得更高的铂分散度和更低的锌损失。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和性能。

2. 组成：Beta沸石的脱铝形成硅醇巢，作为金属物种的锚定位点，提高其分散性和稳定性。Si-Beta载体比Al-Beta载体形成更小的金属纳米颗粒，从而提高催化性能。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：BEA拓扑结构的沸石，特别是Si-Beta，在PDH反应中表现出优异的性能。Pt-Sn-Beta-R催化剂实现了高丙烷转化率（47%）和丙烯选择性（99%），且具有优异的稳定性。

4. 硅铝磷酸盐沸石：PtSn/SAPO-34（CHA拓扑结构）与PtSn/ZSM-5相比，表现出更高的丙烯选择性和产率。SAPO-34的独特结构，即Brønsted酸位主要存在于侧孔中，有助于提高抗积碳性能和催化性能。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：将杂原子（如Sn、Zn）引入沸石骨架可作为金属物种的锚定位点，形成金属-氧化物界面或合金，修饰活性位点的几何和电子结构，从而可能提高PDH性能。

这些因素共同促进了沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提高。
