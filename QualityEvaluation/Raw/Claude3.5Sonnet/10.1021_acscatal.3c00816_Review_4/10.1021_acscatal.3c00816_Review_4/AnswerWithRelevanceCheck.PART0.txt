          [1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species"

[3] "Besides, the resulting Si-Beta zeolites are free of Bronsted acid sites, which suppress the side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits."

[4] "Abundant silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of small ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm), while the impregnated ZnOx on Al-Beta supports tends to form large ZnO nanoparticles (7 nm)."

[5] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."

[6] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C"

[7] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

[8] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

          The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation methods: Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation results in higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation, leading to better catalyst performance and stability.

2. Zeolite composition: Dealumination of Beta zeolites creates silanol nests, which act as efficient anchor sites for metal species, improving their dispersion and stabilization. Si-Beta zeolites, free of Bronsted acid sites, suppress side cracking reactions and reduce coke deposits, enhancing propylene selectivity.

3. Metal dispersion and particle size: Silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of smaller metal nanoparticles (e.g., 3 nm ZnO), while Al-Beta supports tend to form larger nanoparticles (e.g., 7 nm ZnO). Smaller particles generally lead to better catalytic performance.

4. Metal loading and combinations: Proper metal loading and combinations can significantly enhance catalyst performance. For example, Zn/Si-Beta catalysts show superior propane conversion (55%) and propylene selectivity (90%) compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts. PtSn-Beta catalysts exhibit even higher propylene selectivity (99%) and excellent stability over extended periods (250 hours at 500°C).

5. Zeolite topology: Different zeolite topologies affect metal species distribution and catalytic performance. Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites like SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibit superior propylene selectivity compared to aluminosilicate zeolites like ZSM-5. PtSn/SAPO-34 shows 70-95% propylene selectivity, while PtSn/ZSM-5 only achieves 40% under identical conditions.

6. Acidity control: Reducing Bronsted acidity or controlling its distribution within the zeolite structure can improve catalyst performance. SAPO-34, with Bronsted acid sites primarily in side pores, demonstrates better coke resistance than ZSM-5, as these sites are less reactive for undesired cracking reactions.

These factors collectively contribute to the enhanced performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, with BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites showing particularly promising results in terms of propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability.

          沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：锌离子交换后进行铂浸渍，与逐步浸渍相比，可获得更高的铂分散度和更低的锌损失。这种方法提高了催化剂的性能和稳定性。

2. 沸石组成：Beta沸石的脱铝形成硅醇巢，作为金属物种的有效锚定位点，提高其分散性和稳定性。不含Brønsted酸位的Si-Beta沸石抑制了副反应裂解和焦炭沉积，提高了丙烯选择性。

3. 金属分散和粒径：Si-Beta中的硅醇巢有助于形成较小的金属纳米粒子（如3 nm ZnO），而Al-Beta支撑体倾向于形成较大的纳米粒子（如7 nm ZnO）。较小的粒子通常导致更好的催化性能。

4. 金属负载和组合：适当的金属负载和组合可显著提高催化剂性能。例如，Zn/Si-Beta催化剂表现出优于Zn/Al-Beta催化剂的丙烷转化率（55%）和丙烯选择性（90%）。PtSn-Beta催化剂甚至表现出更高的丙烯选择性（99%）和长期优异的稳定性（在500°C下250小时）。

5. 沸石拓扑结构：不同的沸石拓扑结构影响金属物种分布和催化性能。硅铝磷酸盐沸石如SAPO-34（CHA拓扑结构）比铝硅酸盐沸石如ZSM-5表现出更优异的丙烯选择性。在相同条件下，PtSn/SAPO-34显示70-95%的丙烯选择性，而PtSn/ZSM-5仅达到40%。

6. 酸度控制：降低Brønsted酸度或控制其在沸石结构中的分布可以提高催化剂性能。SAPO-34由于其Brønsted酸位主要存在于侧孔中，表现出比ZSM-5更好的抗积碳性能，因为这些位点在不期望的裂解反应中不太活跃。

这些因素共同促进了沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中性能的提高，其中BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性方面表现出特别有前景的结果。
