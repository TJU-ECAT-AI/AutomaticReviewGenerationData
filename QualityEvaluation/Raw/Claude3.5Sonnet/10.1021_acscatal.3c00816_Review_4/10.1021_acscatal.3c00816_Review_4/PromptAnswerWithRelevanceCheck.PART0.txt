[1] "Compared to stepwise impregnation, the catalysts prepared by Zn ion-exchange and subsequent Pt impregnation possess higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss (due to volatilization) during the PDH reaction."

[2] "The removal of lattice Al atoms leads to abundant silanol nests due to vacant T-sites, which are efficient anchor sites to improve the dispersion and stabilization of metal species"

[3] "Abundant silanol nests in Si-Beta contribute to the formation of small ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm), while the impregnated ZnOx on Al-Beta supports tends to form large ZnO nanoparticles (7 nm)."

[4] "The Zn/Si-Beta catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 55% and propylene selectivity of 90%, which is superior to the Zn/Al-Beta catalyst with a propane conversion of 20%."

[5] "The optimized Pt-Sn-Beta-R catalyst exhibits propane conversion of 47% and an extremely high propylene selectivity of 99%, as well as excellent catalytic stability during 250 h of the PDH reaction at 500 C"

[6] "PtSn/SAPO-34 (CHA topology) exhibits a much higher propylene selectivity (7095%) than PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst (40%) under identical conditions, resulting in doubled propylene yield."

[7] "O2-pulse analysis indicates that PtSn/SAPO-34 has better coke-resistance than PtSn/ZSM-5 because the Bronsted acid sites of SAPO-34 primarily exist in side pores and are inert for undesired cracking reactions."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation methods: Zn ion-exchange followed by Pt impregnation results in higher Pt dispersion and lower Zn loss compared to stepwise impregnation. This improved dispersion leads to better catalyst performance.

2. Zeolite composition: Dealumination of Beta zeolites creates silanol nests, which act as efficient anchor sites for metal species, improving their dispersion and stabilization. Si-Beta zeolites support smaller ZnO nanoparticles (3 nm) compared to Al-Beta supports (7 nm), leading to better catalytic performance.

3. Metal loading: The introduction of various metals (Zn, Pt, Sn) on Si-Beta zeolites significantly improves PDH performance. For example, Zn/Si-Beta catalysts show higher propane conversion (55%) and propylene selectivity (90%) compared to Zn/Al-Beta catalysts.

4. Synergistic effects: Bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Sn-Beta-R, exhibit excellent performance with high propane conversion (47%), propylene selectivity (99%), and stability over extended periods (250 h).

5. Zeolite topology: Silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, like SAPO-34 with CHA topology, demonstrate superior performance in PDH reactions. PtSn/SAPO-34 shows higher propylene selectivity (70-95%) compared to PtSn/ZSM-5 (40%), resulting in doubled propylene yield.

6. Acidity control: The location of Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34 (primarily in side pores) contributes to better coke-resistance compared to ZSM-5, as these sites are less accessible for undesired cracking reactions.

These factors collectively contribute to the improved catalytic performance of zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions, highlighting the importance of careful catalyst design and preparation in achieving high propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and stability.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：锌离子交换后进行铂浸渍，与逐步浸渍相比，可获得更高的铂分散度和更低的锌损失。这种改进的分散性能导致更好的催化剂性能。

2. 沸石组成：Beta沸石的脱铝形成硅醇巢，作为金属物种的有效锚定位点，提高其分散性和稳定性。Si-Beta沸石支持更小的ZnO纳米颗粒（3 nm），而Al-Beta支持物上的颗粒较大（7 nm），从而导致更好的催化性能。

3. 金属负载：在Si-Beta沸石上引入各种金属（Zn、Pt、Sn）显著提高了PDH性能。例如，Zn/Si-Beta催化剂表现出更高的丙烷转化率（55%）和丙烯选择性（90%），优于Zn/Al-Beta催化剂。

4. 协同效应：双金属催化剂，如Pt-Sn-Beta-R，表现出优异的性能，具有高丙烷转化率（47%）、丙烯选择性（99%）和长期稳定性（250小时）。

5. 沸石拓扑结构：硅铝磷沸石，如具有CHA拓扑结构的SAPO-34，在PDH反应中表现出优异的性能。PtSn/SAPO-34显示出更高的丙烯选择性（70-95%），相比之下PtSn/ZSM-5为40%，导致丙烯产率翻倍。

6. 酸度控制：SAPO-34中Brønsted酸位点的位置（主要在侧孔中）有助于提高抗积碳能力，优于ZSM-5，因为这些位点不易发生不需要的裂化反应。

这些因素共同促进了沸石基催化剂在PDH反应中的催化性能改进，突出了在实现高丙烯选择性、转化率和稳定性方面，精心设计和制备催化剂的重要性。
