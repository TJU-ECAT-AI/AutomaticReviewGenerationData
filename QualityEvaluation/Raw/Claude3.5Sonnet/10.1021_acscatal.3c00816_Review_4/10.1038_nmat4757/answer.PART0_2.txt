[1] "To test the catalytic properties and to acquire more information on the location of Pt species in the Pt@MCM-22 sample, we have chosen hydrogenation of alkenes with different molecular sizes as probe reactions."

[2] "Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C. Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

The literature does not directly address the question about BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some insights on zeolite-based catalysts for PDH:

1. Preparation method: The study presents a novel strategy to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors. This method results in highly stable subnanometric Pt species.

2. Zeolite topology: The study focuses on MCM-22 zeolite, which has a MWW topology. This structure allows for the incorporation of Pt species in different locations, including external cups and internal supercages.

3. Catalyst performance: Pt@MCM-22 showed higher activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation compared to Pt/MCM-22-imp prepared by conventional impregnation. After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 retained 90% of its initial activity, while Pt/MCM-22-imp lost more than 40%.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:
1. Size and distribution of Pt species: Subnanometric Pt clusters and single atoms are highly dispersed within the zeolite structure.
2. Confinement effect: Pt species are stabilized by the zeolite framework, particularly in internal cavities.
3. Thermal stability: The preparation method results in Pt species that are resistant to sintering at high temperatures.

While the study doesn't specifically address propylene selectivity, the improved stability and activity of the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst suggest potential benefits for PDH reactions in terms of conversion rates and catalyst longevity.

虽然该文献没有直接讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，但它确实提供了一些关于基于沸石的PDH催化剂的见解：

1. 制备方法：研究提出了一种新策略，从二维MWW型前驱体出发，制备三维MCM-22沸石中的亚纳米Pt催化剂。这种方法产生了高度稳定的亚纳米Pt物种。

2. 沸石拓扑结构：研究聚焦于具有MWW拓扑结构的MCM-22沸石。这种结构允许Pt物种在不同位置incorporation，包括外部杯状结构和内部超笼。

3. 催化剂性能：在丙烷脱氢反应中，Pt@MCM-22表现出比传统浸渍法制备的Pt/MCM-22-imp更高的活性和稳定性。经过550°C下五个反应-再生循环后，Pt@MCM-22保留了90%的初始活性，而Pt/MCM-22-imp失去了超过40%的活性。

影响性能提升的关键因素：
1. Pt物种的尺寸和分布：亚纳米Pt簇和单原子高度分散在沸石结构中。
2. 限域效应：Pt物种被沸石骨架稳定，特别是在内部空腔中。
3. 热稳定性：制备方法使得Pt物种在高温下具有抗烧结能力。

尽管该研究没有具体讨论丙烯选择性，但Pt@MCM-22催化剂改进的稳定性和活性表明，在转化率和催化剂寿命方面，这种催化剂可能对PDH反应有潜在的益处。
