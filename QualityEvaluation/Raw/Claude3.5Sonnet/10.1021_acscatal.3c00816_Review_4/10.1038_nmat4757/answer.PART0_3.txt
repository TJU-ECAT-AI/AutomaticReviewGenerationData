[1] "As has been presented above, incorporation of Pt in the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22 leads to isolated Pt atoms and Pt clusters on the cups located at the external surface and also probably in the internal space of MCM-22."

[2] "Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C. Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

[3] "It should be remarked that no significant loss of Pt in the Pt@MCM-22 sample is observed by ICP after five cycles of propane dehydrogenation reaction."

The literature does not specifically discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide insights on MCM-22 zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions.

The preparation method significantly influences catalyst performance. Incorporating Pt into the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22 results in isolated Pt atoms and clusters both on the external surface and within the zeolite structure. This method produces a more active and stable catalyst (Pt@MCM-22) compared to conventional impregnation (Pt/MCM-22-imp).

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Catalyst structure: Pt@MCM-22 contains subnanometric Pt species well-dispersed throughout the zeolite, leading to higher activity.

2. Stability: Pt@MCM-22 shows exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, while Pt/MCM-22-imp loses over 40% activity.

3. Pt retention: Pt@MCM-22 experiences no significant Pt loss after multiple PDH cycles, indicating strong metal-support interactions.

While the literature doesn't provide specific information on propylene selectivity, the improved activity and stability of Pt@MCM-22 suggest that careful control of metal species size and distribution within zeolite structures can significantly enhance catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

这篇文献并未特别讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于基于MCM-22沸石催化剂在PDH反应中的见解。

制备方法显著影响催化剂性能。将Pt掺入MCM-22的扩展层状前体中，会在外表面和沸石结构内部形成孤立的Pt原子和簇。这种方法与传统的浸渍法(Pt/MCM-22-imp)相比，可以生产出活性更高、稳定性更好的催化剂(Pt@MCM-22)。

提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. 催化剂结构：Pt@MCM-22含有均匀分散在沸石中的亚纳米Pt物种，导致更高的活性。

2. 稳定性：Pt@MCM-22表现出卓越的稳定性，在550°C下经过五次反应-再生循环后仍保持90%的初始活性，而Pt/MCM-22-imp的活性损失超过40%。

3. Pt保留：Pt@MCM-22在多次PDH循环后没有明显的Pt流失，表明金属与载体之间存在强相互作用。

虽然文献没有提供关于丙烯选择性的具体信息，但Pt@MCM-22的改进活性和稳定性表明，仔细控制沸石结构中金属物种的尺寸和分布可以显著提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能。
