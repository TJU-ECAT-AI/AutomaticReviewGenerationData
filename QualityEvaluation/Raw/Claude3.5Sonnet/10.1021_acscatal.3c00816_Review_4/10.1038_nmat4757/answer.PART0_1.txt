[1] "To test the catalytic properties and to acquire more information on the location of Pt species in the Pt@MCM-22 sample, we have chosen hydrogenation of alkenes with different molecular sizes as probe reactions."

[2] "Taking into account the higher stability of Pt@MCM-22, we also decided to test its catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reaction–regeneration cycles at high temperature."

[3] "As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550°C. Moreover, after five reaction–regeneration cycles at 550°C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information on BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does discuss the performance of Pt@MCM-22 catalysts in PDH reactions, which can provide some insights into factors contributing to improved catalyst performance.

The preparation method of Pt@MCM-22 involves incorporating subnanometric Pt species into the MCM-22 zeolite structure during its synthesis from a 2D precursor. This method results in highly dispersed Pt atoms and clusters within the zeolite framework, which contributes to improved catalyst performance.

The composition of the catalyst, with subnanometric Pt species incorporated into the MCM-22 zeolite, plays a crucial role in its performance. The confinement of Pt species within the zeolite structure enhances their stability and catalytic activity.

The MCM-22 zeolite topology, with its unique structure of cups and supercages, allows for the stabilization of subnanometric Pt species, which contributes to improved catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. High dispersion of Pt species within the zeolite structure
2. Enhanced stability of Pt species due to confinement in zeolite cavities
3. Improved resistance to sintering during high-temperature reactions and regeneration cycles

The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst showed higher activity and better stability in propane dehydrogenation compared to a conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 catalyst. After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 retained 90% of its initial activity, while Pt/MCM-22-imp lost more than 40% of its activity.

While the literature does not specifically address propylene selectivity, the improved stability and activity of Pt@MCM-22 suggest that this preparation method and catalyst composition could lead to better overall performance in PDH reactions.

文献并未提供关于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的全面信息。然而，它确实讨论了Pt@MCM-22催化剂在PDH反应中的性能，这可以为改善催化剂性能的因素提供一些见解。

Pt@MCM-22的制备方法涉及在从2D前驱体合成MCM-22沸石的过程中将亚纳米级Pt物种掺入沸石结构中。这种方法导致Pt原子和簇在沸石框架内高度分散，从而有助于提高催化剂性能。

催化剂的组成，即将亚纳米级Pt物种掺入MCM-22沸石中，在其性能中起着关键作用。Pt物种被限制在沸石结构内，增强了它们的稳定性和催化活性。

MCM-22沸石的拓扑结构，具有独特的杯状和超笼结构，可以稳定亚纳米级Pt物种，这有助于提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能。

导致性能改善的关键因素包括：

1. Pt物种在沸石结构内的高度分散
2. 由于被限制在沸石空腔中，Pt物种稳定性增强
3. 在高温反应和再生循环过程中对烧结的抗性提高

Pt@MCM-22催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出比传统浸渍法制备的Pt/MCM-22催化剂更高的活性和更好的稳定性。经过五个550°C的反应-再生循环后，Pt@MCM-22保持了90%的初始活性，而Pt/MCM-22-imp失去了超过40%的活性。

虽然文献没有具体提到丙烯选择性，但Pt@MCM-22改进的稳定性和活性表明，这种制备方法和催化剂组成可能会导致PDH反应中的整体性能更好。
