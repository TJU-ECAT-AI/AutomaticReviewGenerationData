[1] "Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C. Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a fixed-bed reactor. A cylindrical quartz tube was loaded with 1.10g of Pt@MCM-22 catalyst material (in the case of Pt/MCM-22-imp, the amount of catalyst was 0.60g). Catalyst was diluted with SiC to keep the total volume of solid constant (3cm3)."

[3] "We have presented a new strategy to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite with exceptional high stability, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors. Pt single atoms and clusters are stable after calcination in air at 540C and under reaction conditions."

The literature does not specifically discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does provide information on MCM-22 zeolite-based catalysts for PDH:

1. Preparation method: A new strategy is presented to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors. This method results in Pt single atoms and clusters with high stability.

2. Composition: The catalyst consists of subnanometric Pt species (single atoms and clusters) incorporated into MCM-22 zeolite.

3. Performance: Pt@MCM-22 shows higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp (prepared by impregnation) at 550°C for propane dehydrogenation.

4. Stability: After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 retains 90% of its initial activity, while Pt/MCM-22-imp loses more than 40%.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:
1. Subnanometric Pt species (single atoms and clusters)
2. Incorporation of Pt within the zeolite structure
3. High thermal stability of the catalyst
4. Resistance to sintering during reaction-regeneration cycles

The study does not provide specific information on propylene selectivity or conversion rates. To fully answer the question, additional research on BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites would be needed.

文献中没有具体讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。但是，它提供了有关MCM-22沸石基催化剂用于PDH的信息：

1. 制备方法：提出了一种新策略，从2D MWW型前驱体开始，在3D MCM-22沸石中制备亚纳米级Pt催化剂。这种方法得到了具有高稳定性的Pt单原子和簇。

2. 组成：催化剂由掺入MCM-22沸石的亚纳米级Pt物种（单原子和簇）组成。

3. 性能：在550°C下进行丙烷脱氢时，Pt@MCM-22的活性高于Pt/MCM-22-imp（通过浸渍法制备）。

4. 稳定性：经过550°C下五个反应-再生循环后，Pt@MCM-22保留了90%的初始活性，而Pt/MCM-22-imp失去了40%以上的活性。

contributes to improving performance的关键因素：
1. 亚纳米级Pt物种（单原子和簇）
2. Pt掺入沸石结构中
3. 催化剂的高热稳定性
4. 在反应-再生循环过程中抗烧结

该研究没有提供关于丙烯选择性或转化率的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石进行额外的研究。
