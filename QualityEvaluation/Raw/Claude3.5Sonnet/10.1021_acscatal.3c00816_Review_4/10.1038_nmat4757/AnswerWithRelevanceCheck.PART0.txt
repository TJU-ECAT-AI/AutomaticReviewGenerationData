          "Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C. Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

"We have presented a new strategy to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite with exceptional high stability, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors."

"As has been presented above, incorporation of Pt in the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22 leads to isolated Pt atoms and Pt clusters on the cups located at the external surface and also probably in the internal space of MCM-22."

"It should be remarked that no significant loss of Pt in the Pt@MCM-22 sample is observed by ICP after five cycles of propane dehydrogenation reaction."

          While the literature does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), it provides insights on MCM-22 zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Preparation method: A novel strategy is presented to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors. This method incorporates Pt into the expanded layered precursor of MCM-22, resulting in isolated Pt atoms and clusters on both the external surface and internal spaces.

2. Zeolite topology: The study focuses on MCM-22 zeolite with MWW topology. This structure allows for the incorporation of Pt species in different locations, including external cups and internal supercages.

3. Catalyst performance: Pt@MCM-22 shows higher activity and significantly better stability compared to conventionally impregnated Pt/MCM-22-imp in propane dehydrogenation.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Size and distribution of Pt species: Subnanometric Pt clusters and single atoms are highly dispersed within the zeolite structure.
2. Confinement effect: Pt species are stabilized by the zeolite framework, particularly in internal cavities.
3. Thermal stability: After five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, Pt@MCM-22 retains 90% of its initial activity, while Pt/MCM-22-imp loses over 40%.
4. Pt retention: No significant loss of Pt is observed in Pt@MCM-22 after multiple PDH cycles, indicating strong metal-support interactions.

While the study doesn't provide specific information on propylene selectivity, the improved activity and stability of Pt@MCM-22 suggest that careful control of metal species size and distribution within zeolite structures can significantly enhance catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

          虽然该文献没有特别讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，但它提供了关于基于MCM-22分子筛催化剂在PDH反应中的一些见解：

1. 制备方法：研究提出了一种新策略，从二维MWW型前驱体出发，制备三维MCM-22分子筛中的亚纳米Pt催化剂。这种方法将Pt掺入MCM-22的扩展层状前体中，导致在外表面和内部空间形成孤立的Pt原子和簇。

2. 分子筛拓扑结构：研究聚焦于具有MWW拓扑结构的MCM-22分子筛。这种结构允许Pt物种在不同位置掺入，包括外部杯状结构和内部超笼。

3. 催化剂性能：在丙烷脱氢反应中，Pt@MCM-22表现出比传统浸渍法制备的Pt/MCM-22-imp更高的活性和显著更好的稳定性。

影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. Pt物种的尺寸和分布：亚纳米Pt簇和单原子高度分散在分子筛结构中。
2. 限域效应：Pt物种被分子筛骨架稳定，特别是在内部空腔中。
3. 热稳定性：经过550°C下五个反应-再生循环后，Pt@MCM-22保留了90%的初始活性，而Pt/MCM-22-imp失去了超过40%的活性。
4. Pt保留：Pt@MCM-22在多次PDH循环后没有观察到明显的Pt流失，表明金属与载体之间存在强相互作用。

尽管该研究没有提供关于丙烯选择性的具体信息，但Pt@MCM-22的改进活性和稳定性表明，仔细控制分子筛结构中金属物种的尺寸和分布可以显著提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能。
