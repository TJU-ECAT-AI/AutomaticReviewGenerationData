[1] "To test the catalytic properties and to acquire more information on the location of Pt species in the Pt@MCM-22 sample, we have chosen hydrogenation of alkenes with different molecular sizes as probe reactions."

[2] "Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550C. Moreover, after five reactionregeneration cycles at 550C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

[3] "We have presented a new strategy to prepare subnanometric Pt catalysts in 3D MCM-22 zeolite with exceptional high stability, starting from 2D MWW-type precursors."

The literature does not directly address the question about BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide some relevant information about zeolite-based catalysts for PDH:

The study focuses on Pt catalysts supported on MCM-22 zeolite (MWW topology). The preparation method involves incorporating subnanometric Pt species into the 2D precursor of MCM-22, followed by transformation into the 3D structure. This method results in highly stable subnanometric Pt catalysts.

The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst shows superior performance in propane dehydrogenation compared to a conventional impregnated Pt/MCM-22 catalyst. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Higher stability: Pt@MCM-22 retains 90% of its initial activity after five reaction-regeneration cycles at 550°C, while Pt/MCM-22-imp loses over 40% of its activity.

2. Better dispersion and confinement of Pt species: The preparation method allows for subnanometric Pt species to be incorporated within the zeolite structure, leading to higher stability and activity.

3. Zeolite topology: The MWW structure of MCM-22 provides suitable cavities and channels for confining Pt species, contributing to their stability and catalytic performance.

While the study doesn't directly compare different zeolite topologies or compositions, it demonstrates that the preparation method and the resulting metal-zeolite interactions are crucial factors in determining catalyst performance and stability in PDH reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了一些关于基于分子筛催化剂用于PDH的相关信息：

该研究主要关注了负载在MCM-22分子筛（MWW拓扑结构）上的Pt催化剂。制备方法涉及将亚纳米级Pt物种掺入MCM-22的二维前驱体中，然后转化为三维结构。这种方法产生了高度稳定的亚纳米级Pt催化剂。

Pt@MCM-22催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出优于常规浸渍法制备的Pt/MCM-22催化剂的性能。导致性能改善的关键因素包括：

1. 更高的稳定性：经过550°C下五个反应-再生循环后，Pt@MCM-22保持了90%的初始活性，而Pt/MCM-22-imp则失去了超过40%的活性。

2. 更好的Pt物种分散和限制：制备方法允许亚纳米级Pt物种被掺入分子筛结构中，从而导致更高的稳定性和活性。

3. 分子筛拓扑结构：MCM-22的MWW结构为限制Pt物种提供了合适的孔穴和通道，有助于其稳定性和催化性能。

虽然该研究没有直接比较不同的分子筛拓扑结构或组成，但它表明制备方法和由此产生的金属-分子筛相互作用是决定PDH反应中催化剂性能和稳定性的关键因素。
