[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y were tested as catalysts in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 555 C."

[2] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%."

[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

[4] "Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, platinum by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6."

[5] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[6] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[7] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7  nSi/nAl  26)."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topology zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: Zinc introduction by aqueous ion exchange followed by platinum impregnation generally produces better catalysts than simultaneous impregnation of both metals. Ion exchange reduces zinc loss and pore blocking during catalyst activation and propane conversion.

2. Composition: The optimal catalyst contains 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn. Higher zinc content can lead to rapid deactivation due to zinc volatilization, metal phase sintering, and coking.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered ring zeolites, particularly Beta (BEA) and mordenite, show the highest and most stable conversion levels. The spacious pore structure of Beta allows for better dispersion of metal species and reduced coking.

4. Si/Al ratio: Zeolites with intermediate Si/Al ratios (8.7-26) perform best. This range allows for optimal zinc distribution and interaction with platinum.

5. Zinc species: Slightly over-exchanged zeolites perform better than strongly over-exchanged or impregnated ones. This suggests that a balance of different zinc species (e.g., Zn2+, ZnO, Zn(OH)+) is crucial for catalyst performance.

The best-performing catalyst was 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, which achieved stable conversion close to thermodynamic equilibrium (29% at 555°C) with >90% propene selectivity for at least 63 hours. This performance is attributed to the optimal combination of preparation method, composition, zeolite topology, and Si/Al ratio.

The study does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, so their performance in PDH reactions cannot be addressed based on the given information.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响，特别是对BEA拓扑结构的沸石。影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：通过水相离子交换引入锌，然后浸渍铂，通常比同时浸渍两种金属产生更好的催化剂。离子交换减少了催化剂活化和丙烷转化过程中的锌损失和孔道堵塞。

2. 成分：最佳催化剂含有0.5 wt%的铂和1.6-2.6 wt%的锌。更高的锌含量可能导致由于锌挥发、金属相烧结和结焦而快速失活。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：12元环沸石，特别是Beta (BEA)和丝光沸石，显示出最高和最稳定的转化水平。Beta的宽敞孔道结构允许更好的金属物种分散和减少结焦。

4. Si/Al比：中等Si/Al比(8.7-26)的沸石表现最佳。这个范围允许锌的最佳分布和与铂的相互作用。

5. 锌物种：轻度过量交换的沸石比强过量交换或浸渍的沸石表现更好。这表明不同锌物种(如Zn2+、ZnO、Zn(OH)+)的平衡对催化剂性能至关重要。

性能最佳的催化剂是0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta，它在555°C下实现了接近热力学平衡的稳定转化(29%)，丙烯选择性>90%，至少持续63小时。这种性能归因于制备方法、成分、沸石拓扑结构和Si/Al比的最佳组合。

研究没有特别提到硅铝磷酸盐沸石，因此基于给定信息无法讨论它们在PDH反应中的性能。

[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[3] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[4] "For a given zeolite type, the fraction of these different zinc species can be controlled by varying the zinc concentration, the pH of the zinc salt solution or the zinc salt precursor."

[5] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26)."

[6] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation methods: Zinc loading by aqueous ion exchange reduces zinc loss and pore blocking during catalyst activation and propane conversion, compared to impregnation methods.

2. Composition: The optimal catalyst composition includes 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn. The Si/Al ratio of the zeolite also plays a crucial role, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26) producing highly active and stable catalysts.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered-ring zeolites, particularly Na-Beta (BEA topology), show superior performance compared to other zeolite types.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Propylene selectivity: Slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate Si/Al ratios show high propene selectivity (>90%).

2. Conversion rates: PtZn-loaded Na-Beta zeolite exhibits the highest propane conversions, reaching thermodynamic equilibrium.

3. Catalyst stability: The Na-Beta zeolite-based catalyst maintains high performance for at least 63 hours on-stream.

The study does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing instead on aluminosilicate zeolites. The superior performance of Na-Beta (BEA topology) is attributed to its 12-membered-ring structure and optimal composition, which allows for efficient propane dehydrogenation while minimizing deactivation due to coking, zinc volatilization, and metal sintering.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation methods: Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, while platinum was added by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6. The zinc loading method affects catalyst stability and activity.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate Si/Al ratios.
2. Optimal zinc content (around 2.5 wt%) and platinum content (0.5 wt%).
3. The use of zeolite Beta (BEA topology) as the support.
