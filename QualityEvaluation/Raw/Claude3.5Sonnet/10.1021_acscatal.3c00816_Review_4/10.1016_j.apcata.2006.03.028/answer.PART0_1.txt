[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[3] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[4] "For a given zeolite type, the fraction of these different zinc species can be controlled by varying the zinc concentration, the pH of the zinc salt solution or the zinc salt precursor."

[5] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26)."

[6] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation methods: Zinc loading by aqueous ion exchange reduces zinc loss and pore blocking during catalyst activation and propane conversion, compared to impregnation methods.

2. Composition: The optimal catalyst composition includes 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn. The Si/Al ratio of the zeolite also plays a crucial role, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26) producing highly active and stable catalysts.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered-ring zeolites, particularly Na-Beta (BEA topology), show superior performance compared to other zeolite types.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Propylene selectivity: Slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate Si/Al ratios show high propene selectivity (>90%).

2. Conversion rates: PtZn-loaded Na-Beta zeolite exhibits the highest propane conversions, reaching thermodynamic equilibrium.

3. Catalyst stability: The Na-Beta zeolite-based catalyst maintains high performance for at least 63 hours on-stream.

The study does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing instead on aluminosilicate zeolites. The superior performance of Na-Beta (BEA topology) is attributed to its 12-membered-ring structure and optimal composition, which allows for efficient propane dehydrogenation while minimizing deactivation due to coking, zinc volatilization, and metal sintering.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 制备方法：与浸渍法相比，水相离子交换法进行锌负载可减少催化剂活化和丙烷转化过程中的锌损失和孔道堵塞。

2. 组成：最佳催化剂组成包括0.5 wt% Pt和1.6-2.6 wt% Zn。沸石的Si/Al比也起着至关重要的作用，中等比例(8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26)可产生高活性和稳定性的催化剂。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：12元环沸石，特别是Na-Beta（BEA拓扑结构），表现出优于其他沸石类型的性能。

促进性能提升的关键因素：

1. 丙烯选择性：稍微过量锌交换的12元环沸石，具有中等Si/Al比，显示出较高的丙烯选择性(>90%)。

2. 转化率：PtZn负载的Na-Beta沸石展现出最高的丙烷转化率，达到热力学平衡。

3. 催化剂稳定性：基于Na-Beta沸石的催化剂在至少63小时的连续反应中保持高性能。

该研究没有特别提及硅铝磷酸盐沸石，而是集中于铝硅酸盐沸石。Na-Beta（BEA拓扑结构）的优异性能归因于其12元环结构和最佳组成，这允许有效的丙烷脱氢，同时最大限度地减少由于结焦、锌挥发和金属烧结导致的失活。
