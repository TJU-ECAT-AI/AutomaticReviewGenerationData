[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26), Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y. Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, platinum by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6."

[2] "The PtZn-containing zeolites were tested in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 555 C. Aromatization occurred over the 10-membered-ring zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11, whereas propane dehydrogenation was the major reaction over the 12-membered-ring zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y."

[3] "The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios  8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%."

[4] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

[5] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[6] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7  nSi/nAl  26)."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation methods: Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, while platinum was added by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6. The zinc loading method affects catalyst stability and activity.

2. Composition: The optimal zinc content was found to be close to 2.5 wt%, with platinum content at 0.5 wt%. The Si/Al ratio also plays a crucial role, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ Si/Al ≤ 26) showing the best performance.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered-ring zeolites (Beta, mordenite, L, and Y) favored propane dehydrogenation, while 10-membered-ring zeolites (ZSM-5 and ZSM-11) promoted aromatization.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate Si/Al ratios.
2. Optimal zinc content (around 2.5 wt%) and platinum content (0.5 wt%).
3. The use of zeolite Beta (BEA topology) as the support.

The best-performing catalyst was 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, which showed stable conversion close to thermodynamic equilibrium (29% at 555°C and 0.1 MPa) for at least 63 hours, with propene selectivity exceeding 90%.

Factors contributing to catalyst deactivation include volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase, and coking. These issues were mitigated by using the optimal preparation methods and compositions mentioned above.

The study did not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing instead on aluminosilicate zeolites with various topologies.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能：

1. 制备方法：锌通过浸渍或水溶液离子交换引入，而铂通过随后用H2PtCl6浸渍添加。锌的负载方法影响催化剂的稳定性和活性。

2. 成分：最佳锌含量接近2.5 wt%，铂含量为0.5 wt%。Si/Al比也起着关键作用，中等比例(8.7 ≤ Si/Al ≤ 26)显示出最佳性能。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：12元环沸石(Beta、丝光沸石、L和Y)有利于丙烷脱氢，而10元环沸石(ZSM-5和ZSM-11)促进芳构化。

提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 具有中等Si/Al比的略微锌过量交换的12元环沸石。
2. 最佳锌含量(约2.5 wt%)和铂含量(0.5 wt%)。
3. 使用Beta沸石(BEA拓扑结构)作为载体。

性能最佳的催化剂是0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta，在555°C和0.1 MPa下，至少63小时内显示出接近热力学平衡的稳定转化率(29%)，丙烯选择性超过90%。

导致催化剂失活的因素包括金属锌的挥发、PtZn金属相的烧结和结焦。通过使用上述最佳制备方法和成分，这些问题得到了缓解。

该研究没有具体提到硅铝磷酸盐沸石，而是集中研究了具有各种拓扑结构的铝硅酸盐沸石。
