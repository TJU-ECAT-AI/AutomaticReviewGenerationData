[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[3] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[4] "Highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26)."

[5] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation methods: Aqueous ion exchange for zinc loading reduces zinc loss and pore blocking compared to impregnation methods.

2. Composition: Slightly zinc over-exchanged catalysts with 0.5 wt.% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt.% Zn show optimal performance. The Si/Al ratio is crucial, with intermediate ratios (8.7-26) producing the best results.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered-ring zeolites, particularly Na-Beta (BEA topology), demonstrate superior performance compared to other structures.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Propylene selectivity: Proper zinc loading and distribution within the zeolite structure.

2. Conversion rates: Optimal balance of Pt and Zn content, along with suitable Si/Al ratio.

3. Catalyst stability: Reduced zinc volatilization and coking through appropriate preparation methods and zeolite structure.

The PtZn-loaded Na-Beta zeolite achieves the highest propane conversions (at thermodynamic equilibrium) with propene selectivities over 90% for at least 63 hours, demonstrating excellent stability and performance in PDH reactions.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能：

1. 制备方法：用于锌负载的水相离子交换法比浸渍法能减少锌损失和孔道堵塞。

2. 成分：略微过量锌交换的催化剂，含0.5 wt.%铂和1.6-2.6 wt.%锌，显示出最佳性能。硅铝比至关重要，中等比例(8.7-26)产生最佳结果。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：12元环沸石，特别是Na-Beta（BEA拓扑结构），与其他结构相比表现出优越的性能。

影响性能改善的关键因素：

1. 丙烯选择性：适当的锌负载量和在沸石结构中的分布。

2. 转化率：铂和锌含量的最佳平衡，以及合适的硅铝比。

3. 催化剂稳定性：通过适当的制备方法和沸石结构减少锌挥发和积碳。

PtZn负载的Na-Beta沸石实现了最高的丙烷转化率（达到热力学平衡），丙烯选择性超过90%，至少持续63小时，展示了在PDH反应中优异的稳定性和性能。
