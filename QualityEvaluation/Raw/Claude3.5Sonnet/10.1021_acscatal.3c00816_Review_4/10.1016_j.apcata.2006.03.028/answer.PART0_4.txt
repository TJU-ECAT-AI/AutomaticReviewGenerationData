[1] "PtZn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "PtZn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the PtZn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon."

[3] "The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion."

[4] "A large fraction of isolated Zn2+ cations causes aromatization in the 10-membered-ring zeolites ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 and coke formation with rapid deactivation in the 12-membered-ring zeolites L and Y."

[5] "On the contrary, highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26)."

[6] "Thus, the PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation methods: Zinc loading by aqueous ion exchange reduces zinc loss and pore blocking, improving catalyst stability compared to impregnation methods.

2. Composition: The optimal catalyst composition includes 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.6-2.6 wt% Zn. The Si/Al ratio is crucial, with intermediate ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26) yielding the best results.

3. Zeolite topology: 12-membered-ring zeolites, particularly Beta (BEA) topology, show superior performance compared to 10-membered-ring zeolites like ZSM-5 and ZSM-11.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Propylene selectivity: Slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate Si/Al ratios show high propene selectivity (>90%).

2. Conversion rates: PtZn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta achieves propane conversions corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium.

3. Catalyst stability: The use of aqueous ion exchange for zinc loading and the selection of appropriate zeolite topology (BEA) and composition contribute to improved stability, with Na-Beta maintaining high performance for at least 63 hours.

The study does not specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing mainly on aluminosilicate zeolites. The key to high performance appears to be the balance between zinc content, zeolite structure, and Si/Al ratio, which affects the distribution and nature of active sites within the catalyst.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 制备方法：通过水溶液离子交换进行锌负载可以减少锌损失和孔道阻塞，与浸渍法相比提高了催化剂稳定性。

2. 组成：最佳催化剂组成包括0.5 wt% Pt和1.6-2.6 wt% Zn。Si/Al比至关重要，中等比例(8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26)产生最佳结果。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：12元环沸石，特别是Beta (BEA)拓扑结构，比10元环沸石如ZSM-5和ZSM-11表现出更优异的性能。

导致性能改善的关键因素：

1. 丙烯选择性：具有中等Si/Al比的稍微过量锌交换的12元环沸石显示出高丙烯选择性(>90%)。

2. 转化率：PtZn负载的Na-Beta沸石达到了与热力学平衡相对应的丙烷转化率。

3. 催化剂稳定性：使用水溶液离子交换进行锌负载，以及选择适当的沸石拓扑结构(BEA)和组成有助于提高稳定性，Na-Beta至少保持63小时的高性能。

该研究没有特别提到硅铝磷沸石，主要集中在铝硅酸盐沸石上。高性能的关键似乎是锌含量、沸石结构和Si/Al比之间的平衡，这影响了催化剂内活性位点的分布和性质。
