[1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "The catalytic performance of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX toward the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was investigated, as shown in Fig. 2."

[3] "The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[4] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[5] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

The literature does not directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide insights into how preparation methods and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance for NaX zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions.

The study compares two preparation methods: in situ crystallization for Pt@NaX (Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages) and traditional incipient impregnation for Pt/NaX (Pt clusters on zeolite exterior). The results show that Pt/NaX exhibits superior performance in terms of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst stability.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Location of Pt clusters: Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior (Pt/NaX) showed higher activity and selectivity compared to those enclosed in zeolite cages (Pt@NaX).

2. Accessibility of active sites: Pt clusters on the exterior are more accessible to reactants, leading to higher propane conversion rates.

3. Product desorption: Propylene desorbs more easily from Pt clusters on the exterior, resulting in higher propylene selectivity for Pt/NaX.

4. Coke deposition: Pt/NaX showed less coke deposition, indicating better catalyst stability.

These findings suggest that the preparation method and the location of active metal clusters significantly influence catalyst performance in PDH reactions. The study emphasizes the importance of considering the interaction between metal clusters and the zeolite framework when designing catalysts for specific reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于制备方法和分子筛拓扑结构如何影响NaX分子筛基催化剂在PDH反应中的性能的见解。

研究比较了两种制备方法：用于Pt@NaX（Pt簇封装在分子筛笼中）的原位结晶法和用于Pt/NaX（Pt簇在分子筛外表面）的传统浸渍法。结果表明，Pt/NaX在丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性方面表现出更优异的性能。

导致性能改善的关键因素包括：

1. Pt簇的位置：位于分子筛外表面的Pt簇（Pt/NaX）比封装在分子筛笼中的Pt簇（Pt@NaX）表现出更高的活性和选择性。

2. 活性位点的可及性：外表面的Pt簇更容易被反应物接触，导致更高的丙烷转化率。

3. 产物脱附：丙烯更容易从外表面的Pt簇上脱附，使Pt/NaX具有更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 积碳沉积：Pt/NaX表现出较少的积碳沉积，表明催化剂稳定性更好。

这些发现表明，制备方法和活性金属簇的位置显著影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能。研究强调了在设计特定反应的催化剂时，考虑金属簇与分子筛骨架之间相互作用的重要性。

The study does not specifically address BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide insights into how preparation methods and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance for PDH using NaX zeolites.

The preparation method significantly affects catalyst performance. Pt@NaX, prepared by in situ crystallization with Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages, showed lower propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Pt/NaX, prepared by traditional incipient impregnation with Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Pt cluster location: Exterior Pt clusters (Pt/NaX) showed better activity and selectivity than enclosed clusters (Pt@NaX).

2. Zeolite framework interaction: The surrounding zeolitic framework passivated enclosed Pt clusters, lowering their d-band center and reducing propane activation ability.

3. Product desorption: Exterior Pt clusters allowed easier propylene desorption, improving selectivity and reducing coke formation.

4. Stability: Pt/NaX showed less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%), indicating higher stability.

While this study focused on NaX zeolites, the principles of metal-zeolite interactions and their effects on catalytic performance could potentially be applied to other zeolite types, including BEA and silicoaluminophosphates, for optimizing PDH catalysts.

这项研究并没有具体讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于制备方法和沸石拓扑结构如何影响使用NaX沸石的PDH催化剂性能的见解。

制备方法显著影响催化剂性能。通过原位结晶法制备的Pt@NaX（Pt簇封装在沸石笼中）与通过传统浸渍法制备的Pt/NaX（Pt簇在沸石外表面）相比，显示出较低的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. Pt簇位置：外部Pt簇（Pt/NaX）表现出比封装簇（Pt@NaX）更好的活性和选择性。

2. 沸石骨架相互作用：周围的沸石骨架钝化了封装的Pt簇，降低了它们的d带中心，减弱了丙烷的活化能力。

3. 产物脱附：外部Pt簇允许丙烯更容易脱附，提高了选择性并减少了积碳形成。

4. 稳定性：Pt/NaX显示出较少的积碳沉积（2.8%），而Pt@NaX为3.5%，表明前者具有更高的稳定性。

虽然这项研究集中在NaX沸石上，但金属-沸石相互作用及其对催化性能影响的原理可能适用于其他类型的沸石，包括BEA和硅铝磷酸盐，以优化PDH催化剂。

The study primarily focuses on NaX zeolite-based catalysts rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, the findings provide insights into how preparation methods and catalyst structure influence performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation method: The study compares two preparation methods - in situ crystallization (Pt@NaX) and traditional incipient impregnation (Pt/NaX). The method significantly affects the location of Pt clusters (inside or outside the zeolite cages), which in turn influences catalyst performance.

2. Catalyst structure: Pt/NaX, with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite, showed better performance in PDH reactions compared to Pt@NaX, where Pt clusters were enclosed in zeolite cages.

3. Propylene selectivity: Pt/NaX demonstrated higher propylene selectivity (67.0%) compared to Pt@NaX (43.0%).

4. Conversion rates: Pt/NaX showed remarkably higher propane conversion rates than Pt@NaX at both 520°C and 550°C.

5. Catalyst stability: Pt/NaX exhibited better stability with less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%) after the reaction.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Location of Pt clusters (exterior vs. interior of zeolite)
- Ease of propylene desorption from Pt clusters
- Interaction between Pt clusters and the zeolite framework
- Electronic state of Pt clusters as influenced by the zeolite environment

While this study doesn't directly address BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it highlights the importance of catalyst preparation methods and metal-support interactions in designing effective PDH catalysts.

[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."

[2] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[3] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

[4] "The d-band center of the Pt50 clusters confined in the zeolite shifts to a lower value compared with that in the gas phase, which is consistent with the Pt L3-edge XANES and Pt 4d XPS results shown in Fig. 1f and S8, respectively. The Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane, and thus a lower propane conversion was achieved over Pt@NaX compared with that over Pt/NaX."

The literature primarily discusses X-zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), specifically comparing Pt/NaX and Pt@NaX catalysts. While it doesn't directly address BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it provides insights into how preparation methods and catalyst structure influence PDH performance:

1. Preparation methods: Pt@NaX was synthesized via in situ crystallization, enclosing Pt clusters in zeolite cages, while Pt/NaX was prepared by traditional incipient impregnation, placing Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior.

2. Catalyst performance: Pt/NaX showed significantly better performance, with 1100% enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and improved propylene selectivity compared to Pt@NaX.

3. Stability and coke formation: Pt/NaX demonstrated higher stability and less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%).

4. Electronic properties: The d-band center of Pt clusters confined in zeolite shifted to a lower value, making them less effective for propane activation. This explains the lower propane conversion for Pt@NaX compared to Pt/NaX.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. Location of Pt clusters (exterior vs. interior)
2. Electronic properties of Pt clusters
3. Ease of reactant activation and product desorption

While the study doesn't directly address BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it suggests that similar principles of metal cluster location, zeolite framework interactions, and electronic properties could be important factors in designing effective PDH catalysts using these materials.
