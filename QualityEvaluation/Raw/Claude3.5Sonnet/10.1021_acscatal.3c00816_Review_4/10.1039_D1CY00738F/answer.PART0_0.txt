[1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "The catalytic performance of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX toward the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was investigated, as shown in Fig. 2."

[3] "The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[4] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[5] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

The literature does not directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide insights into how preparation methods and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance for NaX zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions.

The study compares two preparation methods: in situ crystallization for Pt@NaX (Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages) and traditional incipient impregnation for Pt/NaX (Pt clusters on zeolite exterior). The results show that Pt/NaX exhibits superior performance in terms of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst stability.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Location of Pt clusters: Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior (Pt/NaX) showed higher activity and selectivity compared to those enclosed in zeolite cages (Pt@NaX).

2. Accessibility of active sites: Pt clusters on the exterior are more accessible to reactants, leading to higher propane conversion rates.

3. Product desorption: Propylene desorbs more easily from Pt clusters on the exterior, resulting in higher propylene selectivity for Pt/NaX.

4. Coke deposition: Pt/NaX showed less coke deposition, indicating better catalyst stability.

These findings suggest that the preparation method and the location of active metal clusters significantly influence catalyst performance in PDH reactions. The study emphasizes the importance of considering the interaction between metal clusters and the zeolite framework when designing catalysts for specific reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于制备方法和分子筛拓扑结构如何影响NaX分子筛基催化剂在PDH反应中的性能的见解。

研究比较了两种制备方法：用于Pt@NaX（Pt簇封装在分子筛笼中）的原位结晶法和用于Pt/NaX（Pt簇在分子筛外表面）的传统浸渍法。结果表明，Pt/NaX在丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性方面表现出更优异的性能。

导致性能改善的关键因素包括：

1. Pt簇的位置：位于分子筛外表面的Pt簇（Pt/NaX）比封装在分子筛笼中的Pt簇（Pt@NaX）表现出更高的活性和选择性。

2. 活性位点的可及性：外表面的Pt簇更容易被反应物接触，导致更高的丙烷转化率。

3. 产物脱附：丙烯更容易从外表面的Pt簇上脱附，使Pt/NaX具有更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 积碳沉积：Pt/NaX表现出较少的积碳沉积，表明催化剂稳定性更好。

这些发现表明，制备方法和活性金属簇的位置显著影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能。研究强调了在设计特定反应的催化剂时，考虑金属簇与分子筛骨架之间相互作用的重要性。
