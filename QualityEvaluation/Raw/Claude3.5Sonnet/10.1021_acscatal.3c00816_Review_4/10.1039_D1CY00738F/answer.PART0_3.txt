[1] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."

[2] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[3] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

[4] "The d-band center of the Pt50 clusters confined in the zeolite shifts to a lower value compared with that in the gas phase, which is consistent with the Pt L3-edge XANES and Pt 4d XPS results shown in Fig. 1f and S8, respectively. The Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane, and thus a lower propane conversion was achieved over Pt@NaX compared with that over Pt/NaX."

The literature primarily discusses X-zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), specifically comparing Pt/NaX and Pt@NaX catalysts. While it doesn't directly address BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it provides insights into how preparation methods and catalyst structure influence PDH performance:

1. Preparation methods: Pt@NaX was synthesized via in situ crystallization, enclosing Pt clusters in zeolite cages, while Pt/NaX was prepared by traditional incipient impregnation, placing Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior.

2. Catalyst performance: Pt/NaX showed significantly better performance, with 1100% enhancement in turnover frequency (TOF) and improved propylene selectivity compared to Pt@NaX.

3. Stability and coke formation: Pt/NaX demonstrated higher stability and less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%).

4. Electronic properties: The d-band center of Pt clusters confined in zeolite shifted to a lower value, making them less effective for propane activation. This explains the lower propane conversion for Pt@NaX compared to Pt/NaX.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. Location of Pt clusters (exterior vs. interior)
2. Electronic properties of Pt clusters
3. Ease of reactant activation and product desorption

While the study doesn't directly address BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it suggests that similar principles of metal cluster location, zeolite framework interactions, and electronic properties could be important factors in designing effective PDH catalysts using these materials.

该文献主要讨论了X沸石基催化剂用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应，特别比较了Pt/NaX和Pt@NaX催化剂。虽然它没有直接讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但它提供了关于制备方法和催化剂结构如何影响PDH性能的见解：

1. 制备方法：Pt@NaX通过原位结晶合成，将Pt簇封装在沸石笼中，而Pt/NaX通过传统浸渍法制备，将Pt簇置于沸石外表面。

2. 催化剂性能：Pt/NaX表现出明显更好的性能，与Pt@NaX相比，转化频率(TOF)提高了1100%，丙烯选择性也有所改善。

3. 稳定性和积碳形成：Pt/NaX表现出更高的稳定性和更少的积碳沉积（2.8%），而Pt@NaX为3.5%。

4. 电子性质：封闭在沸石中的Pt簇的d带中心移向较低值，使其对丙烷活化的效果降低。这解释了Pt@NaX与Pt/NaX相比丙烷转化率较低的原因。

导致性能改善的关键因素包括：
1. Pt簇的位置（外部vs内部）
2. Pt簇的电子性质
3. 反应物活化和产物脱附的难易程度

虽然该研究没有直接涉及BEA和硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但它表明，在设计使用这些材料的有效PDH催化剂时，金属簇位置、沸石骨架相互作用和电子性质等类似原则可能是重要因素。
