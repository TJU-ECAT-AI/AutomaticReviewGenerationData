[1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "The catalytic performance of Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX toward the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was investigated, as shown in Fig. 2. The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[3] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[4] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

The literature does not specifically discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide insights into how preparation methods and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance for PDH using NaX zeolites.

The study compares two catalysts: Pt@NaX (Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages) and Pt/NaX (Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior). The preparation method significantly affects catalyst performance:

1. Propane conversion: Pt/NaX showed remarkably higher conversion than Pt@NaX at 520°C and 550°C.

2. Propylene selectivity: Pt/NaX maintained a stable 67.0% selectivity, while Pt@NaX only achieved 43.0%.

3. Catalyst stability: Pt/NaX demonstrated higher stability with less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%).

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Location of Pt clusters: Exterior placement (Pt/NaX) led to better activity and selectivity.
2. Zeolite framework effect: The surrounding framework in Pt@NaX passivated the Pt clusters, reducing their activity.
3. Product desorption: Easier propylene desorption from Pt/NaX contributed to higher selectivity.

While this study focuses on NaX zeolites, the principles of how preparation methods and metal-zeolite interactions affect catalyst performance could potentially be applied to other zeolite types, including BEA and silicoaluminophosphates, for PDH reactions.

这篇文献并未具体讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。但是，它确实提供了关于制备方法和分子筛拓扑结构如何影响使用NaX分子筛的PDH催化剂性能的见解。

该研究比较了两种催化剂：Pt@NaX（Pt簇封装在分子筛笼中）和Pt/NaX（Pt簇在分子筛外表面）。制备方法显著影响催化剂性能：

1. 丙烷转化率：在520°C和550°C下，Pt/NaX的转化率明显高于Pt@NaX。

2. 丙烯选择性：Pt/NaX保持稳定的67.0%选择性，而Pt@NaX仅达到43.0%。

3. 催化剂稳定性：Pt/NaX表现出更高的稳定性，积碳量更少（2.8%），而Pt@NaX为3.5%。

导致性能改善的关键因素包括：

1. Pt簇的位置：外部放置（Pt/NaX）导致更好的活性和选择性。
2. 分子筛骨架效应：Pt@NaX中的周围骨架钝化了Pt簇，降低了其活性。
3. 产物脱附：从Pt/NaX更容易脱附丙烯有助于提高选择性。

虽然这项研究集中在NaX分子筛上，但制备方法和金属-分子筛相互作用如何影响催化剂性能的原理可能适用于其他类型的分子筛，包括BEA和硅铝磷酸盐，用于PDH反应。
