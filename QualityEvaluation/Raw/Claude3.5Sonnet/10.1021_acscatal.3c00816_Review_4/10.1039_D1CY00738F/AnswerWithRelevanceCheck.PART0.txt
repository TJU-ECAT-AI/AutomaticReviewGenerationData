          [1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[3] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[4] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

[5] "The d-band center of the Pt50 clusters confined in the zeolite shifts to a lower value compared with that in the gas phase, which is consistent with the Pt L3-edge XANES and Pt 4d XPS results shown in Fig. 1f and S8, respectively. The Pt clusters with a lower d-band center are inferior for the activation of propane, and thus a lower propane conversion was achieved over Pt@NaX compared with that over Pt/NaX."

[6] "For the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, the Pt/NaX catalyst with Pt clusters on the exterior of X-zeolite showed a 1100% enhancement in TOF and largely improved selectivity for propylene compared with the corresponding Pt@NaX catalyst, in which the Pt clusters were stuck to the inside of X-zeolite."

          The study primarily focuses on NaX zeolite-based catalysts rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it provides valuable insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Preparation methods: 
   - Pt@NaX: synthesized via in situ crystallization, with Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages.
   - Pt/NaX: prepared via traditional incipient impregnation, with Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior.

2. Composition and topology effects:
   - Location of Pt clusters (exterior vs. interior) significantly affects performance.
   - Zeolite framework interaction influences the electronic properties of Pt clusters.

3. Catalyst performance:
   - Propane conversion: Pt/NaX showed remarkably higher conversion than Pt@NaX at 520°C and 550°C.
   - Propylene selectivity: Pt/NaX maintained a stable 67.0% selectivity, while Pt@NaX only achieved 43.0%.
   - Turnover frequency (TOF): Pt/NaX demonstrated a 1100% enhancement compared to Pt@NaX.

4. Catalyst stability:
   - Pt/NaX exhibited higher stability with less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%).

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. Location of Pt clusters: Exterior placement (Pt/NaX) led to better activity and selectivity.
2. Electronic properties: The d-band center of Pt clusters confined in zeolite shifted to a lower value, affecting propane activation.
3. Zeolite framework effect: The surrounding framework in Pt@NaX passivated the Pt clusters, reducing their activity.
4. Product desorption: Easier propylene desorption from Pt/NaX contributed to higher selectivity.

While this study focuses on NaX zeolites, the principles of how preparation methods, metal-zeolite interactions, and electronic properties affect catalyst performance could potentially be applied to other zeolite types, including BEA and silicoaluminophosphates, for optimizing PDH catalysts.

          该研究主要关注NaX沸石基催化剂，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应。然而，它为制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响催化剂性能提供了有价值的见解：

1. 制备方法：
   - Pt@NaX：通过原位结晶合成，Pt簇封装在沸石笼中。
   - Pt/NaX：通过传统浸渍法制备，Pt簇位于沸石外表面。

2. 组成和拓扑结构效应：
   - Pt簇的位置（外部vs内部）显著影响性能。
   - 沸石骨架相互作用影响Pt簇的电子性质。

3. 催化剂性能：
   - 丙烷转化率：在520°C和550°C下，Pt/NaX的转化率明显高于Pt@NaX。
   - 丙烯选择性：Pt/NaX保持稳定的67.0%选择性，而Pt@NaX仅达到43.0%。
   - 转化频率（TOF）：Pt/NaX比Pt@NaX提高了1100%。

4. 催化剂稳定性：
   - Pt/NaX表现出更高的稳定性，积碳量更少（2.8%），而Pt@NaX为3.5%。

导致性能改善的关键因素包括：
1. Pt簇的位置：外部放置（Pt/NaX）导致更好的活性和选择性。
2. 电子性质：封闭在沸石中的Pt簇的d带中心移向较低值，影响丙烷活化。
3. 沸石骨架效应：Pt@NaX中的周围骨架钝化了Pt簇，降低了其活性。
4. 产物脱附：从Pt/NaX更容易脱附丙烯有助于提高选择性。

虽然这项研究集中在NaX沸石上，但制备方法、金属-沸石相互作用和电子性质如何影响催化剂性能的原理可能适用于其他类型的沸石，包括BEA和硅铝磷酸盐，用于优化PDH催化剂。
