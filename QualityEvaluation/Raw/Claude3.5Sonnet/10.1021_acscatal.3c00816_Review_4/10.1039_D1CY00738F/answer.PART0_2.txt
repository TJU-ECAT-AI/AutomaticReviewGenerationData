[1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "Pt@NaX indeed showed rather stable catalytic properties for CO oxidation after a prolonged reaction time of 10 h at 500 C, whereas Pt/NaX became less active after 10 h reaction at 500 C."

[3] "The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[4] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[5] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

The study primarily focuses on NaX zeolite-based catalysts rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, the findings provide insights into how preparation methods and catalyst structure influence performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation method: The study compares two preparation methods - in situ crystallization (Pt@NaX) and traditional incipient impregnation (Pt/NaX). The method significantly affects the location of Pt clusters (inside or outside the zeolite cages), which in turn influences catalyst performance.

2. Catalyst structure: Pt/NaX, with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite, showed better performance in PDH reactions compared to Pt@NaX, where Pt clusters were enclosed in zeolite cages.

3. Propylene selectivity: Pt/NaX demonstrated higher propylene selectivity (67.0%) compared to Pt@NaX (43.0%).

4. Conversion rates: Pt/NaX showed remarkably higher propane conversion rates than Pt@NaX at both 520°C and 550°C.

5. Catalyst stability: Pt/NaX exhibited better stability with less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%) after the reaction.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Location of Pt clusters (exterior vs. interior of zeolite)
- Ease of propylene desorption from Pt clusters
- Interaction between Pt clusters and the zeolite framework
- Electronic state of Pt clusters as influenced by the zeolite environment

While this study doesn't directly address BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it highlights the importance of catalyst preparation methods and metal-support interactions in designing effective PDH catalysts.

该研究主要关注NaX沸石基催化剂，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而，研究结果为丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中催化剂制备方法和结构如何影响性能提供了见解：

1. 制备方法：该研究比较了两种制备方法 - 原位结晶法（Pt@NaX）和传统浸渍法（Pt/NaX）。制备方法显著影响Pt簇的位置（沸石笼内部或外部），进而影响催化剂性能。

2. 催化剂结构：Pt簇位于沸石外部的Pt/NaX在PDH反应中表现出更好的性能，相比之下Pt簇封闭在沸石笼中的Pt@NaX性能较差。

3. 丙烯选择性：Pt/NaX表现出更高的丙烯选择性（67.0%），而Pt@NaX的选择性较低（43.0%）。

4. 转化率：在520°C和550°C两个温度下，Pt/NaX的丙烷转化率都明显高于Pt@NaX。

5. 催化剂稳定性：反应后，Pt/NaX表现出更好的稳定性，积碳量更少（2.8%），而Pt@NaX的积碳量为3.5%。

影响性能改善的关键因素包括：
- Pt簇的位置（沸石外部vs内部）
- 丙烯从Pt簇上脱附的难易程度
- Pt簇与沸石骨架之间的相互作用
- 受沸石环境影响的Pt簇电子状态

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但它强调了催化剂制备方法和金属-载体相互作用在设计有效PDH催化剂中的重要性。
