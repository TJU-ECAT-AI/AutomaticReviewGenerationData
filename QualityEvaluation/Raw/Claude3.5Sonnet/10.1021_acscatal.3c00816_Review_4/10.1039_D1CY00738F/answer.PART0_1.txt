[1] "Pt@NaX with Pt clusters enclosed in the cages of the zeolite was synthesized via in situ crystallization, which is presented in Fig. 1a, and Pt/NaX with Pt clusters on the exterior of the zeolite was prepared via the traditional incipient impregnation."

[2] "The propane conversion over the Pt/NaX catalyst, as shown in Fig. 2a, is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX at two different temperatures of 520 C and 550 C, confirming the better activity of Pt/NaX."

[3] "The selectivity of propylene over Pt/NaX decreased before 8 h and remained stable at 67.0% from 8 to 18 h, which is remarkably higher than that over Pt@NaX, exhibiting only 43.0% stable propylene selectivity."

[4] "The carbon content in the different samples was calculated to be 2.8% for Pt/NaX and 3.5% for Pt@NaX after the reaction, respectively, indicating less coke deposition with high stability for Pt/NaX."

The study does not specifically address BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does provide insights into how preparation methods and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance for PDH using NaX zeolites.

The preparation method significantly affects catalyst performance. Pt@NaX, prepared by in situ crystallization with Pt clusters enclosed in zeolite cages, showed lower propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Pt/NaX, prepared by traditional incipient impregnation with Pt clusters on the zeolite exterior.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Pt cluster location: Exterior Pt clusters (Pt/NaX) showed better activity and selectivity than enclosed clusters (Pt@NaX).

2. Zeolite framework interaction: The surrounding zeolitic framework passivated enclosed Pt clusters, lowering their d-band center and reducing propane activation ability.

3. Product desorption: Exterior Pt clusters allowed easier propylene desorption, improving selectivity and reducing coke formation.

4. Stability: Pt/NaX showed less coke deposition (2.8%) compared to Pt@NaX (3.5%), indicating higher stability.

While this study focused on NaX zeolites, the principles of metal-zeolite interactions and their effects on catalytic performance could potentially be applied to other zeolite types, including BEA and silicoaluminophosphates, for optimizing PDH catalysts.

这项研究并没有具体讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于制备方法和沸石拓扑结构如何影响使用NaX沸石的PDH催化剂性能的见解。

制备方法显著影响催化剂性能。通过原位结晶法制备的Pt@NaX（Pt簇封装在沸石笼中）与通过传统浸渍法制备的Pt/NaX（Pt簇在沸石外表面）相比，显示出较低的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. Pt簇位置：外部Pt簇（Pt/NaX）表现出比封装簇（Pt@NaX）更好的活性和选择性。

2. 沸石骨架相互作用：周围的沸石骨架钝化了封装的Pt簇，降低了它们的d带中心，减弱了丙烷的活化能力。

3. 产物脱附：外部Pt簇允许丙烯更容易脱附，提高了选择性并减少了积碳形成。

4. 稳定性：Pt/NaX显示出较少的积碳沉积（2.8%），而Pt@NaX为3.5%，表明前者具有更高的稳定性。

虽然这项研究集中在NaX沸石上，但金属-沸石相互作用及其对催化性能影响的原理可能适用于其他类型的沸石，包括BEA和硅铝磷酸盐，以优化PDH催化剂。
