[1] "Recently, several regulation strategies of SMSI have been newly developed. Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations homogeneously distributed in a well-defined crystal, metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on thermally and chemically stable oxides are readily formed upon calcination and reduction."

[2] "Additionally, altering the defect amounts of supports has been demonstrated to regulate the SMSI. For Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts, previous results have shown that coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ (Al3+ penta) sites abounding on the (100) facets of the γ-Al2O3 surface serve as anchoring sites of Pt."

[3] "Recently, a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for the PDH reaction has been synthesized by An-Hui Lu and coworkers, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets as a support that is rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions. Such Al2O3 nanosheets exhibit extraordinary performance in decentralizing and stabilizing raft-like PtSn clusters with increasing electron density of Pt sites and electronic interactions between the two metals"

The literature does not provide specific information about BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does discuss some general principles about zeolite-based catalysts that may be applicable:

1. Preparation methods: Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations in well-defined crystals can lead to highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on thermally and chemically stable oxide supports after calcination and reduction.

2. Composition: The presence of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites on the support surface can serve as anchoring sites for active metals like Pt.

3. Support structure: Using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions as a support can help decentralize and stabilize active metal clusters.

4. Metal-support interactions: Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) can be regulated by altering the defect amounts in the support material.

5. Bimetallic systems: PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on Al2O3 sheets have shown high activity and stability, with increased electron density of Pt sites and enhanced electronic interactions between the two metals.

These factors contribute to improved catalyst performance by enhancing metal dispersion, stabilizing active sites, and modulating electronic properties. However, the specific effects on propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability would depend on the exact zeolite composition and structure, which are not detailed for BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in this text.

文献中没有提供关于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢反应中的具体信息。然而,它确实讨论了一些关于沸石基催化剂的一般原则,这些原则可能适用:

1. 制备方法:使用具有可交换金属阳离子的矿物型前驱体在明确定义的晶体中,可在煅烧和还原后在热稳定和化学稳定的氧化物载体上形成高度分散的金属纳米粒子。

2. 组成:载体表面存在配位不饱和的五配位Al3+位点可以作为活性金属(如Pt)的锚定位点。

3. 载体结构:使用富含五配位Al3+离子的γ-Al2O3纳米片作为载体可以帮助分散和稳定活性金属簇。

4. 金属-载体相互作用:可以通过改变载体材料中的缺陷数量来调节强金属-载体相互作用(SMSI)。

5. 双金属系统:以Al2O3片为载体的PtSn双金属催化剂表现出高活性和稳定性,Pt位点的电子密度增加,两种金属之间的电子相互作用增强。

这些因素通过增强金属分散、稳定活性位点和调节电子性质来促进催化剂性能的改善。然而,对丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的具体影响将取决于沸石的确切组成和结构,而本文中并未详细说明BEA和硅铝磷酸盐沸石的这些特性。
