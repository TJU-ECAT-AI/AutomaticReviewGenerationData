[1] "Bert M. Weckhuysen and coworkers summarized the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ethane, propane, butane, etc.) on metals and metal oxides before 2014, providing a very comprehensive introduction."

[5] "KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h).66,83 As displayed in Fig. 14i, the apparent Pt dispersion decreases with reduction time, especially from 0 to 6 h. The decrease in exposed surface Pt should be caused by the formation of PtSn interactions in a scenario in which partially reduced Sn species interact with the external surfaces of the Pt clusters."

The literature provides some insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Zeolite topology: The MFI topology (ZSM-5) appears to be commonly used for PDH catalysts. There is also mention of SAPO-34, which has a chabazite (CHA) topology.

2. Composition: Most catalysts mentioned contain platinum (Pt) as the active metal, often promoted with tin (Sn) or sodium (Na). The Pt loading is typically low (0.4-0.5 wt%), while promoter loadings vary.

3. Preparation methods: The literature mentions embedding Pt and Sn within the zeolite structure (KPtSn@MFI), which helps maintain atomic dispersion of Pt.

4. Performance:
   - Propylene selectivity ranges from 79% to 96%, with MFI-based catalysts generally showing higher selectivity.
   - Conversion rates vary widely, from 15% to 70%.
   - Stability, as indicated by the deactivation rate constant (kd), varies significantly between catalysts.

5. Key factors for improved performance:
   - Atomic dispersion of Pt seems to be crucial for catalyst stability and performance.
   - The interaction between Pt and Sn, particularly when Sn is partially reduced, appears to play a role in controlling Pt dispersion and exposure.
   - The zeolite structure (e.g., MFI) likely helps in confining and stabilizing the active metal species.

However, the literature does not provide detailed information specifically on BEA topology or a comprehensive comparison of different zeolite types. More research would be needed to fully understand the impact of various zeolite topologies on PDH performance.

该文献为我们提供了一些关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能的见解：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：MFI拓扑结构（ZSM-5）似乎是PDH催化剂常用的。文中还提到了SAPO-34，它具有方沸石（CHA）拓扑结构。

2. 组成：大多数提到的催化剂含有铂（Pt）作为活性金属，通常用锡（Sn）或钠（Na）进行促进。Pt的负载量通常较低（0.4-0.5 wt%），而促进剂的负载量则有所不同。

3. 制备方法：文献提到将Pt和Sn嵌入沸石结构中（KPtSn@MFI），这有助于保持Pt的原子分散性。

4. 性能：
   - 丙烯选择性范围从79%到96%，基于MFI的催化剂通常表现出更高的选择性。
   - 转化率差异很大，从15%到70%不等。
   - 稳定性，以失活率常数（kd）表示，在不同催化剂之间差异显著。

5. 提高性能的关键因素：
   - Pt的原子分散性似乎对催化剂的稳定性和性能至关重要。
   - Pt和Sn之间的相互作用，特别是当Sn部分还原时，似乎在控制Pt的分散和暴露方面发挥作用。
   - 沸石结构（如MFI）可能有助于限制和稳定活性金属物种。

然而，该文献并未提供关于BEA拓扑结构的详细信息，也没有对不同类型沸石进行全面比较。需要进行更多研究以充分了解各种沸石拓扑结构对PDH性能的影响。

[1] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

[2] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h)."

[3] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."

[4] "Recently, Jeffrey T. Miller and coworkers demonstrated a clear subsurface effect over two different intermetallic PtMn catalysts with different subsurfaces."

The literature provides some insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for MFI and MCM-22 topologies. However, there is limited specific information on BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Synthesis approach: An innovative method to generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms within purely siliceous MCM-22 during zeolite growth resulted in remarkably high thermal stability.

2. Composition: The addition of potassium (K) in PtSn@MFI catalysts helps maintain atomic dispersion of Pt species after calcination, whereas K-free samples show Pt agglomeration into nanoparticles.

3. Stability: KPtSn@MFI catalysts demonstrated high catalytic performance maintained over at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.

4. Subsurface effects: Different intermetallic PtMn catalysts with varying subsurfaces showed clear influences on catalyst performance, highlighting the importance of considering not only surface but also subsurface composition.

These factors contribute to improved catalyst performance by enhancing metal dispersion, thermal stability, and resistance to deactivation. However, more specific research on BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions would be needed to draw conclusions about their particular influences on catalyst performance.

文献提供了一些关于制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构如何影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能的见解，特别是对于MFI和MCM-22拓扑结构。然而，关于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石的具体信息有限。

影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 合成方法：在沸石生长过程中，在纯硅MCM-22内生成Pt纳米粒子和单原子Pt的创新方法，使得催化剂具有显著高的热稳定性。

2. 成分：在PtSn@MFI催化剂中添加钾(K)有助于在焙烧后保持Pt物种的原子分散性，而不含K的样品显示Pt聚集成纳米粒子。

3. 稳定性：KPtSn@MFI催化剂展示了在至少三个反应-再生循环中保持高催化性能，没有明显的失活。

4. 亚表面效应：具有不同亚表面的不同金属间化合物PtMn催化剂显示出对催化剂性能的明显影响，突出了考虑表面和亚表面成分的重要性。

这些因素通过提高金属分散度、热稳定性和抗失活性来改善催化剂性能。然而，需要对BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的具体研究，才能得出关于它们对催化剂性能的特定影响的结论。

The literature does not provide specific information about zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, the document does discuss some general principles of catalyst design that may be relevant to zeolite-based catalysts:

1. Preparation methods: The use of mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations can lead to highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on thermally and chemically stable oxide supports after calcination and reduction.

2. Composition: Partial substitution of metal cations with two different kinds of metal ions can produce bimetallic catalysts with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys and modulate the interaction between the active metal (e.g., Pt) and supports.

3. Support structure: Altering the defect amounts in supports can regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). For example, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions as a support led to a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH.

These principles could potentially be applied to zeolite-based catalysts to improve their performance in PDH reactions. Key factors that may contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. High dispersion of active metal species
2. Modulation of metal-support interactions
3. Controlled defect engineering in the support structure
4. Bimetallic compositions to enhance catalytic properties

However, specific information about the influence of zeolite topology and the performance of BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions is not provided in the given literature.

The literature does not provide specific information about the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on the performance of BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The document mainly focuses on metal and metal oxide-based catalysts, particularly platinum and chromium oxide catalysts, rather than zeolite-based catalysts.

However, the literature does mention some general principles that could be applied to zeolite-based catalysts:

1. The preparation method can significantly influence catalyst performance. Using mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations can lead to highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on thermally and chemically stable oxides.

2. Surface organometallic chemistry can be used to generate well-defined surface species on various supports, which could potentially be applied to zeolite-based catalysts.

3. The support structure plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. For example, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions as a support led to a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst for PDH.

4. Strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) can be regulated to improve catalyst performance, which could potentially be applied to zeolite-supported metal catalysts.

To fully answer the question about zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, additional research focusing specifically on these materials in PDH reactions would be needed.
