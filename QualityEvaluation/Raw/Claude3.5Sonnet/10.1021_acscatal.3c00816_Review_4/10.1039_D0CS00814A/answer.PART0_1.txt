[1] "Avelino Corma and coworkers found an innovative approach that can generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms with remarkably high thermal stability, formed within purely siliceous MCM-22 during the growth of a two-dimensional zeolite into three dimensions."

[2] "After calcination in air, Pt species in the K-free PtSn@MFI sample agglomerate into nanoparticles, while the Pt species in the KPtSn@MFI sample remain atomically dispersed (Fig. 14g and h)."

[3] "Consequently, the high catalytic performance of KPtSn@MFI can be maintained for at least three reactionregeneration cycles without obvious deactivation."

[4] "Recently, Jeffrey T. Miller and coworkers demonstrated a clear subsurface effect over two different intermetallic PtMn catalysts with different subsurfaces."

The literature provides some insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for MFI and MCM-22 topologies. However, there is limited specific information on BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Synthesis approach: An innovative method to generate Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms within purely siliceous MCM-22 during zeolite growth resulted in remarkably high thermal stability.

2. Composition: The addition of potassium (K) in PtSn@MFI catalysts helps maintain atomic dispersion of Pt species after calcination, whereas K-free samples show Pt agglomeration into nanoparticles.

3. Stability: KPtSn@MFI catalysts demonstrated high catalytic performance maintained over at least three reaction-regeneration cycles without obvious deactivation.

4. Subsurface effects: Different intermetallic PtMn catalysts with varying subsurfaces showed clear influences on catalyst performance, highlighting the importance of considering not only surface but also subsurface composition.

These factors contribute to improved catalyst performance by enhancing metal dispersion, thermal stability, and resistance to deactivation. However, more specific research on BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions would be needed to draw conclusions about their particular influences on catalyst performance.

文献提供了一些关于制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构如何影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能的见解，特别是对于MFI和MCM-22拓扑结构。然而，关于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石的具体信息有限。

影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 合成方法：在沸石生长过程中，在纯硅MCM-22内生成Pt纳米粒子和单原子Pt的创新方法，使得催化剂具有显著高的热稳定性。

2. 成分：在PtSn@MFI催化剂中添加钾(K)有助于在焙烧后保持Pt物种的原子分散性，而不含K的样品显示Pt聚集成纳米粒子。

3. 稳定性：KPtSn@MFI催化剂展示了在至少三个反应-再生循环中保持高催化性能，没有明显的失活。

4. 亚表面效应：具有不同亚表面的不同金属间化合物PtMn催化剂显示出对催化剂性能的明显影响，突出了考虑表面和亚表面成分的重要性。

这些因素通过提高金属分散度、热稳定性和抗失活性来改善催化剂性能。然而，需要对BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的具体研究，才能得出关于它们对催化剂性能的特定影响的结论。
