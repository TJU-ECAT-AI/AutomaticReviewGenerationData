The literature does not provide specific information about zeolite-based catalysts, particularly BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, the document does discuss some general principles of catalyst design that may be relevant to zeolite-based catalysts:

1. Preparation methods: The use of mineral-type precursors with exchangeable metal cations can lead to highly dispersed metal nanoparticles on thermally and chemically stable oxide supports after calcination and reduction.

2. Composition: Partial substitution of metal cations with two different kinds of metal ions can produce bimetallic catalysts with highly dispersed metal/metal alloys and modulate the interaction between the active metal (e.g., Pt) and supports.

3. Support structure: Altering the defect amounts in supports can regulate the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). For example, using γ-Al2O3 nanosheets rich in pentacoordinate Al3+ ions as a support led to a highly active and stable PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH.

These principles could potentially be applied to zeolite-based catalysts to improve their performance in PDH reactions. Key factors that may contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. High dispersion of active metal species
2. Modulation of metal-support interactions
3. Controlled defect engineering in the support structure
4. Bimetallic compositions to enhance catalytic properties

However, specific information about the influence of zeolite topology and the performance of BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions is not provided in the given literature.

文献中没有提供关于沸石基催化剂，特别是BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的具体信息。然而，文献确实讨论了一些可能与沸石基催化剂相关的催化剂设计的一般原则：

1. 制备方法：使用具有可交换金属阳离子的矿物型前驱体可以在煅烧和还原后在热稳定和化学稳定的氧化物载体上形成高度分散的金属纳米颗粒。

2. 组成：用两种不同的金属离子部分替代金属阳离子可以产生具有高度分散的金属/金属合金的双金属催化剂，并调节活性金属（如Pt）与载体之间的相互作用。

3. 载体结构：改变载体中的缺陷数量可以调节强金属-载体相互作用（SMSI）。例如，使用富含五配位Al3+离子的γ-Al2O3纳米片作为载体，可以制得高活性和稳定性的PtSn/Al2O3片状PDH催化剂。

这些原则可能适用于沸石基催化剂，以提高它们在PDH反应中的性能。可能有助于提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 活性金属物种的高度分散
2. 金属-载体相互作用的调节
3. 载体结构中的可控缺陷工程
4. 双金属组成以增强催化性能

然而，给定的文献中没有提供关于沸石拓扑结构的影响以及BEA和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中性能的具体信息。
