[1] "ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are synthesized by performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to HZSM-5 and HY using diethyl zinc and water as the precursors."

[2] "On 1c-ZnO-ZSM-5 the pyridine adsorption band at 1550 cm1 is reduced by 80% compared to the parent HZSM-5 zeolite. This means that on ZSM-5 the BAS are only partially removed after the modification by ZnO ALD."

[3] "After the ALD fabrication the peak at 1455 cm1 becomes much more noticeable, which is an indication of the greatly increased number of LAS from the deposited ZnO."

[4] "The conversion of propane on the Y zeolite modified by different cycles of ZnO ALD increases in the sequence: 1c-ZnO-Y < 3c-ZnO-Y < 2c-ZnO-Y."

[5] "Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite and high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."

The literature provided does not specifically discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does offer insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites modified with ZnO for propane conversion.

The preparation method using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO on HZSM-5 and HY zeolites significantly influences their catalytic performance. This method allows for precise control of ZnO loading and dispersion.

The composition of the catalysts, particularly the ZnO content and its interaction with the zeolite structure, plays a crucial role in their performance. The ALD process introduces highly dispersed ZnO species, predominantly as isolated Zn(OH)+ species after the first cycle.

Zeolite topology significantly affects the catalyst's performance. ZSM-5 and Y zeolites show different behaviors due to their distinct pore structures. Y zeolite, with larger pores, allows for more extensive ZnO deposition throughout the structure, while ZSM-5's smaller pores limit ZnO deposition primarily to the first ALD cycle.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates include:

1. The presence of ZnO species, which promote dehydrogenation reactions.
2. The balance between Brønsted acid sites (BAS) and Lewis acid sites (LAS). ZnO ALD increases LAS while partially or completely removing BAS, depending on the zeolite type.
3. The dispersion and form of ZnO species, with isolated Zn(OH)+ species appearing more effective than larger ZnO clusters.

Catalyst stability is a challenge, with rapid deactivation observed due to coke formation, sintering of ZnO species, and ZnO evaporation, particularly in Y zeolites.

While this information provides valuable insights into zeolite-based catalysts for propane conversion, it does not directly address the specific performance of BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions.

所提供的文献并未具体讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构如何影响经ZnO修饰的ZSM-5和Y沸石在丙烷转化中性能的见解。

使用原子层沉积(ALD)方法在HZSM-5和HY沸石上沉积ZnO的制备方法显著影响其催化性能。这种方法允许精确控制ZnO的负载量和分散度。

催化剂的成分，特别是ZnO含量及其与沸石结构的相互作用，在其性能中起着至关重要的作用。ALD过程引入高度分散的ZnO物种，在第一个循环后主要以孤立的Zn(OH)+物种形式存在。

沸石拓扑结构显著影响催化剂的性能。由于孔结构不同，ZSM-5和Y沸石表现出不同的行为。Y沸石由于孔径较大，允许ZnO在整个结构中更广泛地沉积，而ZSM-5的较小孔径主要将ZnO沉积限制在第一个ALD循环中。

提高丙烯选择性和转化率的关键因素包括：

1. ZnO物种的存在，促进脱氢反应。
2. Brønsted酸位点(BAS)和Lewis酸位点(LAS)之间的平衡。ZnO ALD增加LAS，同时部分或完全移除BAS，具体取决于沸石类型。
3. ZnO物种的分散度和形态，孤立的Zn(OH)+物种似乎比较大的ZnO簇更有效。

催化剂稳定性是一个挑战，观察到由于结焦、ZnO物种烧结和ZnO蒸发（特别是在Y沸石中）而导致的快速失活。

虽然这些信息为丙烷转化中的沸石基催化剂提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未直接涉及BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的具体性能。
