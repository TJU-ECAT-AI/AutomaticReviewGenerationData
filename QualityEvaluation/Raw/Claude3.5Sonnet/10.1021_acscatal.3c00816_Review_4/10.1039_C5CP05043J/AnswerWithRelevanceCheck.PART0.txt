          [1] "ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are synthesized by performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to HZSM-5 and HY using diethyl zinc and water as the precursors."

[2] "Introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."

[3] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."

[4] "These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites."

[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

          Although the literature does not directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, it provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites modified with ZnO for propane conversion:

1. Preparation method: Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) allows precise control over ZnO deposition, resulting in highly dispersed ZnO species on zeolites.

2. Composition: ZnO introduction significantly improves catalytic activity. The balance between ZnO species (for dehydrogenation) and Brønsted acid sites (for oligomerization and cyclization) is crucial.

3. Zeolite topology: Y zeolite shows higher selectivity to propylene, while ZSM-5 achieves high selectivities to aromatics, due to differences in pore structures and acid site distributions.

4. Key factors for improved performance:
   a. ZnO species promote dehydrogenation reactions
   b. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective than larger ZnO clusters
   c. 1-2 ALD cycles perform better than multiple cycles
   d. Balance between Lewis acid sites (from ZnO) and Brønsted acid sites

5. Catalyst stability: Rapid deactivation occurs due to coke formation, presenting a challenge for long-term use.

These findings, while specific to ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites, provide insights that may be applicable to optimizing other zeolite-based catalysts, including those with BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate compositions, for PDH reactions.

          虽然该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，但它提供了关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响ZnO改性的ZSM-5和Y沸石在丙烷转化中性能的见解：

1. 制备方法：原子层沉积（ALD）允许精确控制ZnO的沉积，在沸石上形成高度分散的ZnO物种。

2. 组成：引入ZnO显著提高了催化活性。ZnO物种（用于脱氢）和布朗斯特酸位点（用于齐聚和环化）之间的平衡至关重要。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：由于孔结构和酸位分布的差异，Y沸石对丙烯表现出更高的选择性，而ZSM-5对芳烃实现了高选择性。

4. 改善性能的关键因素：
   a. ZnO物种促进脱氢反应
   b. 孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比较大的ZnO簇更有效
   c. 1-2个ALD循环比多个循环表现更好
   d. 来自ZnO的路易斯酸位点和布朗斯特酸位点之间的平衡

5. 催化剂稳定性：由于积碳导致快速失活，这对长期使用构成挑战。

这些发现虽然特定于ZnO改性的ZSM-5和Y沸石，但提供了可能适用于优化其他基于沸石的催化剂（包括具有BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐组成的催化剂）用于PDH反应的见解。
