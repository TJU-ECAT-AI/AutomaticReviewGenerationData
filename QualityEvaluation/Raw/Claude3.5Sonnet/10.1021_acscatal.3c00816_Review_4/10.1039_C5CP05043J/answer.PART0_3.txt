[1] "ALD of ZnO was performed by alternate doses of DEZ (99%, Dalian Credit Electronic Gas Co., China) and deionized water to the zeolite sample."

[2] "Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite and high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."

[3] "These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites."

[4] "For both zeolites the catalyst modified by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those modified by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."

[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

The literature primarily discusses ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for propane conversion, rather than BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn from this study:

1. Preparation method: ALD allows for precise control of ZnO deposition on zeolites, creating highly dispersed ZnO species.

2. Composition: The amount of ZnO deposited and the type of zeolite influence catalyst performance. ZnO promotes dehydrogenation, while Brønsted acid sites are necessary for subsequent reactions.

3. Zeolite topology: Y zeolite modified with ZnO produces mainly propylene, while ZSM-5 modified with ZnO yields high selectivity to aromatics.

4. Propylene selectivity and conversion rates: ZnO species promote dehydrogenation, increasing propylene production. The number of ALD cycles affects performance, with 1-2 cycles generally performing better than multiple cycles.

5. Catalyst stability: These catalysts show high initial activity but deactivate quickly. Coke formation is the primary cause of deactivation for ZSM-5-based catalysts.

Key factors for improved performance include:
- Optimizing ZnO loading and distribution
- Balancing ZnO (for dehydrogenation) and Brønsted acid sites (for further reactions)
- Controlling the number of ALD cycles
- Addressing catalyst deactivation, particularly coke formation

While this study doesn't directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, similar principles may apply in optimizing those catalysts for PDH reactions.

该文献主要讨论了通过原子层沉积（ALD）制备的ZnO改性ZSM-5和Y沸石用于丙烷转化，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而，我们可以从这项研究中得出一些见解：

1. 制备方法：ALD允许精确控制ZnO在沸石上的沉积，创造高度分散的ZnO物种。

2. 组成：沉积的ZnO数量和沸石类型影响催化剂性能。ZnO促进脱氢，而Brønsted酸位对后续反应是必要的。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：ZnO改性的Y沸石主要产生丙烯，而ZnO改性的ZSM-5对芳烃具有高选择性。

4. 丙烯选择性和转化率：ZnO物种促进脱氢，增加丙烯产量。ALD循环次数影响性能，1-2个循环通常比多个循环表现更好。

5. 催化剂稳定性：这些催化剂显示出高初始活性，但快速失活。积碳是ZSM-5基催化剂失活的主要原因。

改善性能的关键因素包括：
- 优化ZnO负载量和分布
- 平衡ZnO（用于脱氢）和Brønsted酸位（用于进一步反应）
- 控制ALD循环次数
- 解决催化剂失活问题，特别是积碳形成

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但类似的原理可能适用于优化这些催化剂用于PDH反应。
