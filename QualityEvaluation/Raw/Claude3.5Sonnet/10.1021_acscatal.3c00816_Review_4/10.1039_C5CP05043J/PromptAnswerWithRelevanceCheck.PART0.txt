[1] "ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are synthesized by performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to HZSM-5 and HY using diethyl zinc and water as the precursors."

[2] "Particularly, zinc modified zeolites are effective catalysts for dehydrogenation and aromatization of light alkanes."

[3] "Introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."

[4] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."

[5] "Despite their impressive initial catalytic performances, deactivations are rather fast for these ALD ZnO modified zeolites. Coke formation is the primary reason for the deactivation of the ZSM-5 supported ALD ZnO catalyst."

The literature does not directly discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of ZSM-5 and Y zeolite-based catalysts in propane conversion reactions, which can be related to propane dehydrogenation.

Preparation method: The study used atomic layer deposition (ALD) to modify ZSM-5 and Y zeolites with ZnO. This method allows for precise control over the amount and dispersion of ZnO species on the zeolites.

Composition: The introduction of ZnO species significantly improved the catalytic activities of both zeolites. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species were found to be more effective for propane conversion than larger ZnO clusters.

Zeolite topology: The different pore structures of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites influenced the deposition of ZnO and the resulting catalytic performance. ZSM-5 (with smaller pores) showed high selectivity to aromatics, while Y zeolite (with larger pores) primarily produced propylene.

Key factors for improved performance:

1. Propylene selectivity: Y zeolite modified with ZnO showed high selectivity to propylene, likely due to its larger pore structure and the complete elimination of Brønsted acid sites.

2. Conversion rates: Both zeolites showed significantly improved activities after ZnO modification. The number of ALD cycles (1-2) was optimal for better performance.

3. Catalyst stability: Despite high initial activity, both catalysts deactivated rapidly. Coke formation was the primary reason for deactivation in ZSM-5, while Y zeolite suffered from coke formation, sintering of the catalytic phase, and ZnO evaporation.

These findings suggest that optimizing the preparation method, controlling the zinc species' nature and distribution, and selecting appropriate zeolite topology are crucial for developing effective propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷分子筛在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于制备方法、组成和分子筛拓扑结构如何影响ZSM-5和Y型分子筛基催化剂在丙烷转化反应中性能的见解，这些可以与丙烷脱氢反应相关联。

制备方法：该研究使用原子层沉积（ALD）技术在ZSM-5和Y型分子筛上修饰ZnO。这种方法可以精确控制ZnO物种在分子筛上的数量和分散度。

组成：引入ZnO物种显著提高了两种分子筛的催化活性。研究发现，孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比较大的ZnO簇更有效地转化丙烷。

分子筛拓扑结构：ZSM-5和Y型分子筛的不同孔道结构影响了ZnO的沉积和最终的催化性能。ZSM-5（孔径较小）表现出对芳烃的高选择性，而Y型分子筛（孔径较大）主要生成丙烯。

提高性能的关键因素：

1. 丙烯选择性：经ZnO修饰的Y型分子筛对丙烯表现出高选择性，这可能是由于其较大的孔道结构和布朗斯特酸位的完全消除。

2. 转化率：两种分子筛在ZnO修饰后都显示出显著提高的活性。1-2次ALD循环次数对性能提升最为理想。

3. 催化剂稳定性：尽管初始活性高，但两种催化剂都快速失活。ZSM-5的失活主要原因是积碳，而Y型分子筛则受到积碳、催化相烧结和ZnO蒸发的综合影响。

这些发现表明，优化制备方法、控制锌物种的性质和分布以及选择适当的分子筛拓扑结构对开发有效的丙烷脱氢催化剂至关重要。

The literature discusses ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for propane conversion, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites specifically. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Preparation method: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to synthesize ZnO-modified zeolites, which allows for precise control of ZnO loading and distribution.

2. Composition: ZnO species are introduced onto the zeolite surface, with isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed after the first ALD cycle.

3. Zeolite topology: ZSM-5 (MFI) and Y (FAU) zeolites are studied, showing different behaviors due to their pore structures.

4. Performance in propane dehydrogenation:
   - ZnO modification significantly improves catalytic activity for both zeolites.
   - Y zeolite shows high selectivity to propylene, while ZSM-5 produces more aromatics.
   - ZnO species promote dehydrogenation, while Brønsted acid sites are necessary for subsequent reactions.

5. Key factors for improved performance:
   - Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective than larger ZnO clusters.
   - Catalysts with 1-2 ALD cycles perform better than those with multiple cycles.
   - Balance between ZnO species (for dehydrogenation) and Brønsted acid sites (for oligomerization and cyclization) is crucial.

6. Catalyst stability: The study mentions rapid deactivation due to coke formation, suggesting that stability remains a challenge for these catalysts.

While this information is not directly about BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it provides insights into how zeolite modification, composition, and topology can influence PDH performance, which may be applicable to other zeolite types as well.

The literature primarily discusses ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key factors contributing to improved performance can be inferred:

1. Preparation method: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) allows for precise control over ZnO deposition, resulting in highly dispersed ZnO species on the zeolites.

2. Composition: The introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. ZnO promotes the dehydrogenation reaction, while Brønsted acid sites are required for subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions.

3. Zeolite topology: Y zeolite shows higher selectivity to propylene, while ZSM-5 achieves high selectivities to aromatics. This difference is attributed to the complete elimination of Brønsted acid sites in Y zeolite, compared to partial removal in ZSM-5.

4. Key factors for improved performance:
   a. Acid site distribution: The balance between Lewis acid sites (from ZnO) and Brønsted acid sites influences product selectivity.
   b. ZnO species dispersion: Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective than larger ZnO clusters.
   c. Number of ALD cycles: 1-2 cycles perform better than multiple cycles, suggesting that smaller, more dispersed ZnO species are preferable.

These findings, while specific to ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites, provide insights into factors that may also influence the performance of other zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions.

[2] "On 1c-ZnO-ZSM-5 the pyridine adsorption band at 1550 cm1 is reduced by 80% compared to the parent HZSM-5 zeolite. This means that on ZSM-5 the BAS are only partially removed after the modification by ZnO ALD."

[3] "After the ALD fabrication the peak at 1455 cm1 becomes much more noticeable, which is an indication of the greatly increased number of LAS from the deposited ZnO."

The literature provided does not specifically discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. However, it does offer insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites modified with ZnO for propane conversion.

The preparation method using atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO on HZSM-5 and HY zeolites significantly influences their catalytic performance. This method allows for precise control of ZnO loading and dispersion.

The composition of the catalysts, particularly the ZnO content and its interaction with the zeolite structure, plays a crucial role in their performance. The ALD process introduces highly dispersed ZnO species, predominantly as isolated Zn(OH)+ species after the first cycle.

Zeolite topology significantly affects the catalyst's performance. ZSM-5 and Y zeolites show different behaviors due to their distinct pore structures. Y zeolite, with larger pores, allows for more extensive ZnO deposition throughout the structure, while ZSM-5's smaller pores limit ZnO deposition primarily to the first ALD cycle.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates include:

1. The presence of ZnO species, which promote dehydrogenation reactions.
2. The balance between Brønsted acid sites (BAS) and Lewis acid sites (LAS). ZnO ALD increases LAS while partially or completely removing BAS, depending on the zeolite type.
3. The dispersion and form of ZnO species, with isolated Zn(OH)+ species appearing more effective than larger ZnO clusters.

Catalyst stability is a challenge, with rapid deactivation observed due to coke formation, sintering of ZnO species, and ZnO evaporation, particularly in Y zeolites.

While this information provides valuable insights into zeolite-based catalysts for propane conversion, it does not directly address the specific performance of BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions.

所提供的文献并未具体讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用。然而，它确实提供了关于制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构如何影响经ZnO修饰的ZSM-5和Y沸石在丙烷转化中性能的见解。

使用原子层沉积(ALD)方法在HZSM-5和HY沸石上沉积ZnO的制备方法显著影响其催化性能。这种方法允许精确控制ZnO的负载量和分散度。

催化剂的成分，特别是ZnO含量及其与沸石结构的相互作用，在其性能中起着至关重要的作用。ALD过程引入高度分散的ZnO物种，在第一个循环后主要以孤立的Zn(OH)+物种形式存在。

沸石拓扑结构显著影响催化剂的性能。由于孔结构不同，ZSM-5和Y沸石表现出不同的行为。Y沸石由于孔径较大，允许ZnO在整个结构中更广泛地沉积，而ZSM-5的较小孔径主要将ZnO沉积限制在第一个ALD循环中。

提高丙烯选择性和转化率的关键因素包括：

1. ZnO物种的存在，促进脱氢反应。
2. Brønsted酸位点(BAS)和Lewis酸位点(LAS)之间的平衡。ZnO ALD增加LAS，同时部分或完全移除BAS，具体取决于沸石类型。
3. ZnO物种的分散度和形态，孤立的Zn(OH)+物种似乎比较大的ZnO簇更有效。

催化剂稳定性是一个挑战，观察到由于结焦、ZnO物种烧结和ZnO蒸发（特别是在Y沸石中）而导致的快速失活。

虽然这些信息为丙烷转化中的沸石基催化剂提供了宝贵的见解，但它并未直接涉及BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的具体性能。
