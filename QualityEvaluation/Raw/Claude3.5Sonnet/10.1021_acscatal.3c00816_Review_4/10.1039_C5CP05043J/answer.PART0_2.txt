[1] "ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are synthesized by performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to HZSM-5 and HY using diethyl zinc and water as the precursors."

[2] "Incorporation of ZnO into Y zeolite by ALD completely eliminates the Brnsted acid sites and increases the number of strong Lewis acid sites. Similar effects are obtained on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5 except that the Brnsted acid sites are only partially removed."

[3] "Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5. These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites."

[4] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."

The literature primarily discusses ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key factors contributing to improved performance can be inferred:

1. Preparation method: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) allows for precise control over ZnO deposition, resulting in highly dispersed ZnO species on the zeolites.

2. Composition: The introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. ZnO promotes the dehydrogenation reaction, while Brønsted acid sites are required for subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions.

3. Zeolite topology: Y zeolite shows higher selectivity to propylene, while ZSM-5 achieves high selectivities to aromatics. This difference is attributed to the complete elimination of Brønsted acid sites in Y zeolite, compared to partial removal in ZSM-5.

4. Key factors for improved performance:
   a. Acid site distribution: The balance between Lewis acid sites (from ZnO) and Brønsted acid sites influences product selectivity.
   b. ZnO species dispersion: Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective than larger ZnO clusters.
   c. Number of ALD cycles: 1-2 cycles perform better than multiple cycles, suggesting that smaller, more dispersed ZnO species are preferable.

These findings, while specific to ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites, provide insights into factors that may also influence the performance of other zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions.

该文献主要讨论了通过原子层沉积（ALD）制备的ZnO改性ZSM-5和Y沸石用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，而非BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而，我们可以推断出一些影响性能改进的关键因素：

1. 制备方法：原子层沉积（ALD）允许精确控制ZnO的沉积，在沸石上形成高度分散的ZnO物种。

2. 组成：引入ZnO物种显著提高了两种沸石的活性。ZnO促进脱氢反应，而布朗斯特酸位点则需要进行后续的齐聚和环化反应。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：Y沸石对丙烯表现出更高的选择性，而ZSM-5对芳烃实现了高选择性。这种差异归因于Y沸石中布朗斯特酸位点的完全消除，相比之下ZSM-5中仅部分消除。

4. 改善性能的关键因素：
   a. 酸位分布：来自ZnO的路易斯酸位点和布朗斯特酸位点之间的平衡影响产品选择性。
   b. ZnO物种分散：孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比较大的ZnO簇更有效。
   c. ALD循环次数：1-2个循环比多个循环表现更好，表明更小、更分散的ZnO物种更为理想。

这些发现虽然特定于ZnO改性的ZSM-5和Y沸石，但为其他基于沸石的催化剂在PDH反应中的性能影响因素提供了见解。
