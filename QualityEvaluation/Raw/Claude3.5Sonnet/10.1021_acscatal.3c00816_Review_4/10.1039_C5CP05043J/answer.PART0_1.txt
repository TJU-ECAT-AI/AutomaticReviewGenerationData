[1] "ZnO modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites are synthesized by performing atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO to HZSM-5 and HY using diethyl zinc and water as the precursors."

[2] "Introduction of ZnO species significantly improves the activities of both zeolites. Propylene is the major reaction product on ALD ZnO modified Y zeolite while high selectivities to aromatics are achieved on ALD ZnO modified ZSM-5."

[3] "These results suggest that ZnO species merely promote the dehydrogenation reaction while the subsequent oligomerization and cyclization reactions require Brnsted acid sites."

[4] "For both zeolites the catalyst fabricated by only 1 or 2 cycles of ZnO ALD performs better than those fabricated by multiple cycles of ALD, indicating that isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective for the conversion of propane to propylene and aromatics."

The literature discusses ZnO-modified ZSM-5 and Y zeolites prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) for propane conversion, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites specifically. However, some insights can be drawn:

1. Preparation method: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to synthesize ZnO-modified zeolites, which allows for precise control of ZnO loading and distribution.

2. Composition: ZnO species are introduced onto the zeolite surface, with isolated Zn(OH)+ species formed after the first ALD cycle.

3. Zeolite topology: ZSM-5 (MFI) and Y (FAU) zeolites are studied, showing different behaviors due to their pore structures.

4. Performance in propane dehydrogenation:
   - ZnO modification significantly improves catalytic activity for both zeolites.
   - Y zeolite shows high selectivity to propylene, while ZSM-5 produces more aromatics.
   - ZnO species promote dehydrogenation, while Brønsted acid sites are necessary for subsequent reactions.

5. Key factors for improved performance:
   - Isolated Zn(OH)+ species are more effective than larger ZnO clusters.
   - Catalysts with 1-2 ALD cycles perform better than those with multiple cycles.
   - Balance between ZnO species (for dehydrogenation) and Brønsted acid sites (for oligomerization and cyclization) is crucial.

6. Catalyst stability: The study mentions rapid deactivation due to coke formation, suggesting that stability remains a challenge for these catalysts.

While this information is not directly about BEA and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it provides insights into how zeolite modification, composition, and topology can influence PDH performance, which may be applicable to other zeolite types as well.

该文献讨论了通过原子层沉积(ALD)制备的ZnO改性ZSM-5和Y沸石用于丙烷转化，而非特定讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石。但是，我们可以从中得到一些见解：

1. 制备方法：使用原子层沉积(ALD)合成ZnO改性沸石，这允许精确控制ZnO的负载量和分布。

2. 组成：在沸石表面引入ZnO物种，在第一个ALD循环后形成孤立的Zn(OH)+物种。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：研究了ZSM-5 (MFI)和Y (FAU)沸石，由于它们的孔结构不同而表现出不同的行为。

4. 丙烷脱氢性能：
   - ZnO改性显著提高了两种沸石的催化活性。
   - Y沸石对丙烯表现出高选择性，而ZSM-5产生更多芳烃。
   - ZnO物种促进脱氢反应，而布朗斯特酸位点对后续反应是必要的。

5. 提高性能的关键因素：
   - 孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比较大的ZnO簇更有效。
   - 经过1-2个ALD循环的催化剂比多个循环的表现更好。
   - ZnO物种（用于脱氢）和布朗斯特酸位点（用于寡聚和环化）之间的平衡至关重要。

6. 催化剂稳定性：研究提到由于积碳导致的快速失活，表明稳定性仍然是这些催化剂面临的挑战。

虽然这些信息不是直接关于BEA和硅铝磷酸盐沸石的，但它提供了关于沸石改性、组成和拓扑结构如何影响PDH性能的见解，这可能适用于其他类型的沸石。
