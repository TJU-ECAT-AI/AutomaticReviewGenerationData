The literature does not directly discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, it does provide insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of ZSM-5 and Y zeolite-based catalysts in propane conversion reactions, which can be related to propane dehydrogenation.

Preparation method: The study used atomic layer deposition (ALD) to modify ZSM-5 and Y zeolites with ZnO. This method allows for precise control over the amount and dispersion of ZnO species on the zeolites.

Composition: The introduction of ZnO species significantly improved the catalytic activities of both zeolites. Isolated Zn(OH)+ species were found to be more effective for propane conversion than larger ZnO clusters.

Zeolite topology: The different pore structures of ZSM-5 and Y zeolites influenced the deposition of ZnO and the resulting catalytic performance. ZSM-5 (with smaller pores) showed high selectivity to aromatics, while Y zeolite (with larger pores) primarily produced propylene.

Key factors for improved performance:

1. Propylene selectivity: Y zeolite modified with ZnO showed high selectivity to propylene, likely due to its larger pore structure and the complete elimination of Brønsted acid sites.

2. Conversion rates: Both zeolites showed significantly improved activities after ZnO modification. The number of ALD cycles (1-2) was optimal for better performance.

3. Catalyst stability: Despite high initial activity, both catalysts deactivated rapidly. Coke formation was the primary reason for deactivation in ZSM-5, while Y zeolite suffered from coke formation, sintering of the catalytic phase, and ZnO evaporation.

These findings suggest that optimizing the preparation method, controlling the zinc species' nature and distribution, and selecting appropriate zeolite topology are crucial for developing effective propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷分子筛在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。然而，它提供了关于制备方法、组成和分子筛拓扑结构如何影响ZSM-5和Y型分子筛基催化剂在丙烷转化反应中性能的见解，这些可以与丙烷脱氢反应相关联。

制备方法：该研究使用原子层沉积（ALD）技术在ZSM-5和Y型分子筛上修饰ZnO。这种方法可以精确控制ZnO物种在分子筛上的数量和分散度。

组成：引入ZnO物种显著提高了两种分子筛的催化活性。研究发现，孤立的Zn(OH)+物种比较大的ZnO簇更有效地转化丙烷。

分子筛拓扑结构：ZSM-5和Y型分子筛的不同孔道结构影响了ZnO的沉积和最终的催化性能。ZSM-5（孔径较小）表现出对芳烃的高选择性，而Y型分子筛（孔径较大）主要生成丙烯。

提高性能的关键因素：

1. 丙烯选择性：经ZnO修饰的Y型分子筛对丙烯表现出高选择性，这可能是由于其较大的孔道结构和布朗斯特酸位的完全消除。

2. 转化率：两种分子筛在ZnO修饰后都显示出显著提高的活性。1-2次ALD循环次数对性能提升最为理想。

3. 催化剂稳定性：尽管初始活性高，但两种催化剂都快速失活。ZSM-5的失活主要原因是积碳，而Y型分子筛则受到积碳、催化相烧结和ZnO蒸发的综合影响。

这些发现表明，优化制备方法、控制锌物种的性质和分布以及选择适当的分子筛拓扑结构对开发有效的丙烷脱氢催化剂至关重要。
