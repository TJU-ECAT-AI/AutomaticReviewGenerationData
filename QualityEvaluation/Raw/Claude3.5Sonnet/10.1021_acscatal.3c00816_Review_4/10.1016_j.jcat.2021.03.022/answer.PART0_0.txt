[1] "Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications."

[2] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."

[3] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

[4] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

[5] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals"

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Encapsulation of subnanometric clusters: Single atoms and ultrasmall clusters encapsulated within zeolite pores or cages enhance stability and broaden catalytic applications.

2. Framework-Sn anchoring: Using framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation results in confined Pt subnanometric clusters.

3. Zeolite pore restrictions and Sn electronic effect: These factors inhibit coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, leading to excellent stability in PDH reactions.

4. Joint confinement effect: The combination of Sn and zeolite topology provides a unique confinement effect, resulting in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

5. Carrier selection and metal additives: Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are effective strategies for providing confinement effects and prohibiting metal growth.

These factors contribute to improved catalyst performance by maintaining high propane conversion rates (90% of maximum conversion over 250 hours) and excellent propene selectivity (99%) in PDH reactions.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 亚纳米簇的包封：包封在沸石孔道或笼中的单原子和超小簇可显著提高稳定性并拓宽催化应用。

2. 骨架Sn锚定：利用Beta沸石中的骨架Sn在浸渍过程中锚定铂前体，形成受限的Pt亚纳米簇。

3. 沸石孔道限制和Sn电子效应：这些因素抑制了超细Pt簇的积炭和烧结，从而在PDH反应中表现出优异的稳定性。

4. 联合限制效应：Sn和沸石拓扑结构的组合提供了独特的限制效应，使得催化剂在PDH反应中具有高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。

5. 载体选择和金属添加剂：选择适当的载体和添加第二种金属添加剂是提供限制效应和抑制金属生长的有效策略。

这些因素通过在PDH反应中保持高丙烷转化率（250小时内保持最大转化率的90%）和优异的丙烯选择性（99%）来提高催化剂性能。
