The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. In this study, the focus is on Beta zeolite (BEA topology) with incorporated framework Sn.

The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:

1. Anchoring effect: The framework Sn in Beta zeolite anchors Pt precursors during impregnation, leading to the formation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters after reduction.

2. Confinement effect: The zeolite pores provide a physical restriction that inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

3. Electronic effect: Sn species interact electronically with Pt, further enhancing stability and performance.

4. Specific active sites: The formation of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] species and their subsequent reduction to (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15) within the pore walls of BEA crystals contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

These factors combined result in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions. The Pt@Sn-Beta catalyst demonstrated excellent stability, maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours with 99% propene selectivity.

The study highlights the importance of the synergistic effect between the zeolite topology (BEA in this case) and the incorporation of heteroatoms (Sn) in creating an effective support for highly dispersed metal catalysts. This approach allows for the confinement of subnanometric Pt clusters, which is crucial for enhancing catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。本研究重点关注含有骨架Sn的Beta沸石（BEA拓扑结构）。

提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 锚定效应：Beta沸石中的骨架Sn在浸渍过程中锚定Pt前驱体，还原后形成Sn-Beta限制的Pt亚纳米簇。

2. 限制效应：沸石孔道提供物理限制，抑制积碳形成和Pt簇的烧结。

3. 电子效应：Sn物种与Pt产生电子相互作用，进一步增强稳定性和性能。

4. 特定活性位点：在BEA晶体孔壁中形成(Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]物种，并随后还原为(Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15)，这contributes to了催化剂的有效性。

这些因素的结合产生了高活性、高选择性和高稳定性的PDH反应催化剂。Pt@Sn-Beta催化剂表现出出色的稳定性，在250小时内保持最大丙烷转化率的90%，丙烯选择性达99%。

研究强调了沸石拓扑结构（本例中为BEA）与杂原子（Sn）掺杂之间的协同效应在创建高分散金属催化剂有效载体方面的重要性。这种方法允许限制亚纳米Pt簇，这对于提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能至关重要。
