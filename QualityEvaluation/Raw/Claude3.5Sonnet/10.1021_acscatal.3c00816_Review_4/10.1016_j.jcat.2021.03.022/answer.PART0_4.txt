[1] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."

[2] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

[3] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

[4] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

[5] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:

1. Use of framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation, resulting in confined Pt subnanometric clusters.

2. The combination of zeolite pore restrictions and the electronic effect of Sn, which inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

3. The unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, leading to highly active, selective, and stable catalysts.

4. The use of supported Pt catalysts, which are active for C-H activation but less active for unfavorable C-C cracking.

5. The addition of Sn as an outstanding additive, providing both geometric and electronic effects. Sn prevents the collision of movable Pt active sites and facilitates electron transfer to Pt atoms.

These factors collectively contribute to excellent stability in PDH reactions, maintaining high propane conversion rates (90% of maximum) over extended periods (250 h) with high propene selectivity (99%).

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂的性能有显著影响。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 利用Beta沸石中的骨架Sn锚定铂前体，在浸渍过程中形成受限的Pt亚纳米簇。

2. 沸石孔道限制和Sn的电子效应相结合，抑制了焦炭形成和Pt簇的烧结。

3. Sn和沸石拓扑结构的独特联合限制效应，导致催化剂具有高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。

4. 使用负载型Pt催化剂，对C-H活化具有活性，但对不利的C-C断裂活性较低。

5. 添加Sn作为优秀的添加剂，提供几何和电子效应。Sn防止可移动Pt活性位点的碰撞，并促进电子向Pt原子转移。

这些因素共同作用，使PDH反应具有优异的稳定性，在长时间（250小时）内保持高丙烷转化率（最大值的90%）和高丙烯选择性（99%）。
