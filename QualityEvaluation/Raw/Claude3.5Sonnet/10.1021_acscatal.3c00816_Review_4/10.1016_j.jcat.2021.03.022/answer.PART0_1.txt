[1] "Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications."

[2] "We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction."

[3] "The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity."

[4] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals"

[5] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."

[6] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Encapsulation of subnanometric clusters: Single atoms and ultrasmall clusters encapsulated within zeolite pores or cages enhance stability and broaden catalytic applications.

2. Framework-Sn anchoring: Utilizing framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor platinum precursors during impregnation leads to the formation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters.

3. Confinement effect: Zeolite pores and the electronic effect of Sn inhibit coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, resulting in excellent stability in PDH reactions.

4. Choice of carriers and additives: Selecting appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive provide confinement effects and prevent metal growth.

5. Sn as an outstanding additive: For supported Pt catalysts, Sn imposes both geometric and electronic effects, preventing collision of Pt active sites and modifying electronic properties through electron transfer.

6. Joint confinement effect: The combination of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

These factors contribute to maintaining high propane conversion rates (90% of maximum conversion over 250 hours) and excellent propene selectivity (99%) in PDH reactions using Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能有显著影响，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石。提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 亚纳米簇的包封：包封在沸石孔道或笼中的单原子和超小簇可以显著提高稳定性并拓宽催化应用。

2. 骨架Sn锚定：利用Beta沸石中的骨架Sn在浸渍过程中锚定铂前驱体，形成Sn-Beta限制的Pt亚纳米簇。

3. 限制效应：沸石孔道和Sn的电子效应抑制了焦炭形成和超细Pt簇的烧结，从而在PDH反应中获得优异的稳定性。

4. 载体和添加剂的选择：选择适当的载体并添加第二种金属添加剂可提供限制效应并防止金属生长。

5. Sn作为优秀添加剂：对于负载型Pt催化剂，Sn既提供几何效应又提供电子效应，防止Pt活性位点碰撞并通过电子转移修饰电子性质。

6. 联合限制效应：Sn和沸石拓扑结构的组合产生了高活性、高选择性和高稳定性的PDH反应催化剂。

这些因素有助于在使用Pt@Sn-Beta催化剂的PDH反应中保持高丙烷转化率（250小时内保持最大转化率的90%）和优异的丙烯选择性（99%）。
