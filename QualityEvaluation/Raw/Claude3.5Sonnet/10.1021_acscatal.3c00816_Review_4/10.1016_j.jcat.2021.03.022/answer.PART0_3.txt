[1] "Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals"

[2] "Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts"

[3] "For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact."

[4] "Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction."

[5] "Specially, the solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]  species was revealed in the present study, which is the first report disclosing how framework Sn atoms are interacting with Pt species."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Carrier selection: Microporous zeolites with crystalline structure, large surface area, and well-defined pore channels provide an intrinsic confinement effect, making them excellent carriers for metal catalysts.

2. Metal additives: Adding a second metal, such as Sn to Pt catalysts, can enhance performance. Sn provides both geometric effects (preventing Pt active site collision) and electronic effects (electron transfer to Pt atoms).

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology, in particular, can help confine metal clusters within its structure, improving catalyst stability and performance.

4. Preparation method: The study describes a method of trapping subnanometric Pt clusters in Sn-Beta zeolite using wet impregnation followed by direct hydrogen reduction. This method relies on high framework Sn content to provide anchors for Pt species.

5. Metal-framework interactions: The formation of specific species like (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] demonstrates how framework Sn atoms interact with Pt species, contributing to improved catalyst performance.

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能受到几个与制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构相关的因素影响：

1. 载体选择：具有晶体结构、大比表面积和明确孔道的微孔沸石提供了内在的限域效应，使其成为金属催化剂的优秀载体。

2. 金属添加剂：添加第二种金属（如在Pt催化剂中添加Sn）可以提高性能。Sn提供几何效应（防止Pt活性位点碰撞）和电子效应（向Pt原子转移电子）。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：特别是BEA拓扑结构可以帮助将金属簇限制在其结构内，提高催化剂的稳定性和性能。

4. 制备方法：研究描述了一种通过湿法浸渍followed直接氢还原将亚纳米Pt簇捕获在Sn-Beta沸石中的方法。该方法依赖于高框架Sn含量为Pt物种提供锚点。

5. 金属-框架相互作用：特定物种如(Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]的形成展示了框架Sn原子如何与Pt物种相互作用，从而提高催化剂性能。

这些因素共同促进了PDH反应中丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提高。Sn和沸石拓扑结构的独特联合限域效应产生了高活性、高选择性和高稳定性的PDH反应催化剂。
