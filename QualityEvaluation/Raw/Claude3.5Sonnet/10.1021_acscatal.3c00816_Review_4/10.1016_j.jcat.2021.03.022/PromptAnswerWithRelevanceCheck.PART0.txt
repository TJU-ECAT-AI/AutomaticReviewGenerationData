The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. In this study, the focus is on Beta zeolite (BEA topology) with incorporated framework Sn.

The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:

1. Anchoring effect: The framework Sn in Beta zeolite anchors Pt precursors during impregnation, leading to the formation of Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters after reduction.

2. Confinement effect: The zeolite pores provide a physical restriction that inhibits coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

3. Electronic effect: Sn species interact electronically with Pt, further enhancing stability and performance.

4. Specific active sites: The formation of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] species and their subsequent reduction to (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15) within the pore walls of BEA crystals contributes to the catalyst's effectiveness.

These factors combined result in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions. The Pt@Sn-Beta catalyst demonstrated excellent stability, maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 hours with 99% propene selectivity.

The study highlights the importance of the synergistic effect between the zeolite topology (BEA in this case) and the incorporation of heteroatoms (Sn) in creating an effective support for highly dispersed metal catalysts. This approach allows for the confinement of subnanometric Pt clusters, which is crucial for enhancing catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 锚定效应：Beta沸石中的骨架Sn在浸渍过程中锚定Pt前驱体，还原后形成Sn-Beta限制的Pt亚纳米簇。

2. 限制效应：沸石孔道提供物理限制，抑制积碳形成和Pt簇的烧结。

3. 电子效应：Sn物种与Pt产生电子相互作用，进一步增强稳定性和性能。

4. 特定活性位点：在BEA晶体孔壁中形成(Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]物种，并随后还原为(Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=1-15)，这contributes to了催化剂的有效性。

这些因素的结合产生了高活性、高选择性和高稳定性的PDH反应催化剂。Pt@Sn-Beta催化剂表现出出色的稳定性，在250小时内保持最大丙烷转化率的90%，丙烯选择性达99%。

研究强调了沸石拓扑结构（本例中为BEA）与杂原子（Sn）掺杂之间的协同效应在创建高分散金属催化剂有效载体方面的重要性。这种方法允许限制亚纳米Pt簇，这对于提高PDH反应中的催化剂性能至关重要。

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Carrier selection: Microporous zeolites with crystalline structure, large surface area, and well-defined pore channels provide an intrinsic confinement effect, making them excellent carriers for metal catalysts.

2. Metal additives: Adding a second metal, such as Sn to Pt catalysts, can enhance performance. Sn provides both geometric effects (preventing Pt active site collision) and electronic effects (electron transfer to Pt atoms).

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology, in particular, can help confine metal clusters within its structure, improving catalyst stability and performance.

4. Preparation method: The study describes a method of trapping subnanometric Pt clusters in Sn-Beta zeolite using wet impregnation followed by direct hydrogen reduction. This method relies on high framework Sn content to provide anchors for Pt species.

5. Metal-framework interactions: The formation of specific species like (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] demonstrates how framework Sn atoms interact with Pt species, contributing to improved catalyst performance.

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology results in highly active, selective, and stable catalysts for PDH reactions.
