[1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows superior performance compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5. Its unique structure with weak surface acidity and most acid sites located in side pores makes it inert toward dehydrogenation while providing excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene.

2. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared using a sequential impregnation method, which allows for better control of metal dispersion and interaction with the support.

3. Composition: The presence of both Pt and Sn in the catalyst is crucial. The optimal ratio of these metals contributes to improved catalyst performance.

4. Acidity: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si), are responsible for catalytic activity. The weak acidity of SAPO-34 helps in achieving higher propylene selectivity without promoting undesired side reactions.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between the metals (Pt and Sn) and the SAPO-34 support plays a significant role in catalyst stability and activity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by:

1. Providing shape selectivity for propylene formation
2. Minimizing unwanted side reactions due to weak acidity
3. Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
4. Promoting the desired dehydrogenation pathway through optimal metal-support interactions

The unique properties of SAPO-34 as a support, combined with the synergistic effects of Pt and Sn, result in a catalyst system that offers superior performance in PDH reactions compared to other zeolite-based catalysts.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：作为硅铝磷沸石的SAPO-34相比其他沸石如ZSM-5表现出更优异的性能。其独特的结构具有弱表面酸性，大多数酸性位点位于侧孔中，使其对脱氢反应惰性，同时为丙烯提供了优秀的形状选择性机会。

2. 制备方法：双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂采用序贯浸渍法制备，这种方法可以更好地控制金属分散度和与载体的相互作用。

3. 组成：催化剂中同时存在Pt和Sn至关重要。这些金属的最佳比例有助于提高催化剂性能。

4. 酸性：SAPO-34中的Brønsted酸性位点基于两种不同的羟基（Al和Si的OH桥），负责催化活性。SAPO-34的弱酸性有助于实现更高的丙烯选择性，同时不会促进不需要的副反应。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：金属（Pt和Sn）与SAPO-34载体之间的相互作用在催化剂稳定性和活性方面起着重要作用。

这些因素通过以下方式提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性：

1. 为丙烯形成提供形状选择性
2. 由于弱酸性而最小化不需要的副反应
3. 增强金属分散度和稳定性
4. 通过最佳的金属-载体相互作用促进所需的脱氢途径

The literature discusses several factors influencing the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly focusing on PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows advantages over other supports like ZSM-5 or amorphous materials. Its unique structure provides better stereochemistry control and shape selectivity for propylene.

2. Surface acidity: SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, with most acid sites located in side pores. This makes it relatively inert towards dehydrogenation while still providing excellent shape-selective properties for propylene.

3. Bimetallic composition: The use of PtSn as the active metals improves catalyst performance. Sn acts as a promoter, modifying Pt electronic density and retarding coke formation.

4. Acid site distribution: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyl bridges to Al and Si, are responsible for catalytic activity. This influences the propane dehydrogenation mechanism, which is proposed to occur via propoxy species.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between Pt, Sn, and the SAPO-34 support plays a crucial role in catalyst stability and activity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The SAPO-34 topology, in particular, offers advantages in terms of weak acidity and shape selectivity, which are key to achieving high propylene yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.
