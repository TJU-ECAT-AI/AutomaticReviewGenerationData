[1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts of different metallic contents were prepared by sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34"

[4] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows superior performance compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5. Its unique structure with weak surface acidity and most acid sites located in side pores makes it inert toward dehydrogenation while providing excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene.

2. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared using a sequential impregnation method, which allows for better control of metal dispersion and interaction with the support.

3. Composition: The presence of both Pt and Sn in the catalyst is crucial. The optimal ratio of these metals contributes to improved catalyst performance.

4. Acidity: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si), are responsible for catalytic activity. The weak acidity of SAPO-34 helps in achieving higher propylene selectivity without promoting undesired side reactions.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between the metals (Pt and Sn) and the SAPO-34 support plays a significant role in catalyst stability and activity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by:

1. Providing shape selectivity for propylene formation
2. Minimizing unwanted side reactions due to weak acidity
3. Enhancing metal dispersion and stability
4. Promoting the desired dehydrogenation pathway through optimal metal-support interactions

The unique properties of SAPO-34 as a support, combined with the synergistic effects of Pt and Sn, result in a catalyst system that offers superior performance in PDH reactions compared to other zeolite-based catalysts.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受以下几个因素影响：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：作为硅铝磷沸石的SAPO-34相比其他沸石如ZSM-5表现出更优异的性能。其独特的结构具有弱表面酸性，大多数酸性位点位于侧孔中，使其对脱氢反应惰性，同时为丙烯提供了优秀的形状选择性机会。

2. 制备方法：双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂采用序贯浸渍法制备，这种方法可以更好地控制金属分散度和与载体的相互作用。

3. 组成：催化剂中同时存在Pt和Sn至关重要。这些金属的最佳比例有助于提高催化剂性能。

4. 酸性：SAPO-34中的Brønsted酸性位点基于两种不同的羟基（Al和Si的OH桥），负责催化活性。SAPO-34的弱酸性有助于实现更高的丙烯选择性，同时不会促进不需要的副反应。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：金属（Pt和Sn）与SAPO-34载体之间的相互作用在催化剂稳定性和活性方面起着重要作用。

这些因素通过以下方式提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性：

1. 为丙烯形成提供形状选择性
2. 由于弱酸性而最小化不需要的副反应
3. 增强金属分散度和稳定性
4. 通过最佳的金属-载体相互作用促进所需的脱氢途径

SAPO-34作为载体的独特性质，结合Pt和Sn的协同作用，形成了一个在PDH反应中性能优于其他沸石基催化剂的催化体系。
