[1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."

[3] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[4] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

The literature discusses several factors influencing the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly focusing on PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows advantages over other supports like ZSM-5 or amorphous materials. Its unique structure provides better stereochemistry control and shape selectivity for propylene.

2. Surface acidity: SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, with most acid sites located in side pores. This makes it relatively inert towards dehydrogenation while still providing excellent shape-selective properties for propylene.

3. Bimetallic composition: The use of PtSn as the active metals improves catalyst performance. Sn acts as a promoter, modifying Pt electronic density and retarding coke formation.

4. Acid site distribution: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyl bridges to Al and Si, are responsible for catalytic activity. This influences the propane dehydrogenation mechanism, which is proposed to occur via propoxy species.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between Pt, Sn, and the SAPO-34 support plays a crucial role in catalyst stability and activity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The SAPO-34 topology, in particular, offers advantages in terms of weak acidity and shape selectivity, which are key to achieving high propylene yields while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

文献讨论了几个影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中性能的因素，特别关注PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34作为硅铝磷酸盐沸石，相比ZSM-5或无定形材料等其他载体显示出优势。其独特的结构提供了更好的立体化学控制和对丙烯的形状选择性。

2. 表面酸度：SAPO-34具有弱表面酸度，大多数酸性位点位于侧孔中。这使其对脱氢反应相对惰性，同时仍能为丙烯提供优秀的形状选择性。

3. 双金属组成：使用PtSn作为活性金属可改善催化剂性能。Sn作为助剂，可以修饰Pt的电子密度并抑制积碳形成。

4. 酸性位点分布：SAPO-34中的Brønsted酸性位点基于与Al和Si的两种不同羟基桥，负责催化活性。这影响了丙烷脱氢机理，据推测是通过丙氧基物种进行的。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：Pt、Sn与SAPO-34载体之间的相互作用在催化剂稳定性和活性方面起着关键作用。

这些因素共同促进了PDH反应中丙烯选择性的提高、转化率的增加和催化剂稳定性的改善。特别是SAPO-34拓扑结构在弱酸性和形状选择性方面具有优势，这是实现高丙烯产率同时最小化不良副反应的关键。
