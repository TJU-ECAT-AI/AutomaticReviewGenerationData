[1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[3] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

[4] "The dehydrogenation performance of PtSn-based catalysts depends largely on the interactions between the Pt, Sn, and also the support."

[5] "The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits on metal sites to support. It is only possible when the metals interacted well with the support. Moreover, Sn modifies Pt ensembles by decreasing surface area and reduces carbonmetal bonds/interaction and allows the intermediates to move easily to support."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Support material: Different zeolite supports like ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 have varying effects on catalyst performance. SAPO-34 is particularly advantageous due to its weak surface acidity and shape-selective properties for propylene.

2. Metal interactions: The performance of PtSn-based catalysts heavily depends on the interactions between Pt, Sn, and the support material. These interactions affect the dispersion and stability of active metal sites.

3. Acidity: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, formed by hydroxyl bridges to Al and Si in the framework, play a crucial role in catalyst activity. The weak surface acidity of SAPO-34 makes it less prone to unwanted side reactions.

4. Metal loading and distribution: The amount and distribution of Pt and Sn on the support affect catalyst performance. Optimal metal loading and dispersion are crucial for improved propylene selectivity and conversion rates.

5. Coke formation management: The presence of Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metal sites to the support, which helps maintain catalyst stability and longevity.

6. Preparation method: The sequential impregnation method used in the study allows for better control of metal loading and distribution on the support.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by optimizing the balance between active sites, acidity, and resistance to coking. The unique properties of SAPO-34, combined with the synergistic effects of Pt and Sn, result in a catalyst with superior performance in PDH reactions.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到与制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构相关的几个因素的影响：

1. 载体材料：不同的沸石载体如ZSM-5和SAPO-34对催化剂性能有不同的影响。SAPO-34由于其弱表面酸性和对丙烯的形状选择性特性而特别有优势。

2. 金属相互作用：PtSn基催化剂的性能在很大程度上取决于Pt、Sn和载体材料之间的相互作用。这些相互作用影响活性金属位点的分散和稳定性。

3. 酸性：SAPO-34中由框架中Al和Si的羟基桥形成的Brønsted酸位在催化剂活性中起着关键作用。SAPO-34的弱表面酸性使其不易发生不需要的副反应。

4. 金属负载和分布：Pt和Sn在载体上的数量和分布影响催化剂性能。最佳的金属负载和分散对提高丙烯选择性和转化率至关重要。

5. 积碳管理：Sn的存在促进了碳沉积物从金属位点向载体的转移，有助于保持催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

6. 制备方法：研究中使用的序列浸渍法可以更好地控制金属在载体上的负载和分布。

这些因素通过优化活性位点、酸性和抗积碳性之间的平衡，有助于提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。SAPO-34的独特性质，结合Pt和Sn的协同效应，使得这种催化剂在PDH反应中表现出优越的性能。
