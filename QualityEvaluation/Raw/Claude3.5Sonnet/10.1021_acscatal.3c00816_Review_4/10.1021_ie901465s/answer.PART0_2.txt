[1] "The advantages of novel PtSn/SAPO-34 and its better stereochemistry control over propane and butane dehydrogenation to propylene was well explained in previous studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[3] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

[4] "The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts of different metallic contents were prepared by sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34"

[5] "It is impressive that the Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metallic sites to support, and in this way improves catalyst stability."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is significantly influenced by preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology. For SAPO-34 catalysts, key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts are prepared using a sequential impregnation method, which allows for better control of metal distribution.

2. Composition: The presence of Pt and Sn on SAPO-34 support enhances catalyst performance. Sn acts as a promoter, modifying Pt electronic density and retarding coke formation. The optimal Sn content was found to be around 1 wt%.

3. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34 has a unique structure with weak surface acidity and most acid sites located in side pores. This makes it relatively inert towards dehydrogenation while providing excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene.

4. Acidity: The Brønsted acid sites of SAPO-34, based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si), are responsible for catalytic activity. The weak acidity helps minimize unwanted side reactions.

5. Coke resistance: Sn facilitates the transfer of carbon deposits from metallic sites to the support, improving catalyst stability and longevity.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts in PDH reactions, offering better stereochemistry control and improved propylene selectivity compared to other zeolite-based catalysts.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。对于SAPO-34催化剂，提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂采用序列浸渍法制备，可以更好地控制金属分布。

2. 成分：Pt和Sn在SAPO-34载体上的存在增强了催化剂性能。Sn作为助剂，可以修饰Pt的电子密度并抑制积碳形成。最佳Sn含量约为1 wt%。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34具有独特的结构，表面酸性弱，大多数酸性位点位于侧孔中。这使得它对脱氢反应相对惰性，同时为丙烯提供了出色的形状选择机会。

4. 酸性：SAPO-34的Brønsted酸性位点基于两种不同的羟基（Al和Si的OH桥），负责催化活性。弱酸性有助于最小化不需要的副反应。

5. 抗积碳性：Sn促进碳沉积物从金属位点转移到载体，提高了催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

这些因素共同促进了PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在PDH反应中的卓越性能，与其他沸石基催化剂相比，提供了更好的立体化学控制和更高的丙烯选择性。
