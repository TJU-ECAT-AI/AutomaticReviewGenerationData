[1] "PtSn-based catalysts supported on amorphous (Al2O3, SiO2, etc.) and zeolites (ZSM-5, SAPO-34, etc.) supports were discussed in many studies."

[2] "SAPO-34-supported catalyst is inherently free from the above-discussed drawbacks. Moreover, SAPO-34 has weak surface acidity, as most of the acid sites exist in side pores (make it inert toward dehydrogenation) and have excellent shape-selective opportunities for propylene."

[3] "The Brnsted acid sites of SAPO-34 were found to be responsible for their activities and based on two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si) on the structural framework; therefore, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation was proposed on the basis of propoxy species."

[4] "The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts of different metallic contents were prepared by sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34"

[5] "It is observed that the Sn content has a large influence upon catalyst stability and the dehydrogenation activity. With increase in the Sn loading, the gradual increase in selectivity toward propylene was noted up to 1 wt %, and later declined"

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite, shows superior performance compared to other zeolites like ZSM-5. SAPO-34's weak surface acidity and unique pore structure make it inert towards dehydrogenation while providing excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

2. Composition: The bimetallic PtSn combination supported on SAPO-34 shows improved performance. The Sn content significantly influences catalyst stability and dehydrogenation activity, with an optimal loading of 1 wt% Sn providing the best propylene selectivity.

3. Preparation method: Sequential impregnation is used to prepare PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts, allowing for controlled metal loading and distribution.

4. Acid sites: The Brønsted acid sites in SAPO-34, formed by two distinct hydroxyls (OH bridges to Al and Si), are responsible for catalytic activity. The propane dehydrogenation mechanism is proposed to involve propoxy species.

5. Metal-support interaction: The interaction between Pt, Sn, and the SAPO-34 support plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. Sn helps modify Pt ensembles and improves catalyst stability.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Optimal metal loading (particularly Sn content)
2. Weak surface acidity of SAPO-34
3. Shape selectivity provided by SAPO-34's pore structure
4. Synergistic effects between Pt and Sn
5. Improved resistance to coke formation due to Sn promotion

These factors combined result in a catalyst with high propylene selectivity, good conversion rates, and improved stability for PDH reactions.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34，一种硅铝磷酸盐沸石，相比其他沸石如ZSM-5表现出更优异的性能。SAPO-34的弱表面酸性和独特的孔结构使其对脱氢反应惰性，同时为丙烯提供了优异的形状选择性。

2. 组成：负载在SAPO-34上的双金属PtSn组合显示出改进的性能。Sn含量显著影响催化剂稳定性和脱氢活性，1 wt%的Sn负载量提供最佳的丙烯选择性。

3. 制备方法：采用序列浸渍法制备PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂，可以控制金属负载量和分布。

4. 酸性位点：SAPO-34中的Brønsted酸性位点，由两种不同的羟基（Al和Si的OH桥）形成，负责催化活性。丙烷脱氢机理被提议涉及丙氧基物种。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：Pt、Sn与SAPO-34载体之间的相互作用在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。Sn有助于修饰Pt集合体并提高催化剂稳定性。

提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 最佳金属负载量（特别是Sn含量）
2. SAPO-34的弱表面酸性
3. SAPO-34孔结构提供的形状选择性
4. Pt和Sn之间的协同效应
5. 由于Sn促进作用而提高的抗结焦能力

这些因素的结合导致了一种具有高丙烯选择性、良好转化率和改进稳定性的PDH反应催化剂。
