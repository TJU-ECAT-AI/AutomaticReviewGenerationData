[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "For In-CHA with varying Si/Al ratios (Fig. 4a and S11), the H2/In ratios are close to 1.0, confirming that In2O3 in the CHA zeolite can be reduced to replace BASs and form isolated In+ when In/Al ratios  1.0 (independently of the Si/Al ratio)."

[3] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[4] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on PDH performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite framework was found to be superior to other zeolite frameworks (including BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Composition: 
   - The Si/Al ratio affects performance. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA is beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.
   - An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates.
   - The In/Al ratio is important. Isolated In+ sites form when In/Al ratios ≤ 1.0, regardless of the Si/Al ratio.

3. Preparation method: The study used incipient wetness impregnation followed by calcination and reduction to prepare In-CHA catalysts.

4. Performance:
   - In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - In-CHA has a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol), contributing to improved propylene selectivity.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include the formation of isolated In+ sites in the CHA framework, optimized Si/Al and In/Al ratios, and the unique properties of the CHA zeolite structure. These factors lead to enhanced propylene selectivity, improved conversion rates, and better catalyst stability compared to other supports.

该文献主要关注了In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。然而，我们可以从中获得一些关于制备方法、组成和分子筛拓扑结构对PDH性能影响的见解：

1. 分子筛拓扑结构：CHA分子筛框架在脱氢反应中优于其他分子筛框架（包括BEA、MFI和MOR）。

2. 组成：
   - Si/Al比影响性能。CHA中较高的Si/Al比有利于PDH反应，因为它减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。
   - 富铝的In-CHA分子筛（Si/Al = 6.85）提供了更高的脱氢速率。
   - In/Al比很重要。当In/Al比≤1.0时，无论Si/Al比如何，都会形成孤立的In+位点。

3. 制备方法：该研究使用浸渍法，随后进行焙烧和还原来制备In-CHA催化剂。

4. 性能：
   - 与In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3相比，In-CHA表现出更好的稳定性和C3H6选择性（85%）。
   - In-CHA具有较低的C3H8脱氢活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和较高的C3H8裂解活化能（206 kJ/mol），有助于提高丙烯选择性。

提高性能的关键因素包括在CHA框架中形成孤立的In+位点、优化的Si/Al和In/Al比以及CHA分子筛结构的独特性质。这些因素导致了与其他载体相比，丙烯选择性提高、转化率改善和催化剂稳定性增强。

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on PDH performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite is reported to be superior to other frameworks like BEA, MFI, and MOR for dehydrogenation reactions. The small pore size and cage structure of CHA appear to contribute to its improved performance.

2. Composition: The Si/Al ratio plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA is beneficial for PDH, as it decreases the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations. This suggests that isolated In+ sites are more effective for PDH.

3. Preparation method: The formation of extra-framework In+ cations is facilitated by the Brønsted acid sites (BASs) in H-CHA. These In+ cations are stabilized in extra-framework positions and prevent the deep reduction of In2O3 to In(0), which is less active for PDH.

4. Catalyst performance: In-CHA catalysts show better stability and propylene selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3. This improved performance is attributed to a low activation energy for propane dehydrogenation and a high activation energy for propane cracking.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Isolated In+ sites in extra-framework positions
2. High Si/Al ratio in the CHA framework
3. Prevention of deep reduction to In(0)
4. Small pore size and cage structure of CHA zeolite

While the literature does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH, the principles of isolated active sites, appropriate framework composition, and prevention of deep reduction of the active metal species are likely to be applicable to other zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对PDH性能影响的见解：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：CHA沸石被报道优于其他框架如BEA、MFI和MOR用于脱氢反应。CHA的小孔径和笼状结构似乎有助于提高其性能。

2. 组成：Si/Al比对催化剂性能起着关键作用。CHA中较高的Si/Al比有利于PDH，因为它减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。这表明孤立的In+位点对PDH更有效。

3. 制备方法：H-CHA中的布朗斯特酸位点（BASs）促进了额外骨架In+阳离子的形成。这些In+阳离子稳定在额外骨架位置，并防止In2O3深度还原为In(0)，后者对PDH的活性较低。

4. 催化剂性能：与In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3相比，In-CHA催化剂表现出更好的稳定性和丙烯选择性（85%）。这种性能改善归因于丙烷脱氢的低活化能和丙烷裂解的高活化能。

促进提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 额外骨架位置的孤立In+位点
2. CHA框架中的高Si/Al比
3. 防止深度还原为In(0)
4. CHA沸石的小孔径和笼状结构

尽管该文献没有具体讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛用于PDH，但孤立活性位点、适当的框架组成和防止活性金属物种深度还原的原则可能适用于其他基于沸石的PDH反应催化剂。

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, but it does provide some insights into the influence of zeolite topology and composition on catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: The CHA zeolite structure is reported to be superior to other zeolite frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions, specifically for ethane dehydrogenation. This suggests that the unique structure of CHA contributes to improved catalyst performance.

2. Si/Al ratio: A higher Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolites is beneficial for PDH reactions. This is attributed to decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to better propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

3. In loading: The preparation method involving the introduction of In into CHA zeolites results in isolated In+ species, which are crucial for improved catalyst performance. The In-CHA catalysts show better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.

4. Activation energies: In-CHA catalysts demonstrate low activation energy for C3H8 dehydrogenation (94.3 kJ/mol) and high activation energy for C3H8 cracking (206 kJ/mol), contributing to improved propylene selectivity.

5. Catalyst stability: In-CHA catalysts exhibit better stability over time compared to other catalysts, with minimal coke formation.

The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in In-CHA catalysts include:

1. The unique CHA zeolite structure
2. Higher Si/Al ratios
3. Isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions
4. Low activation energy for dehydrogenation and high activation energy for cracking
5. Minimal coke formation

While the literature does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH reactions, it suggests that the principles of optimizing Si/Al ratios and achieving isolated metal species could be applied to improve the performance of other zeolite-based catalysts.

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), but it does provide some insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA topology is reported to be superior to other zeolite frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions, although this was specifically mentioned for ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Composition: 
   - The Si/Al ratio affects performance. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA is beneficial for PDH as it decreases the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.
   - The In/Al ratio influences the catalyst's performance. As the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0, the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation decreases, indicating that In+ species dominate the reaction.

3. Preparation method: The literature describes a method where In2O3 is first formed on the external surface of the zeolite, then reduced and diffused into the micropores, displacing Brønsted acid sites to form isolated In+ species.

4. Performance:
   - In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - In-CHA exhibits a low activation energy for propane dehydrogenation (94.3 kJ/mol) and a high activation energy for propane cracking (206 kJ/mol), contributing to its high propylene selectivity.

While the document doesn't specifically discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH, it suggests that the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:
- The use of CHA topology
- Optimized Si/Al and In/Al ratios
- Formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions
- Low activation energy for dehydrogenation and high activation energy for cracking

3. 制备方法：文献描述了一种方法，首先在沸石外表面形成In2O3，然后还原并扩散到微孔中，取代Brønsted酸位形成孤立的In+物种。

4. 性能：
   - In-CHA表现出比In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3更好的稳定性和C3H6选择性（85%）。
   - In-CHA表现出丙烷脱氢的低活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和丙烷裂解的高活化能（206 kJ/mol），这有助于其高丙烯选择性。

虽然文档没有特别讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石用于PDH，但它表明，提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是：
- 使用CHA拓扑结构
- 优化Si/Al和In/Al比
