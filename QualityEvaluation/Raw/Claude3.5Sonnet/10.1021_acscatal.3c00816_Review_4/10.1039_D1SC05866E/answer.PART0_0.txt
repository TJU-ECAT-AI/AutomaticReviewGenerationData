[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "For In-CHA with varying Si/Al ratios (Fig. 4a and S11), the H2/In ratios are close to 1.0, confirming that In2O3 in the CHA zeolite can be reduced to replace BASs and form isolated In+ when In/Al ratios  1.0 (independently of the Si/Al ratio)."

[3] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[4] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on PDH performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite framework was found to be superior to other zeolite frameworks (including BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Composition: 
   - The Si/Al ratio affects performance. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA is beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.
   - An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates.
   - The In/Al ratio is important. Isolated In+ sites form when In/Al ratios ≤ 1.0, regardless of the Si/Al ratio.

3. Preparation method: The study used incipient wetness impregnation followed by calcination and reduction to prepare In-CHA catalysts.

4. Performance:
   - In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - In-CHA has a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol), contributing to improved propylene selectivity.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include the formation of isolated In+ sites in the CHA framework, optimized Si/Al and In/Al ratios, and the unique properties of the CHA zeolite structure. These factors lead to enhanced propylene selectivity, improved conversion rates, and better catalyst stability compared to other supports.

该文献主要关注了In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。然而，我们可以从中获得一些关于制备方法、组成和分子筛拓扑结构对PDH性能影响的见解：

1. 分子筛拓扑结构：CHA分子筛框架在脱氢反应中优于其他分子筛框架（包括BEA、MFI和MOR）。

2. 组成：
   - Si/Al比影响性能。CHA中较高的Si/Al比有利于PDH反应，因为它减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。
   - 富铝的In-CHA分子筛（Si/Al = 6.85）提供了更高的脱氢速率。
   - In/Al比很重要。当In/Al比≤1.0时，无论Si/Al比如何，都会形成孤立的In+位点。

3. 制备方法：该研究使用浸渍法，随后进行焙烧和还原来制备In-CHA催化剂。

4. 性能：
   - 与In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3相比，In-CHA表现出更好的稳定性和C3H6选择性（85%）。
   - In-CHA具有较低的C3H8脱氢活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和较高的C3H8裂解活化能（206 kJ/mol），有助于提高丙烯选择性。

提高性能的关键因素包括在CHA框架中形成孤立的In+位点、优化的Si/Al和In/Al比以及CHA分子筛结构的独特性质。这些因素导致了与其他载体相比，丙烯选择性提高、转化率改善和催化剂稳定性增强。
