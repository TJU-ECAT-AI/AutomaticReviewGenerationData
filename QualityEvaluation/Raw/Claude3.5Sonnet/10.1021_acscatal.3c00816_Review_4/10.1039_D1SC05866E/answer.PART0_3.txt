[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."

[3] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[4] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key insights can be drawn:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite is reported to be superior to other frameworks like BEA, MFI, and MOR for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Preparation method: In-CHA catalysts are prepared by reducing In2O3 located on the external surface of H-CHA zeolite, which leads to the formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions.

3. Composition: 
   - Al content: An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates.
   - Si/Al ratio: A high Si/Al ratio is beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.

4. Performance:
   - Propylene selectivity: In-CHA shows better C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - Stability: In-CHA demonstrates better stability than other In-based catalysts.
   - Activation energy: In-CHA has a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol), contributing to its improved performance.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include the formation of isolated In+ species in the CHA framework, optimized Si/Al ratio, and the unique properties of the CHA topology that stabilize In in the +1 oxidation state.

该文献主要关注In-CHA沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷沸石。然而，我们可以得出以下几个关键见解：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：据报道，CHA沸石在脱氢反应中优于其他框架结构，如BEA、MFI和MOR。

2. 制备方法：In-CHA催化剂是通过还原位于H-CHA沸石外表面的In2O3制备而成，这导致在骨架外位置形成孤立的In+物种。

3. 组成：
   - Al含量：富Al的In-CHA沸石（Si/Al = 6.85）提供了更高的脱氢速率。
   - Si/Al比：较高的Si/Al比有利于PDH反应，因为它减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。

4. 性能：
   - 丙烯选择性：In-CHA表现出更好的C3H6选择性（85%），优于In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3。
   - 稳定性：In-CHA比其他In基催化剂表现出更好的稳定性。
   - 活化能：In-CHA具有较低的C3H8脱氢活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和较高的C3H8裂解活化能（206 kJ/mol），这有助于提高其性能。

导致性能改善的关键因素包括在CHA框架中形成孤立的In+物种、优化的Si/Al比，以及CHA拓扑结构的独特性质，这些性质能够稳定In的+1氧化态。
