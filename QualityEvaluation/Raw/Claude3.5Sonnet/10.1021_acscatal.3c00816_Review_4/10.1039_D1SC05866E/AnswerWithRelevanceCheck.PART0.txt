          [1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[3] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

[4] "On In-CHA, In2O3 initially located on the external surface of the H-CHA zeolite is reduced in the presence of dihydrogen displacing the protons of the BAS. Isolated In+ in the CHA zeolite was formed upon reduction."

[5] "The gradual decrease of Eapp for C3H8 dehydrogenation on In-CHA(12, 1.0) from 190 to 109 kJ mol1 as the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0 is consistent with the fact that In+ dominates the reaction since the BAS density decreases, although it slightly increases as the In/Al ratio is increased to 1.7."

          The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, it provides insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite is reported to be superior to other frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions. The unique structure of CHA contributes to improved catalyst performance.

2. Composition:
   - Si/Al ratio: A higher Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolites is beneficial for PDH reactions, decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.
   - In/Al ratio: As the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0, the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation decreases, indicating that In+ species dominate the reaction.
   - Al content: An Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates.

3. Preparation method: In-CHA catalysts are prepared by reducing In2O3 located on the external surface of H-CHA zeolite, leading to the formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions.

4. Performance:
   - Propylene selectivity: In-CHA shows better C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - Stability: In-CHA demonstrates better stability than other In-based catalysts.
   - Activation energy: In-CHA has a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ/mol) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ/mol), contributing to its improved performance.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:
1. The unique CHA zeolite structure
2. Optimized Si/Al and In/Al ratios
3. Formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions
4. Low activation energy for dehydrogenation and high activation energy for cracking
5. Minimal coke formation

          该文献主要关注In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。然而，它提供了关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响催化剂性能的见解：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：据报道，CHA沸石结构在脱氢反应中优于其他框架（BEA、MFI和MOR）。CHA的独特结构有助于提高催化剂性能。

2. 组成：
   - Si/Al比：CHA沸石中较高的Si/Al比有利于PDH反应，减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。
   - In/Al比：随着In/Al比从0增加到1.0，丙烷脱氢的活化能降低，表明In+物种主导反应。
   - Al含量：富Al的In-CHA沸石（Si/Al = 6.85）提供了更高的脱氢速率。

3. 制备方法：In-CHA催化剂是通过还原位于H-CHA沸石外表面的In2O3制备而成，这导致在骨架外位置形成孤立的In+物种。

4. 性能：
   - 丙烯选择性：In-CHA表现出更好的C3H6选择性（85%），优于In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3。
   - 稳定性：In-CHA比其他In基催化剂表现出更好的稳定性。
   - 活化能：In-CHA具有较低的C3H8脱氢活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和较高的C3H8裂解活化能（206 kJ/mol），这有助于提高其性能。

导致丙烯选择性提高、转化率改善和催化剂稳定性增强的关键因素包括：
1. 独特的CHA沸石结构
2. 优化的Si/Al和In/Al比
3. 在骨架外位置形成孤立的In+物种
4. 脱氢反应的低活化能和裂解反应的高活化能
5. 最小的焦炭生成
