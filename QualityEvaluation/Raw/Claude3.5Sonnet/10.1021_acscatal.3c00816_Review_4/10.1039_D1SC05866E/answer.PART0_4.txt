[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[3] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

[4] "The gradual decrease of Eapp for C3H8 dehydrogenation on In-CHA(12, 1.0) from 190 to 109 kJ mol1 as the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0 is consistent with the fact that In+ dominates the reaction since the BAS density decreases, although it slightly increases as the In/Al ratio is increased to 1.7."

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), but it does provide some insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA topology is reported to be superior to other zeolite frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions, although this was specifically mentioned for ethane dehydrogenation.

2. Composition: 
   - The Si/Al ratio affects performance. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA is beneficial for PDH as it decreases the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations.
   - The In/Al ratio influences the catalyst's performance. As the In/Al ratio increases from 0 to 1.0, the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation decreases, indicating that In+ species dominate the reaction.

3. Preparation method: The literature describes a method where In2O3 is first formed on the external surface of the zeolite, then reduced and diffused into the micropores, displacing Brønsted acid sites to form isolated In+ species.

4. Performance:
   - In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.
   - In-CHA exhibits a low activation energy for propane dehydrogenation (94.3 kJ/mol) and a high activation energy for propane cracking (206 kJ/mol), contributing to its high propylene selectivity.

While the document doesn't specifically discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH, it suggests that the key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:
- The use of CHA topology
- Optimized Si/Al and In/Al ratios
- Formation of isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions
- Low activation energy for dehydrogenation and high activation energy for cracking

该文献主要集中在研究In-CHA催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，但它确实提供了一些关于制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构如何影响催化剂性能的见解：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：据报道，CHA拓扑结构优于其他沸石框架（BEA、MFI和MOR）用于脱氢反应，尽管这是特别针对乙烷脱氢而言的。

2. 成分：
   - Si/Al比影响性能。CHA中高Si/Al比有利于PDH，因为它减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。
   - In/Al比影响催化剂的性能。随着In/Al比从0增加到1.0，丙烷脱氢的活化能降低，表明In+物种主导反应。

3. 制备方法：文献描述了一种方法，首先在沸石外表面形成In2O3，然后还原并扩散到微孔中，取代Brønsted酸位形成孤立的In+物种。

4. 性能：
   - In-CHA表现出比In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3更好的稳定性和C3H6选择性（85%）。
   - In-CHA表现出丙烷脱氢的低活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和丙烷裂解的高活化能（206 kJ/mol），这有助于其高丙烯选择性。

虽然文档没有特别讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石用于PDH，但它表明，提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是：
- 使用CHA拓扑结构
- 优化Si/Al和In/Al比
- 在额外框架位置形成孤立的In+物种
- 脱氢的低活化能和裂解的高活化能
