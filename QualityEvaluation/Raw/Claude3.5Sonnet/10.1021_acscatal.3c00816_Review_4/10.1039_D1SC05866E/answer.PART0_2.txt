[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

[3] "In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[4] "Interestingly, the C3H8 dehydrogenation rate normalized to In loading declines as the Si/Al ratio decreases (Fig. 10b and S33). In particular, the C3H8 dehydrogenation rate decreased from 88 μmolC3H8 molIn1 s1 for In-CHA(25, 1.0) to 7.9 μmolC3H8 molIn1 s1 for In-CHA(5, 1.0)."

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, but it does provide some insights into the influence of zeolite topology and composition on catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: The CHA zeolite structure is reported to be superior to other zeolite frameworks (BEA, MFI, and MOR) for dehydrogenation reactions, specifically for ethane dehydrogenation. This suggests that the unique structure of CHA contributes to improved catalyst performance.

2. Si/Al ratio: A higher Si/Al ratio in CHA zeolites is beneficial for PDH reactions. This is attributed to decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to better propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

3. In loading: The preparation method involving the introduction of In into CHA zeolites results in isolated In+ species, which are crucial for improved catalyst performance. The In-CHA catalysts show better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3.

4. Activation energies: In-CHA catalysts demonstrate low activation energy for C3H8 dehydrogenation (94.3 kJ/mol) and high activation energy for C3H8 cracking (206 kJ/mol), contributing to improved propylene selectivity.

5. Catalyst stability: In-CHA catalysts exhibit better stability over time compared to other catalysts, with minimal coke formation.

The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in In-CHA catalysts include:

1. The unique CHA zeolite structure
2. Higher Si/Al ratios
3. Isolated In+ species in extra-framework positions
4. Low activation energy for dehydrogenation and high activation energy for cracking
5. Minimal coke formation

While the literature does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH reactions, it suggests that the principles of optimizing Si/Al ratios and achieving isolated metal species could be applied to improve the performance of other zeolite-based catalysts.

该文献主要关注In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，但也提供了一些关于沸石拓扑结构和组成对催化剂性能影响的见解：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：据报道，CHA沸石结构在脱氢反应中优于其他沸石框架（BEA、MFI和MOR），特别是对于乙烷脱氢反应。这表明CHA的独特结构有助于提高催化剂性能。

2. Si/Al比：CHA沸石中较高的Si/Al比有利于PDH反应。这是由于减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。较高的Si/Al比可以带来更好的丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

3. In负载：将In引入CHA沸石的制备方法可以得到孤立的In+物种，这对提高催化剂性能至关重要。In-CHA催化剂与In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3相比，表现出更好的稳定性和C3H6选择性（85%）。

4. 活化能：In-CHA催化剂表现出较低的C3H8脱氢活化能（94.3 kJ/mol）和较高的C3H8裂解活化能（206 kJ/mol），有助于提高丙烯选择性。

5. 催化剂稳定性：In-CHA催化剂与其他催化剂相比，随时间推移表现出更好的稳定性，焦炭生成量最小。

In-CHA催化剂提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 独特的CHA沸石结构
2. 较高的Si/Al比
3. 额外框架位置的孤立In+物种
4. 脱氢反应的低活化能和裂解反应的高活化能
5. 最小的焦炭生成

虽然文献没有专门讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的应用，但它表明，优化Si/Al比和实现金属物种孤立的原理可以应用于改善其他基于沸石的催化剂的性能。
