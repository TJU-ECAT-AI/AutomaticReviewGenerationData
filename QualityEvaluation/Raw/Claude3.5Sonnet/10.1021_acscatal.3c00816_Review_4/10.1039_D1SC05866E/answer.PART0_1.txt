[1] "Shimizu and coworkers33,34 recently reported that In-CHA is a stable and selective catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation. They have also shown that the CHA zeolite is superior to other zeolite frameworks for this reaction (BEA, MFI, and MOR) and that an Al-rich In-CHA zeolite (Si/Al = 6.85) provided higher dehydrogenation rates."

[2] "At comparable conversion, In-CHA shows better stability and C3H6 selectivity (85%) than In2O3, 10In/SiO2 and 10In/Al2O3, consistent with a low C3H8 dehydrogenation activation energy (94.3 kJ mol1) and high C3H8 cracking activation energy (206 kJ mol1) in the In-CHA catalyst."

[3] "A high Si/Al ratio in CHA seems beneficial for PDH by decreasing the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations."

[4] "The BASs in H-CHA facilitate the formation and stabilization of In+ cations in extra-framework positions, and prevent the deep reduction of In2O3 to In(0)."

The literature primarily focuses on In-CHA catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on PDH performance:

1. Zeolite topology: CHA zeolite is reported to be superior to other frameworks like BEA, MFI, and MOR for dehydrogenation reactions. The small pore size and cage structure of CHA appear to contribute to its improved performance.

2. Composition: The Si/Al ratio plays a crucial role in catalyst performance. A high Si/Al ratio in CHA is beneficial for PDH, as it decreases the fraction of CHA cages containing multiple In+ cations. This suggests that isolated In+ sites are more effective for PDH.

3. Preparation method: The formation of extra-framework In+ cations is facilitated by the Brønsted acid sites (BASs) in H-CHA. These In+ cations are stabilized in extra-framework positions and prevent the deep reduction of In2O3 to In(0), which is less active for PDH.

4. Catalyst performance: In-CHA catalysts show better stability and propylene selectivity (85%) compared to In2O3, In/SiO2, and In/Al2O3. This improved performance is attributed to a low activation energy for propane dehydrogenation and a high activation energy for propane cracking.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Isolated In+ sites in extra-framework positions
2. High Si/Al ratio in the CHA framework
3. Prevention of deep reduction to In(0)
4. Small pore size and cage structure of CHA zeolite

While the literature does not specifically address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH, the principles of isolated active sites, appropriate framework composition, and prevention of deep reduction of the active metal species are likely to be applicable to other zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注In-CHA催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对PDH性能影响的见解：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：CHA沸石被报道优于其他框架如BEA、MFI和MOR用于脱氢反应。CHA的小孔径和笼状结构似乎有助于提高其性能。

2. 组成：Si/Al比对催化剂性能起着关键作用。CHA中较高的Si/Al比有利于PDH，因为它减少了含有多个In+阳离子的CHA笼的比例。这表明孤立的In+位点对PDH更有效。

3. 制备方法：H-CHA中的布朗斯特酸位点（BASs）促进了额外骨架In+阳离子的形成。这些In+阳离子稳定在额外骨架位置，并防止In2O3深度还原为In(0)，后者对PDH的活性较低。

4. 催化剂性能：与In2O3、In/SiO2和In/Al2O3相比，In-CHA催化剂表现出更好的稳定性和丙烯选择性（85%）。这种性能改善归因于丙烷脱氢的低活化能和丙烷裂解的高活化能。

促进提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 额外骨架位置的孤立In+位点
2. CHA框架中的高Si/Al比
3. 防止深度还原为In(0)
4. CHA沸石的小孔径和笼状结构

尽管该文献没有具体讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛用于PDH，但孤立活性位点、适当的框架组成和防止活性金属物种深度还原的原则可能适用于其他基于沸石的PDH反应催化剂。
