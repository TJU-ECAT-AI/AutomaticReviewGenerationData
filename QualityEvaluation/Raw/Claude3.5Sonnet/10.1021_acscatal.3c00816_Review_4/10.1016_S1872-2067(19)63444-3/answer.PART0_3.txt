[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."

[4] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."

[5] "With the properties of high surface area, well-crystallized structure and high thermal stability, dealuminated Beta zeolites (SiBeta) have been intensively used as an ideal support to attach transition metal species"

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation method: The study uses a two-step post-synthesis method to prepare VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta).

2. Composition: The V loading amount (ranging from 0.5 to 10 wt%) significantly affects catalyst performance. The 3VSiBeta catalyst, containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows optimal performance with around 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. Zeolite topology: Beta zeolite (BEA topology) is used after dealumination (SiBeta). Its high surface area, well-crystallized structure, and high thermal stability make it an ideal support for attaching transition metal species.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Acidic sites: The catalytic activity shows a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, derived from the interaction between VOx species and SiBeta support.

2. Dispersion of active species: Isolated VOx species in monolayer (as in 3VSiBeta) provide optimal performance.

3. Aggregation degree of VOx species: This determines propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both increasing with higher V loading.

4. Stability: The catalyst remains stable after several regeneration cycles, indicating good catalyst stability.

While the study doesn't specifically mention silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it demonstrates that the dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) support plays a crucial role in catalyst performance by providing a high surface area and stable structure for VOx species dispersion.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，沸石基催化剂的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. 制备方法：该研究使用两步后合成法制备负载在脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)上的VOx催化剂。

2. 组成：V的负载量（从0.5到10 wt%）显著影响催化剂性能。含有单层分散VOx物种的3VSiBeta催化剂表现最佳，丙烷转化率约为40%，丙烯选择性为90%。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：使用脱铝后的Beta沸石（BEA拓扑结构）。其高比表面积、良好的结晶结构和高热稳定性使其成为附着过渡金属物种的理想载体。

影响性能提升的关键因素：

1. 酸性位：催化活性与生成的酸性位数量呈良好的线性关系，这些酸性位源于VOx物种与SiBeta载体之间的相互作用。

2. 活性物种的分散度：单层分散的VOx物种（如3VSiBeta中）提供最佳性能。

3. VOx物种的聚集程度：这决定了丙烯选择性和失活率，两者都随V负载量的增加而增加。

4. 稳定性：催化剂经过多次再生循环后仍保持稳定，表明催化剂具有良好的稳定性。

虽然该研究没有特别提到硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但它证明了脱铝Beta沸石（SiBeta）载体通过提供高比表面积和稳定结构来分散VOx物种，在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。
