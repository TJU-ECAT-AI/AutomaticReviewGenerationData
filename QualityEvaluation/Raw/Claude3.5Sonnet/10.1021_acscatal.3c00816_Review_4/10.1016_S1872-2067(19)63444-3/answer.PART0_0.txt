[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."

[4] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."

[5] "The superiority of SiBeta support was proved by the activity test over the 3VAlBeta catalyst (Fig. S2), which shows much lower propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared with the 3VSiBeta catalyst."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

For BEA topology zeolites, the study focuses on VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings. The key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. V loading: The optimal V loading was found to be around 3 wt%, which resulted in isolated VOx species in a monolayer. This 3VSiBeta catalyst showed comparable performance to catalysts with higher V loadings.

2. Acidic sites: The catalytic activity is linearly related to the number of acidic sites generated from the interaction between VOx species and the SiBeta support. These sites remain stable after multiple regeneration cycles.

3. Aggregation degree of VOx species: This factor influences propylene selectivity and deactivation rate. Both increase with higher V loading.

4. Support material: SiBeta proved superior to AlBeta as a support, with 3VSiBeta showing much higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to 3VAlBeta.

5. Isolated VOx species: The presence of these species in a monolayer contributes to high catalytic activity.

The study does not provide specific information about silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions. However, the findings suggest that optimizing the metal loading, creating stable acidic sites, controlling the aggregation of metal species, and choosing an appropriate zeolite support are crucial factors in developing effective PDH catalysts.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。

对于BEA拓扑结构沸石，该研究主要关注了负载在脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)上的VOx催化剂，V负载量不同。提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. V负载量：最佳V负载量约为3 wt%，这导致了单层分离的VOx物种。这种3VSiBeta催化剂显示出与更高V负载量催化剂相当的性能。

2. 酸性位点：催化活性与VOx物种和SiBeta支撑体之间相互作用产生的酸性位点数量呈线性关系。这些位点在多次再生循环后保持稳定。

3. VOx物种的聚集程度：这一因素影响丙烯选择性和失活率。随着V负载量的增加，两者都会增加。

4. 支撑材料：SiBeta作为支撑体比AlBeta更优越，3VSiBeta与3VAlBeta相比显示出更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

5. 分离的VOx物种：这些物种以单层存在，有助于提高催化活性。

该研究没有提供关于硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的具体信息。然而，研究结果表明，优化金属负载量、创造稳定的酸性位点、控制金属物种的聚集以及选择适当的沸石支撑体是开发有效PDH催化剂的关键因素。
