[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."

[4] "While, the initial valence state of V does not seem to influence the catalytic performance. Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation method: The study uses a two-step post-synthesis method to prepare VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta).

2. Composition: The V loading amount (0.5 to 10 wt%) significantly affects catalyst performance. The 3VSiBeta catalyst, with 3 wt% V loading, shows optimal performance with 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. Zeolite topology: The study focuses on Beta zeolite (BEA topology) dealuminated to form SiBeta. This support effectively disperses and stabilizes VOx species.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Acidic sites: Catalytic activity has a linear relationship with the number of acidic sites generated from VOx-SiBeta interactions.

2. VOx species distribution: Isolated VOx species in a monolayer formation (as in 3VSiBeta) provide optimal performance.

3. Aggregation degree of VOx species: Higher aggregation increases propylene selectivity but also increases the deactivation rate.

4. Stability: The catalyst shows good stability, maintaining performance after several regeneration cycles.

5. V loading: While higher V loading increases propylene selectivity, it also increases the deactivation rate due to coke formation.

The study does not specifically address silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, focusing instead on dealuminated Beta zeolite. The initial valence state of V does not significantly influence catalytic performance.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. 制备方法：该研究使用两步后合成法制备了负载在脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)上的VOx催化剂。

2. 组成：V负载量(0.5至10 wt%)显著影响催化剂性能。3VSiBeta催化剂(3 wt% V负载)显示出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为90%。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：研究集中在脱铝形成SiBeta的Beta沸石(BEA拓扑结构)上。这种载体有效地分散和稳定VOx物种。

提高性能的关键因素：

1. 酸性位点：催化活性与VOx-SiBeta相互作用产生的酸性位点数量呈线性关系。

2. VOx物种分布：单层形成的孤立VOx物种(如3VSiBeta中)提供最佳性能。

3. VOx物种的聚集程度：较高的聚集程度增加丙烯选择性，但也增加失活率。

4. 稳定性：催化剂显示出良好的稳定性，经过多次再生循环后仍能保持性能。

5. V负载量：虽然较高的V负载量增加了丙烯选择性，但由于焦炭形成，也增加了失活率。

该研究并未特别涉及硅铝磷酸盐沸石，而是集中在脱铝Beta沸石上。V的初始价态对催化性能没有显著影响。
