          [1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."

[4] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."

[5] "With the properties of high surface area, well-crystallized structure and high thermal stability, dealuminated Beta zeolites (SiBeta) have been intensively used as an ideal support to attach transition metal species"

          The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Preparation method: The study uses a two-step post-synthesis method to prepare VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings from 0.5 to 10 wt%.

2. Composition: The V loading amount significantly affects catalyst performance. The 3VSiBeta catalyst (3 wt% V loading) shows optimal performance, with about 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. Zeolite topology: Dealuminated Beta zeolites (SiBeta) with BEA topology are used as the support due to their high surface area, well-crystallized structure, and high thermal stability. These properties make SiBeta an ideal support for attaching transition metal species.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Acidic sites: Catalytic activity shows a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which come from interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support.

2. Isolated VOx species: The 3VSiBeta catalyst, containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, showed optimal performance.

3. Aggregation degree of VOx species: This determines propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both increasing with higher V loading.

4. Stability: The catalyst remains stable after several regeneration cycles, indicating good reusability.

These factors collectively contribute to the improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions using zeolite-based catalysts. The study does not provide specific information about silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions.

          沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. 制备方法：该研究使用两步后合成法制备了负载在脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)上的VOx催化剂，V负载量从0.5至10 wt%不等。

2. 成分：V的负载量极大地影响了催化剂性能。3VSiBeta催化剂(3 wt% V负载量)显示出最佳性能，丙烷转化率约为40%，丙烯选择性为90%。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：使用具有BEA拓扑结构的脱铝Beta沸石(SiBeta)作为载体，因为它具有高比表面积、良好的晶体结构和高热稳定性。这些特性使SiBeta成为附着过渡金属物种的理想载体。

导致性能改善的关键因素：

1. 酸性位点：催化活性与生成的酸性位点数量呈良好的线性关系，这些酸性位点来自VOx物种与SiBeta载体之间的相互作用位点。

2. 孤立的VOx物种：含有单层孤立VOx物种的3VSiBeta催化剂显示出最佳性能。

3. VOx物种的聚集程度：这决定了丙烯选择性和失活率，两者都随着V负载量的增加而增加。

4. 稳定性：催化剂经过多次再生循环后仍保持稳定，表明具有良好的可重复使用性。

这些因素共同促进了使用沸石基催化剂进行PDH反应时丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提高。该研究没有提供关于硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的具体信息。
