[1] "The VOx catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) with varying V loadings (from 0.5 to 10 wt%) are prepared and tested for their catalytic activities in the reaction of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)."

[2] "The 3VSiBeta catalyst (V loading is 3 wt%), containing isolated VOx species in monolayer, shows around 40% of propane conversion with 90% of propylene selectivity (reaction conditions: 600 C, 4000 mL g-1h-1) which are comparable to VSiBeta catalysts with higher V loadings."

[3] "The catalytic activity exhibits a good linear relationship with the amount of generated acidic sites, which are derived from the interaction sites between VOx species and SiBeta support, and keeps stable after several regeneration cycles."

[4] "Moreover, the aggregation degree of VOx species determines the propylene selectivity and deactivation rate, both of which increase as raising the V loading amount."

[5] "The superiority of SiBeta support was proved by the activity test over the 3VAlBeta catalyst (Fig. S2), which shows much lower propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared with the 3VSiBeta catalyst."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors:

1. Zeolite topology: The study focuses on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta), which shows superior performance compared to AlBeta. This suggests that the BEA topology, when dealuminated, provides a suitable support for VOx species.

2. Composition: The vanadium loading (0.5 to 10 wt%) significantly affects the catalyst performance. The 3VSiBeta catalyst, with 3 wt% V loading, shows optimal performance with around 40% propane conversion and 90% propylene selectivity.

3. Preparation method: The catalysts are prepared by supporting VOx on dealuminated Beta zeolite, which allows for the formation of isolated VOx species in a monolayer at optimal loading.

4. Acidic sites: The catalytic activity is linearly related to the number of acidic sites generated from the interaction between VOx species and the SiBeta support. These sites contribute to improved conversion rates and catalyst stability.

5. VOx species aggregation: The degree of VOx aggregation influences propylene selectivity and catalyst deactivation rate. Higher V loadings lead to increased aggregation, which improves selectivity but also increases the deactivation rate.

6. Regeneration stability: The catalysts, particularly 3VSiBeta, demonstrate good stability after several regeneration cycles, indicating robust performance over time.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
1. Optimal V loading (around 3 wt%) for isolated VOx species in monolayer
2. Generation of acidic sites from VOx-SiBeta interactions
3. Balance between VOx aggregation and dispersion for selectivity and stability
4. Use of dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) as a support

These factors combine to create a catalyst with high propylene selectivity, good conversion rates, and excellent stability in PDH reactions.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到几个因素的影响：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：研究重点关注脱铝的Beta沸石(SiBeta)，其性能优于AlBeta。这表明脱铝后的BEA拓扑结构为VOx物种提供了合适的载体。

2. 组成：钒负载量(0.5至10 wt%)显著影响催化剂性能。3VSiBeta催化剂（3 wt%钒负载）显示最佳性能，丙烷转化率约为40%，丙烯选择性为90%。

3. 制备方法：通过将VOx负载在脱铝的Beta沸石上制备催化剂，这种方法在最佳负载量下可形成单层分散的VOx物种。

4. 酸性位点：催化活性与VOx物种和SiBeta载体之间相互作用产生的酸性位点数量呈线性关系。这些位点有助于提高转化率和催化剂稳定性。

5. VOx物种聚集：VOx的聚集程度影响丙烯选择性和催化剂失活速率。较高的V负载导致聚集度增加，这提高了选择性但也增加了失活速率。

6. 再生稳定性：催化剂，特别是3VSiBeta，在多次再生循环后表现出良好的稳定性，表明长期性能稳定。

提高性能的关键因素包括：
1. 最佳V负载量（约3 wt%）以形成单层分散的VOx物种
2. VOx-SiBeta相互作用产生酸性位点
3. VOx聚集和分散之间的平衡，以实现选择性和稳定性的优化
4. 使用脱铝的Beta沸石(SiBeta)作为载体

这些因素共同创造了一种在PDH反应中具有高丙烯选择性、良好转化率和优异稳定性的催化剂。
