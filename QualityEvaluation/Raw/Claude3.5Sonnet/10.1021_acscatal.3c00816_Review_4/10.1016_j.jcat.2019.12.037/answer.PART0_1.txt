[1] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts"

[2] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[3] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[4] "After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."

[5] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[6] "It is notable that the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[7] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown. The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11, showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination: Treating Beta zeolite with concentrated nitric acid removes aluminum and creates T-vacant sites with silanols. This modification enhances the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite, benefiting catalytic reactions.

2. Metal loading: Using a low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) results in highly dispersed CoOx species confined in the created T-sites (silanols).

3. Reduction treatment: Prereduction of the catalyst under optimum conditions allows for the formation of small metallic Co particles, which are the active sites for PDH.

4. Acidity control: The very weak acidity of the modified zeolite support contributes to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

5. Support properties: Beta zeolite provides a high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species, high stability under harsh reaction conditions, and an adjustable inner environment.

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity around 92%, demonstrating superior performance compared to other Co-based catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts.

The intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH was confirmed through experiments at different WHSVs, showing that the catalyst's performance is directly related to its unique structure and composition.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，沸石基催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对其性能有显著影响。影响性能改善的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：用浓硝酸处理Beta沸石可去除铝并创造带硅醇的T空位。这种修饰增强了沸石的结构和酸性，有利于催化反应。

2. 金属负载：在脱铝的Beta沸石(SiBeta)上使用低钴负载量(0.5 wt%)可得到高度分散的CoOx物种，这些物种被限制在所创造的T位点(硅醇)中。

3. 还原处理：在最佳条件下对催化剂进行预还原，可形成小的金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒是PDH的活性位点。

4. 酸度控制：改性沸石载体的极弱酸度通过促进丙烯脱附，有助于获得优异的丙烯选择性。

5. 载体性质：Beta沸石提供了高比表面积用于金属物种的良好分散，在苛刻反应条件下具有高稳定性，并具有可调节的内部环境。

这些因素共同促进了丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提高。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂表现出高达72%的丙烷转化率和约92%的丙烯选择性，显示出优于其他钴基催化剂的性能，可与工业催化剂相媲美。

通过在不同WHSV下的实验证实了0.5CoSiBeta催化剂对PDH的本征活性，表明催化剂的性能直接与其独特的结构和组成相关。
