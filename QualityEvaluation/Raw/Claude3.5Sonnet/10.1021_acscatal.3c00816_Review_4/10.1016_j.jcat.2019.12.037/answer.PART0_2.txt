[1] "We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[4] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."

[5] "It is notable that the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[6] "The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination: Dealuminating Beta zeolite creates T-vacant sites and reduces acidity, which is beneficial for catalytic reactions. This modification improves the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite.

2. Confinement of active species: Highly dispersed CoOx species confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of the SiBeta support contribute to improved catalytic performance. This confinement leads to easily reducible CoOx species.

3. Low metal loading: A low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) in SiBeta zeolite showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity, with high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

4. Weak acidity: The very weak acidity of the catalyst may be responsible for superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

5. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared using Dzwigaj's method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air. This approach leads to the formation of highly active CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH.

6. Regeneration stability: The catalyst showed excellent regeneration stability, maintaining its activity over multiple cycles. This indicates that deactivation is primarily caused by carbon deposits rather than cobalt sintering.

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The BEA topology of the Beta zeolite, combined with the dealumination process and controlled cobalt loading, creates an environment that favors the formation of highly dispersed and easily reducible active sites, resulting in superior catalytic performance.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中沸石基催化剂的性能有显著影响。提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：脱铝Beta沸石创造了T空位和降低酸度，这对催化反应有利。这种修饰改善了沸石的结构和酸性质。

2. 活性物种的限制：高度分散的CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta支持体的T位点（硅醇）中，有助于提高催化性能。这种限制导致CoOx物种容易被还原。

3. 低金属负载：SiBeta沸石中低钴负载（0.5 wt%）显示出最先进的丙烯生产力，具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

4. 弱酸性：催化剂的极弱酸性可能是导致优异丙烯选择性的原因，因为它促进了丙烯的脱附。

5. 制备方法：催化剂是使用Dzwigaj方法制备的，然后在空气中高温煅烧。这种方法导致形成高活性的CoSiBeta催化剂用于PDH。

6. 再生稳定性：催化剂显示出优异的再生稳定性，在多个循环中保持其活性。这表明失活主要是由碳沉积引起的，而不是钴的烧结。

这些因素共同作用，提高了PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。Beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构，结合脱铝过程和受控的钴负载，创造了一个有利于形成高度分散和易还原活性位点的环境，从而实现了优异的催化性能。
