[1] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[2] "The obtained SiBeta solid was excessively impregnated with calculated cobalt nitrate solution (1 g of SiBeta in 20 mL of solution) and stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The impregnated samples were dried at 80 C for 8 h and then calcined at 600 C for 6 h in air with a heating rate of 10 C min1."

[3] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[4] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts"

[5] "After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."

[6] "Noticeably, the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[7] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown. The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11, showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination: Treating AlBeta zeolite with concentrated nitric acid creates T-vacant sites and reduces acidity, which is beneficial for catalytic reactions.

2. Metal loading: Impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, followed by drying and calcination, allows for well-dispersed metal species on the zeolite support.

3. Zeolite structure: Beta zeolite provides a high specific surface area, stability under harsh conditions, and an adjustable inner environment for metal catalysts.

4. Reduction treatment: Prereduction of the catalyst under optimum conditions enhances catalytic performance.

5. Metal content: A low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on SiBeta showed excellent propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

6. Acidity: Very weak acidity of the catalyst may contribute to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

7. Catalyst mass: The intrinsic activity of the catalyst is confirmed by its performance at different WHSVs.

These factors combined result in a highly active and selective catalyst for PDH reactions, with the CoSiBeta catalyst showing superior performance compared to other catalysts.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对BEA拓扑沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能有显著影响。提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：用浓硝酸处理AlBeta沸石可创造T空位并降低酸度，这有利于催化反应。

2. 金属负载：用硝酸钴溶液浸渍，然后干燥和煅烧，可使金属物种在沸石载体上分散良好。

3. 沸石结构：Beta沸石具有高比表面积、在苛刻条件下的稳定性，以及可调节的内部环境，适合金属催化剂。

4. 还原处理：在最佳条件下对催化剂进行预还原可提高催化性能。

5. 金属含量：SiBeta上低含量的钴负载（0.5 wt%）显示出优异的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

6. 酸度：催化剂的极弱酸度可能通过促进丙烯脱附，从而提高丙烯选择性。

7. 催化剂质量：通过在不同WHSV下的性能表现，证实了催化剂的固有活性。

这些因素的结合使得PDH反应具有高活性和高选择性的催化剂，其中CoSiBeta催化剂相比其他催化剂表现出优越的性能。
