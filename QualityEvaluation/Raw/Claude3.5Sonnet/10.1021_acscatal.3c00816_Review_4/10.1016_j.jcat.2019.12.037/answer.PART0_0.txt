[1] "We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[4] "After 6 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases to ca. 40%. It is noticeable that its propylene selectivity remains at ca. 98% during the whole reaction, which is hard to realize at such a high propane conversion."

[5] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[6] "The recycling stability of the PDH reaction over the CoSiBeta catalyst is a prerequisite for practical application, and thus the reaction stability of 0.5CoSiBeta under forcing conditions was tested here."

[7] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination: The dealumination of Beta zeolite modifies its structural and acidic properties, creating T-vacant sites and low acidity, which are beneficial for PDH reactions.

2. Cobalt incorporation: Cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (CoSiBeta) show high catalytic activity and selectivity for PDH.

3. Calcination: High-temperature calcination in air is used to prepare the final CoSiBeta catalysts.

4. Reduction treatment: This shortens the induction period and improves catalytic performance.

5. Cobalt loading: Low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on SiBeta shows high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

6. Zeolite structure: The BEA topology of Beta zeolite provides a suitable framework for confining cobalt species and creating active sites.

The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:

1. Confined cobalt species: CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles, which are highly active for PDH.

2. Low acidity: The very weak acidity of the catalyst may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting propylene desorption.

3. High dispersion: Well-dispersed cobalt species throughout the SiBeta support contribute to high catalytic activity.

4. Regeneration ability: The catalyst can be easily regenerated by calcination to remove carbon deposits, maintaining its activity over multiple cycles.

These factors combined result in a catalyst with high propane conversion (ca. 40% after 6 hours), excellent propylene selectivity (ca. 98%), and good stability over multiple reaction cycles.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对BEA拓扑沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：Beta沸石的脱铝改变了其结构和酸性质，创造了T位空位和低酸度，这有利于PDH反应。

2. 钴的引入：负载在脱铝Beta沸石上的钴催化剂(CoSiBeta)显示出高催化活性和选择性。

3. 煅烧：在空气中进行高温煅烧用于制备最终的CoSiBeta催化剂。

4. 还原处理：这缩短了诱导期并提高了催化性能。

5. 钴负载量：在SiBeta上低钴负载量(0.5 wt%)显示出高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

6. 沸石结构：Beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构为限制钴物种和创造活性位点提供了合适的框架。

提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素是：

1. 限制的钴物种：限制在SiBeta硅醇中的CoOx物种可以被还原为小的金属Co颗粒，这些颗粒对PDH具有高活性。

2. 低酸度：催化剂的极弱酸度可能是其具有优异丙烯选择性的原因，因为它促进了丙烯的脱附。

3. 高分散度：在SiBeta载体上均匀分散的钴物种有助于提高催化活性。

4. 再生能力：催化剂可以通过煅烧轻易去除碳沉积物而再生，在多个循环中保持其活性。

这些因素的结合产生了一种具有高丙烷转化率(6小时后约40%)、优异丙烯选择性(约98%)和多个反应循环中良好稳定性的催化剂。
