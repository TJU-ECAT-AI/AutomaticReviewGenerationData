[1] "CoOx within dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) zeolite developing into ultrasmall-sized Co particles under H2 or reactant gas is highly efficient for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene reaction."

[2] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[3] "Co in SiBeta zeolite (0.5 wt%) showed state-of-the-art propylene productivity with propane conversion of about 72% and propylene selectivity of over 92% at 600 C, which is far better than that of the other reported Co catalysts and comparable to that of industrial catalysts."

[4] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[5] "The dealumination treatment creates a lot of vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide good conditions for confining the cobalt species and thus lead to the formation of confined cobalt species after high-temperature treatment"

[6] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[7] "Great propane conversion and extremely high propylene selectivity were simultaneously realized over the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst and match to that over commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts, which is the first time to be reported."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

The key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination of Beta zeolite: This creates vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide ideal conditions for confining cobalt species.

2. Low cobalt loading: 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite showed state-of-the-art performance.

3. Formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles: CoOx within dealuminated Beta zeolite develops into highly efficient ultrasmall-sized Co particles under reaction conditions.

4. Confinement of CoOx species: Easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of the SiBeta support.

5. Reduction treatment: This shortens the induction period and improves catalytic activity.

These factors contribute to high propylene selectivity (over 92%), high propane conversion (about 72%), and improved catalyst stability. The performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is comparable to commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts, representing a significant advancement in zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions.

The preparation method, involving dealumination of AlBeta zeolite, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and high-temperature calcination, results in confined CoOx that can be reduced to small metallic Co particles during the reaction. These small metallic Co particles are believed to be the active sites responsible for the high catalytic performance.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了BEA拓扑结构沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。

提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. Beta沸石的脱铝：这创造了带有硅醇的空T位，为限制钴物种提供了理想条件。

2. 低钴负载量：在SiBeta沸石中0.5 wt%的钴显示出最先进的性能。

3. 超小尺寸钴颗粒的形成：脱铝Beta沸石中的CoOx在反应条件下发展成高效的超小尺寸钴颗粒。

4. CoOx物种的限制：易还原的CoOx物种被限制在SiBeta支撑体的创建T位（硅醇）中。

5. 还原处理：这缩短了诱导期并提高了催化活性。

这些因素共同促进了高丙烯选择性（超过92%）、高丙烷转化率（约72%）和改善的催化剂稳定性。0.5CoSiBeta催化剂的性能可与商业Pt和CrOx催化剂相媲美，代表了PDH反应中沸石基催化剂的重大进步。

制备方法涉及AlBeta沸石的脱铝、浸渍钴硝酸盐溶液和高温煅烧，结果形成了限制在沸石中的CoOx，这些CoOx可在反应过程中还原为小的金属钴颗粒。这些小的金属钴颗粒被认为是负责高催化性能的活性位点。
