[1] "We prepared cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta (SiBeta) based on Dzwigajs method, followed by high-temperature calcination in air to obtain CoSiBeta catalysts for PDH."

[2] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[3] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[4] "After 6 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases to ca. 40%. It is noticeable that its propylene selectivity remains at ca. 98% during the whole reaction, which is hard to realize at such a high propane conversion."

[5] "The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst shows considerable catalytic activity with very high propylene selectivity, and the induction period is evidently shortened after reduction treatment."

[6] "The recycling stability of the PDH reaction over the CoSiBeta catalyst is a prerequisite for practical application, and thus the reaction stability of 0.5CoSiBeta under forcing conditions was tested here."

[7] "After completion of the previous run, the catalysts were calcinated for 2 h in air at 600 C to remove the deposited coke for the next cycle without another reduction treatment. The catalytic activities of the regenerated 0.5CoSiBeta are almost the same as that obtained with the fresh catalyst over four cycles, indicating that deactivation is caused mainly by carbon deposits instead of sintering of cobalt."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination: The dealumination of Beta zeolite modifies its structural and acidic properties, creating T-vacant sites and low acidity, which are beneficial for PDH reactions.

2. Cobalt incorporation: Cobalt catalysts supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite (CoSiBeta) show high catalytic activity and selectivity for PDH.

3. Calcination: High-temperature calcination in air is used to prepare the final CoSiBeta catalysts.

4. Reduction treatment: This shortens the induction period and improves catalytic performance.

5. Cobalt loading: Low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on SiBeta shows high propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

6. Zeolite structure: The BEA topology of Beta zeolite provides a suitable framework for confining cobalt species and creating active sites.

The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:

1. Confined cobalt species: CoOx species confined in the silanols of SiBeta can be reduced to small metallic Co particles, which are highly active for PDH.

2. Low acidity: The very weak acidity of the catalyst may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting propylene desorption.

3. High dispersion: Well-dispersed cobalt species throughout the SiBeta support contribute to high catalytic activity.

4. Regeneration ability: The catalyst can be easily regenerated by calcination to remove carbon deposits, maintaining its activity over multiple cycles.

These factors combined result in a catalyst with high propane conversion (ca. 40% after 6 hours), excellent propylene selectivity (ca. 98%), and good stability over multiple reaction cycles.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对BEA拓扑沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. 脱铝：Beta沸石的脱铝改变了其结构和酸性质，创造了T位空位和低酸度，这有利于PDH反应。

2. 钴的引入：负载在脱铝Beta沸石上的钴催化剂(CoSiBeta)显示出高催化活性和选择性。

3. 煅烧：在空气中进行高温煅烧用于制备最终的CoSiBeta催化剂。

4. 还原处理：这缩短了诱导期并提高了催化性能。

[1] "Beta zeolite is such a substrate that possesses high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species and high stability for tolerance of harsh reaction conditions, as well as an adjustable inner environment for changing the surrounding environment of metal catalysts, and thus has been widely employed to support metal catalysts"

[2] "The SiBeta support was obtained by treating raw AlBeta zeolite with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 20:1 in a concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L1) at 100 C for 12 h under constant stirring and then washed several times with distilled water."

[3] "The dealumination of Beta zeolite developed by Dzwigaj et al. is a good way to further modify its structural and acidic properties, since the created T-vacant sites and low acidity are beneficial for many catalytic reactions"

[4] "After prereduction under optimum conditions, the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst (Co loading is 0.5 wt%) showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity of around 92%."

[5] "The existence of highly dispersed CoOx species is identified, and the easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of SiBeta support."

[6] "It is notable that the very weak acidity may be responsible for its superior propylene selectivity by boosting the propylene desorption."

[7] "The superiority of the CoSiBeta catalyst is thus clearly shown. The TOF values were obtained at different WHSVs in Fig. S11, showing that decreasing catalyst mass leads to a loss of catalytic activity and simultaneously confirming the intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination: Treating Beta zeolite with concentrated nitric acid removes aluminum and creates T-vacant sites with silanols. This modification enhances the structural and acidic properties of the zeolite, benefiting catalytic reactions.

2. Metal loading: Using a low cobalt loading (0.5 wt%) on dealuminated Beta zeolite (SiBeta) results in highly dispersed CoOx species confined in the created T-sites (silanols).

3. Reduction treatment: Prereduction of the catalyst under optimum conditions allows for the formation of small metallic Co particles, which are the active sites for PDH.

4. Acidity control: The very weak acidity of the modified zeolite support contributes to superior propylene selectivity by promoting propylene desorption.

5. Support properties: Beta zeolite provides a high specific surface area for well-dispersed metal species, high stability under harsh reaction conditions, and an adjustable inner environment.

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability. The 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst showed propane conversion as high as 72% with propylene selectivity around 92%, demonstrating superior performance compared to other Co-based catalysts and comparable to industrial catalysts.

The intrinsic activity of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst for PDH was confirmed through experiments at different WHSVs, showing that the catalyst's performance is directly related to its unique structure and composition.

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

The key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Dealumination of Beta zeolite: This creates vacant T-sites with silanols, which provide ideal conditions for confining cobalt species.

2. Low cobalt loading: 0.5 wt% Co in SiBeta zeolite showed state-of-the-art performance.

3. Formation of ultrasmall-sized Co particles: CoOx within dealuminated Beta zeolite develops into highly efficient ultrasmall-sized Co particles under reaction conditions.

4. Confinement of CoOx species: Easily reducible CoOx species are confined in the created T-sites (silanols) of the SiBeta support.

5. Reduction treatment: This shortens the induction period and improves catalytic activity.

These factors contribute to high propylene selectivity (over 92%), high propane conversion (about 72%), and improved catalyst stability. The performance of the 0.5CoSiBeta catalyst is comparable to commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts, representing a significant advancement in zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions.

The preparation method, involving dealumination of AlBeta zeolite, impregnation with cobalt nitrate solution, and high-temperature calcination, results in confined CoOx that can be reduced to small metallic Co particles during the reaction. These small metallic Co particles are believed to be the active sites responsible for the high catalytic performance.
