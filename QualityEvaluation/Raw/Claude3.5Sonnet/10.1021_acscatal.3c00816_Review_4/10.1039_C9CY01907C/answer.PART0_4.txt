[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[2] "The Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by dealumination of H-beta and then the introduction of Sn species via dry impregnation."

[3] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."

[4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."

[5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: An improved post-synthesis method involving dealumination of H-beta zeolite followed by dry impregnation of Sn species was used to prepare highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts.

2. Composition: The incorporation of Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta) played a crucial role in catalyst performance.

3. Metal dispersion: Pt species were highly dispersed as ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to strong interactions between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework.

4. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology of beta zeolite provided a suitable structure for the incorporation of Sn species and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters.

5. Metal-support interactions: Strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework contributed to improved catalyst stability by inhibiting coke formation and Pt sintering.

These factors resulted in excellent catalytic performance, with high propene formation rates (2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 550°C and 3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 600°C), high propene selectivity (>99%), and good stability over multiple regeneration cycles. The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst, with framework-confined Sn and highly dispersed Pt nanoclusters, was key to achieving superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional catalysts.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了BEA拓扑结构沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。对丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性改善有贡献的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：采用改进的后合成方法，包括H-beta沸石的脱铝和随后的Sn物种干浸渍，制备了高度稳定的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂。

2. 成分：将四面体配位状态的Sn物种掺入脱铝的beta（Si-beta）骨架中，对催化剂性能起到了关键作用。

3. 金属分散：由于Pt与Si-beta骨架中限制的Sn(IV)位之间的强相互作用，Pt物种以超小纳米簇的形式高度分散在Pt/Sn-Si-beta上。

4. 沸石拓扑结构：beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构为Sn物种的掺入和Pt纳米簇的分散提供了合适的结构。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：强PtSn相互作用和Sn在Si-beta骨架中的限制效应通过抑制积炭和Pt团聚，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

这些因素导致了优异的催化性能，具有高丙烯生成速率（550°C时为2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹，600°C时为3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹），高丙烯选择性（>99%），以及多个再生循环中的良好稳定性。Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂独特的结构，具有骨架限制的Sn和高度分散的Pt纳米簇，是在PDH反应中实现优于传统催化剂的性能的关键。
