[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[2] "The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by introducing the platinum precursor onto Sn-Si-beta using the wet impregnation method."

[3] "As illustrated in Scheme 1, firstly, H-beta zeolite was completely dealuminated and then mixed with the calculated amount of Sn precursors. After calcination, the Sn precursors decomposed and reacted with the silanols produced by dealumination of the zeolite."

[4] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."

[5] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."

[6] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."

[7] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: An improved post-synthesis method was used, involving complete dealumination of H-beta zeolite, followed by incorporation of Sn precursors and wet impregnation of Pt. This method results in highly stable catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. Composition: The incorporation of Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta) plays a crucial role. The strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework leads to highly dispersed Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA-type structure of beta zeolite provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH, promoting the diffusion of propene molecules and inhibiting side reactions and coke formation.

4. Improved propylene selectivity: The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts achieved a propene selectivity of >99% at 550°C, demonstrating excellent selectivity.

5. Conversion rates: The catalysts showed high propene formation rates of 2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 550°C and 3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 600°C.

6. Catalyst stability: The strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters. This results in good stability during dehydrogenation and regeneration, with almost unchanged catalytic activity over four cycles at 550°C.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts in PDH reactions, offering high selectivity, conversion rates, and stability compared to conventional catalysts.

Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响。促进丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性提高的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：采用改进的后合成法，包括H-beta沸石的完全脱铝，随后引入Sn前体和Pt湿法浸渍。这种方法产生了具有优异催化活性和选择性的高度稳定的催化剂。

2. 组成：将四面体配位状态的Sn物种引入脱铝beta（Si-beta）骨架起着关键作用。Pt与Si-beta骨架中限制的Sn(IV)位点之间的强相互作用导致Pt物种以超小纳米团簇的形式高度分散。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：beta沸石的BEA型结构为PDH提供了形状选择性反应空间，促进丙烯分子的扩散，抑制副反应和积碳形成。

4. 改善的丙烯选择性：Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在550°C下实现了>99%的丙烯选择性，表现出优异的选择性。

5. 转化率：催化剂在550°C下显示2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹的高丙烯生成速率，在600°C下达到3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹。

6. 催化剂稳定性：PtSn强相互作用和Sn在Si-beta骨架中的限制效应抑制了积碳形成和Pt团簇的烧结。这导致了脱氢和再生过程中的良好稳定性，在550°C下经过四个循环后催化活性几乎保持不变。

这些因素共同促进了Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在PDH反应中的卓越性能，与传统催化剂相比，提供了高选择性、高转化率和高稳定性。
