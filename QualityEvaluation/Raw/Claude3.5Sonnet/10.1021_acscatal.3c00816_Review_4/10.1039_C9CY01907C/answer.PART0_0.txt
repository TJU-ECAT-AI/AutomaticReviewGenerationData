[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[2] "The Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by dealumination of H-beta and then the introduction of Sn species via dry impregnation."

[3] "It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework."

[4] "The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C."

[5] "Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites like beta zeolite. 

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: An improved post-synthesis method involving dealumination of H-beta zeolite followed by the introduction of Sn species via dry impregnation, and then Pt impregnation, leads to highly stable catalysts.

2. Composition: The incorporation of Sn species in tetrahedral coordination states into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta) is crucial. This allows for strong interactions between Pt and Sn(IV) sites, leading to highly dispersed Pt species in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology of beta zeolite provides a suitable framework for the incorporation of Sn species and dispersion of Pt nanoclusters.

4. Metal-support interactions: Strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework play a vital role in inhibiting coke formation and sintering of Pt clusters.

These factors collectively contribute to excellent catalytic performance, with high propene formation rates (2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 550°C and 3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹ at 600°C), high propene selectivity (>99%), and good stability over multiple reaction-regeneration cycles.

The unique structure of Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts, resulting from the careful control of preparation methods and composition, leads to superior performance in PDH reactions compared to traditional catalysts. This demonstrates the importance of tailoring zeolite-based catalysts at the molecular level to achieve desired catalytic properties.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石，如beta沸石。

提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：改进的后合成方法，包括H-beta沸石的脱铝、随后通过干浸渍引入Sn物种，然后进行Pt浸渍，能够制备出高度稳定的催化剂。

2. 成分：将四面体配位状态的Sn物种掺入脱铝beta（Si-beta）骨架中至关重要。这允许Pt与被限制在Si-beta骨架中的Sn(IV)位点之间形成强相互作用，从而使Pt物种以超小纳米簇的形式高度分散。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构为Sn物种的掺入和Pt纳米簇的分散提供了合适的骨架。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：强PtSn相互作用以及Sn在Si-beta骨架中的限制效应在抑制Pt簇的积碳和烧结方面起着重要作用。

这些因素共同促成了优异的催化性能，具有高丙烯生成速率（在550°C时为2.3 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹，在600°C时为3.1 mol g⁻¹Pt h⁻¹），高丙烯选择性（>99%），以及在多个反应-再生循环中的良好稳定性。

Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂独特的结构，源于制备方法和成分的精心控制，使其在PDH反应中表现出优于传统催化剂的性能。这表明在分子水平上调整沸石基催化剂对于实现所需催化性能的重要性。
