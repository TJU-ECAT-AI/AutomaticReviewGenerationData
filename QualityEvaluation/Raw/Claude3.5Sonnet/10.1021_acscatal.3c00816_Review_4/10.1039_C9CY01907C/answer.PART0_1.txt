[1] "Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability."

[2] "The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst exhibits excellent stability with a slight activity loss during 5 h time-on-stream at 550 C"

[3] "The influence of the high propene selectivity and catalytic stability could be explained by strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework."

[4] "As shown in Fig. 1a, all the samples display similar diffraction patterns with a typical BEA topology, revealing that the dealumination and metal incorporation do not disturb the structure of the zeolite beta framework."

[5] "The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of BEA topologic zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Preparation method: An improved post-synthesis strategy involving dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation was used to prepare highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts.

2. Composition: The incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta) and the addition of Pt species resulted in a bimetallic catalyst with enhanced performance.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA-type structure of beta zeolites, featuring three-dimensional structures with 12-ring channel systems, provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH. This promotes the diffusion of propene molecules while inhibiting side reactions and coke formation.

4. Strong metal-support interactions: The confinement of Sn species in the Si-beta framework and their strong interaction with Pt species leads to high dispersion of Pt in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters. This results in improved catalyst stability and performance.

5. Electronic effects: The strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework contributes to high propene selectivity and catalytic stability.

These factors collectively contribute to the high catalytic activity, good selectivity, and excellent stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts in PDH reactions. The catalyst exhibits minimal activity loss during operation and shows resistance to coke formation and metal sintering, leading to improved long-term performance.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了BEA拓扑结构沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。对丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性改善有贡献的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：采用改进的后合成策略，包括H-beta脱铝和随后的金属浸渍，制备出高度稳定的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂。

2. 组成：将Sn物种引入脱铝beta（Si-beta）骨架和添加Pt物种，形成了性能增强的双金属催化剂。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：beta沸石的BEA型结构，具有三维12元环通道系统，为PDH提供了形状选择性反应空间。这促进了丙烯分子的扩散，同时抑制了副反应和积碳形成。

4. 强金属-载体相互作用：Sn物种被限制在Si-beta骨架中，并与Pt物种强烈相互作用，导致Pt以超小纳米簇的形式高度分散。这提高了催化剂的稳定性和性能。

5. 电子效应：Pt与限制在Si-beta骨架中的Sn之间的强相互作用有助于提高丙烯选择性和催化稳定性。

这些因素共同促进了Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂在PDH反应中的高催化活性、良好选择性和优异稳定性。该催化剂在运行过程中活性损失最小，并表现出对积碳形成和金属烧结的抵抗力，从而提高了长期性能。
