[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures."

[2] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[3] "Sn-Beta zeolites exhibit improved stability in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The catalytic performances of these Sn-Beta catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation become stable after a certain period, and no evident loss of activity is observable in a long time-on-stream reaction for 72 h."

[4] "The Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[5] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

The preparation method, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of Sn-Beta zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation method: Sn-Beta zeolites are synthesized via a two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of parent H-Beta and incorporation of Sn species into the framework. This indirect synthesis method allows for better control of Sn incorporation and distribution.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) showed the best performance in PDH reactions.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology of Beta zeolite provides a suitable framework for incorporating Sn species and creating isolated single-site Sn atoms, which are crucial for PDH activity.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Lewis acidity: The Lewis acid sites created by single-site Sn atoms are the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction.

2. Brønsted/Lewis acid ratio: A high Lewis to Brønsted acid ratio (L/B ratio) is beneficial for PDH, as it promotes dehydrogenation over cracking reactions.

3. Stability of Sn sites: The incorporation of Sn into the zeolite framework creates stable single-site Sn atoms, leading to improved catalyst stability and longevity.

4. Na+ exchange: Further improvement in performance was achieved by Na+ exchange, which reduced Brønsted acidity while maintaining Lewis acidity, resulting in higher propylene selectivity.

The optimized Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst demonstrated excellent performance, with 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity, as well as remarkable stability over 72 hours of reaction time.

Sn-Beta分子筛催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的性能有显著影响：

1. 制备方法：Sn-Beta分子筛通过两步后合成程序制备，包括母体H-Beta的脱铝和Sn物种的框架掺杂。这种间接合成方法可以更好地控制Sn的掺杂和分布。

2. 组成：沸石结构中的Sn/Si比例影响催化性能。优化后的Si/Sn比约为30（Sn-Beta-30）在PDH反应中表现最佳。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：Beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构为Sn物种的掺杂和单原子Sn活性位的创建提供了合适的框架，这对PDH活性至关重要。

提高性能的关键因素：

1. Lewis酸性：由单原子Sn创建的Lewis酸位是脱氢反应的活性位点。

2. Brønsted/Lewis酸比例：高Lewis酸与Brønsted酸比例（L/B比）有利于PDH反应，因为它促进脱氢反应而不是裂解反应。

3. Sn位点的稳定性：Sn掺杂到沸石框架中形成稳定的单原子Sn，提高了催化剂的稳定性和寿命。

4. Na+离子交换：通过Na+离子交换进一步改善性能，减少了Brønsted酸性同时保持Lewis酸性，从而提高丙烯选择性。

优化后的Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂表现出优异的性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为92%，并且在72小时的反应时间内表现出卓越的稳定性。
