          [1] "Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process"

[2] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[3] "The Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites like Sn-Beta. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Preparation method: A two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of H-Beta and incorporation of Sn species into the framework is used to create Sn-Beta zeolites. This method allows for better control of Sn incorporation and distribution.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) showed the best results in PDH reactions.

3. Acid site distribution: The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (L/B ratio) is crucial. A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH, as Lewis acid sites catalyze dehydrogenation while Brønsted acid sites promote undesired cracking reactions.

4. Single-site Sn structure: The incorporation of isolated Sn atoms into the zeolite framework creates single-site catalysts, which contribute to improved activity and selectivity.

5. Ion exchange: Na+ exchange of Sn-Beta (Na-Sn-Beta) further improved catalytic performance by reducing Brønsted acidity while maintaining Lewis acidity.

These factors lead to improved propylene selectivity (up to 92%), high conversion rates (40% for Na-Sn-Beta-30), and excellent catalyst stability (no detectable deactivation for 72 hours under harsh reaction conditions).

          制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石如Sn-Beta。影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：通过H-Beta脱铝和将Sn物种引入骨架的两步后合成程序来制备Sn-Beta沸石。这种方法可以更好地控制Sn的引入和分布。

2. 组成：沸石结构中的Sn/Si比对催化性能有影响。优化后的Si/Sn比约为30（Sn-Beta-30）在PDH反应中表现最佳。

3. 酸性位分布：Lewis酸位与Brønsted酸位的比例(L/B比)至关重要。高L/B比有利于PDH反应，因为Lewis酸位催化脱氢反应，而Brønsted酸位促进不需要的裂化反应。

4. 单点Sn结构：将孤立的Sn原子引入沸石骨架创造了单位点催化剂，这有助于提高活性和选择性。

5. 离子交换：Sn-Beta的Na+交换（Na-Sn-Beta）通过减少Brønsted酸性同时保持Lewis酸性，进一步改善了催化性能。

这些因素导致丙烯选择性提高（高达92%），转化率高（Na-Sn-Beta-30为40%），以及优异的催化剂稳定性（在苛刻反应条件下72小时内无可检测的失活）。
