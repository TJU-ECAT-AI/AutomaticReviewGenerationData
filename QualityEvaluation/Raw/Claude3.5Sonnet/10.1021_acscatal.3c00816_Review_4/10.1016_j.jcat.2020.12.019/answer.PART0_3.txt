[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures."

[2] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[3] "The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

The preparation method, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of Sn-Beta catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation method: Sn-Beta zeolites are synthesized via a two-step post-synthesis procedure. First, Al atoms are removed from the zeolite framework to create lattice defects. Then, Sn atoms are incorporated into these vacancies to form Sn-containing zeolite. This method ensures the incorporation of Sn into the zeolite framework as isolated single atoms.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) shows the best performance in PDH reactions.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology of Beta zeolite provides a suitable framework for incorporating Sn atoms and creating Lewis acid sites, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation reaction.

Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Lewis acidity: The Lewis acid sites in Sn-Beta are the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. A higher concentration of Lewis acid sites leads to better catalytic performance.

2. Brønsted to Lewis acid ratio (B/L ratio): A lower B/L ratio is beneficial for PDH reactions. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio.

3. Na+ exchange: Na-Sn-Beta catalysts show enhanced performance due to a reduction in Brønsted acid sites while maintaining Lewis acid sites. The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acidity and lowest B/L ratio, delivers the best performance with 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity.

4. Single-site Sn structure: The incorporation of Sn as isolated single atoms in the zeolite framework contributes to high stability and resistance to deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for extended periods (72 hours).

These factors combined result in improved propylene selectivity, high conversion rates, and excellent catalyst stability in PDH reactions using Sn-Beta zeolites.

Sn-Beta催化剂的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构对丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的性能有显著影响：

1. 制备方法：Sn-Beta沸石通过两步后合成程序合成。首先，从沸石骨架中移除Al原子以创建晶格缺陷。然后，将Sn原子掺入这些空位形成含Sn沸石。这种方法确保Sn以孤立的单原子形式掺入沸石骨架。

2. 组成：沸石结构中的Sn/Si比例影响催化性能。优化的Si/Sn比约为30（Sn-Beta-30）在PDH反应中表现最佳。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：Beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构为掺入Sn原子和创建Lewis酸位提供了合适的骨架，这对脱氢反应至关重要。

影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. Lewis酸性：Sn-Beta中的Lewis酸位是脱氢反应的活性位点。更高浓度的Lewis酸位导致更好的催化性能。

2. Brønsted酸与Lewis酸比例（B/L比）：较低的B/L比有利于PDH反应。脱氢率/裂解率与L/B比呈正比。

3. Na+交换：Na-Sn-Beta催化剂显示出增强的性能，这是由于Brønsted酸位减少而Lewis酸位保持不变。Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂具有最高的Lewis酸性和最低的B/L比，在PDH反应中表现最佳，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为92%。

4. 单点Sn结构：Sn以孤立单原子形式掺入沸石骨架，有助于在苛刻反应条件下长时间（72小时）保持高稳定性和抗失活性。

这些因素综合作用，导致在使用Sn-Beta沸石进行PDH反应时，丙烯选择性提高、转化率高和催化剂稳定性优异。
