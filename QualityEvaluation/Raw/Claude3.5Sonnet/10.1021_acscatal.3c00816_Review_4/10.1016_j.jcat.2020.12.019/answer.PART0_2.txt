[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process"

[2] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[3] "The Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites like Sn-Beta. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Preparation method: Sn-Beta zeolites are synthesized using a two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of parent H-Beta zeolite followed by incorporation of Sn species into the framework. This indirect synthesis method allows for better control of Sn incorporation and distribution.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) showed the best results in PDH reactions.

3. Acid site distribution: The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (L/B ratio) is crucial. A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH reactions, as Lewis acid sites catalyze dehydrogenation while Brønsted acid sites promote undesired cracking reactions.

4. Ion exchange: Na+ exchange of Sn-Beta (Na-Sn-Beta) further improved catalytic performance by reducing Brønsted acidity while maintaining Lewis acidity.

5. Single-site Sn structure: The incorporation of isolated Sn atoms into the zeolite framework creates single-site catalysts, which contribute to improved activity and selectivity.

These factors lead to improved propylene selectivity (up to 92%), high conversion rates (40% for Na-Sn-Beta-30), and excellent catalyst stability (no detectable deactivation for 72 hours under harsh reaction conditions).

While the literature does not specifically discuss silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH, the principles of optimizing acid site distribution and creating single-site metal centers could potentially be applied to other zeolite types to improve their performance in PDH reactions.

在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了基于沸石的催化剂的性能，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石如Sn-Beta。提高性能的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：Sn-Beta沸石通过两步后合成程序制备，包括对母体H-Beta沸石进行脱铝，然后将Sn物种掺入骨架。这种间接合成方法可以更好地控制Sn的掺入和分布。

2. 成分：沸石结构中的Sn/Si比例影响催化性能。优化的Si/Sn比约为30（Sn-Beta-30）在PDH反应中显示出最佳结果。

3. 酸位分布：Lewis酸位与Brønsted酸位的比例（L/B比）至关重要。高L/B比有利于PDH反应，因为Lewis酸位催化脱氢反应，而Brønsted酸位促进不需要的裂解反应。

4. 离子交换：Sn-Beta的Na+交换（Na-Sn-Beta）通过减少Brønsted酸性同时保持Lewis酸性，进一步改善了催化性能。

5. 单点Sn结构：将孤立的Sn原子掺入沸石骨架创造了单点催化剂，这有助于提高活性和选择性。

这些因素导致丙烯选择性提高（高达92%），转化率高（Na-Sn-Beta-30为40%），以及优异的催化剂稳定性（在苛刻反应条件下72小时内无可检测的失活）。

虽然文献中没有专门讨论硅铝磷酸盐沸石用于PDH，但优化酸位分布和创造单点金属中心的原理可能适用于其他类型的沸石，以提高它们在PDH反应中的性能。
