[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites with different Sn/Si ratios obtained from two steps were investigated with XRD characterization, to verify the possible structural changes in the post-synthesis procedures."

[2] "The indirect synthesis of Sn-Beta involves two basic steps: (1) removal of Al atoms from the zeolite framework structure to generate the lattice defects, (2) incorporation of Sn atoms into the vacancies to form Sn containing zeolite"

[3] "The Lewis acid in Sn-Beta is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst that possesses the highest Lewis acid but the lowest B/L ratio delivers the best performance in propane dehydrogenation, which gives propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation in propane dehydrogenation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

The preparation method, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of Sn-Beta zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation method: A two-step post-synthesis procedure is used, involving dealumination of parent H-Beta zeolite followed by incorporation of Sn species into the framework. This indirect synthesis method allows for better control of Sn incorporation and preserves the BEA topology.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure greatly affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) showed the best results in PDH reactions.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology of Beta zeolites provides a suitable framework for incorporating Sn atoms and creating isolated single-site Sn species, which act as Lewis acid sites.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Lewis acidity: The Lewis acid sites created by single-site Sn atoms are the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Brønsted to Lewis acid ratio (B/L ratio): A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH reactions, as it promotes dehydrogenation over cracking.

3. Na+ exchange: Na-Sn-Beta catalysts showed enhanced performance due to reduced Brønsted acidity while maintaining Lewis acidity.

The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acidity and lowest B/L ratio, demonstrated the best performance, achieving 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity. Additionally, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibited excellent stability, showing no detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours.

Sn-Beta沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响：

1. 制备方法：采用两步后合成法，包括母体H-Beta沸石的脱铝和锡物种的骨架引入。这种间接合成方法可以更好地控制锡的引入，并保持BEA拓扑结构。

2. 组成：沸石结构中的Sn/Si比对催化性能有很大影响。优化后的Si/Sn比约为30（Sn-Beta-30）在PDH反应中表现最佳。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：Beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构为引入锡原子和创建孤立的单位点锡物种提供了合适的框架，这些锡物种充当路易斯酸位。

改善性能的关键因素：

1. 路易斯酸性：由单位点锡原子创建的路易斯酸位是脱氢反应的活性位点。

2. 布伦斯特酸与路易斯酸比例（B/L比）：高L/B比有利于PDH反应，因为它促进脱氢而不是裂解。

3. Na+交换：Na-Sn-Beta催化剂显示出增强的性能，因为它减少了布伦斯特酸性同时保持了路易斯酸性。

Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂具有最高的路易斯酸性和最低的B/L比，表现出最佳性能，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和92%的丙烯选择性。此外，Sn-Beta沸石表现出优异的稳定性，在72小时的苛刻反应条件下没有检测到明显的失活。
