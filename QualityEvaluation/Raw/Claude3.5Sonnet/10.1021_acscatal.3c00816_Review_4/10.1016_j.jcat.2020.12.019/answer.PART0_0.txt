[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process"

[2] "The Sn-Beta were converted to Na-Sn-Beta by ion-exchange with 1 M NaCl solution at room temperature for 48 h."

[3] "The Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites like Sn-Beta. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Preparation method: A two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of H-Beta and incorporation of Sn species into the framework is effective for creating Sn-Beta zeolites. Further ion-exchange with NaCl solution can convert Sn-Beta to Na-Sn-Beta, enhancing performance.

2. Acid site distribution: The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (L/B ratio) is crucial. A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH, as Lewis acid sites catalyze dehydrogenation while Brønsted acid sites promote undesired cracking reactions.

3. Sn incorporation: The incorporation of Sn into the zeolite framework creates isolated Sn single atoms, which act as Lewis acid sites and are key to the catalyst's performance.

4. Composition optimization: The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest amount of Lewis acid sites and lowest Brønsted/Lewis ratio, showed the best performance with 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity.

5. Stability: The Sn-Beta zeolites demonstrated excellent stability, showing no detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The ability to fine-tune the acid site distribution and incorporate Sn as single sites in the zeolite framework are particularly important for achieving high performance and stability in BEA topologic zeolites for PDH reactions.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石如Sn-Beta。影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：通过H-Beta脱铝和将Sn物种引入骨架的两步后合成程序是制备Sn-Beta沸石的有效方法。进一步与NaCl溶液进行离子交换可将Sn-Beta转化为Na-Sn-Beta，提高性能。

2. 酸性位分布：Lewis酸位与Brønsted酸位的比例(L/B比)至关重要。高L/B比有利于PDH反应，因为Lewis酸位催化脱氢反应，而Brønsted酸位促进不需要的裂化反应。

3. Sn的引入：将Sn引入沸石骨架创造了孤立的Sn单原子，这些原子作为Lewis酸位，是催化剂性能的关键。

4. 组成优化：Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂具有最高的Lewis酸位数量和最低的Brønsted/Lewis比，表现出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为92%。

5. 稳定性：Sn-Beta沸石表现出优异的稳定性，在苛刻的反应条件下72小时内没有检测到明显失活。

这些因素有助于提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH反应中实现高性能和稳定性，精细调节酸性位分布和将Sn作为单一位点引入沸石骨架的能力尤为重要。
