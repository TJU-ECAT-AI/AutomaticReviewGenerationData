[1] "Sn-Beta zeolites were synthesized via a well-established two-step post-synthesis procedure, which is composed of the dealumination of parent H-Beta and then incorporation of Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Si-Beta through an impregnation process"

[2] "The Sn-Beta were converted to Na-Sn-Beta by ion-exchange with 1 M NaCl solution at room temperature for 48 h."

[3] "The Lewis acid is the active site for dehydrogenation reaction, and the Brnsted acid is responsible for cracking reaction. The dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate is positively proportional to the L/B ratio, and a high L/B ratio is beneficial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."

[4] "The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst possessing the highest amount of Lewis acid but the lowest Brnsted/Lewis ratio, exhibits the best performance in the PDH, which delivers propane conversion of 40% and propylene selectivity of 92%."

[5] "Most importantly, these Sn-Beta zeolites are extremely stable without any detectable deactivation under the harsh reaction condition for 72 h."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, particularly for BEA topologic zeolites like Sn-Beta. Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Preparation method: A two-step post-synthesis procedure involving dealumination of H-Beta and incorporation of Sn species into the framework is effective for creating Sn-Beta zeolites. Further ion-exchange with NaCl solution can convert Sn-Beta to Na-Sn-Beta, enhancing performance.

2. Acid site distribution: The ratio of Lewis to Brønsted acid sites (L/B ratio) is crucial. A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH, as Lewis acid sites catalyze dehydrogenation while Brønsted acid sites promote undesired cracking reactions.

3. Sn incorporation: The incorporation of Sn into the zeolite framework creates isolated Sn single atoms, which act as Lewis acid sites and are key to the catalyst's performance.

4. Composition optimization: The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest amount of Lewis acid sites and lowest Brønsted/Lewis ratio, showed the best performance with 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity.

5. Stability: The Sn-Beta zeolites demonstrated excellent stability, showing no detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The ability to fine-tune the acid site distribution and incorporate Sn as single sites in the zeolite framework are particularly important for achieving high performance and stability in BEA topologic zeolites for PDH reactions.

制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构显著影响沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能，特别是对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石如Sn-Beta。影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. 制备方法：通过H-Beta脱铝和将Sn物种引入骨架的两步后合成程序是制备Sn-Beta沸石的有效方法。进一步与NaCl溶液进行离子交换可将Sn-Beta转化为Na-Sn-Beta，提高性能。

2. 酸性位分布：Lewis酸位与Brønsted酸位的比例(L/B比)至关重要。高L/B比有利于PDH反应，因为Lewis酸位催化脱氢反应，而Brønsted酸位促进不需要的裂化反应。

3. Sn的引入：将Sn引入沸石骨架创造了孤立的Sn单原子，这些原子作为Lewis酸位，是催化剂性能的关键。

4. 组成优化：Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂具有最高的Lewis酸位数量和最低的Brønsted/Lewis比，表现出最佳性能，丙烷转化率为40%，丙烯选择性为92%。

5. 稳定性：Sn-Beta沸石表现出优异的稳定性，在苛刻的反应条件下72小时内没有检测到明显失活。

这些因素有助于提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。对于BEA拓扑结构的沸石在PDH反应中实现高性能和稳定性，精细调节酸性位分布和将Sn作为单一位点引入沸石骨架的能力尤为重要。

The preparation method, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of Sn-Beta zeolites in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation method: A two-step post-synthesis procedure is used, involving dealumination of parent H-Beta zeolite followed by incorporation of Sn species into the framework. This indirect synthesis method allows for better control of Sn incorporation and preserves the BEA topology.

2. Composition: The Sn/Si ratio in the zeolite structure greatly affects catalytic performance. An optimized Si/Sn ratio of around 30 (Sn-Beta-30) showed the best results in PDH reactions.

3. Zeolite topology: The BEA topology of Beta zeolites provides a suitable framework for incorporating Sn atoms and creating isolated single-site Sn species, which act as Lewis acid sites.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Lewis acidity: The Lewis acid sites created by single-site Sn atoms are the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions.

2. Brønsted to Lewis acid ratio (B/L ratio): A high L/B ratio is beneficial for PDH reactions, as it promotes dehydrogenation over cracking.

3. Na+ exchange: Na-Sn-Beta catalysts showed enhanced performance due to reduced Brønsted acidity while maintaining Lewis acidity.

The Na-Sn-Beta-30 catalyst, with the highest Lewis acidity and lowest B/L ratio, demonstrated the best performance, achieving 40% propane conversion and 92% propylene selectivity. Additionally, Sn-Beta zeolites exhibited excellent stability, showing no detectable deactivation under harsh reaction conditions for 72 hours.

Sn-Beta沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的显著影响：

1. 制备方法：采用两步后合成法，包括母体H-Beta沸石的脱铝和锡物种的骨架引入。这种间接合成方法可以更好地控制锡的引入，并保持BEA拓扑结构。

2. 组成：沸石结构中的Sn/Si比对催化性能有很大影响。优化后的Si/Sn比约为30（Sn-Beta-30）在PDH反应中表现最佳。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：Beta沸石的BEA拓扑结构为引入锡原子和创建孤立的单位点锡物种提供了合适的框架，这些锡物种充当路易斯酸位。

改善性能的关键因素：

1. 路易斯酸性：由单位点锡原子创建的路易斯酸位是脱氢反应的活性位点。

2. 布伦斯特酸与路易斯酸比例（B/L比）：高L/B比有利于PDH反应，因为它促进脱氢而不是裂解。

3. Na+交换：Na-Sn-Beta催化剂显示出增强的性能，因为它减少了布伦斯特酸性同时保持了路易斯酸性。

Na-Sn-Beta-30催化剂具有最高的路易斯酸性和最低的B/L比，表现出最佳性能，实现了40%的丙烷转化率和92%的丙烯选择性。此外，Sn-Beta沸石表现出优异的稳定性，在72小时的苛刻反应条件下没有检测到明显的失活。

5. Single-site Sn structure: The incorporation of isolated Sn atoms into the zeolite framework creates single-site catalysts, which contribute to improved activity and selectivity.

These factors lead to improved propylene selectivity (up to 92%), high conversion rates (40% for Na-Sn-Beta-30), and excellent catalyst stability (no detectable deactivation for 72 hours under harsh reaction conditions).

While the literature does not specifically discuss silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for PDH, the principles of optimizing acid site distribution and creating single-site metal centers could potentially be applied to other zeolite types to improve their performance in PDH reactions.
