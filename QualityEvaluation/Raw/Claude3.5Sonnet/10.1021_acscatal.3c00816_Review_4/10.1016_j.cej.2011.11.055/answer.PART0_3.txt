[1] "Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "XRD patterns of the support have the representative peaks at 78 and 2324, corresponding to that given in Ref. [17] for pure ZSM-5."

[3] "The possible reason for this behavior may be attributed to the acidic properties of lanthanum ions. It is known that the La3+ cations are also weak Lewis acid sites"

[4] "As for the Z700 sample, it exhibits the much larger reduction peaks of Sn species at high temperature, suggesting that in this case more amounts of Sn0 components have produced. Similarly, this behavior may be linked with the severe dealumination of the catalyst, which in consequence weakens the interactions between Sn species and the carrier."

[5] "To explain these, it should first be noted that the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particle and the acid site) may work collaboratively. From this, it is assumed that an optimum ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites over the catalyst should exist."

The literature primarily focuses on PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) rather than BEA or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about zeolite-based catalysts for PDH in general:

1. Zeolite topology: Three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 are better catalytic supports than mesoporous materials like SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature.

2. Composition: The addition of promoters like La can improve catalyst performance. La3+ cations act as weak Lewis acid sites, which can influence the catalyst's acidity and stability.

3. Preparation methods: Calcination temperature of promoters (e.g., La) significantly affects catalyst performance. Proper calcination can strengthen interactions between metal species (e.g., Pt, Sn) and the support, improving catalyst stability and activity.

4. Key factors for improved performance:
   - Optimal acidity: Balancing the number of active sites and acid sites is crucial for catalyst performance.
   - Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (e.g., Pt, Sn) and the support enhance catalyst stability and activity.
   - Thermal stability: Proper preparation methods can improve the thermal stability of the zeolite support, preventing dealumination and maintaining catalyst structure.
   - Metal dispersion: Preventing metal sintering (e.g., Pt particles) is important for maintaining catalyst activity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. However, the specific effects of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites are not directly addressed in this literature.

该文献主要关注PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应，而非BEA或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。然而，我们可以从中获得一些关于分子筛基催化剂用于PDH的一般性见解：

1. 分子筛拓扑结构：由于其本质特性，像ZSM-5这样的三维微孔材料比SBA-15等介孔材料更适合作为催化剂载体。

2. 组成：添加助剂如La可以改善催化剂性能。La3+阳离子作为弱Lewis酸位点，可以影响催化剂的酸性和稳定性。

3. 制备方法：助剂（如La）的焙烧温度显著影响催化剂性能。适当的焙烧可以加强金属物种（如Pt、Sn）与载体之间的相互作用，提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。

4. 提高性能的关键因素：
   - 最佳酸度：平衡活性位点和酸位点的数量对催化剂性能至关重要。
   - 金属-载体相互作用：金属物种（如Pt、Sn）与载体之间的强相互作用可提高催化剂的稳定性和活性。
   - 热稳定性：合适的制备方法可以提高分子筛载体的热稳定性，防止脱铝并维持催化剂结构。
   - 金属分散性：防止金属烧结（如Pt颗粒）对维持催化剂活性很重要。

这些因素有助于提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。然而，该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛的具体效果。
