[1] "Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "Our previous work discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. The powder H-ZSM-5 was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.123 M La(NO3)3 at 80 C at first, then dried at 80 C for 3 h, calcined in an air flow at 500 C, 550 C, 600 C, 650 C and 700 C for 4 h, respectively."

[4] "The catalyst when the calcination temperature of La was 650 C showed the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene was about 34.3% over 82 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 C."

The literature primarily focuses on PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite topology: Three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 were found to be better catalytic supports than mesoporous materials like SBA-15 for propane dehydrogenation, due to their intrinsic nature.

2. Composition: The addition of La as a promoter to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts resulted in higher propane conversion and propene selectivity.

3. Preparation method: The catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation, with a focus on the calcination temperature of La. The calcination temperature significantly affected catalyst performance.

4. Calcination temperature: The optimal calcination temperature for La was found to be 650°C, which resulted in the best reaction activity and stability.

5. Performance: The optimized catalyst (calcined at 650°C) achieved an average propene yield of 34.3% over 82 hours at 590°C.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Proper selection of zeolite topology (three-dimensional microporous structure)
- Addition of suitable promoters (La in this case)
- Optimization of preparation conditions, particularly the calcination temperature

While this study doesn't directly address BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it suggests that careful optimization of preparation methods and composition can significantly impact catalyst performance in PDH reactions.

该文献主要关注PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛。然而，我们可以从中得出一些关于制备方法、组成和分子筛拓扑结构对催化剂性能影响的见解：

1. 分子筛拓扑结构：三维微孔材料如ZSM-5被发现是比介孔材料SBA-15更好的丙烷脱氢催化剂载体，这归因于其本质特性。

2. 组成：向PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂中添加La作为助剂，可提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 制备方法：催化剂通过序贯浸渍法制备，重点关注La的焙烧温度。焙烧温度显著影响催化剂性能。

4. 焙烧温度：La的最佳焙烧温度被发现是650°C，这导致了最佳的反应活性和稳定性。

5. 性能：优化后的催化剂（650°C焙烧）在590°C下82小时内平均丙烯收率达到34.3%。

影响性能提升的关键因素包括：
- 合适的分子筛拓扑结构选择（三维微孔结构）
- 添加适当的助剂（本例中为La）
- 优化制备条件，特别是焙烧温度

虽然这项研究没有直接涉及BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐分子筛，但它表明，仔细优化制备方法和组成可以显著影响PDH反应中的催化剂性能。
