[1] "Kumar et al. investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "Our previous work discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "The catalyst calcined at 650 C shows the best reaction activity and stability."

[4] "Too high calcination temperature (700 C) changes the character of Pt and the catalyst structure."

The literature does not directly discuss BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation. However, it provides some insights on zeolite-based catalysts for PDH reactions:

1. Pore geometry influences catalytic properties. Three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 perform better than mesoporous materials like SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature.

2. Promoters and reaction conditions affect catalyst performance. The addition of La to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts improved propane conversion and propene selectivity.

3. Preparation methods, particularly calcination temperature, significantly impact catalyst performance. For the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst studied, calcination at 650°C produced the best activity and stability.

4. Excessive calcination temperature (700°C) negatively affected Pt character and catalyst structure, leading to decreased performance.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Optimal pore geometry (three-dimensional microporous structure)
- Suitable promoters (e.g., La for PtSnNa/ZSM-5)
- Appropriate preparation methods, especially calcination temperature
- Balanced acidity and metal function on the catalyst surface

While the study focuses on ZSM-5 based catalysts, these principles may apply to other zeolite topologies, including BEA and silicoaluminophosphates, for propane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用。然而，它提供了一些关于基于沸石催化剂在PDH反应中的见解：

1. 孔隙几何结构影响催化性能。由于其固有性质，三维微孔材料(如ZSM-5)的性能优于介孔材料(如SBA-15)。

2. 助剂和反应条件影响催化剂性能。向PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂中添加La提高了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 制备方法，特别是煅烧温度，显著影响催化剂性能。对于所研究的PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂，650°C煅烧产生了最佳的活性和稳定性。

4. 过高的煅烧温度(700°C)对Pt特性和催化剂结构产生负面影响，导致性能下降。

提高性能的关键因素包括：
- 最佳孔隙几何结构(三维微孔结构)
- 合适的助剂(例如，PtSnNa/ZSM-5的La)
- 适当的制备方法，尤其是煅烧温度
- 催化剂表面酸性和金属功能的平衡

虽然该研究主要关注基于ZSM-5的催化剂，但这些原理可能适用于其他沸石拓扑结构，包括BEA和硅铝磷酸盐，用于丙烷脱氢反应。

[2] "XRD patterns of the support have the representative peaks at 78 and 2324, corresponding to that given in Ref. [17] for pure ZSM-5."

[3] "The possible reason for this behavior may be attributed to the acidic properties of lanthanum ions. It is known that the La3+ cations are also weak Lewis acid sites"

[4] "As for the Z700 sample, it exhibits the much larger reduction peaks of Sn species at high temperature, suggesting that in this case more amounts of Sn0 components have produced. Similarly, this behavior may be linked with the severe dealumination of the catalyst, which in consequence weakens the interactions between Sn species and the carrier."

[5] "To explain these, it should first be noted that the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particle and the acid site) may work collaboratively. From this, it is assumed that an optimum ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites over the catalyst should exist."

The literature primarily focuses on PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) rather than BEA or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some insights can be drawn about zeolite-based catalysts for PDH in general:

1. Zeolite topology: Three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 are better catalytic supports than mesoporous materials like SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature.

2. Composition: The addition of promoters like La can improve catalyst performance. La3+ cations act as weak Lewis acid sites, which can influence the catalyst's acidity and stability.

3. Preparation methods: Calcination temperature of promoters (e.g., La) significantly affects catalyst performance. Proper calcination can strengthen interactions between metal species (e.g., Pt, Sn) and the support, improving catalyst stability and activity.

4. Key factors for improved performance:
   - Optimal acidity: Balancing the number of active sites and acid sites is crucial for catalyst performance.
   - Metal-support interactions: Strong interactions between metal species (e.g., Pt, Sn) and the support enhance catalyst stability and activity.
   - Thermal stability: Proper preparation methods can improve the thermal stability of the zeolite support, preventing dealumination and maintaining catalyst structure.
   - Metal dispersion: Preventing metal sintering (e.g., Pt particles) is important for maintaining catalyst activity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. However, the specific effects of BEA topology and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites are not directly addressed in this literature.
