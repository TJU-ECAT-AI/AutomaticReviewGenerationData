[1] "Kumar et al. [8] investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "Our previous work [9],[10],[11],[12] discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."

[3] "PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. The powder H-ZSM-5 was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.123 M La(NO3)3 at 80 C at first, then dried at 80 C for 3 h, calcined in an air flow at 500 C, 550 C, 600 C, 650 C and 700 C for 4 h, respectively."

[4] "In our experiments, the catalyst when the calcination temperature of La was 650 C showed the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene was about 34.3% over 82 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 C."

The literature provides some insights into how preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, specifically for ZSM-5 zeolites:

1. Zeolite topology: Three-dimensional microporous materials like ZSM-5 were found to be better catalytic supports than mesoporous materials like SBA-15 due to their intrinsic nature.

2. Composition: The addition of promoters, specifically La, to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts resulted in higher propane conversion and propene selectivity.

3. Preparation method: PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared using sequential impregnation. The calcination temperature of La was found to be a crucial factor in catalyst performance.

4. Optimal conditions: The catalyst calcined at 650°C showed the best reaction activity and stability, with an average propene yield of 34.3% over 82 hours at 590°C.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Proper selection of zeolite topology (three-dimensional microporous structure)
- Use of appropriate promoters (La in this case)
- Optimization of preparation conditions, particularly calcination temperature

However, the literature does not provide specific information on BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions. To fully answer the question, additional research on these specific zeolite types would be necessary.

该文献对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构如何影响其性能提供了一些见解,特别是针对ZSM-5沸石:

1. 沸石拓扑结构:由于其本质特性,三维微孔材料(如ZSM-5)被发现是比介孔材料(如SBA-15)更好的催化剂载体。

2. 组成:向PtSnNa/ZSM-5催化剂中添加助剂,特别是La,可提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

3. 制备方法:PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5催化剂是采用序列浸渍法制备的。La的煅烧温度被发现是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。

4. 最佳条件:在650°C下煅烧的催化剂显示出最佳的反应活性和稳定性,在590°C下82小时内平均丙烯产率为34.3%。

contributes to improved performance的关键因素包括:
- 适当选择沸石拓扑结构(三维微孔结构)
- 使用适当的助剂(本例中为La)
- 优化制备条件,特别是煅烧温度

然而,该文献并未提供有关BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的具体信息。要全面回答这个问题,需要对这些特定类型的沸石进行额外的研究。
