[1] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."

[3] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."

[4] "The substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."

[5] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

The literature focuses on Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance can be identified:

1. Preparation method: Hydrothermal synthesis was used to incorporate cerium into the ZSM-5 framework, which influenced the zeolite's morphology and textural properties.

2. Composition: The optimal cerium content was found to be 0.76 wt%, resulting in the highest reaction activity and stability.

3. Influence on metal dispersion: Ce-modified supports promoted better dispersion of metallic particles.

4. Acidity modification: Cerium substitution decreased the strength of weak acid sites.

5. Improved hydrogen adsorption: The Ce-modified material enhanced the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperatures.

6. Enhanced metal-support interaction: Cerium incorporation strengthened the interaction between tin species and the support.

7. Coke migration: The Ce-modified support facilitated the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support, potentially improving catalyst stability.

These factors contributed to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in the PDH reaction. While the study doesn't directly address BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, similar principles of metal dispersion, acidity modification, and enhanced metal-support interactions could potentially be applied to other zeolite-based catalysts to improve their performance in PDH reactions.

该文献主要研究了用于丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应的Ce改性ZSM-5沸石，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石。但是，我们可以识别出一些对改善催化剂性能有贡献的关键因素：

1. 制备方法：使用水热合成法将铈掺入ZSM-5骨架，这影响了沸石的形态和织构特性。

2. 组成：最佳铈含量被发现为0.76 wt%，能够获得最高的反应活性和稳定性。

3. 对金属分散的影响：Ce改性载体促进了金属粒子的更好分散。

4. 酸度修饰：铈取代降低了弱酸位的强度。

5. 改善氢气吸附：Ce改性材料增强了催化剂在低温下吸附氢气的能力。

6. 增强金属-载体相互作用：铈的掺入加强了锡物种与载体之间的相互作用。

7. 积炭迁移：Ce改性载体促进了积炭从金属活性位点向载体迁移，可能改善了催化剂的稳定性。

这些因素有助于提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。虽然该研究没有直接涉及BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但类似的金属分散、酸度修饰和增强金属-载体相互作用的原理可能也适用于其他基于沸石的催化剂，以改善它们在PDH反应中的性能。
