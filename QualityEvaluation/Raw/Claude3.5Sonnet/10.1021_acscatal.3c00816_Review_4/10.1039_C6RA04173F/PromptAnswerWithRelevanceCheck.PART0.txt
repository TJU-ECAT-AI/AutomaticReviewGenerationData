[1] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."

[3] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."

[4] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."

[5] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

The literature focuses on Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, rather than BEA or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance can be inferred:

1. Preparation method: Hydrothermal synthesis of Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites allows for incorporation of cerium species into the zeolite framework.

2. Composition: The optimal content of Ce in the support was found to be 0.76 wt%.

3. Influence on catalyst properties:
- Promotes dispersion of metallic particles
- Improves hydrogen adsorption at low temperatures
- Enhances interaction between Sn species and the support
- Decreases strength of weak acidity sites
- Facilitates coke migration from metal active sites to the support

4. Performance improvements:
- Highest reaction activity 
- Improved stability in propane dehydrogenation
- Enhanced propylene selectivity (implied by improved stability and activity)

These factors contribute to better catalyst performance by optimizing metal dispersion, modifying acidity, improving metal-support interactions, and enhancing coke resistance. While the specific zeolite topology differs, these principles may be applicable to other zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

该文献主要研究了含Ce的ZSM-5沸石用于丙烷脱氢反应,而非BEA或硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而,我们可以推断出一些导致催化剂性能提高的关键因素:

1. 制备方法:水热合成含Ce的ZSM-5沸石,使铈物种能够掺入沸石骨架中。

2. 组成:发现支持剂中Ce的最佳含量为0.76 wt%。

3. 对催化剂性能的影响:
- 促进金属颗粒的分散
- 改善低温下的氢气吸附能力
- 增强Sn物种与支持剂的相互作用
- 降低弱酸性位点的强度
- 促进焦炭从金属活性位点向支持剂迁移

4. 性能改进:
- 最高的反应活性
- 提高丙烷脱氢反应的稳定性
- 提高丙烯选择性(由提高的稳定性和活性推断)

这些因素通过优化金属分散、调节酸度、改善金属-载体相互作用以及增强抗焦性来提高催化剂性能。尽管具体的沸石拓扑结构不同,但这些原理可能适用于其他用于丙烷脱氢的沸石基催化剂。
