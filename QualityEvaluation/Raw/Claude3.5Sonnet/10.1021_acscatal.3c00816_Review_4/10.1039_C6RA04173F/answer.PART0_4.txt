[1] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."

[3] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."

[4] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."

[5] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

The literature primarily focuses on Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, rather than BEA or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance can be inferred:

1. Preparation method: Hydrothermal synthesis was used to incorporate cerium into the ZSM-5 framework, which influenced the zeolite's morphology and textural properties.

2. Composition: The optimal cerium content was found to be 0.76 wt%, resulting in the highest reaction activity and stability.

3. Metal dispersion: Ce-modification promoted better dispersion of metallic particles (Pt and Sn) on the support.

4. Acidity modification: Cerium substitution decreased the strength of weak acid sites.

5. Metal-support interaction: Ce-modification enhanced the interaction between Sn species and the support.

6. Hydrogen adsorption: The Ce-modified material improved the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperatures.

7. Coke migration: Cerium facilitated the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support.

These factors collectively contributed to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation reactions. While the study doesn't directly address BEA or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, similar principles of metal dispersion, acidity modification, and coke resistance could potentially be applied to other zeolite topologies to enhance their performance in PDH reactions.

这篇文献主要关注了Ce改性的ZSM-5沸石在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用，而不是BEA或硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而，我们可以从中推断出一些提高催化剂性能的关键因素：

1. 制备方法：采用水热合成法将铈掺入ZSM-5骨架，这影响了沸石的形貌和织构特性。

2. 组成：发现最佳的铈含量为0.76 wt%，这能得到最高的反应活性和稳定性。

3. 金属分散：Ce改性促进了金属粒子（Pt和Sn）在载体上的更好分散。

4. 酸性修饰：铈取代降低了弱酸位的强度。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：Ce改性增强了Sn物种与载体之间的相互作用。

6. 氢吸附：Ce改性材料提高了催化剂在低温下吸附氢的能力。

7. 焦炭迁移：铈促进了焦炭从金属活性位向载体的迁移。

这些因素共同促进了丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提高。虽然该研究没有直接涉及BEA或硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但类似的金属分散、酸性修饰和抗焦炭原理可能也适用于其他沸石拓扑结构，以提高它们在PDH反应中的性能。
