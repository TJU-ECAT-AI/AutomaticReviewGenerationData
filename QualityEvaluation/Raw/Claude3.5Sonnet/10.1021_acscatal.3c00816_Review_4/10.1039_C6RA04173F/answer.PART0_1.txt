[1] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."

[3] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."

[4] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."

[5] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

The literature focuses on Ce-modified ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance can be extracted:

1. Preparation method: Hydrothermal synthesis of Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites allowed for incorporation of cerium species into the zeolite framework.

2. Composition: The optimal content of Ce in the support was found to be 0.76 wt%.

3. Influence on catalyst properties:
- Ce modification promoted dispersion of metallic particles
- Improved catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature
- Enhanced interaction between Sn species and the support
- Decreased strength of weak acidity
- Facilitated migration of coke from metal active sites to the support

4. Performance improvements:
- Highest reaction activity
- Improved stability in propane dehydrogenation

While the study does not directly address BEA or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, it demonstrates that careful modification of zeolite composition and structure can significantly impact catalyst performance in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

该文献主要关注了用于丙烷脱氢的Ce改性ZSM-5沸石,而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而,我们可以提取一些有助于改善催化剂性能的关键因素:

1. 制备方法:水热合成Ce含量的ZSM-5沸石允许将铈物种掺入沸石骨架中。

2. 成分:发现支持体中Ce的最佳含量为0.76 wt%。

3. 对催化剂性能的影响:
- Ce改性促进了金属颗粒的分散
- 改善了催化剂在低温下吸附氢气的能力
- 增强了Sn物种与支持体之间的相互作用
- 降低了弱酸性强度
- 促进了焦炭从金属活性位点迁移到支持体

4. 性能改进:
- 最高的反应活性
- 改善了丙烷脱氢的稳定性

虽然该研究没有直接涉及BEA或硅铝磷酸盐沸石,但它表明,对沸石成分和结构进行仔细修饰可以显著影响丙烷脱氢反应中的催化剂性能。
