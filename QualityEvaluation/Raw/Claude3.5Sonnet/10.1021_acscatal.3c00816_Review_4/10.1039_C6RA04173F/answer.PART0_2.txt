[1] "Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized and then used as supports for platinumtin catalysts in propane dehydrogenation."

[2] "It is found that parts of the cerium species can be incorporated into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites, thus influencing the morphologies and textural properties of the supports."

[3] "The use of the Ce-modified material promotes the dispersion of metallic particles, improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature and enhances the interaction of Sn species and the support."

[4] "Moreover, the substitution of Ce decreases the strength of the weak acidity and facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support."

[5] "In the present work, the optimal content of Ce in the support is 0.76 wt%, which results in the highest reaction activity and the stability in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation."

The study focuses on Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, some key factors contributing to improved performance can be identified:

1. Preparation method: Hydrothermal synthesis of Ce-containing ZSM-5 zeolites allows for incorporation of cerium species into the zeolite framework.

2. Composition: The optimal content of Ce in the support was found to be 0.76 wt%.

3. Influence on catalyst structure: Ce incorporation affects the morphology and textural properties of the supports, promotes dispersion of metallic particles, and enhances interaction between Sn species and the support.

4. Impact on acidity: Ce substitution decreases the strength of weak acid sites.

5. Coke resistance: Ce facilitates the migration of coke from metal active sites to the support.

6. Hydrogen adsorption: Ce-modified material improves the catalytic ability to adsorb hydrogen at low temperature.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The optimal Ce content resulted in the highest reaction activity and stability.

这项研究主要关注含铈ZSM-5沸石在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而，我们可以识别出一些导致性能提升的关键因素：

1. 制备方法：含铈ZSM-5沸石的水热合成法允许将铈物种掺入沸石骨架中。

2. 组成：支撑剂中铈的最佳含量被发现是0.76重量百分比。

3. 对催化剂结构的影响：铈的掺入影响了支撑剂的形态和纹理特性，促进了金属粒子的分散，并增强了锡物种与支撑剂之间的相互作用。

4. 对酸性的影响：铈的替代降低了弱酸位点的强度。

5. 抗积碳性：铈促进了积碳从金属活性位点向支撑剂迁移。

6. 氢气吸附：铈改性材料提高了在低温下吸附氢气的催化能力。

这些因素有助于提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。最佳铈含量导致了最高的反应活性和稳定性。
