          [1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."

[2] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn-based SAPO-34 zeolite supported catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method, with calcined SAPO-34 powder."

[4] "The silico-aluminophosphate zeolite SAPO-34 is a microporous sieve with a chabasite-like structure (structural code CHA), has an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene"

[5] "The structure, acidity and catalytic properties of SAPO-34 depend on the number and distribution of Si in the framework"

[6] "Its Si based acid sites make it resistant to hydrothermal treatment and gives superiority over ZSM-5, where dealumination occur frequently"

[7] "The amount of coke formed over the SAPO-34 supported catalysts was about 30% less than ZSM-5 supported catalysts, after 8 h reaction."

[8] "Accordingly, it was found that SAPO-34 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts have both weak Bronsted and Lewis acid sites."

          The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The study focuses on SAPO-34 as a support for PtSn-based catalysts.

Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst was prepared using a sequential impregnation method with calcined SAPO-34 powder.

Composition: The catalyst contains both Pt and Sn metals supported on SAPO-34 zeolite. The number and distribution of Si in the SAPO-34 framework influence its structure, acidity, and catalytic properties.

Zeolite topology: SAPO-34 has a chabasite-like structure (CHA topology) with microporous channels, providing excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Shape selectivity: The microporous structure of SAPO-34 provides an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene, enhancing selectivity.

2. Acidity: SAPO-34 and its supported catalysts have weak Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which contribute to the selective conversion of intermediates to propylene and reduce unwanted side reactions.

3. Surface area: SAPO-34 supported catalysts have a larger surface area compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalytic performance.

4. Hydrothermal stability: The Si-based acid sites in SAPO-34 make it more resistant to hydrothermal treatment compared to ZSM-5, which is prone to dealumination.

5. Coke resistance: SAPO-34 supported catalysts form less coke (about 30% less) compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalyst stability.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts, resulting in higher propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefins selectivity (>97%) compared to other zeolite-based catalysts like PtSn/ZSM-5.

          制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。这项研究主要关注SAPO-34作为PtSn基催化剂的载体。

制备方法：双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂是通过使用煅烧的SAPO-34粉末进行序列浸渍法制备的。

成分：催化剂包含负载在SAPO-34沸石上的Pt和Sn金属。SAPO-34骨架中Si的数量和分布影响其结构、酸度和催化性能。

沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34具有类似于方沸石的结构（CHA拓扑），具有微孔通道，为丙烯提供了优异的形状选择性。

影响性能提升的关键因素：

1. 形状选择性：SAPO-34的微孔结构为丙烯提供了极好的形状选择效应，提高了选择性。

2. 酸度：SAPO-34及其负载的催化剂具有弱布伦斯特酸位和路易斯酸位，有助于中间体选择性转化为丙烯，并减少不需要的副反应。

3. 比表面积：与ZSM-5负载的催化剂相比，SAPO-34负载的催化剂具有更大的比表面积，提高了催化性能。

4. 水热稳定性：SAPO-34中的硅基酸性位使其比ZSM-5具有更强的水热处理耐受性，后者容易发生脱铝。

5. 抗积碳性：SAPO-34负载的催化剂形成的积碳较少（约少30%），与ZSM-5负载的催化剂相比，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

这些因素共同促进了PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂的优异性能，与其他基于沸石的催化剂（如PtSn/ZSM-5）相比，具有更高的丙烯选择性（94%）和总烯烃选择性（>97%）。
