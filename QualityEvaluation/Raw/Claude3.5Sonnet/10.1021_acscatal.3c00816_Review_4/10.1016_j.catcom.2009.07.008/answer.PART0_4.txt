[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method and characterized by XRF, BET, XRD, NH3-IR, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, HR-TEM and O2-pulse coke analysis."

[2] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[3] "The silico-aluminophosphate zeolite SAPO-34 is a microporous sieve with a chabasite-like structure (structural code CHA), has an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene"

[4] "Its Si based acid sites make it resistant to hydrothermal treatment and gives superiority over ZSM-5, where dealumination occur frequently"

[5] "The Pt metal dispersion on support was verified using a JEM 2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy, operated at 120.0 kV before and after the reaction, for hydrothermally treated samples."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. For SAPO-34 supported PtSn catalysts:

1. Preparation method: The catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation, allowing for better control of metal loading and distribution.

2. Composition: The PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst showed superior performance compared to PtSn/ZSM-5, achieving 94% propylene selectivity and over 97% total olefins selectivity.

3. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34 has a chabasite-like structure (CHA) with microporous channels, providing excellent shape selectivity for propylene.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Larger surface area: SAPO-34 provides a higher surface area compared to ZSM-5, allowing for better dispersion of active metals.

2. Shape selectivity: The microporous structure of SAPO-34 favors propylene formation and limits side reactions.

3. Suitable acidity: SAPO-34 has weaker acid sites compared to ZSM-5, reducing cracking reactions and improving propylene selectivity.

4. Hydrothermal stability: Si-based acid sites in SAPO-34 make it more resistant to hydrothermal treatment compared to Al-based ZSM-5, which is prone to dealumination.

5. Metal dispersion: High-resolution TEM analysis verified good dispersion of Pt on the support, which is crucial for catalyst activity and stability.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions using SAPO-34 supported catalysts.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。对于SAPO-34负载的PtSn催化剂：

1. 制备方法：催化剂通过序列浸渍法制备，可以更好地控制金属负载量和分布。

2. 成分：PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂相比PtSn/ZSM-5表现出更优异的性能，丙烯选择性达到94%，总烯烃选择性超过97%。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34具有类似于方沸石的结构(CHA)，具有微孔通道，为丙烯提供了优异的形状选择性。

影响性能提升的关键因素：

1. 更大的比表面积：相比ZSM-5，SAPO-34提供了更大的比表面积，有利于活性金属的分散。

2. 形状选择性：SAPO-34的微孔结构有利于丙烯的形成，并限制副反应的发生。

3. 适宜的酸性：与ZSM-5相比，SAPO-34具有较弱的酸性位，减少了裂解反应，提高了丙烯选择性。

4. 水热稳定性：SAPO-34的Si基酸性位使其比Al基的ZSM-5具有更好的水热处理耐受性，后者容易发生脱铝。

5. 金属分散性：高分辨率TEM分析证实了Pt在载体上的良好分散，这对催化剂的活性和稳定性至关重要。

这些因素共同促进了SAPO-34负载催化剂在PDH反应中丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的提高。
