[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."

[2] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn-based SAPO-34 zeolite supported catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method, with calcined SAPO-34 powder."

[4] "The silico-aluminophosphate zeolite SAPO-34 is a microporous sieve with a chabasite-like structure (structural code CHA), has an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene"

[5] "The structure, acidity and catalytic properties of SAPO-34 depend on the number and distribution of Si in the framework"

[6] "Its Si based acid sites make it resistant to hydrothermal treatment and gives superiority over ZSM-5, where dealumination occur frequently"

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions:

1. Preparation method: The study used a sequential impregnation method to prepare the PtSn-based SAPO-34 catalyst, which resulted in improved performance compared to other catalysts.

2. Composition: The PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst showed superior performance with 94% propylene selectivity and over 97% total olefins selectivity. The presence of both Pt and Sn on the SAPO-34 support contributed to this improved performance.

3. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite with a chabasite-like structure (CHA topology), demonstrated better performance than ZSM-5. The microporous structure of SAPO-34 provides an excellent shape selective effect for propylene.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Larger surface area: SAPO-34 supported catalysts had a larger surface area compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts.

2. Shape selectivity: The microporous structure of SAPO-34 provides shape selectivity, favoring propylene formation.

3. Suitable acidity: SAPO-34 has weaker acid sites compared to ZSM-5, which helps control the reaction towards propylene formation and reduces unwanted side reactions.

4. Hydrothermal stability: The Si-based acid sites in SAPO-34 make it more resistant to hydrothermal treatment compared to ZSM-5, which is prone to dealumination.

5. Si distribution: The catalytic properties of SAPO-34 depend on the number and distribution of Si in the framework, allowing for fine-tuning of its performance.

These factors collectively contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions using SAPO-34 supported catalysts.
