[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."

[2] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn-based SAPO-34 zeolite supported catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method, with calcined SAPO-34 powder."

[4] "The silico-aluminophosphate zeolite SAPO-34 is a microporous sieve with a chabasite-like structure (structural code CHA), has an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene"

[5] "Its Si based acid sites make it resistant to hydrothermal treatment and gives superiority over ZSM-5, where dealumination occur frequently"

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

For SAPO-34 supported catalysts:

1. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst was prepared using a sequential impregnation method. This method allows for better control of metal distribution and interactions.

2. Composition: The PtSn-based catalyst supported on SAPO-34 showed superior performance compared to PtSn/ZSM-5. The SAPO-34 support provided a larger surface area and suitable acidity, which contributed to improved catalytic performance.

3. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34 has a chabasite-like structure (CHA topology) with microporous channels. This structure provides an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene, which is crucial for improving selectivity.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Shape selectivity: The microporous structure of SAPO-34 allows for better control of product formation, favoring propylene production.

2. Suitable acidity: SAPO-34 has weaker acid sites compared to ZSM-5, which helps to minimize undesired side reactions and improve propylene selectivity.

3. Hydrothermal stability: The Si-based acid sites in SAPO-34 make it more resistant to hydrothermal treatment compared to ZSM-5, which suffers from dealumination.

4. Metal-support interactions: The sequential impregnation method used for PtSn/SAPO-34 preparation likely results in better metal dispersion and interactions with the support, leading to improved catalytic performance.

These factors collectively contribute to the higher propylene selectivity (94%), improved conversion rates, and better catalyst stability observed for PtSn/SAPO-34 compared to other zeolite-based catalysts in PDH reactions.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。

对于SAPO-34负载的催化剂：

1. 制备方法：双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂是使用序列浸渍法制备的。这种方法可以更好地控制金属分布和相互作用。

2. 成分：与PtSn/ZSM-5相比，负载在SAPO-34上的PtSn基催化剂表现出更优异的性能。SAPO-34载体提供了更大的表面积和适宜的酸性，这有助于提高催化性能。

3. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34具有类似于方沸石的结构（CHA拓扑结构），具有微孔通道。这种结构对丙烯具有极好的形状选择性效应，这对提高选择性至关重要。

提高性能的关键因素：

1. 形状选择性：SAPO-34的微孔结构可以更好地控制产物形成，有利于丙烯的生成。

2. 适宜的酸性：与ZSM-5相比，SAPO-34具有较弱的酸性位，这有助于减少不需要的副反应并提高丙烯选择性。

3. 水热稳定性：SAPO-34中的硅基酸性位使其比ZSM-5具有更强的水热处理耐受性，后者容易发生脱铝。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：用于制备PtSn/SAPO-34的序列浸渍法可能会导致更好的金属分散和与载体的相互作用，从而提高催化性能。

这些因素共同促成了PtSn/SAPO-34在PDH反应中观察到的较高丙烯选择性（94%）、改善的转化率和更好的催化剂稳定性，相比其他沸石基催化剂表现更优异。
