[1] "The PtSn-based catalyst was intensified using SAPO-34 as support for direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene."

[2] "Propylene selectivity of 94% and total olefins selectivity greater than 97% was achieved using PtSn/SAPO-34. The results were compared with PtSn/ZSM-5 under identical conditions. The possible reasons for improvement were the larger surface area, shape selectivity and particular by suitable acidity of SAPO-34."

[3] "The bimetallic PtSn-based SAPO-34 zeolite supported catalyst was prepared by sequential impregnation method, with calcined SAPO-34 powder."

[4] "It can be seen that the PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst showed very high propylene and total olefins yields in comparison with PtSn/ZSM-5. This suggested that shape selectivity may play a vital role."

[5] "The coke formed over PtSn-based ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts (of similar contents), under identical operating conditions (8 h operation) were 0.7 and 0.4 wt.% respectively."

[6] "The amount of coke formed over the SAPO-34 supported catalysts was about 30% less than ZSM-5 supported catalysts, after 8 h reaction."

[7] "Accordingly, it was found that SAPO-34 and SAPO-34 supported catalysts have both weak Bronsted and Lewis acid sites."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. 

For SAPO-34 supported catalysts:
1. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn-based SAPO-34 catalyst was prepared using a sequential impregnation method.
2. Composition: The catalyst contains both Pt and Sn metals supported on SAPO-34 zeolite.
3. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34 has a chabasite-like structure with small pore size.

Key factors contributing to improved performance:

1. Shape selectivity: The small pore size of SAPO-34 provides shape selectivity, which is crucial for high propylene yield and selectivity.

2. Acidity: SAPO-34 and its supported catalysts have weak Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, which contribute to the selective conversion of intermediates to propylene.

3. Surface area: SAPO-34 supported catalysts have a larger surface area compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, which may contribute to better catalytic performance.

4. Coke resistance: SAPO-34 supported catalysts showed lower coke formation (about 30% less) compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, indicating better stability.

5. Metal-support interaction: The combination of Pt and Sn on SAPO-34 leads to improved catalytic performance, likely due to synergistic effects between the metals and the support.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts in PDH reactions, resulting in high propylene selectivity (94%) and total olefins selectivity (>97%). The improved catalyst stability is evident from the lower coke formation on SAPO-34 supported catalysts compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts.

催化剂的制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构显著影响了沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。

对于SAPO-34负载的催化剂：
1. 制备方法：双金属PtSn基SAPO-34催化剂是通过序列浸渍法制备的。
2. 成分：催化剂包含负载在SAPO-34沸石上的Pt和Sn金属。
3. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34具有类似于方沸石的结构，孔径较小。

导致性能改善的关键因素：

1. 形状选择性：SAPO-34的小孔径提供了形状选择性，这对于高丙烯产率和选择性至关重要。

2. 酸度：SAPO-34及其负载的催化剂具有弱布伦斯特酸位和路易斯酸位，有助于中间体选择性转化为丙烯。

3. 比表面积：与ZSM-5负载的催化剂相比，SAPO-34负载的催化剂具有更大的比表面积，可能有助于提高催化性能。

4. 抗积碳性：SAPO-34负载的催化剂显示出较低的积碳形成（约低30%），表明其稳定性更好。

5. 金属-载体相互作用：Pt和Sn在SAPO-34上的组合导致催化性能提高，可能是由于金属和载体之间的协同效应。

这些因素共同促进了PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂在PDH反应中的优异性能，导致了高丙烯选择性（94%）和高总烯烃选择性（>97%）。从SAPO-34负载催化剂与ZSM-5负载催化剂相比较低的积碳形成可以看出，催化剂稳定性得到了改善。
