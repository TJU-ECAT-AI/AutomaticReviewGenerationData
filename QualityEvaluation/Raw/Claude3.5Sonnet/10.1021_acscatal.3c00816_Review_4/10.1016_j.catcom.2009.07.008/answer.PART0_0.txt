The literature focuses primarily on SAPO-34 as a support for PtSn-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions, rather than BEA topologic zeolites. However, it provides valuable insights into how zeolite topology and composition influence catalyst performance.

SAPO-34, a silicoaluminophosphate zeolite with a chabasite-like structure (CHA topology), demonstrates superior performance as a catalyst support compared to ZSM-5. The key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability are:

1. Zeolite topology: SAPO-34's microporous structure provides an extremely good shape selective effect for propylene, enhancing selectivity.

2. Acidity: SAPO-34 has suitable weak acidity, which helps control the stereo-chemistry of the reaction and selectively convert intermediates to propylene.

3. Surface area: SAPO-34 supported catalysts have a larger surface area compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalytic performance.

4. Preparation method: The bimetallic PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst is prepared by sequential impregnation, which helps in achieving better metal dispersion and interaction with the support.

5. Composition: The number and distribution of Si in the SAPO-34 framework influence its structure, acidity, and catalytic properties.

6. Coke resistance: SAPO-34 supported catalysts form less coke (about 30% less) compared to ZSM-5 supported catalysts, improving catalyst stability.

These factors collectively contribute to the superior performance of PtSn/SAPO-34 catalysts, resulting in higher propylene selectivity (above 94 wt.%) and yield compared to other zeolite-based catalysts like PtSn/ZSM-5.

该文献主要关注SAPO-34作为丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中PtSn基催化剂的载体，而非BEA拓扑结构的沸石。然而，它提供了关于沸石拓扑结构和成分如何影响催化剂性能的宝贵见解。

SAPO-34是一种具有类似方沸石结构（CHA拓扑结构）的硅铝磷酸盐沸石，作为催化剂载体比ZSM-5表现出更优异的性能。导致丙烯选择性提高、转化率提高和催化剂稳定性提高的关键因素有：

1. 沸石拓扑结构：SAPO-34的微孔结构对丙烯具有极好的形状选择性效应，提高了选择性。

2. 酸度：SAPO-34具有适当的弱酸性，有助于控制反应的立体化学并选择性地将中间体转化为丙烯。

3. 表面积：与ZSM-5负载的催化剂相比，SAPO-34负载的催化剂具有更大的表面积，提高了催化性能。

4. 制备方法：双金属PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂通过序列浸渍法制备，有助于实现更好的金属分散和与载体的相互作用。

5. 成分：SAPO-34骨架中Si的数量和分布影响其结构、酸度和催化性能。

6. 抗积炭性：SAPO-34负载的催化剂形成的积炭较少（约少30%），与ZSM-5负载的催化剂相比，提高了催化剂的稳定性。

这些因素共同促进了PtSn/SAPO-34催化剂的优异性能，与其他基于沸石的催化剂（如PtSn/ZSM-5）相比，具有更高的丙烯选择性（高于94 wt.%）和产率。
