The given literature does not contain any information specifically about the preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology of BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation reactions. The document appears to focus more broadly on ethane and propane conversion technologies, but does not go into detail about the specific zeolite catalysts mentioned in the question. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately answer the question about how these factors influence catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation or what the key factors are for improving selectivity, conversion rates, and stability.

给定的文献中没有包含任何关于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐分子筛在丙烷脱氢反应中的制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构的具体信息。该文档似乎更广泛地关注乙烷和丙烷转化技术，但并未详细介绍问题中提到的特定沸石催化剂。由于缺乏相关文本中的相关信息，我无法准确回答这些因素如何影响丙烷脱氢的催化剂性能，或者提高选择性、转化率和稳定性的关键因素是什么。
