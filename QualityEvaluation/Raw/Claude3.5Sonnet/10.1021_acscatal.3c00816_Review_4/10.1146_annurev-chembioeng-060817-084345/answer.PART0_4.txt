The given literature does not contain any information specifically addressing the influence of preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology on the performance of BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolite catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The document does not discuss factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, or catalyst stability for these specific types of zeolite catalysts in PDH reactions. The literature appears to focus more broadly on ethane and propane dehydrogenation technologies and processes, without going into detail about zeolite catalyst design for PDH.

所给文献中没有具体提及制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中性能的影响。文档未讨论这些特定类型的沸石催化剂在PDH反应中提高丙烯选择性、转化率或催化剂稳定性的因素。该文献似乎更广泛地关注乙烷和丙烷脱氢技术和过程，而没有详细讨论PDH的沸石催化剂设计。
