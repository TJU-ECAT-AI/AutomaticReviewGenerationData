The given literature does not contain any specific information about zeolite-based catalysts, their preparation methods, composition, or topology for propane dehydrogenation reactions. There is no mention of BEA topologic zeolites, silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, or factors affecting propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in propane dehydrogenation. The document appears to focus on other aspects of petrochemical processes and does not address the specific catalysts and reactions asked about in the question.
