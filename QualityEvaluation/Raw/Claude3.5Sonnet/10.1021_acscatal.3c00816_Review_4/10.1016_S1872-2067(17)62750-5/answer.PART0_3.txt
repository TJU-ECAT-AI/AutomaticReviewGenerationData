[1] "SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."

[3] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology significantly influence the performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. Key factors contributing to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability include:

1. Zeolite acidity: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 zeolite prevent the impregnation of Pt precursors into the zeolite, leading to better dispersion of Pt particles on the external surface. This results in higher catalytic activity and stability compared to ZSM-5-supported catalysts.

2. Metal dispersion: PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalysts have Pt particles primarily dispersed over the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition. In contrast, ZSM-5-supported catalysts have more Pt clusters inside the zeolite tunnels, leading to easier deactivation.

3. Interactions between metal components and support: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 zeolite leads to decreased interactions between Sn oxides and the support, resulting in easier reduction of Sn oxides to the metallic state. This reduces the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

4. Addition of promoters: The addition of Na as a promoter improves both propane conversion and propylene selectivity by neutralizing the support acidity.

While the literature does not specifically mention BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, the principles observed in SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 catalysts suggest that zeolite topology and acidity play crucial roles in determining catalyst performance for PDH reactions.

制备方法、成分和沸石拓扑结构对沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能有显著影响。影响丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性的关键因素包括：

1. 沸石酸性：SUZ-4沸石的强酸位阻止了Pt前驱体渗入沸石内部，使Pt颗粒更好地分散在外表面。这导致其比ZSM-5负载的催化剂具有更高的催化活性和稳定性。

2. 金属分散：PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂的Pt颗粒主要分散在外表面，使其不易被碳沉积失活。相比之下，ZSM-5负载的催化剂在沸石通道内有更多的Pt簇，更容易失活。

3. 金属组分与载体的相互作用：ZSM-5沸石的弱酸性导致Sn氧化物与载体之间的相互作用减弱，使Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属态。这降低了碳氢化合物脱氢的催化活性。

4. 助剂的添加：添加Na作为助剂可以中和载体酸性，从而提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

虽然文献中没有特别提到BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但从SUZ-4和ZSM-5催化剂中观察到的原理表明，沸石拓扑结构和酸性在决定PDH反应的催化剂性能方面起着至关重要的作用。
