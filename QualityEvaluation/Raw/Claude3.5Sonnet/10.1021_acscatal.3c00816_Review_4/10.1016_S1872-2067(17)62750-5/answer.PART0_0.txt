[1] "PtSnNa catalysts supported on either the SUZ-4 or the ZSM-5 zeolite (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) were prepared by sequentially impregnating the H-SUZ-4 or H-ZSM-5 with an aqueous mixture of H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 (H2PtCl6 = 5 mg/mL, SnCl4 = 5.85 mg/mL) and with aqueous NaCl (0.5 mol/L)."

[2] "Between these two, the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior based on its higher stability and propylene selectivity"

[3] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The literature primarily focuses on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, the key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance can be inferred from the comparison between SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 based catalysts.

Preparation methods involve impregnating the zeolites with platinum, tin, and sodium precursors. The composition of the catalysts (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) plays a crucial role in their performance.

Zeolite topology significantly influences catalyst performance. The SUZ-4 zeolite, with its stronger acidity, prevents deep impregnation of Pt precursors, leading to more Pt on the external surface. This results in higher stability and propylene selectivity compared to ZSM-5-based catalysts.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Acidity of the zeolite support: Stronger acidity (as in SUZ-4) prevents deep impregnation of metal precursors, leading to better metal distribution.

2. Metal distribution: More Pt on the external surface (as in SUZ-4) leads to higher stability and selectivity.

3. Interactions between metal components and support: Weaker interactions (as in ZSM-5) can lead to easier reduction of Sn oxides to metallic state, decreasing catalytic activity.

4. Pore structure: This affects the distribution of metal particles and carbon deposition, influencing catalyst stability.

While the study doesn't directly address BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, these factors would likely be relevant to their performance in PDH reactions as well.

该文献主要关注SUZ-4和ZSM-5沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而，我们可以从SUZ-4和ZSM-5基催化剂的比较中推断出影响催化剂性能的关键因素。

制备方法涉及将铂、锡和钠前体浸渍到沸石中。催化剂的组成（Pt = 0.5%，Sn = 2.0%，Na = 1.0%）在其性能中起着至关重要的作用。

沸石拓扑结构显著影响催化剂性能。SUZ-4沸石由于其较强的酸性，阻止了Pt前体的深度浸渍，导致更多的Pt分布在外表面。这使得其稳定性和丙烯选择性高于基于ZSM-5的催化剂。

影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. 沸石载体的酸性：较强的酸性（如SUZ-4）防止金属前体的深度浸渍，导致更好的金属分布。

2. 金属分布：外表面上更多的Pt（如SUZ-4）导致更高的稳定性和选择性。

3. 金属组分与载体之间的相互作用：较弱的相互作用（如ZSM-5）可能导致Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属态，降低催化活性。

4. 孔结构：这影响金属颗粒的分布和碳沉积，从而影响催化剂的稳定性。

尽管该研究没有直接涉及BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但这些因素可能也与它们在PDH反应中的性能相关。
