[1] "PtSnNa catalysts supported on either the SUZ-4 or the ZSM-5 zeolite (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) were prepared by sequentially impregnating the H-SUZ-4 or H-ZSM-5 with an aqueous mixture of H2PtCl6 and SnCl4 (H2PtCl6 = 5 mg/mL, SnCl4 = 5.85 mg/mL) and with aqueous NaCl (0.5 mol/L)."

[2] "Between these two, the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to be superior based on its higher stability and propylene selectivity"

[3] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The literature primarily focuses on SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), rather than BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites. However, the key factors contributing to improved catalyst performance can be inferred from the comparison between SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 based catalysts.

Preparation methods involve impregnating the zeolites with platinum, tin, and sodium precursors. The composition of the catalysts (Pt = 0.5%, Sn = 2.0%, Na = 1.0%) plays a crucial role in their performance.

Zeolite topology significantly influences catalyst performance. The SUZ-4 zeolite, with its stronger acidity, prevents deep impregnation of Pt precursors, leading to more Pt on the external surface. This results in higher stability and propylene selectivity compared to ZSM-5-based catalysts.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:

1. Acidity of the zeolite support: Stronger acidity (as in SUZ-4) prevents deep impregnation of metal precursors, leading to better metal distribution.

2. Metal distribution: More Pt on the external surface (as in SUZ-4) leads to higher stability and selectivity.

3. Interactions between metal components and support: Weaker interactions (as in ZSM-5) can lead to easier reduction of Sn oxides to metallic state, decreasing catalytic activity.

4. Pore structure: This affects the distribution of metal particles and carbon deposition, influencing catalyst stability.

While the study doesn't directly address BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, these factors would likely be relevant to their performance in PDH reactions as well.

该文献主要关注SUZ-4和ZSM-5沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中的应用，而非BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石。然而，我们可以从SUZ-4和ZSM-5基催化剂的比较中推断出影响催化剂性能的关键因素。

制备方法涉及将铂、锡和钠前体浸渍到沸石中。催化剂的组成（Pt = 0.5%，Sn = 2.0%，Na = 1.0%）在其性能中起着至关重要的作用。

沸石拓扑结构显著影响催化剂性能。SUZ-4沸石由于其较强的酸性，阻止了Pt前体的深度浸渍，导致更多的Pt分布在外表面。这使得其稳定性和丙烯选择性高于基于ZSM-5的催化剂。

影响性能提升的关键因素包括：

1. 沸石载体的酸性：较强的酸性（如SUZ-4）防止金属前体的深度浸渍，导致更好的金属分布。

2. 金属分布：外表面上更多的Pt（如SUZ-4）导致更高的稳定性和选择性。

3. 金属组分与载体之间的相互作用：较弱的相互作用（如ZSM-5）可能导致Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属态，降低催化活性。

4. 孔结构：这影响金属颗粒的分布和碳沉积，从而影响催化剂的稳定性。

尽管该研究没有直接涉及BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但这些因素可能也与它们在PDH反应中的性能相关。

[1] "SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Zeolite type: SUZ-4-supported catalysts showed better performance than ZSM-5-supported catalysts due to higher catalytic activity and stability.

2. Metal distribution: The distribution of Pt particles on the zeolite surface affects catalyst performance. Pt particles on PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition.

3. Acid site strength: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented the impregnation of Pt precursors into the zeolite, while the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed more precursor to enter the zeolite tunnels. This difference in acid strength affects the final distribution of Pt particles.

4. Metal-support interactions: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 led to lessened interactions between Sn oxides and the support, making it easier for Sn oxides to reduce to the metallic state. This reduction decreased the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

5. Promoters: The addition of Na as a promoter improved both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by influencing the distribution and state of active metal particles, preventing carbon deposition, and modulating the acidity of the catalyst surface. However, the literature does not specifically discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到几个与制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构相关的因素影响：

1. 沸石类型：SUZ-4负载的催化剂由于具有更高的催化活性和稳定性，表现优于ZSM-5负载的催化剂。

2. 金属分布：Pt粒子在沸石表面的分布影响催化剂性能。PtSnNa/SUZ-4上的Pt粒子主要分散在外表面，使其不易被碳沉积失活。

3. 酸位强度：SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前体浸入沸石内部，而ZSM-5的弱酸位允许更多前体进入沸石通道。这种酸强度的差异影响了Pt粒子的最终分布。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：ZSM-5的较弱酸性导致Sn氧化物与载体的相互作用减弱，使Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属态。这种还原降低了碳氢化合物脱氢的催化活性。

5. 助剂：添加Na作为助剂可以提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

这些因素通过影响活性金属粒子的分布和状态、防止碳沉积以及调节催化剂表面的酸度，从而提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。然而，文献中并未具体讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的应用。

The study primarily compares SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). While it doesn't directly discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, the findings provide insights into how zeolite properties influence catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite acidity: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented Pt precursor impregnation into the zeolite, leading to better Pt dispersion on the external surface. This resulted in higher activity and stability compared to ZSM-5.

2. Metal distribution: PtSnNa/SUZ-4 had more Pt particles on the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition. In contrast, PtSnNa/ZSM-5 had more Pt inside the zeolite tunnels.

3. Support-metal interactions: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 led to reduced interactions between Sn oxides and the support, making Sn oxides easier to reduce to metallic state, which decreased catalytic activity.

4. Pore structure: The different pore structures of SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 influenced metal distribution and catalyst performance.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Optimized zeolite acidity
- Proper metal distribution (more on external surface)
- Strong support-metal interactions
- Suitable pore structure

These findings suggest that for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, similar considerations of acidity, metal distribution, and pore structure would be crucial for optimizing PDH catalyst performance.
