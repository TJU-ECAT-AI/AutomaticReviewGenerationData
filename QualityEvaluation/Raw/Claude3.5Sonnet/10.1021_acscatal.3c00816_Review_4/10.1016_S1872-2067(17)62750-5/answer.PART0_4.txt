[1] "SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."

[3] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The literature primarily compares SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. While it does not specifically mention BEA topology or silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, several key factors influencing catalyst performance can be identified:

1. Zeolite acidity: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevent the impregnation of Pt precursors into the zeolite, leading to better Pt dispersion on the external surface. This results in higher catalytic activity and stability compared to ZSM-5.

2. Metal dispersion: Pt particles on PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition. In contrast, ZSM-5's weaker acidity allows more Pt to enter the zeolite tunnels.

3. Interactions between metal components and support: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 results in reduced interactions between Sn oxides and the support, leading to easier reduction of Sn to its metallic state. This decreases catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

4. Preparation method: Sequential impregnation of the zeolite with Pt, Sn, and Na precursors, followed by drying, calcination, and dechlorination, affects the final catalyst structure and performance.

5. Composition: The addition of Na improves both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with an optimal Na content of 1.0%.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability in PDH reactions. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst demonstrated higher activity and improved stability compared to PtSnNa/ZSM-5, mainly due to the differences in Pt distribution and resistance to carbon deposition.

文献主要比较了SUZ-4和ZSM-5沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的性能。虽然没有具体提到BEA拓扑结构或硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但可以确定几个影响催化剂性能的关键因素：

1. 沸石酸度：SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前驱体渗入沸石内部，导致Pt在外表面有更好的分散度。这使得其催化活性和稳定性比ZSM-5更高。

2. 金属分散：PtSnNa/SUZ-4上的Pt粒子主要分散在外表面，使其不易受碳沉积失活。相比之下，ZSM-5的较弱酸度允许更多Pt进入沸石通道。

3. 金属组分与载体的相互作用：ZSM-5的较弱酸度导致Sn氧化物与载体的相互作用减弱，使Sn更容易还原为金属态。这降低了碳氢化合物脱氢的催化活性。

4. 制备方法：依次将Pt、Sn和Na前驱体浸渍到沸石上，然后进行干燥、焙烧和脱氯，这影响了最终催化剂的结构和性能。

5. 组成：添加Na可以提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，最佳Na含量为1.0%。

这些因素有助于提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂表现出比PtSnNa/ZSM-5更高的活性和更好的稳定性，主要是由于Pt分布和抗碳沉积能力的差异。
