[1] "SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."

[3] "The strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The study primarily compares SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 zeolite-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). While it doesn't directly discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, the findings provide insights into how zeolite properties influence catalyst performance:

1. Zeolite acidity: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented Pt precursor impregnation into the zeolite, leading to better Pt dispersion on the external surface. This resulted in higher activity and stability compared to ZSM-5.

2. Metal distribution: PtSnNa/SUZ-4 had more Pt particles on the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition. In contrast, PtSnNa/ZSM-5 had more Pt inside the zeolite tunnels.

3. Support-metal interactions: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 led to reduced interactions between Sn oxides and the support, making Sn oxides easier to reduce to metallic state, which decreased catalytic activity.

4. Pore structure: The different pore structures of SUZ-4 and ZSM-5 influenced metal distribution and catalyst performance.

Key factors contributing to improved performance include:
- Optimized zeolite acidity
- Proper metal distribution (more on external surface)
- Strong support-metal interactions
- Suitable pore structure

These findings suggest that for BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites, similar considerations of acidity, metal distribution, and pore structure would be crucial for optimizing PDH catalyst performance.

该研究主要比较了SUZ-4和ZSM-5沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能。虽然没有直接讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石，但其发现为沸石性质如何影响催化剂性能提供了见解：

1. 沸石酸度：SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前体浸入沸石内部，导致Pt在外表面更好地分散。这使得其活性和稳定性高于ZSM-5。

2. 金属分布：PtSnNa/SUZ-4在外表面有更多的Pt颗粒，使其不易受碳沉积失活。相比之下，PtSnNa/ZSM-5在沸石通道内有更多的Pt。

3. 载体-金属相互作用：ZSM-5的酸性较弱，导致Sn氧化物与载体的相互作用减弱，使Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属态，从而降低了催化活性。

4. 孔结构：SUZ-4和ZSM-5的不同孔结构影响了金属分布和催化剂性能。

提高性能的关键因素包括：
- 优化的沸石酸度
- 适当的金属分布（更多分布在外表面）
- 强的载体-金属相互作用
- 合适的孔结构

这些发现表明，对于BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石，类似的酸度、金属分布和孔结构考虑对于优化PDH催化剂性能至关重要。
