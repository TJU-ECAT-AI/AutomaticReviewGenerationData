[1] "SUZ-4-supported PtSnNa (PtSnNa/SUZ-4) was determined to be a better catalyst for propane dehydrogenation than conventional catalysts supported on ZSM-5, owing to its higher catalytic activity and stability."

[2] "In contrast to ZSM-5-supported catalysts, Pt particles on the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface and are not as readily deactivated by carbon deposition."

[3] "This is because that the strong acid sites of the SUZ-4 zeolite evidently prevented the impregnation of the Pt precursor H2PtCl6 into the zeolite. In contrast, the weak acid sites of the ZSM-5 zeolite led to more of the precursor entering the zeolite tunnels, followed by transformation to highly dispersed Pt clusters during calcination."

[4] "In the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5, the interactions between Sn oxides and the support were lessened, owing to the weaker acidity of the ZSM-5 zeolite. The dispersed Sn oxides were therefore easier to reduce to the metallic state, thus decreasing the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation."

The performance of zeolite-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions is influenced by several factors related to preparation methods, composition, and zeolite topology:

1. Zeolite type: SUZ-4-supported catalysts showed better performance than ZSM-5-supported catalysts due to higher catalytic activity and stability.

2. Metal distribution: The distribution of Pt particles on the zeolite surface affects catalyst performance. Pt particles on PtSnNa/SUZ-4 are primarily dispersed over the external surface, making them less susceptible to deactivation by carbon deposition.

3. Acid site strength: The strong acid sites of SUZ-4 prevented the impregnation of Pt precursors into the zeolite, while the weak acid sites of ZSM-5 allowed more precursor to enter the zeolite tunnels. This difference in acid strength affects the final distribution of Pt particles.

4. Metal-support interactions: The weaker acidity of ZSM-5 led to lessened interactions between Sn oxides and the support, making it easier for Sn oxides to reduce to the metallic state. This reduction decreased the catalytic activity for hydrocarbon dehydrogenation.

5. Promoters: The addition of Na as a promoter improved both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

These factors contribute to improved propylene selectivity, conversion rates, and catalyst stability by influencing the distribution and state of active metal particles, preventing carbon deposition, and modulating the acidity of the catalyst surface. However, the literature does not specifically discuss BEA topologic and silicoaluminophosphate zeolites in PDH reactions.

沸石基催化剂在丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中的性能受到几个与制备方法、组成和沸石拓扑结构相关的因素影响：

1. 沸石类型：SUZ-4负载的催化剂由于具有更高的催化活性和稳定性，表现优于ZSM-5负载的催化剂。

2. 金属分布：Pt粒子在沸石表面的分布影响催化剂性能。PtSnNa/SUZ-4上的Pt粒子主要分散在外表面，使其不易被碳沉积失活。

3. 酸位强度：SUZ-4的强酸位阻止了Pt前体浸入沸石内部，而ZSM-5的弱酸位允许更多前体进入沸石通道。这种酸强度的差异影响了Pt粒子的最终分布。

4. 金属-载体相互作用：ZSM-5的较弱酸性导致Sn氧化物与载体的相互作用减弱，使Sn氧化物更容易还原为金属态。这种还原降低了碳氢化合物脱氢的催化活性。

5. 助剂：添加Na作为助剂可以提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。

这些因素通过影响活性金属粒子的分布和状态、防止碳沉积以及调节催化剂表面的酸度，从而提高丙烯选择性、转化率和催化剂稳定性。然而，文献中并未具体讨论BEA拓扑结构和硅铝磷酸盐沸石在PDH反应中的应用。
