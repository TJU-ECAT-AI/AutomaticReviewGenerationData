[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha."

[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene"

[3] "For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively"

[4] "However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from shale gas resources, providing a new and abundant feedstock source compared to conventional naphtha-based methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a nonoxidative catalytic process, PDH offers a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to fluid catalytic cracking or steam cracking of naphtha.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, addressing the challenge of obtaining high-purity propylene from conventional methods.

4. Capacity expansion: PDH technology allows for further capacity expansion to meet the steadily increasing demand for propylene, which is difficult to achieve with conventional processes alone.

5. Complementary production: PDH serves as a valuable complement to existing propylene production methods, diversifying the production portfolio.

However, current commercial PDH catalysts face challenges such as high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life. This has led to ongoing research for developing alternative catalysts with improved performance and sustainability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用来自页岩气资源的丙烷，与传统的石脑油基方法相比，提供了一种新的且丰富的原料来源。

2. 工艺效率：作为一种非氧化催化过程，与石脑油的流化催化裂化或蒸汽裂解相比，PDH提供了一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，解决了从传统方法获得高纯度丙烯的挑战。

4. 产能扩张：PDH技术允许进一步扩大产能，以满足持续增长的丙烯需求，这是仅依靠传统工艺难以实现的。

5. 互补生产：PDH作为现有丙烯生产方法的有价值补充，使生产组合多样化。

然而，当前商业PDH催化剂面临高成本、高毒性和低循环寿命等挑战。这导致了正在进行的研究，以开发具有改进性能和可持续性的替代催化剂。
