[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha."

[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene"

[3] "For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively"

[4] "However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH technology can utilize the abundant propane feedstock from shale gas resources, addressing the limitations of conventional naphtha-based processes.

2. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers a more direct and efficient route to propylene production compared to conventional fluid catalytic cracking or steam cracking methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology allows for higher propylene selectivity, potentially reducing unwanted byproducts and improving overall yield.

4. Flexibility: PDH can serve as a complementary process to existing production methods, allowing for increased capacity and production flexibility.

5. Potential for improved catalysts: Current research focuses on developing alternative catalysts with better performance, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact compared to existing commercial catalysts.

These advantages position PDH as a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene, addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
