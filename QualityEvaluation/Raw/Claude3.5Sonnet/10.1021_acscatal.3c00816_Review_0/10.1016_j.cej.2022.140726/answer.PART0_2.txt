[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha."

[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene"

[3] "For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively"

[4] "However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to the mass exploitation of shale gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct and non-oxidative process, PDH offers improved efficiency compared to traditional methods. It allows for a more straightforward conversion of propane to propylene without the need for complex separation processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology can achieve high propylene selectivity, especially with the development of new catalysts. This addresses the challenge of producing propylene with high purity and minimal byproducts.

4. Capacity expansion: PDH provides an efficient way to expand propylene production capacity, helping to meet the steadily increasing demand for this valuable chemical feedstock.

5. Complementary production method: PDH serves as a valuable complement to conventional production methods, offering flexibility in propylene production.

However, challenges remain in developing more cost-effective, less toxic, and longer-lasting catalysts for PDH processes. Current commercial catalysts based on PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 have drawbacks in terms of cost, toxicity, and cycling life. Ongoing research focuses on developing alternative catalysts with improved performance and sustainability to further enhance the advantages of PDH technology.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷，由于页岩气资源的大规模开发，丙烷供应充足。这解决了传统方法如流化催化裂化和石脑油蒸汽裂解所面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：作为一种直接和非氧化过程，PDH比传统方法提供了更高的效率。它允许更直接地将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需复杂的分离过程。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术可以实现高丙烯选择性，特别是随着新催化剂的开发。这解决了生产高纯度丙烯和最小化副产品的挑战。

4. 产能扩张：PDH提供了一种高效的方式来扩大丙烯生产能力，有助于满足这种有价值的化学原料不断增长的需求。

5. 互补生产方法：PDH作为传统生产方法的有价值补充，为丙烯生产提供了灵活性。

然而，在开发更具成本效益、毒性更低和使用寿命更长的PDH工艺催化剂方面仍然存在挑战。当前基于PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3的商业催化剂在成本、毒性和循环寿命方面存在缺点。正在进行的研究集中于开发具有改进性能和可持续性的替代催化剂，以进一步增强PDH技术的优势。
