[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha."

[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Ability to meet increasing demand: PDH provides additional production capacity to address the steadily growing demand for propylene that cannot be met by conventional methods alone.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas resources, offering an alternative feedstock to naphtha used in traditional processes.

3. Process efficiency: As a catalytic process, PDH likely offers improved efficiency compared to thermal cracking methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is a targeted process for propylene production, potentially offering higher selectivity than fluid catalytic cracking or steam cracking which produce a range of products.

5. Complementary production: PDH serves as a complementary method to existing processes, allowing for diversification of propylene sources.

While not explicitly stated, PDH may also address challenges of conventional methods by providing a more direct route to propylene, reducing energy requirements, and allowing for smaller-scale, more flexible production facilities closer to end-users.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH提供了额外的生产能力，以满足仅靠传统方法无法满足的稳步增长的丙烯需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气资源的丙烷，为传统工艺中使用的石脑油提供了替代原料。

3. 工艺效率：作为一种催化过程，PDH可能比热裂解方法提供更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH是一种针对丙烯生产的定向过程，可能比产生多种产品的流化催化裂化或蒸汽裂解提供更高的选择性。

5. 互补生产：PDH作为现有工艺的补充方法，允许丙烯来源多样化。

虽然没有明确说明，但PDH可能还通过提供更直接的丙烯生产路线、减少能源需求以及允许在终端用户附近建立规模更小、更灵活的生产设施来解决传统方法的挑战。
