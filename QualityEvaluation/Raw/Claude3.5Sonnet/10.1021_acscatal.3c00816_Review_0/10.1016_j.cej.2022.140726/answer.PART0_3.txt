[1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha."

[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from shale gas resources, providing a more abundant and cost-effective feedstock compared to conventional naphtha-based methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a catalytic process, PDH offers improved efficiency over traditional thermal cracking methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is a more selective process for propylene production, potentially yielding higher propylene concentrations in the product stream.

4. Capacity expansion: PDH technology allows for targeted propylene production, helping to meet the steadily increasing demand that cannot be satisfied by conventional methods alone.

5. Complementary production: PDH serves as a valuable complement to existing propylene production methods, diversifying the supply chain and reducing reliance on a single production route.

These advantages address the challenges of feedstock limitations, lower efficiency, and lower selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, making PDH a promising solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用来自页岩气资源的丙烷，与传统的石脑油基方法相比，提供了更丰富和更具成本效益的原料。

2. 工艺效率：作为一种催化过程，PDH比传统的热裂解方法（如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解）提供了更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH是一种更具选择性的丙烯生产过程，potentially在产品流中产生更高浓度的丙烯。

4. 产能扩张：PDH技术允许有针对性的丙烯生产，有助于满足仅靠常规方法无法满足的稳步增长的需求。

5. 互补生产：PDH作为现有丙烯生产方法的有价值补充，diversifying了供应链并减少了对单一生产路线的依赖。

这些优势解决了传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料限制、效率较低和选择性较低的挑战，使PDH成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的一个有前景的解决方案。
