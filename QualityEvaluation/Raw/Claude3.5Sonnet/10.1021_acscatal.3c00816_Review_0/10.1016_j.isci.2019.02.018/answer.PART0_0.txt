[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."

[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."

[3] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the available information:

PDH allows for direct large-scale production of propene, which is advantageous for meeting growing global demand. It offers high selectivity, with the study reporting about 90% propene selectivity at 44.4% propane conversion. The process can achieve high activity and on-stream stability. 

The technology addresses challenges by using environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals. This suggests improved process efficiency and potentially lower costs compared to conventional methods that might rely on more expensive catalysts.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how PDH compares to conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability or detailed efficiency metrics.

该文献并未直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术相对于传统生产方法的所有优势方面的问题。但是，根据可用信息：

PDH允许直接大规模生产丙烯，这有利于满足不断增长的全球需求。它提供了高选择性，研究报告在44.4%的丙烷转化率下实现了约90%的丙烯选择性。该过程可以实现高活性和在线稳定性。

该技术通过使用环境友好和成本效益高的催化剂而不使用贵金属来应对挑战。这表明与可能依赖更昂贵催化剂的传统方法相比，工艺效率更高，成本可能更低。

然而，文献并未提供关于PDH在原料可用性或详细效率指标方面如何与传统方法相比的具体信息。
