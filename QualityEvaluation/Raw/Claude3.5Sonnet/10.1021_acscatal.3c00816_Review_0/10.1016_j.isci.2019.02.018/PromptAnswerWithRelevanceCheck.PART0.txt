[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."

[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."

[3] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the available information:

PDH allows for direct large-scale production of propene, which is advantageous for meeting growing global demand. It offers high selectivity, with the study reporting about 90% propene selectivity at 44.4% propane conversion. The process can achieve high activity and on-stream stability. 

The technology addresses challenges by using environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals. This suggests improved process efficiency and potentially lower costs compared to conventional methods that might rely on more expensive catalysts.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how PDH compares to conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability or detailed efficiency metrics.

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing global propylene demand challenges. However, based on the available information:

PDH technology offers direct large-scale production of propene, which is advantageous for meeting growing global demand. It allows for fundamental analysis of C-H activation, suggesting potential for process optimization. The main challenges for PDH involve achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability using environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without noble metals. The study demonstrates progress in addressing these challenges, achieving about 90% propene selectivity at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours on stream. This indicates PDH technology's potential for efficient and selective propylene production.

The document does not specifically compare PDH to conventional production methods or discuss feedstock availability issues.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology with other conventional production methods for propylene. However, it does highlight some key advantages of PDH:

1. It allows for direct large-scale production of propene.
2. It enables fundamental analysis of C-H activation, which is scientifically valuable.
3. It can achieve high propene selectivity (about 90%) at significant propane conversion rates (44.4%).

The main challenges for PDH technology involve developing catalysts that are highly active, selective, stable over time, environmentally friendly, and cost-efficient without using noble metals. The study presents a novel catalyst design that appears to address some of these challenges, but does not explicitly compare PDH to other propylene production methods in terms of feedstock availability or overall process efficiency.

文献并没有全面比较丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术与其他传统丙烯生产方法。但是，它确实突出了PDH的一些关键优势：

1. 它允许直接大规模生产丙烯。
2. 它能够对C-H活化进行基础分析，这在科学上很有价值。
3. 它可以在显著的丙烷转化率（44.4%）下实现高丙烯选择性（约90%）。

PDH技术的主要挑战涉及开发高活性、高选择性、长期稳定、环境友好和成本效益高的催化剂，而不使用贵金属。该研究提出了一种新型催化剂设计，似乎解决了其中一些挑战，但并未明确将PDH与其他丙烯生产方法在原料可用性或整体工艺效率方面进行比较。
