[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."

[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."

[3] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the limited information available:

PDH allows for direct large-scale production of propene, which is advantageous for meeting growing global demand. It achieves high selectivity, with the study reporting 90% propene selectivity at 44.4% propane conversion. The process can use environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without noble metals, addressing sustainability and cost concerns. However, the text does not directly compare PDH to conventional methods or discuss specific advantages in terms of feedstock availability or process efficiency.

这篇文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术相比传统生产方法的优势问题。但是，根据有限的可用信息：

PDH允许直接大规模生产丙烯，这对满足不断增长的全球需求有利。它实现了高选择性，研究报告在44.4%的丙烷转化率下达到90%的丙烯选择性。该过程可以使用环境友好和成本效益高的非贵金属催化剂，解决了可持续性和成本问题。然而，文本并没有直接比较PDH与传统方法，也没有讨论在原料可用性或过程效率方面的具体优势。
