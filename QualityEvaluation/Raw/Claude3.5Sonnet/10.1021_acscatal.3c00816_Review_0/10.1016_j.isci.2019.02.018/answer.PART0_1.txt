[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."

[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."

[3] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in addressing global propylene demand challenges. However, based on the available information:

PDH technology offers direct large-scale production of propene, which is advantageous for meeting growing global demand. It allows for fundamental analysis of C-H activation, suggesting potential for process optimization. The main challenges for PDH involve achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability using environmentally friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without noble metals. The study demonstrates progress in addressing these challenges, achieving about 90% propene selectivity at 44.4% propane conversion at 600°C after nearly 6 hours on stream. This indicates PDH technology's potential for efficient and selective propylene production.

The document does not specifically compare PDH to conventional production methods or discuss feedstock availability issues.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在解决全球丙烯需求挑战方面的优势问题。但是，根据可用信息：

PDH技术提供了丙烯的直接大规模生产，这对满足不断增长的全球需求有利。它允许对C-H活化进行基础分析，表明有潜力进行工艺优化。PDH的主要挑战涉及使用环保和成本效益高的非贵金属催化剂实现高活性、选择性和在线稳定性。研究表明在解决这些挑战方面取得了进展，在600°C下运行近6小时后，丙烷转化率为44.4%时，丙烯选择性达到约90%。这表明PDH技术在高效和选择性丙烯生产方面具有潜力。

该文档没有具体比较PDH与传统生产方法，也没有讨论原料可用性问题。
