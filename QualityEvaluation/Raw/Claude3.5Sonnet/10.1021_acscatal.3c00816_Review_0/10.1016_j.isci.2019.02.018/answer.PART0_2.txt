[1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."

[2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."

[3] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the available information:

PDH technology allows for direct large-scale production of propene, which is advantageous for meeting growing global demand. It offers high selectivity, with the study reporting 90% propene selectivity at 44.4% propane conversion. The process can achieve good stability, as demonstrated by the performance after 6 hours on stream.

The technology addresses some challenges by using environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals. This suggests improved process efficiency and potentially lower production costs compared to methods requiring more expensive catalysts.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on feedstock availability or direct comparisons to conventional production methods. More comprehensive data would be needed to fully assess PDH's advantages in these areas.

根据可用信息：

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术允许直接大规模生产丙烯，这有利于满足不断增长的全球需求。它提供高选择性，研究报告在44.4%的丙烷转化率下达到90%的丙烯选择性。该过程可以达到良好的稳定性，如在流程中6小时后的表现所示。

该技术通过使用不含贵金属的环保和成本效益高的催化剂解决了一些挑战。这表明与需要更昂贵催化剂的方法相比，工艺效率得到提高，生产成本可能降低。

然而，文献并未提供有关原料可用性或与传统生产方法直接比较的具体信息。需要更全面的数据来充分评估PDH在这些领域的优势。
