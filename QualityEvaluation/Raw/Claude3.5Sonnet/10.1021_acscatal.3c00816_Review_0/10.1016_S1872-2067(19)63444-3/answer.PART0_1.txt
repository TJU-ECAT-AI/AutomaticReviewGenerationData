[1] "Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil"

[2] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning lowvalue propane into valueadded propylene"

[3] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is becoming more abundant due to shale gas exploitation. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, turning low-value propane into high-value propylene. This offers better efficiency compared to traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is designed specifically to produce propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity compared to less targeted processes like fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Environmental considerations: While not explicitly stated, PDH may offer environmental benefits compared to the cracking of heavier oil fractions.

5. Economic value: PDH allows for the valorization of propane, turning a lower-value feedstock into a higher-value product.

However, challenges remain, particularly in catalyst development. Current commercial catalysts based on Pt and CrOx face issues of high cost, toxicity, and frequent deactivation. This highlights the need for research into alternative catalysts that are more economical, environmentally friendly, and stable.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气开采，丙烷变得更加丰富。这解决了传统方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解）面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种直接转化工艺，将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯。与传统方法相比，这提供了更好的效率，传统方法将丙烯作为副产品生产。

3. 产品选择性：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，与流化催化裂化等不太具有针对性的工艺相比，可能提供更高的选择性。

4. 环境考虑：虽然没有明确说明，但与重油馏分的裂解相比，PDH可能提供环境效益。

5. 经济价值：PDH允许丙烷增值，将低价值的原料转化为高价值的产品。

然而，挑战仍然存在，特别是在催化剂开发方面。目前基于Pt和CrOx的商业催化剂面临成本高、毒性和频繁失活的问题。这突出了对替代催化剂的研究需求，这些催化剂应更经济、环保和稳定。
