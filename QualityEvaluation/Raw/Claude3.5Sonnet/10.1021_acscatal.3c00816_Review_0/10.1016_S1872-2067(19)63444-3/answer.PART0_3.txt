[1] "Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil"

[2] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning lowvalue propane into valueadded propylene"

[3] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as feedstock, which is abundantly available due to the exploitation of shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process for converting propane to propylene. This simplicity can lead to improved process efficiency compared to more complex multi-step methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is designed specifically to produce propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity compared to processes like fluid catalytic cracking that produce a range of products.

4. Value addition: PDH allows for the conversion of low-value propane into high-value propylene, improving the economics of the process.

5. Addressing demand: With increasing global demand for propylene, PDH provides an alternative production route to supplement existing methods and meet growing needs.

However, PDH also faces some challenges, particularly in catalyst development. Current commercial catalysts based on Pt and CrOx have issues with high cost, toxicity, and frequent deactivation. Ongoing research, such as the development of VOx catalysts described in this paper, aims to address these limitations and further improve the PDH process.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气的开发，丙烷供应充足。这解决了传统方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解）面临的原料稀缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的一步法工艺。这种简单性可以带来比更复杂的多步法更高的工艺效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，与流化催化裂解等生产多种产品的工艺相比，可能提供更高的选择性。

4. 价值提升：PDH允许将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，提高了工艺的经济性。

5. 满足需求：随着全球对丙烯需求的增加，PDH提供了一种替代生产路线，以补充现有方法并满足不断增长的需求。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战，特别是在催化剂开发方面。当前基于Pt和CrOx的商业催化剂存在成本高、毒性和频繁失活的问题。正在进行的研究，如本文所述的VOx催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些限制并进一步改进PDH工艺。
