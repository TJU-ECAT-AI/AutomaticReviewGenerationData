          [1] "Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil"

[2] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning lowvalue propane into valueadded propylene"

[3] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration"

          PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant due to shale gas exploitation, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to traditional methods, allowing for the conversion of low-value propane into high-value propylene.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mixture of various hydrocarbons.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH potentially has a lower environmental impact compared to conventional methods that use heavier oil feedstocks.

5. Economic value: PDH allows for the valorization of propane, turning a lower-value feedstock into a higher-value product.

6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages.

7. Addressing demand: With increasing global demand for propylene, PDH provides an alternative production route to supplement existing methods and meet growing needs.

However, challenges remain, particularly in catalyst development. Current commercial catalysts based on Pt and CrOx face issues of high cost, toxicity, and frequent deactivation. This highlights the need for research into alternative catalysts that are more economical, environmentally friendly, and stable. Ongoing research, such as the development of VOx catalysts, aims to address these limitations and further improve the PDH process.

          PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气开采，丙烷变得更加丰富。这解决了传统方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解）面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线，允许将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯。

3. 产品选择性：与产生多种烃类混合物的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 环境效益：与使用重质油原料的传统方法相比，PDH可能具有更低的环境影响。

5. 经济价值：PDH允许丙烷增值，将低价值的原料转化为高价值的产品。

6. 灵活性：PDH装置可以建在更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，提供物流优势。

7. 满足需求：随着全球对丙烯需求的增加，PDH提供了一种替代生产路线，以补充现有方法并满足不断增长的需求。

然而，挑战仍然存在，特别是在催化剂开发方面。目前基于Pt和CrOx的商业催化剂面临成本高、毒性和频繁失活的问题。这突出了对替代催化剂的研究需求，这些催化剂应更经济、环保和稳定。正在进行的研究，如VOx催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些限制并进一步改进PDH工艺。
