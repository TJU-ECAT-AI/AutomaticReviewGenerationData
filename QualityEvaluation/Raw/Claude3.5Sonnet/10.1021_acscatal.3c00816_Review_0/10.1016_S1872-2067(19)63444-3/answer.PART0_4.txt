[1] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning lowvalue propane into valueadded propylene"

[2] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. It addresses the increasing demand for propylene by providing an alternative production route.

2. It takes advantage of the growing availability of shale gas, which has increased the supply of propane feedstock.

3. It allows for the conversion of low-value propane into higher-value propylene, improving economic efficiency.

4. It overcomes limitations of current commercial catalysts (Pt and CrOx) which have issues with high cost, toxicity, and frequent deactivation/regeneration needs.

5. As a direct dehydrogenation process, it likely offers improved selectivity compared to alternative methods that produce multiple products.

6. It provides a dedicated propylene production method, allowing manufacturers to adjust output based on market demand rather than relying on byproduct streams from other processes.

While not explicitly stated, PDH also likely offers improved energy efficiency compared to traditional steam cracking, as it is a more targeted process requiring less severe reaction conditions.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种很有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 它通过提供替代生产途径来满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 它利用了页岩气开采带来的丙烷原料供应增加的优势。

3. 它允许将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，提高了经济效率。

4. 它克服了当前商业催化剂（铂和氧化铬）的局限性，这些催化剂存在成本高、毒性和频繁失活/再生需求等问题。

5. 作为一种直接脱氢工艺，它可能比产生多种产品的替代方法提供更好的选择性。

6. 它提供了一种专门的丙烯生产方法，允许制造商根据市场需求调整产量，而不是依赖其他工艺的副产品流。

虽然没有明确说明，但与传统的蒸汽裂解相比，PDH可能还提供了更高的能源效率，因为它是一个更有针对性的过程，需要的反应条件较温和。
