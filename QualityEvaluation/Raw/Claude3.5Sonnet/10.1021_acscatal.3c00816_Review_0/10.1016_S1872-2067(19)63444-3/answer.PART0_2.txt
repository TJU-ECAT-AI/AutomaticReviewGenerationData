[1] "Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil"

[2] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning lowvalue propane into valueadded propylene"

[3] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundant due to the exploitation of shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to traditional methods. It allows for the conversion of low-value propane into high-value propylene, improving overall process economics.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mixture of various hydrocarbons.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH potentially has a lower environmental impact compared to conventional methods that use heavier oil feedstocks.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages.

While current commercial PDH catalysts (Pt and CrOx-based) face challenges like high cost, toxicity, and frequent deactivation, research into new catalyst systems (like the VOx/SiBeta discussed in this paper) aims to overcome these limitations, further improving the viability of PDH technology.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，由于页岩气的开发，丙烷资源丰富。这解决了传统方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解）面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。它允许将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，提高了整体工艺经济性。

3. 产品选择性：与产生多种烃类混合物的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 环境效益：与使用重质油原料的传统方法相比，PDH可能具有更低的环境影响。

5. 灵活性：PDH装置可以建在更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，提供物流优势。

虽然当前的商业PDH催化剂（基于Pt和CrOx）面临成本高、毒性和频繁失活等挑战，但对新催化剂系统的研究（如本文讨论的VOx/SiBeta）旨在克服这些限制，进一步提高PDH技术的可行性。
