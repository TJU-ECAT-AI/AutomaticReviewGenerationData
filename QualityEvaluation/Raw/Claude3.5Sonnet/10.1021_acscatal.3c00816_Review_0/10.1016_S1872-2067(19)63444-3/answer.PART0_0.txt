[1] "Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil"

[2] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning lowvalue propane into valueadded propylene"

[3] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane, which is abundant due to shale gas exploitation, as a feedstock. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Value addition: PDH allows for the conversion of low-value propane into high-value propylene, improving the overall economics of the process.

3. Targeted production: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mix of products, PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, potentially improving selectivity.

4. Environmental considerations: PDH may have less environmental impact compared to the conventional heavy oil cracking methods, though this depends on the specific catalysts used.

5. Flexibility: As a standalone process, PDH can be more easily scaled and adapted to market demands compared to integrated refinery processes.

However, PDH still faces challenges, particularly in catalyst performance. Current commercial catalysts based on Pt and CrOx have issues with high cost, toxicity, and frequent deactivation. This highlights the need for developing more efficient and sustainable catalysts for PDH technology to fully realize its potential in addressing the growing global demand for propylene.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气开采带来的丰富丙烷作为原料。这解决了传统方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解）面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 价值提升：PDH允许将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，提高了整个过程的经济性。

3. 定向生产：与产生混合产品的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解不同，PDH专门设计用于丙烯生产，可能提高选择性。

4. 环境考虑：与传统的重油裂解方法相比，PDH可能对环境影响较小，尽管这取决于所使用的具体催化剂。

5. 灵活性：作为一个独立的过程，PDH相比集成的炼油厂过程，可以更容易地根据市场需求进行规模调整和适应。

然而，PDH仍然面临挑战，特别是在催化剂性能方面。目前基于Pt和CrOx的商业催化剂存在成本高、毒性和频繁失活的问题。这突显了开发更高效和可持续的PDH技术催化剂的需求，以充分实现其在满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求方面的潜力。
