<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is an important basis of numerous chemical products, such as polymers, resins, solvents and fibers, mainly obtained from the steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil"

[2] "With the increasing demand of propylene and the exploitation of shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) as an alternative way has drawn great attention and been widely employed in commercial propylene production, and is a great mean for turning lowvalue propane into valueadded propylene"

[3] "The commercial PDH catalysts are based on Pt and CrOx based catalysts, while the high cost of Pt and toxicity of CrOx greatly hinder their further wide application. Moreover, both of them are easy to be deactivated and need frequently regeneration"

</quotes>

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane, which is abundant due to shale gas exploitation, as a feedstock. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods like steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Value addition: PDH allows for the conversion of low-value propane into high-value propylene, improving the overall economics of the process.

3. Targeted production: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mix of products, PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, potentially improving selectivity.

4. Environmental considerations: PDH may have less environmental impact compared to the conventional heavy oil cracking methods, though this depends on the specific catalysts used.

5. Flexibility: As a standalone process, PDH can be more easily scaled and adapted to market demands compared to integrated refinery processes.

However, PDH still faces challenges, particularly in catalyst performance. Current commercial catalysts based on Pt and CrOx have issues with high cost, toxicity, and frequent deactivation. This highlights the need for developing more efficient and sustainable catalysts for PDH technology to fully realize its potential in addressing the growing global demand for propylene.
