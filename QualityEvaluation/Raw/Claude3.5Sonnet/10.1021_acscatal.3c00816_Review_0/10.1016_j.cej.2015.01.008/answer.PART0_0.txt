[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene"

[2] "propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."

[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene. Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production method.

2. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks used in other propylene production methods.

3. PDH allows for better process control and potentially higher propylene selectivity compared to other methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. It offers flexibility in production scale and can be integrated with existing petrochemical infrastructure.

5. PDH technology can achieve higher propylene yields compared to by-product production from other processes.

However, PDH faces challenges related to the endothermic nature of the reaction, requiring high temperatures and specialized catalysts to achieve high yields. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is also a significant issue that needs to be addressed through catalyst development and process optimization.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 它直接解决了全球日益增长的丙烯需求，提供了一种专门的生产方法。

2. 它使用丙烷作为原料，与其他丙烯生产方法所使用的传统原料相比，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化等其他方法相比，PDH允许更好的过程控制和潜在的更高丙烯选择性。

4. 它在生产规模上提供了灵活性，并可以与现有的石化基础设施集成。

5. 与其他过程的副产品生产相比，PDH技术可以实现更高的丙烯产率。

然而，PDH面临着与反应吸热性质相关的挑战，需要高温和专门的催化剂来实现高产率。由于焦炭形成而导致的催化剂失活也是一个需要通过催化剂开发和工艺优化来解决的重要问题。
