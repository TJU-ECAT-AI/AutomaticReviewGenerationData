          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene"
          [2] "propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."
          [3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene. Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."
          [4] "Supported platinum catalyst has been widely used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes due to its high reaction activity"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

          1. It directly addresses the growing global demand for propylene, which is an important raw material for many products including polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid.

          2. It provides a dedicated process for propylene production, unlike conventional methods which produce propylene as a byproduct. This allows for better control over output and product selectivity.

          3. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than traditional feedstocks like naphtha or ethane used in steam cracking.

          4. It employs supported platinum catalysts that provide high reaction activity, offering potential for higher propylene yields and selectivity compared to other processes.

          5. It allows for on-purpose propylene production, decoupling it from ethylene production and giving producers more control over supply.

          However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

          1. The endothermic nature of the reaction requires high temperatures to obtain high yields of propene.

          2. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a significant issue.

          3. There is a need for the development of highly active, stable, and selective catalysts to overcome these challenges and improve process efficiency.

          Overall, PDH addresses feedstock availability by using propane, improves efficiency through dedicated propylene production, and has the potential for better selectivity. Ongoing research is focused on developing improved catalysts that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions while maintaining high activity and selectivity.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

          1. 它直接解决了全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，丙烯是许多产品的重要原料，包括聚丙烯、丙烯醛、聚丙烯腈和丙烯酸。

          2. 它提供了专门的丙烯生产工艺，不同于将丙烯作为副产品生产的常规方法。这允许更好地控制产量和产品选择性。

          3. 它使用丙烷作为原料，比蒸汽裂解中使用的传统原料如石脑油或乙烷更容易获得。

          4. 它采用提供高反应活性的负载型铂催化剂，与其他工艺相比，有可能获得更高的丙烯产率和选择性。

          5. 它允许定向生产丙烯，将其与乙烯生产解耦，使生产商对供应有更多控制。

          然而，PDH技术也面临挑战：

          1. 反应的吸热性质需要高温才能获得高产率的丙烯。

          2. 由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活是一个重要问题。

          3. 需要开发高活性、高稳定性和高选择性的催化剂来克服这些挑战并提高工艺效率。

          总的来说，PDH通过使用丙烷解决了原料可用性问题，通过专门的丙烯生产提高了效率，并有可能获得更好的选择性。持续的研究集中在开发改进的催化剂，这些催化剂能够承受苛刻的反应条件，同时保持高活性和选择性。
