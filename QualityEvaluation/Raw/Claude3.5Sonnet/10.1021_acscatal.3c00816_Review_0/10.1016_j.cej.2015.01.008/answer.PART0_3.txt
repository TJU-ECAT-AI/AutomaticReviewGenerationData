[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene"

[2] "propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."

[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."

[4] "Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing global demand for propylene.

2. It provides a dedicated process for propylene production, unlike conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

3. It allows for better control over product selectivity, as it's designed specifically for propylene.

4. It can utilize propane feedstock, which may be more readily available than traditional naphtha feedstock.

5. It offers potential for higher propylene yields compared to traditional steam cracking.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. It's an endothermic process requiring high temperatures.

2. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is a significant issue.

3. It requires development of highly active, stable, and selective catalysts to overcome these challenges.

Overall, PDH addresses feedstock availability by using propane, improves efficiency through dedicated propylene production, and has the potential for better selectivity. However, ongoing research is needed to develop improved catalysts that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions while maintaining high activity and selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 它直接解决了全球对丙烯日益增长的需求。

2. 它提供了专门的丙烯生产工艺，不同于常规方法将丙烯作为副产品生产。

3. 它允许更好地控制产品选择性，因为它专门为丙烯设计。

4. 它可以利用丙烷原料，这可能比传统的石脑油原料更容易获得。

5. 与传统的蒸汽裂解相比，它有可能获得更高的丙烯产率。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战：

1. 它是一个需要高温的吸热过程。

2. 由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活是一个重要问题。

3. 它需要开发高活性、高稳定性和高选择性的催化剂来克服这些挑战。

总的来说，PDH通过使用丙烷解决了原料可用性问题，通过专门的丙烯生产提高了效率，并有可能获得更好的选择性。然而，仍需要进行持续的研究来开发改进的催化剂，这些催化剂能够承受苛刻的反应条件，同时保持高活性和选择性。
