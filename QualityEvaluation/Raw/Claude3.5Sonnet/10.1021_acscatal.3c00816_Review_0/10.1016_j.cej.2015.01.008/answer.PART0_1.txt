[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene"

[2] "propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."

[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."

[4] "Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it promising for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, which is an important raw material for many products.

2. It provides a dedicated process for propylene production, allowing for better control over output compared to conventional methods.

3. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than the naphtha or ethane used in steam cracking.

4. It offers potential for higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

5. It allows for on-purpose propylene production, decoupling it from ethylene production.

However, PDH faces challenges including:

1. The endothermic nature of the reaction requiring high temperatures.

2. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

3. The need for highly active, stable and selective catalysts to overcome these issues.

Overall, PDH addresses feedstock availability by using propane, improves efficiency through dedicated propylene production, and has potential for high selectivity with proper catalyst development. These factors make it a promising technology to meet growing propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的有前景方法：

1. 它直接满足了日益增长的丙烯需求，丙烯是许多产品的重要原料。

2. 它提供了一个专门的丙烯生产过程，与传统方法相比，可以更好地控制产量。

3. 它使用丙烷作为原料，比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油或乙烷更容易获得。

4. 与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，它有可能提供更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 它允许定向生产丙烯，将其与乙烯生产解耦。

然而，PDH面临的挑战包括：

1. 反应的吸热性质需要高温。

2. 由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。

3. 需要高活性、高稳定性和高选择性的催化剂来克服这些问题。

总的来说，PDH通过使用丙烷解决了原料可用性问题，通过专门的丙烯生产提高了效率，并且通过适当的催化剂开发具有高选择性的潜力。这些因素使其成为满足不断增长的丙烯需求的有前景技术。
