[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene"

[2] "propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."

[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene. Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it promising for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing global demand for propylene.

2. It provides a dedicated process for propylene production, unlike conventional methods which produce propylene as a byproduct.

3. It offers flexibility in terms of feedstock, as propane is readily available from natural gas processing and oil refining.

4. It has the potential for high propylene selectivity compared to other processes.

5. It allows for on-purpose propylene production, giving producers more control over supply.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly the need for high temperatures and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The development of high-activity, high-stability, and high-selectivity catalysts is crucial to address these issues and improve process efficiency. The research described in this paper on Zn-modified ZSM-5 supported platinum catalysts aims to tackle these challenges by improving catalyst performance and stability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前途的方法：

1. 它直接解决了全球对丙烯不断增长的需求。

2. 它提供了专门的丙烯生产工艺，不同于常规方法将丙烯作为副产品生产。

3. 在原料方面具有灵活性，因为丙烷可以从天然气加工和石油精炼中readily获得。

4. 与其他工艺相比，它具有较高的丙烯选择性潜力。

5. 它允许定向生产丙烯，使生产商对供应有更多控制。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是需要高温和由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。开发高活性、高稳定性和高选择性的催化剂对于解决这些问题和提高工艺效率至关重要。本文所述的关于锌改性ZSM-5负载铂催化剂的研究旨在通过改善催化剂性能和稳定性来解决这些挑战。
