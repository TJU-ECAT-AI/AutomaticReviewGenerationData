[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene"

[2] "propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."

[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene."

[4] "Supported platinum catalyst has been widely used in reforming or dehydrogenation processes due to its high reaction activity"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propene as an important raw material.

2. It offers a dedicated process for propylene production, unlike conventional methods which produce propylene as a byproduct.

3. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha cracking feedstocks.

4. It employs supported platinum catalysts that provide high reaction activity.

5. It allows for better control of product selectivity compared to thermal cracking processes.

However, PDH also faces challenges such as the need for high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation. The technology aims to improve process efficiency and product selectivity through catalyst and process optimizations.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它直接应对了作为重要原料的丙烯不断增长的需求。

2. 它提供了一个专门的丙烯生产工艺，不像传统方法将丙烯作为副产品生产。

3. 它使用丙烷作为原料，与传统的石脑油裂解原料相比更容易获得。

4. 它采用提供高反应活性的负载型铂催化剂。

5. 与热裂解工艺相比，它能更好地控制产品选择性。

然而，PDH也面临着诸如需要高反应温度和催化剂失活等挑战。该技术旨在通过催化剂和工艺优化来提高工艺效率和产品选择性。
