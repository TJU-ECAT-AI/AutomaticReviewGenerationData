<quotes>

[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene"

[2] "propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid."

[3] "However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene. Therefore, it is crucial to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable."

</quotes>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production method.

2. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks used in other propylene production methods.

3. PDH allows for better process control and potentially higher propylene selectivity compared to other methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. It offers flexibility in production scale and can be integrated with existing petrochemical infrastructure.

5. PDH technology can achieve higher propylene yields compared to by-product production from other processes.

However, PDH faces challenges related to the endothermic nature of the reaction, requiring high temperatures and specialized catalysts to achieve high yields. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation is also a significant issue that needs to be addressed through catalyst development and process optimization.
