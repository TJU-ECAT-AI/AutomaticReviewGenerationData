[1] "PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."

[2] "Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from shale gas, which can be extracted on a massive scale. This provides a cheap and plentiful feedstock source, addressing the challenge of depleting crude oil reserves faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH avoids the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, making it more efficient.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is a proprietary technology that offers high propylene selectivity. This is a significant advantage over other methods like methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes, which produce a mix of products.

4. Meeting growing demand: Unlike conventional methods that rely on fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil, PDH is better positioned to satisfy the growing global demand for propylene, as traditional technologies are struggling to keep up due to the rapid consumption of crude oil.

These advantages collectively address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making PDH the most promising method for meeting the increasing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用来自页岩气的丙烷，这种气体可以大规模开采。这提供了廉价且丰富的原料来源，解决了传统生产方法面临的原油储备枯竭的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH避免了在氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中出现的不必要的过度氧化，使其更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：PDH是一种专有技术，具有高丙烯选择性。这比其他方法如甲醇制烯烃（MTO）和费托合成制烯烃（FTO）工艺具有显著优势，后者会产生混合产品。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：与依赖流化催化裂化和石脑油及重油蒸汽裂解的传统方法不同，PDH更有能力满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，因为传统技术由于原油的快速消耗而难以跟上需求。

这些优势共同解决了原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性的挑战，使PDH成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的最有前景的方法。
