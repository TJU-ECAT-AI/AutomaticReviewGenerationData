[1] "PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."

[2] "Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH benefits from the abundant and cheap propane feedstock produced from shale gas extraction on a massive scale. This addresses the issue of dwindling crude oil resources that traditional methods rely on.

2. Process efficiency: PDH avoids the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, leading to improved efficiency and reduced waste.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is a proprietary technology that offers high propylene selectivity. This is a significant advantage over other processes like methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO), which produce a mix of products.

4. Meeting growing demand: Conventional methods using fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil are struggling to meet the increasing global demand for propylene due to rapid crude oil consumption. PDH technology helps address this gap by providing an alternative production route.

These advantages make PDH particularly well-suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity while meeting the growing global demand for propylene that conventional methods are struggling to satisfy.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，这是由于它具有几个关键优势，能够解决传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH受益于大规模页岩气开采所产生的丰富且廉价的丙烷原料。这解决了传统方法依赖的原油资源日益减少的问题。

2. 过程效率：PDH避免了氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中出现的不良过度氧化现象，从而提高了效率并减少了废物。

3. 产品选择性：PDH是一种专有技术，提供高丙烯选择性。这比其他生产混合产品的工艺（如甲醇制烯烃MTO和费托制烯烃FTO）具有显著优势。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：由于原油消耗迅速，使用流化催化裂化和石脑油及重油蒸汽裂解的传统方法难以满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。PDH技术通过提供替代生产路线来帮助解决这一缺口。

这些优势使PDH特别适合解决原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性的挑战，同时满足传统方法难以满足的不断增长的全球丙烯需求。
