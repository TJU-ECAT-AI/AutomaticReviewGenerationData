[1] "PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."

[2] "Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH benefits from the abundant and cheap propane feedstock produced from shale gas extraction on a massive scale. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods that rely on rapidly depleting crude oil.

2. Process efficiency: PDH avoids the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, making it more efficient.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high propylene selectivity as a proprietary technology. This is a significant advantage over other processes like methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO), which produce a mixture of products.

4. Sustainability: By utilizing propane from shale gas, PDH provides a more sustainable alternative to conventional production methods that rely on naphtha and heavy oil cracking, which are facing challenges due to the rapid consumption of crude oil.

5. Future demand: PDH technology is better positioned to meet the growing global demand for propylene, which conventional technologies are struggling to satisfy due to limitations in feedstock and production capacity.

These advantages make PDH a superior choice for addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity in propylene production, especially in the context of increasing global demand and the limitations of traditional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH受益于大规模页岩气开采产生的丰富且廉价的丙烷原料。这解决了传统方法依赖快速耗尽的原油所面临的原料稀缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH避免了氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中出现的不希望的过度氧化，使其更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：PDH作为一项专有技术，提供了高丙烯选择性。这比其他生产混合产品的工艺（如甲醇制烯烃MTO和费托制烯烃FTO）具有显著优势。

4. 可持续性：通过利用页岩气中的丙烷，PDH为依赖石脑油和重油裂解的传统生产方法提供了更可持续的替代方案，这些传统方法因原油的快速消耗而面临挑战。

5. 未来需求：PDH技术更有能力满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求，而传统技术由于原料和产能的限制而难以满足这一需求。

这些优势使PDH成为解决丙烯生产中原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性挑战的卓越选择，尤其是在全球需求增加和传统生产方法受限的背景下。
