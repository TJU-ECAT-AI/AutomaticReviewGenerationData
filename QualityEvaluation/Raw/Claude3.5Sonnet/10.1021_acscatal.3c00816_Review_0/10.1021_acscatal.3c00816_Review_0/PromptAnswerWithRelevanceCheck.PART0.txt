[1] "PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."

[2] "Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH benefits from the abundant and cheap propane feedstock produced from shale gas extraction on a massive scale. This addresses the issue of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods that rely on rapidly depleting crude oil resources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH avoids the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, making it more efficient. It also offers a more direct route to propylene compared to other alternatives like methanol-to-olefin (MTO) or Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is a proprietary technology that offers high propylene selectivity. This is a significant advantage over conventional methods and other alternative processes that often produce a mix of products, requiring additional separation steps.

4. Meeting growing demand: As conventional propylene production from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil cannot satisfy current and future demands due to rapid crude oil consumption, PDH offers a viable solution to bridge this gap and meet the growing global demand for propylene.

These advantages make PDH a more sustainable, efficient, and selective method for propylene production, addressing the limitations of conventional methods and positioning it as the most promising technology for meeting future propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，原因在于它具有几个关键优势，能够解决传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH技术受益于大规模页岩气开采产生的丰富且廉价的丙烷原料。这解决了传统方法依赖于快速耗尽的原油资源所面临的原料短缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH避免了氧化脱氢（ODH）工艺中出现的不必要过度氧化，使其更加高效。与其他替代方法如甲醇制烯烃（MTO）或费托制烯烃（FTO）工艺相比，PDH还提供了一条更直接的丙烯生产路线。

3. 产品选择性：PDH是一种专有技术，具有高丙烯选择性。这是相对于传统方法和其他替代工艺的重要优势，因为后者通常会产生混合产品，需要额外的分离步骤。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：由于传统的丙烯生产方法（如流化催化裂化和石脑油及重油的蒸汽裂解）由于原油消耗迅速而无法满足当前和未来的需求，PDH提供了一种可行的解决方案来弥补这一差距，满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。

这些优势使PDH成为一种更可持续、更高效、更具选择性的丙烯生产方法，解决了传统方法的局限性，并将其定位为满足未来丙烯需求的最有前景的技术。

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from shale gas, which can be extracted on a massive scale. This provides a cheap and plentiful feedstock source, addressing the challenge of depleting crude oil reserves faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH avoids the undesired overoxidation that occurs in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes, making it more efficient.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is a proprietary technology that offers high propylene selectivity. This is a significant advantage over other methods like methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO) processes, which produce a mix of products.

4. Meeting growing demand: Unlike conventional methods that rely on fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil, PDH is better positioned to satisfy the growing global demand for propylene, as traditional technologies are struggling to keep up due to the rapid consumption of crude oil.

These advantages collectively address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making PDH the most promising method for meeting the increasing global demand for propylene.
