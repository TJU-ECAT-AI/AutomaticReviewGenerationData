[1] "PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c)."

[2] "Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH benefits from the abundant and cheap propane feedstock produced from shale gas extraction on a massive scale. This addresses the issue of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods that rely on rapidly depleting crude oil resources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH technology inhibits undesired overoxidation, which is a common problem in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes. This results in improved efficiency and reduced waste.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high propylene selectivity as a proprietary technology. This is a significant advantage over other processes like methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and Fischer-Tropsch to olefin (FTO), which produce a mix of products.

4. Meeting growing demand: Unlike conventional methods based on fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil, PDH technology is better positioned to satisfy the current and future demands for propylene production.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene while overcoming the limitations of traditional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，这是由于它具有几个关键优势，可以解决传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH技术受益于大规模页岩气开采所产生的丰富且廉价的丙烷原料。这解决了传统方法依赖于快速耗尽的原油资源所面临的原料短缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH技术抑制了不良的过度氧化反应，这是氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中常见的问题。这提高了效率并减少了废物。

3. 产品选择性：作为一种专有技术，PDH提供了高丙烯选择性。这比其他生产混合产品的工艺（如甲醇制烯烃MTO和费托合成制烯烃FTO）具有显著优势。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：与基于流化催化裂化和石脑油及重油蒸汽裂解的传统方法相比，PDH技术更有能力满足当前和未来的丙烯生产需求。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合应对不断增长的全球丙烯需求，同时克服传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的限制。
