[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has become the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to conventional methods that may involve multiple steps.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, as demonstrated by the 85% selectivity achieved with In-CHA catalysts in this study.

4. Economic viability: The low cost of propane feedstock makes PDH economically attractive compared to other production methods.

5. Flexibility: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, enabling producers to adjust output based on market demand.

However, PDH technology still faces some challenges, such as catalyst deactivation and the need for more environmentally friendly catalysts. The research presented in this paper aims to address these issues by developing stable and selective catalysts like In-CHA for PDH reactions.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，主要有以下几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用当前页岩气中低成本的丙烷，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，与可能涉及多个步骤的传统方法相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，正如本研究中In-CHA催化剂实现的85%选择性所示。

4. 经济可行性：丙烷原料的低成本使PDH与其他生产方法相比具有经济吸引力。

5. 灵活性：PDH允许定向生产丙烯，使生产商能够根据市场需求调整产量。

然而，PDH技术仍面临一些挑战，如催化剂失活和需要更环保的催化剂。本文所呈现的研究旨在通过开发稳定和选择性的催化剂（如用于PDH反应的In-CHA）来解决这些问题。
