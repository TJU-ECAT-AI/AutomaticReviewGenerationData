[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is readily available and relatively low-cost, especially with the abundance of shale gas.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, addressing the challenge of producing propylene as a primary product rather than a by-product.

4. Economic viability: The increasing demand for propylene, coupled with the availability of low-cost propane, makes PDH economically attractive.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built close to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages.

However, current PDH technologies face challenges such as catalyst deactivation and environmental concerns. Research into new catalysts, like the In-CHA catalyst described in the literature, aims to address these issues by improving stability, selectivity, and environmental performance.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因以下几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，丙烷易于获得且成本相对较低，特别是在页岩气丰富的情况下。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种直接转化工艺，与传统的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，解决了将丙烯作为主产品而非副产品生产的挑战。

4. 经济可行性：丙烯需求的增加，加上低成本丙烷的可用性，使PDH在经济上具有吸引力。

5. 灵活性：PDH装置可以建在靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，提供物流优势。

然而，当前的PDH技术面临催化剂失活和环境问题等挑战。对新型催化剂的研究，如文献中描述的In-CHA催化剂，旨在通过提高稳定性、选择性和环境性能来解决这些问题。
