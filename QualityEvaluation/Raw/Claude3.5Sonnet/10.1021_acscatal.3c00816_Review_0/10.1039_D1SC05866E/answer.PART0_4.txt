[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has become the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane derived from shale gas, which is currently available at low cost.

2. Process efficiency: Compared to conventional methods, PDH offers a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, addressing the challenge of obtaining high-purity products.

4. Economic viability: The low cost of propane feedstock makes PDH economically attractive.

5. Flexibility: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, helping to meet the increasing global demand.

However, current PDH technologies face some challenges, such as catalyst deactivation and environmental concerns. The development of new catalysts, like the In-CHA catalyst described in this study, aims to address these issues by improving stability, selectivity, and reducing environmental impact.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法，这是由于几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用从页岩气中提取的丙烷，目前成本较低。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路径。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，解决了获得高纯度产品的挑战。

4. 经济可行性：丙烷原料的低成本使PDH在经济上具有吸引力。

5. 灵活性：PDH允许按需生产丙烯，有助于满足不断增长的全球需求。

然而，当前的PDH技术也面临一些挑战，如催化剂失活和环境问题。本研究中描述的In-CHA催化剂等新型催化剂的开发旨在通过提高稳定性、选择性和减少环境影响来解决这些问题。
