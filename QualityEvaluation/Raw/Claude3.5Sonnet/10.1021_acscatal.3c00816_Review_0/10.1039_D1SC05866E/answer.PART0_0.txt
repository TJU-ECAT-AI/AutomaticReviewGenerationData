[1] "The increasing world demand for propylene and the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas have renewed interest in the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH)."

[2] "PDH technologies, i.e., the Catofin process using a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and the Oleflex process using a supported PtSn catalyst, have drawbacks, such as the high cost and rapid deactivation of Pt and the potential environmental impact caused by Cr."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the current low cost of propane derived from shale gas, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to conventional methods that involve multiple steps.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, especially with advanced catalysts like In-CHA, which shows 85% propylene selectivity.

4. Economic viability: The renewed interest in PDH is driven by increasing global demand for propylene, making it an attractive investment.

5. Overcoming limitations of existing technologies: PDH addresses drawbacks of current technologies like the Catofin and Oleflex processes, which suffer from high costs, rapid catalyst deactivation, and potential environmental impacts.

While not explicitly stated in the text, PDH also likely offers advantages in terms of energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint compared to traditional steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking methods.
