I apologize, but I cannot answer this question as there is no relevant information provided in the given literature. The document appears to be empty or missing, containing only "element not found" messages. Without specific content about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, propylene production, or related topics, it's not possible to address the advantages of PDH technology or how it compares to conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
