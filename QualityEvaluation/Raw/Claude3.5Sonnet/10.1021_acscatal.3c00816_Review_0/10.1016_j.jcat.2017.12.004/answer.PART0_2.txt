[1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, providing a dedicated process for its production.

2. PDH can use propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks used in steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. The process offers higher selectivity towards propylene compared to conventional methods.

4. PDH technology has already been commercialized, demonstrating its viability.

5. Current research focuses on developing novel catalysts (like V-, Ga-, and Sn-based) to overcome the limitations of traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, potentially improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact.

6. It addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is often a byproduct of other processes.

7. PDH offers better process efficiency as it is a dedicated process for propylene production, unlike steam cracking which produces multiple products.

8. The technology provides higher product selectivity compared to conventional methods, addressing the challenge of improving propylene yield.
