[1] "DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

2. Process efficiency: Non-oxidative PDH avoids the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations present in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, potentially leading to higher yields.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers better selectivity towards propylene compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mixture of various olefins.

4. Environmental considerations: While traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts have some drawbacks, research into novel catalysts like V-, Ga-, and Sn-based options is addressing pollution concerns.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be scaled more easily than large steam crackers, allowing for more flexible production capacities.

6. Direct route: PDH provides a direct route from propane to propylene, simplifying the production process compared to other methods that require separation of multiple products.

These advantages address the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more selective, efficient, and potentially cleaner route to propylene production, better suited to meeting growing global demand.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解使用的石脑油更容易获得。

2. 工艺效率：非氧化PDH避免了氧化脱氢工艺中存在的热力学平衡限制，可能导致更高的产率。

3. 产品选择性：与产生各种烯烃混合物的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH对丙烯的选择性更好。

4. 环境考虑：虽然传统的Pt和Cr基催化剂有一些缺点，但对V、Ga和Sn基等新型催化剂的研究正在解决污染问题。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂比大型蒸汽裂解装置更容易调整规模，允许更灵活的生产能力。

6. 直接路线：PDH提供了从丙烷到丙烯的直接路线，相比其他需要分离多种产品的方法，简化了生产过程。

这些优势通过提供一种更具选择性、更高效和潜在更清洁的丙烯生产路线来应对传统方法的挑战，更适合满足不断增长的全球需求。
