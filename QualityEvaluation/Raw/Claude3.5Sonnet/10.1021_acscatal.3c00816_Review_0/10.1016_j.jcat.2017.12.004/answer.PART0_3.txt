[1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, providing a targeted production method.

2. PDH can utilize propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks.

3. It offers better process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene in a single step.

4. PDH allows for higher product selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

5. It provides an alternative to conventional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, which have price and deactivation disadvantages.

6. PDH technology enables the development of novel catalysts (e.g. V-, Ga-, and Sn-based) that can be more environmentally friendly and efficient.

7. It helps address the pollution problems associated with conventional CrOX-based catalysts.

By offering these advantages, PDH technology specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.
