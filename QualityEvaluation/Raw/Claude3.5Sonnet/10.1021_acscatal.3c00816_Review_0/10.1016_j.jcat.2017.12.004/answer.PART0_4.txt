[1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, providing a dedicated process for its production.

2. PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, offering better control over feedstock availability compared to traditional methods.

3. The process efficiency is potentially higher as it's a single-step conversion from propane to propylene.

4. PDH can achieve high product selectivity, focusing primarily on propylene production.

5. It reduces dependence on conventional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are less flexible in adjusting product ratios.

6. The technology is being improved with the development of novel catalysts (like V-, Ga-, and Sn-based) to address issues of catalyst deactivation and environmental concerns associated with traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts.

7. PDH can utilize the increasing supply of propane from shale gas processing, providing a valuable outlet for this feedstock.

These advantages collectively make PDH a versatile and potentially more sustainable option for meeting the growing propylene demand, especially in regions with abundant propane resources.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 它直接应对了丙烯需求的增长，提供了一个专门的生产过程。

2. PDH允许定向丙烯生产，与传统方法相比，对原料供应的控制更好。

3. 由于是从丙烷到丙烯的单步转化，工艺效率可能更高。

4. PDH可以实现高产品选择性，主要集中在丙烯生产上。

5. 它减少了对蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等传统生产方法的依赖，这些方法在调整产品比例方面不太灵活。

6. 随着新型催化剂（如基于V、Ga和Sn的催化剂）的开发，该技术正在不断改进，以解决与传统Pt和Cr基催化剂相关的催化剂失活和环境问题。

7. PDH可以利用页岩气加工产生的日益增多的丙烷供应，为这种原料提供了一个有价值的出口。

这些优势共同使PDH成为一种versatile和潜在更可持续的选择，以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，特别是在丙烷资源丰富的地区。
