[1] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene"

[2] "Low-cost saturated hydrocarbons can be converted to value-added olefins by propane dehydrogenation, and this route is economically competitive"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene"

[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more abundant and less expensive than the naphtha or other oil-based feedstocks used in conventional methods. This addresses the challenge of decreasing fossil oil resources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a single-step process that directly converts propane to propylene, which is potentially more efficient than multi-step conventional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, potentially producing fewer byproducts compared to conventional methods. This is especially important given the increasing market demand for propylene.

4. Economic competitiveness: The ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) to higher-value olefins (propylene) makes PDH economically attractive.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures to achieve satisfactory propylene yields.

2. Catalyst deactivation: The high temperatures can lead to hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which decrease catalyst activity and stability.

3. Equilibrium limitations: As an equilibrium-limited reaction, there are thermodynamic constraints on conversion.

Despite these challenges, the advantages of PDH in terms of feedstock flexibility, potential for high selectivity, and economic competitiveness make it a promising technology for addressing the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，比传统方法中使用的石脑油或其他基于石油的原料更加丰富且价格更低。这解决了化石油资源日益减少的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个单步过程，直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这可能比蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解等多步骤传统方法更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，与传统方法相比可能产生更少的副产品。考虑到丙烯市场需求的不断增长，这一点尤为重要。

4. 经济竞争力：将低成本饱和烃（丙烷）转化为高附加值烯烃（丙烯）的能力使PDH在经济上具有吸引力。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗需求：该过程是高度吸热的，需要高温才能获得令人满意的丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂失活：高温可能导致烃类裂解和积碳形成，从而降低催化剂活性和稳定性。

3. 平衡限制：作为一个平衡限制反应，转化率存在热力学限制。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH在原料灵活性、高选择性潜力和经济竞争力方面的优势使其成为应对全球丙烯需求增长的一项有前景的技术。
