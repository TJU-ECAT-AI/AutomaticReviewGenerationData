[1] "Propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene"

[2] "Low-cost saturated hydrocarbons can be converted to value-added olefins by propane dehydrogenation, and this route is economically competitive"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene"

[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane, which is abundantly available from natural gas processing and oil refining. This addresses the challenge of decreasing fossil oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Economic competitiveness: PDH converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into higher-value olefins (propylene), making it an economically attractive route.

3. Targeted production: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mix of products, PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity.

4. Flexibility: PDH plants can be scaled and located close to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering flexibility in production.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. High energy requirement: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures to achieve satisfactory propylene yields.

2. Catalyst deactivation: The high temperatures can lead to hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which decrease catalyst activity and stability.

3. Equilibrium limitations: The reaction is equilibrium-limited, which can affect overall conversion rates.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research into improved catalysts and process designs is making PDH an increasingly attractive option for addressing the growing global demand for propylene.
