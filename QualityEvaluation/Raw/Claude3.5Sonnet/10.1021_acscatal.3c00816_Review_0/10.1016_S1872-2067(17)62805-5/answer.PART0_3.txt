[1] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene"

[2] "Low-cost saturated hydrocarbons can be converted to value-added olefins by propane dehydrogenation, and this route is economically competitive"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene"

[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more abundant and less expensive than the conventional feedstocks like naphtha used in steam cracking. This addresses the challenge of decreasing fossil oil resources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mixture of products. This allows for better control over the production process.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, potentially over 90%, which is significantly higher than conventional methods. This addresses the challenge of improving product yield and reducing byproduct formation.

4. Economic competitiveness: The ability to convert low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into high-value olefins (propylene) makes PDH economically attractive.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built on a smaller scale and closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, providing greater flexibility in production and distribution.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, such as the need for high reaction temperatures, which can lead to catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and hydrocarbon cracking. Ongoing research, such as the development of improved catalysts described in this study, aims to address these challenges and further enhance the efficiency and stability of PDH processes.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比于蒸汽裂解中使用的传统原料如石脑油，丙烷更加丰富且价格更低。这解决了化石油资源减少的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法如蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。这些传统方法会产生混合产品。PDH允许更好地控制生产过程。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，潜在地超过90%，这显著高于传统方法。这解决了提高产品产率和减少副产品形成的挑战。

4. 经济竞争力：将低成本饱和烃（丙烷）转化为高价值烯烃（丙烯）的能力使PDH在经济上具有吸引力。

5. 灵活性：PDH装置可以建在更小的规模上，更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者，提供更大的生产和分配灵活性。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，如需要高反应温度，这可能导致由于积碳和烃类裂解而引起的催化剂失活。正在进行的研究，如本研究中描述的改进催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些挑战，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和稳定性。
