[1] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene"

[2] "Low-cost saturated hydrocarbons can be converted to value-added olefins by propane dehydrogenation, and this route is economically competitive"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene"

[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available and less expensive compared to the diminishing fossil oil resources used in conventional methods.

2. Economic competitiveness: The process converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into higher-value olefins (propylene), making it economically attractive.

3. Targeted production: PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, addressing the increasing market demand for this product more directly than conventional methods.

4. Process efficiency: While PDH requires high temperatures for satisfactory yields, it is a more straightforward and focused process compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic, necessitating high temperatures.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Coke formation at high temperatures can lead to decreased catalyst activity and stability.

3. Side reactions: Hydrocarbon cracking can occur at elevated temperatures, affecting product selectivity.

To address these challenges, ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions to improve propylene selectivity, reduce coke formation, and enhance overall process efficiency. Despite these challenges, PDH remains a promising technology due to its ability to directly produce propylene from abundant propane feedstock, aligning well with the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统方法使用的日益减少的化石油资源，丙烷更容易获得且价格更低。

2. 经济竞争力：该过程将低成本的饱和烃（丙烷）转化为高价值的烯烃（丙烯），使其在经济上具有吸引力。

3. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于丙烯生产，比传统方法更直接地满足市场对这种产品不断增长的需求。

4. 过程效率：虽然PDH需要高温才能获得满意的产量，但与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，它是一个更直接、更集中的过程。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗：该过程高度吸热，需要高温。

2. 催化剂失活：高温下的积碳形成可导致催化剂活性和稳定性降低。

3. 副反应：在高温下可能发生烃类裂解，影响产品选择性。

为了应对这些挑战，正在进行的研究重点是开发更高效的催化剂和优化反应条件，以提高丙烯选择性，减少积碳形成，并提高整体过程效率。尽管存在这些挑战，由于PDH能够从丰富的丙烷原料直接生产丙烯，与全球不断增长的丙烯需求相一致，因此它仍然是一项很有前景的技术。
