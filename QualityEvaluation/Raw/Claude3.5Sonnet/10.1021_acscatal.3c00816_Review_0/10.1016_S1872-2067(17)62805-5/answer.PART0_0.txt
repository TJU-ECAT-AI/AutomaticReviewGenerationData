[1] "Propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene"

[2] "Low-cost saturated hydrocarbons can be converted to value-added olefins by propane dehydrogenation, and this route is economically competitive"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene"

[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane, which is abundantly available from natural gas processing and oil refining. This addresses the challenge of decreasing fossil oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Economic competitiveness: PDH converts low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into higher-value olefins (propylene), making it an economically attractive route.

3. Targeted production: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mix of products, PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity.

4. Flexibility: PDH plants can be scaled and located close to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering flexibility in production.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. High energy requirement: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures to achieve satisfactory propylene yields.

2. Catalyst deactivation: The high temperatures can lead to hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which decrease catalyst activity and stability.

3. Equilibrium limitations: The reaction is equilibrium-limited, which can affect overall conversion rates.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research into improved catalysts and process designs is making PDH an increasingly attractive option for addressing the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷，这种原料可以从天然气加工和石油精炼中大量获得。这解决了传统生产方法面临的化石油资源减少的挑战。

2. 经济竞争力：PDH将低成本的饱和烃（丙烷）转化为高价值的烯烃（丙烯），使其成为一种经济上有吸引力的路线。

3. 定向生产：与产生混合产品的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解不同，PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，可能提供更高的选择性。

4. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以根据需要进行规模调整，并且可以靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者，提供生产上的灵活性。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：该过程是高度吸热的，需要高温才能获得令人满意的丙烯产率。

2. 催化剂失活：高温可能导致烃类裂解和焦炭形成，这会降低催化剂的活性和稳定性。

3. 平衡限制：反应受平衡限制，可能影响整体转化率。

尽管存在这些挑战，但对改进催化剂和工艺设计的持续研究正使PDH成为一个越来越有吸引力的选择，以满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。
