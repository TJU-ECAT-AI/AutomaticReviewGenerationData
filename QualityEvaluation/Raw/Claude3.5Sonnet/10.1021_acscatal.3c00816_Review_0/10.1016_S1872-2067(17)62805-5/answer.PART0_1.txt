[1] "Recently, propane dehydrogenation has been widely investigated as an effective approach to propene production because of the continuing decrease in fossil oil resources and the increasing market for propene"

[2] "Low-cost saturated hydrocarbons can be converted to value-added olefins by propane dehydrogenation, and this route is economically competitive"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium-limited reaction, therefore a high temperature is needed to obtain a satisfactory yield of propene"

[4] "However, problems such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation arise with increasing reaction temperature, and these lead to decreases in the activity and stability of the catalyst"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is more readily available and less expensive than the feedstocks used in conventional methods. This addresses the challenge of decreasing fossil oil resources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking. It allows for the conversion of low-cost saturated hydrocarbons (propane) into higher-value olefins (propylene).

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity for propylene, potentially offering better yields than conventional methods that produce multiple products.

4. Economic competitiveness: The PDH route is described as economically competitive, likely due to its use of cheaper feedstock and more straightforward process.

5. Market demand: PDH directly addresses the increasing market demand for propylene, which conventional methods may struggle to meet.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly related to the high temperatures required for the reaction, which can lead to catalyst deactivation through coke formation and hydrocarbon cracking. Ongoing research, such as the development of improved catalysts described in this paper, aims to address these challenges and further enhance the efficiency and stability of the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，相比传统方法使用的原料更容易获得且价格更低。这解决了化石油资源减少的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化等传统方法相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。它允许将低成本的饱和烃（丙烷）转化为更高价值的烯烃（丙烯）。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，可能比传统方法提供更好的产率，而传统方法通常会产生多种产品。

4. 经济竞争力：PDH路线被描述为具有经济竞争力，这可能是由于使用了更便宜的原料和更直接的工艺。

5. 市场需求：PDH直接满足了不断增长的丙烯市场需求，而传统方法可能难以满足这一需求。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是反应所需的高温可能导致催化剂失活，如结焦和烃类裂解。正在进行的研究，如本文所述的改进催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些挑战，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和稳定性。
