[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx."

[2] "Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage. In such a background, the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."

[3] "On the other hand, the recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Simpler reactant and product distribution: PDH involves a straightforward conversion of propane to propylene, without the complexities of oxidative processes.

2. Lower investment costs: The simpler process design of PDH requires less capital investment compared to other technologies.

3. Easier integration with existing technologies: PDH can be more readily incorporated into current petrochemical infrastructures.

4. Abundant feedstock availability: The growth in natural gas and shale gas production provides a steady and economical source of propane for PDH.

5. Higher selectivity: Unlike oxidative processes, PDH avoids deep oxidation reactions that can lead to unwanted COx byproducts.

6. Better process control: The absence of oxidants allows for better control of the reaction conditions and product distribution.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in several ways:

- Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from abundant natural gas sources, reducing dependence on traditional naphtha feedstocks.
- Process efficiency: The simpler reaction system of PDH allows for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene.
- Product selectivity: By avoiding oxidative conditions, PDH achieves higher propylene selectivity and reduces unwanted side reactions.

Overall, PDH technology offers a more direct, efficient, and economical route to propylene production, making it well-suited to meet the growing global demand for this important chemical feedstock.
