[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx."

[2] "In such a background, the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."

[3] "The recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Simpler reactant and product distribution: PDH involves a straightforward conversion of propane to propylene, resulting in fewer side products and easier separation processes.

2. Lower investment costs: The simplicity of the PDH process translates to lower capital expenditures compared to more complex production methods.

3. Easier integration with existing technology: PDH can be more readily incorporated into current petrochemical infrastructure.

4. Abundant feedstock availability: The recent boom in natural gas and shale gas production provides a steady and economical source of propane for PDH processes.

5. Better selectivity: Unlike oxidative dehydrogenation, PDH avoids deep oxidation reactions that can lead to unwanted COx byproducts.

6. Improved efficiency: PDH directly converts propane to propylene without the need for complex separation of multiple products, as in steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more selective, efficient, and economical route to propylene production, while also leveraging the increased availability of light alkane feedstocks from natural gas sources.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 更简单的反应物和产品分布：PDH涉及丙烷到丙烯的直接转化，产生较少的副产品，使分离过程更加简单。

2. 较低的投资成本：PDH过程的简单性意味着与更复杂的生产方法相比，资本支出更低。

3. 更容易与现有技术集成：PDH可以更容易地融入当前的石化基础设施。

4. 充足的原料供应：近期天然气和页岩气生产的繁荣为PDH过程提供了稳定和经济的丙烷来源。

5. 更好的选择性：与氧化脱氢不同，PDH避免了可能导致不需要的COx副产品的深度氧化反应。

6. 提高效率：PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需像蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解那样复杂地分离多种产品。

这些优势通过提供一种更具选择性、效率和经济性的丙烯生产路线，同时也利用了来自天然气源的轻烷烃原料的增加可用性，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。
