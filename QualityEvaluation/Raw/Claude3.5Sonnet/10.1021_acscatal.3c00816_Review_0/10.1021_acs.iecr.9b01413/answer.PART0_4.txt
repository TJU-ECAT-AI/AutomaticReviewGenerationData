[1] "The conventional processes for propylene production including the steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha originate from the petrochemical industry. (4) However, the productivity is hard to meet the demand from the continuous growth of the propylene market."

[2] "On the other hand, the recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."

[3] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the abundant, economical, and steady supply of propane from natural gas and shale gas production. This addresses the feedstock limitations faced by conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers a simpler reactant and product distribution compared to conventional methods. This simplicity leads to improved process efficiency and easier control of the reaction.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is more selective towards propylene production, allowing for higher yields of the desired product compared to steam cracking or FCC, which produce a wider range of products.

4. Lower investment costs: The simpler process design of PDH requires less investment compared to the complex infrastructure needed for steam cracking or FCC units.

5. Integration with existing technology: PDH can be more easily integrated with present petrochemical technologies, allowing for smoother adoption and implementation.

6. Meeting growing demand: PDH addresses the challenge of meeting the continuously growing demand for propylene, which conventional methods struggle to satisfy due to their limited productivity.

By offering these advantages, PDH technology provides a more targeted, efficient, and economically viable solution for propylene production, making it better suited to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in the current market scenario.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因以下几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用天然气和页岩气生产中丰富、经济且稳定的丙烷供应。这解决了传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）石脑油面临的原料限制问题。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更简单的反应物和产品分布。这种简单性导致了工艺效率的提高和更容易的反应控制。

3. 产品选择性：PDH对丙烯生产的选择性更高，与蒸汽裂解或FCC相比，可以获得更高的目标产品产率，后者会产生更广泛的产品。

4. 较低的投资成本：PDH的简单工艺设计需要较少的投资，相比之下，蒸汽裂解或FCC装置需要复杂的基础设施。

5. 与现有技术的集成：PDH可以更容易地与现有石化技术集成，从而实现更平稳的采用和实施。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH解决了持续增长的丙烯需求问题，而传统方法由于生产力有限而难以满足这一需求。

通过提供这些优势，PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了一个更有针对性、更高效和更具经济可行性的解决方案，使其更适合解决当前市场情况下传统生产方法面临的挑战。
