[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx."

[2] "The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."

[3] "On the other hand, the recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Simpler reactant and product distribution: PDH involves a straightforward conversion of propane to propylene, resulting in fewer side products and easier separation.

2. Lower investment costs: The process requires less complex equipment and infrastructure compared to other methods.

3. Easier integration with existing technology: PDH can be more readily incorporated into current petrochemical processes.

4. Feedstock availability: The recent boom in natural gas production, including shale gas exploitation, provides abundant, economical, and steady sources of propane.

5. Better selectivity: Unlike oxidative dehydrogenation, PDH avoids deep oxidation that can lead to unwanted COx products.

6. Energy efficiency: While oxidative dehydrogenation is exothermic and requires cooling, PDH can be operated at controlled temperatures, potentially improving overall energy efficiency.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing more readily available feedstocks, improving process efficiency through simpler reactant and product distributions, and enhancing product selectivity by avoiding unwanted oxidation reactions.
