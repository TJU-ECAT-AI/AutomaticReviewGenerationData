[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."

[3] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

[4] "The production of olefins from propane could be simply classified into three categories as follows: (1) reaction without an oxidant involved in propane dehydrogenation, simply designated as direct propane dehydrogenation to propylene; (2) oxygen or air jointly involved in dehydrogenation, denoted as PDH-O2; and (3) carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant or hydrogen serving as feeding gas, named CO2/H2 mediated dehydrogenation (PDH-CO2/PDH-H2)."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High product value: PDH directly converts low-value propane into high-value propylene, maximizing the economic benefit.

2. Feedstock availability: With the advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology, abundant shale gas resources have increased the availability of propane feedstock.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Product selectivity: Direct dehydrogenation allows for higher propylene selectivity compared to other processes that produce multiple products.

5. Environmental considerations: PDH has potentially lower environmental impact compared to more energy-intensive traditional methods.

6. Flexibility: PDH can be operated in different modes (with or without oxidants) to optimize process conditions and outcomes.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing more abundant feedstocks, improving process efficiency, and enhancing product selectivity, all while potentially reducing environmental impacts.
