[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."

[3] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

[4] "The reaction equation (C3H8  C3H6 + H2) reveals its economic efficiency with the generation of high-valued products by using only propane reactants."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH generates high-value propylene using only propane as a reactant, making it a cost-effective process.

2. Feedstock availability: With advancements in hydraulic fracturing technology, there is increased availability of low-cost propane from shale gas extraction, providing a reliable and abundant feedstock for PDH.

3. Process selectivity: PDH offers better control over the reaction, resulting in higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Environmental considerations: PDH has lower environmental impact compared to other propylene production methods, as it doesn't involve complex processes or byproducts.

5. Meeting growing demand: With propylene demand reaching around 116 million tons in 2020 and still growing, PDH technology helps bridge the gap between supply and demand more effectively than conventional methods.

6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more selective, efficient, and environmentally friendly process that can better utilize the increasingly available propane feedstock from shale gas extraction.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 经济效益：PDH仅使用丙烷作为反应物生产高价值丙烯，使其成为一个具有成本效益的过程。

2. 原料可用性：随着水力压裂技术的进步，从页岩气提取中获得的低成本丙烷供应增加，为PDH提供了可靠且丰富的原料。

3. 工艺选择性：与传统的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，PDH对反应的控制更好，从而获得更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 环境考虑：与其他丙烯生产方法相比，PDH的环境影响较小，因为它不涉及复杂的过程或副产品。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：2020年丙烯需求达到约1.16亿吨并仍在增长，PDH技术比传统方法更有效地帮助弥合供需差距。

6. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，减少运输成本并提高供应链效率。

这些优势通过提供更具选择性、效率和环境友好的工艺来解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，该工艺能够更好地利用从页岩气提取中越来越多的可用丙烷原料。
