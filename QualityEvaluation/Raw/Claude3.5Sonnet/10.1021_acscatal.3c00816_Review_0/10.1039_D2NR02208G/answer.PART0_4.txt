[1] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."

[2] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

[3] "PDH is a typical highly endothermic reaction process, which requires an elevated temperature to realize a reasonable propane conversion (ΔH θ 298K = 124 KJ mol1)."

[4] "The reaction equation (C3H8  C3H6 + H2) reveals its economic efficiency with the generation of high-valued products by using only propane reactants."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Cost-effectiveness: PDH is considered more economical compared to other technical processes, taking into account both production costs and environmental impacts.

2. High-value products: The PDH process generates high-value propylene from relatively low-value propane, improving economic efficiency.

3. Feedstock availability: The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has increased the availability of propane from shale gas, providing an abundant feedstock for PDH.

4. Simplified reaction: PDH involves a straightforward reaction where propane is converted directly to propylene and hydrogen, without the need for complex separations or additional reactants.

5. Selectivity: The direct conversion allows for potentially higher selectivity towards propylene compared to conventional cracking methods.

6. Utilization of low-value resources: PDH enables the conversion of low-value propane into high-value propylene, adding value to previously underutilized resources.

These advantages address challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more direct and efficient route to propylene, utilizing more readily available feedstocks, and potentially providing better selectivity. However, it's worth noting that PDH is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures, which presents its own set of challenges in terms of energy efficiency and catalyst stability.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术已成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，主要基于以下几个关键优势：

1. 成本效益：考虑到生产成本和环境影响，PDH被认为比其他技术工艺更经济。

2. 高价值产品：PDH工艺将相对低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，提高了经济效益。

3. 原料可用性：水力压裂技术的发展增加了从页岩气中获取丙烷的可能性，为PDH提供了丰富的原料来源。

4. 简化反应：PDH涉及一个直接将丙烷转化为丙烯和氢气的简单反应，无需复杂的分离或额外的反应物。

5. 选择性：直接转化可能比传统的裂解方法具有更高的丙烯选择性。

6. 低价值资源利用：PDH能够将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，提高了先前未充分利用资源的价值。

这些优势解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，提供了一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线，利用了更容易获得的原料，并可能提供更好的选择性。然而，值得注意的是，PDH是一个需要高温的吸热过程，这在能源效率和催化剂稳定性方面也带来了一系列挑战。
