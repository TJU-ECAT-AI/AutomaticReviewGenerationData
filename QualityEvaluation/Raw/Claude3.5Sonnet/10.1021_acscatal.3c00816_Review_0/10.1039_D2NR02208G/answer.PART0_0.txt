[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."

[3] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

[4] "The reaction equation (C3H8  C3H6 + H2) reveals its economic efficiency with the generation of high-valued products by using only propane reactants."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH produces high-value propylene directly from propane, which is a relatively low-value feedstock. This simple one-step process is more economically efficient compared to traditional multi-step methods.

2. Feedstock availability: With the advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology, there is increased availability of low-cost propane from shale gas extraction. This abundant feedstock makes PDH more attractive and sustainable.

3. Process simplicity: The PDH reaction is straightforward, involving only the conversion of propane to propylene and hydrogen. This simplicity leads to better process control and potentially higher efficiency compared to more complex traditional methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity towards propylene production, as it directly targets the conversion of propane to propylene without significant side reactions or byproducts.

5. Environmental considerations: PDH can be more environmentally friendly compared to other processes that may require higher energy inputs or produce more waste products.

6. Meeting growing demand: With the global demand for propylene increasing rapidly (around 116 million tons in 2020), PDH technology offers a scalable solution to address this growing need that traditional methods struggle to meet.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最具前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 经济效率：PDH直接从相对低价值的丙烷原料生产高价值丙烯。这种简单的一步法过程比传统的多步法在经济上更有效率。

2. 原料可用性：随着水力压裂技术的进步，从页岩气提取中获得的低成本丙烷可用性增加。这种丰富的原料使PDH更具吸引力和可持续性。

3. 过程简单：PDH反应简单直接，只涉及丙烷到丙烯和氢气的转化。这种简单性带来了更好的过程控制，与更复杂的传统方法相比，可能具有更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH对丙烯生产具有高选择性，因为它直接针对丙烷到丙烯的转化，没有显著的副反应或副产品。

5. 环境考虑：与其他可能需要更高能量输入或产生更多废物的过程相比，PDH可能更加环保。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：随着全球丙烯需求迅速增加（2020年约1.16亿吨），PDH技术提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，以满足传统方法难以应对的这种不断增长的需求。

这些优势共同使PDH技术成为一个有前景的解决方案，可以解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
