[1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."

[3] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

[4] "The reaction equation (C3H8  C3H6 + H2) reveals its economic efficiency with the generation of high-valued products by using only propane reactants."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH produces high-value propylene directly from propane, which is a relatively low-value feedstock. This simple one-step process is more economically efficient compared to traditional multi-step methods.

2. Feedstock availability: With the advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology, there is increased availability of low-cost propane from shale gas extraction. This abundant feedstock makes PDH more attractive and sustainable.

3. Process simplicity: The PDH reaction is straightforward, involving only the conversion of propane to propylene and hydrogen. This simplicity leads to better process control and potentially higher efficiency compared to more complex traditional methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity towards propylene production, as it directly targets the conversion of propane to propylene without significant side reactions or byproducts.

5. Environmental considerations: PDH can be more environmentally friendly compared to other processes that may require higher energy inputs or produce more waste products.

6. Meeting growing demand: With the global demand for propylene increasing rapidly (around 116 million tons in 2020), PDH technology offers a scalable solution to address this growing need that traditional methods struggle to meet.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.
