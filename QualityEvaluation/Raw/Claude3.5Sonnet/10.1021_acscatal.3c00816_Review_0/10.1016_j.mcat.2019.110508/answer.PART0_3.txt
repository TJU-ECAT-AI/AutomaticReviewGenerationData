[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."

[3] "Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration. Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Utilization of abundant feedstock: PDH takes advantage of the increased availability of propane from shale gas, providing a stable and plentiful source of raw material.

2. Direct and efficient process: Unlike conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct, PDH directly converts propane to propylene, potentially improving efficiency.

3. Addresses feedstock limitations: PDH reduces reliance on traditional naphtha cracking, which faces feedstock constraints.

4. Potential for improved selectivity: By focusing on a single reaction pathway, PDH has the potential for higher propylene selectivity compared to multi-product processes.

5. Opportunity for greener catalysts: The research demonstrates efforts to develop more environmentally friendly catalysts for PDH, addressing toxicity concerns with some current commercial options.

6. Stability improvements: Ongoing catalyst development aims to reduce coking and improve stability, potentially leading to longer catalyst lifetimes and less frequent regeneration needs.

While challenges remain, particularly in catalyst design, PDH technology shows promise in addressing key issues of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 利用丰富的原料：PDH利用页岩气带来的丙烷供应增加，提供了稳定和充足的原材料来源。

2. 直接高效的过程：与将丙烯作为副产品生产的传统方法不同，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，可能提高效率。

3. 解决原料限制：PDH减少了对面临原料限制的传统石脑油裂解的依赖。

4. 提高选择性的潜力：通过专注于单一反应路径，PDH有可能比多产品过程具有更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 开发更环保催化剂的机会：研究表明，正在努力开发更环保的PDH催化剂，解决一些当前商业选择存在的毒性问题。

6. 稳定性改进：正在进行的催化剂开发旨在减少结焦并提高稳定性，可能导致催化剂寿命延长和再生需求减少。

尽管在催化剂设计方面仍存在挑战，但PDH技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性等关键问题方面显示出前景。
