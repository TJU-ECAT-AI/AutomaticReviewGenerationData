[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."

[3] "Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration. Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH takes advantage of the abundant shale gas resources, providing a reliable and alternative hydrocarbon source for propylene production.

2. Process efficiency: Compared to conventional methods, PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene from propane.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology allows for higher propylene selectivity compared to other processes like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Economic benefits: With the development of new catalysts, PDH can potentially offer a more cost-effective solution compared to the expensive PtSn catalysts currently used in commercial processes.

5. Environmental considerations: The development of green catalyst systems for PDH addresses the toxicity concerns associated with conventional CrOx catalysts.

6. Improved stability: Research into new catalysts aims to reduce coke formation and sintering of active sites, which could lead to improved process stability and less frequent regeneration needs.

PDH technology specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more direct route from propane to propylene, utilizing abundant shale gas resources, and driving research towards more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts.
