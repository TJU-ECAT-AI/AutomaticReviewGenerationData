[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."

[3] "Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration. Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production route.

2. It utilizes abundant and alternative hydrocarbon sources like shale gas as feedstock, improving feedstock availability.

3. It offers a more efficient process compared to conventional methods, as it directly converts propane to propylene.

4. It has the potential for higher product selectivity compared to traditional cracking processes.

5. It addresses the challenges of high costs associated with PtSn catalysts and toxicity issues of CrOx catalysts used in conventional methods.

6. There is ongoing research to develop low-cost, environmentally friendly, and stable catalyst systems to further improve the PDH process efficiency and sustainability.

However, PDH technology still faces some challenges, such as catalyst deactivation due to coke formation and the need for frequent regeneration. Ongoing research aims to overcome these issues and further enhance the efficiency and stability of PDH processes.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 它直接满足了全球不断增长的丙烯需求，提供了一种专门的生产途径。

2. 它利用丰富的替代碳氢化合物源（如页岩气）作为原料，改善了原料的可用性。

3. 与传统方法相比，它提供了更高效的工艺，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯。

4. 与传统的裂解工艺相比，它具有更高的产品选择性潜力。

5. 它解决了传统方法中使用的PtSn催化剂的高成本问题和CrOx催化剂的毒性问题。

6. 目前正在进行研究，开发低成本、环保和稳定的催化剂系统，以进一步提高PDH工艺的效率和可持续性。

然而，PDH技术仍面临一些挑战，如由于结焦导致的催化剂失活和需要频繁再生。正在进行的研究旨在克服这些问题，并进一步提高PDH工艺的效率和稳定性。
