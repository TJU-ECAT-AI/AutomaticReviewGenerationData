[1] "The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."

[3] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of abundant shale gas as feedstock, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially improving process efficiency compared to conventional multi-step methods.

3. Opportunity for developing low-cost and environmentally friendly catalysts, overcoming the drawbacks of expensive PtSn and toxic CrOx catalysts used in current commercial processes.

4. Potential for good stability and selectivity with properly designed catalyst systems.

While not explicitly stated, PDH likely offers improved product selectivity compared to conventional methods, as it is a targeted dehydrogenation reaction. The technology addresses challenges in feedstock availability by using shale gas resources, aims to improve efficiency through direct conversion, and seeks to overcome cost and environmental issues associated with current commercial catalysts.
