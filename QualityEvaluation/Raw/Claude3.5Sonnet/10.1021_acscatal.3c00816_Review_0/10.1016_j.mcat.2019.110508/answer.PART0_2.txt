[1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."

[3] "Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of abundant shale gas resources as feedstock, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering improved process efficiency compared to conventional methods.

3. Opportunity for developing more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts compared to expensive PtSn or toxic CrOx catalysts used in current commercial processes.

4. Potential for high propylene selectivity, as PDH is a targeted dehydrogenation reaction.

PDH technology specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more direct route from an increasingly available feedstock (shale gas-derived propane) to the desired propylene product, while also presenting opportunities to overcome cost and environmental concerns associated with current commercial catalysts.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 利用丰富的页岩气资源作为原料，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

2. 丙烷直接转化为丙烯，与传统方法相比可能提供更高的工艺效率。

3. 相比当前商业过程中使用的昂贵PtSn或有毒CrOx催化剂，有机会开发更具成本效益和环境友好的催化剂。

4. 由于PDH是一种有针对性的脱氢反应，因此具有高丙烯选择性的潜力。

PDH技术通过提供一种从日益可用的原料（页岩气衍生的丙烷）到所需丙烯产品的更直接路线，特别解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，同时还提供了克服当前商业催化剂相关成本和环境问题的机会。
