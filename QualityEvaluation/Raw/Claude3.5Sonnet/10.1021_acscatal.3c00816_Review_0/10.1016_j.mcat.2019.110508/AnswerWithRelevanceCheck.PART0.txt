          [1] "Propylene is a vital chemical feedstock for the production of high-valued chemical products. The recent wide exploitation of shale gas, which is an abundant and alternative hydrocarbon source, has boosted the way of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH)"

[2] "Up to now, PtSn and CrOx catalysts have been widely used in commercial PDH process. However, the highly cost of PtSn and strong toxicity of CrOx catalysts evidently hamper their widespread industrial applications."

[3] "Besides, severe coke formation and sintering of active sites of them always need frequent regeneration. Therefore, the exploitation of low-cost and green catalyst systems with good stability for PDH is necessary and urgent."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of abundant feedstock: PDH takes advantage of the increased availability of propane from shale gas, providing a stable and plentiful source of raw material.

2. Direct and efficient process: Unlike conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct, PDH directly converts propane to propylene, potentially improving efficiency.

3. Addresses feedstock limitations: PDH reduces reliance on traditional naphtha cracking, which faces feedstock constraints.

4. Potential for improved selectivity: By focusing on a single reaction pathway, PDH has the potential for higher propylene selectivity compared to multi-product processes.

5. Opportunity for greener catalysts: There are ongoing efforts to develop more environmentally friendly and cost-effective catalysts for PDH, addressing toxicity concerns and high costs associated with current commercial options like PtSn and CrOx catalysts.

6. Stability improvements: Ongoing catalyst development aims to reduce coking and improve stability, potentially leading to longer catalyst lifetimes and less frequent regeneration needs.

PDH technology specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of:

- Feedstock availability: By utilizing abundant shale gas resources.
- Process efficiency: Through direct conversion of propane to propylene.
- Product selectivity: By focusing on a single reaction pathway.

While challenges remain, particularly in catalyst design to overcome issues like coke formation and active site sintering, PDH technology shows promise in addressing key issues faced by conventional propylene production methods.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 利用丰富的原料：PDH利用页岩气带来的丙烷供应增加，提供了稳定和充足的原材料来源。

2. 直接高效的过程：与将丙烯作为副产品生产的传统方法不同，PDH直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，可能提高效率。

3. 解决原料限制：PDH减少了对面临原料限制的传统石脑油裂解的依赖。

4. 提高选择性的潜力：通过专注于单一反应路径，PDH有可能比多产品过程具有更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 开发更环保催化剂的机会：正在努力开发更环保和更具成本效益的PDH催化剂，解决与当前商业选择（如PtSn和CrOx催化剂）相关的毒性问题和高成本。

6. 稳定性改进：正在进行的催化剂开发旨在减少结焦并提高稳定性，可能导致催化剂寿命延长和再生需求减少。

PDH技术特别解决了传统生产方法在以下方面面临的挑战：

- 原料可用性：通过利用丰富的页岩气资源。
- 工艺效率：通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯。
- 产品选择性：通过专注于单一反应路径。

尽管在催化剂设计方面仍存在挑战，特别是克服结焦和活性位点烧结等问题，但PDH技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的关键问题方面显示出前景。
