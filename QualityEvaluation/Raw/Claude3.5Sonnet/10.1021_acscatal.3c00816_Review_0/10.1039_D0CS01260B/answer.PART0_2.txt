Here are the relevant quotes and answers to the question:

<quotes>

[1] "Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates."

[2] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."

[3] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas, which is abundantly available due to the large-scale exploitation of shale resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a catalytic selective process that directly converts propane to propylene. This direct conversion is more efficient compared to conventional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce propylene as a by-product.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers exclusive selectivity to olefins, which is a unique property compared to other processes like methanol-to-olefins (MTO), Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO), or oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). This high selectivity means less unwanted by-products and higher yield of the desired propylene.

4. Flexibility: As a standalone process, PDH can be used to supplement existing propylene production methods, allowing producers to adjust their output based on market demands.

5. Environmental considerations: PDH does not require oxidants like O2, CO2, or N2O, which are used in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. This can potentially lead to a lower environmental impact.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology positions itself as a highly promising method to meet the growing global demand for propylene, offering a more efficient, selective, and flexible production route compared to conventional methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气的丙烷，由于页岩资源的大规模开发，这种原料丰富可用。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种催化选择性过程，可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯。与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化等将丙烯作为副产品生产的传统方法相比，这种直接转化更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：与其他过程如甲醇制烯烃（MTO）、费托合成制烯烃（FTO）或氧化脱氢（ODH）相比，PDH提供了独特的烯烃专一选择性。这种高选择性意味着更少的不需要的副产品和更高的目标丙烯产率。

4. 灵活性：作为一个独立的过程，PDH可以用来补充现有的丙烯生产方法，允许生产商根据市场需求调整产量。

5. 环境考虑：PDH不需要氧化脱氢过程中使用的O2、CO2或N2O等氧化剂。这可能会导致更低的环境影响。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术将自己定位为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的高度有前景的方法，与传统方法相比，提供了更高效、更具选择性和更灵活的生产路线。
