          [1] "Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates."

[2] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."

[3] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

[4] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock limitations faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene. This offers improved efficiency compared to multi-step processes like methanol-to-olefins (MTO) or Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO).

3. Product selectivity: PDH provides exclusive selectivity to olefins, which is a unique advantage over oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes that use oxidants like O2, CO2, or N2O. This high selectivity leads to improved product yields and reduced byproduct formation.

4. Flexibility: As a catalytic process, PDH allows for optimization through catalyst design and reaction engineering to overcome challenges like high reaction temperatures required due to the stability of C-H bonds.

5. Complementary to existing methods: PDH serves as an effective supplement to conventional production methods, helping to meet the growing demand for propylene without completely replacing established technologies.

6. Sustainability: PDH does not require additional oxidants like O2, CO2, or N2O, potentially reducing overall process complexity and environmental impact.

While PDH does face challenges, particularly in terms of high reaction temperatures and potential catalyst deactivation, its advantages in feedstock utilization, selectivity, and process simplicity make it a highly promising technology for addressing the increasing global demand for propylene. Ongoing research and development in catalyst design and process optimization are addressing these challenges to make PDH increasingly competitive and efficient.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，由于页岩气的大规模开发，丙烷供应充足。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料限制问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的一步法工艺。与甲醇制烯烃（MTO）或费托合成制烯烃（FTO）等多步骤工艺相比，这提供了更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH提供了对烯烃的专一选择性，这是相对于使用O2、CO2或N2O等氧化剂的氧化脱氢（ODH）工艺的独特优势。这种高选择性导致了更高的产品收率和更少的副产品形成。

4. 灵活性：作为一种催化过程，PDH允许通过催化剂设计和反应工程优化来克服由于C-H键稳定性而导致的高反应温度等挑战。

5. 对现有方法的补充：PDH作为传统生产方法的有效补充，有助于满足不断增长的丙烯需求，而无需完全取代已建立的技术。

6. 可持续性：PDH不需要额外的氧化剂，如O2、CO2或N2O，可能减少了整体工艺复杂性和环境影响。

虽然PDH确实面临一些挑战，特别是在高反应温度和潜在的催化剂失活方面，但它在原料利用、选择性和工艺简单性方面的优势使其成为解决全球丙烯需求不断增长的高度有前景的技术。正在进行的催化剂设计和工艺优化研究正在解决这些挑战，使PDH在满足日益增长的全球丙烯需求方面变得越来越具有竞争力和效率。
