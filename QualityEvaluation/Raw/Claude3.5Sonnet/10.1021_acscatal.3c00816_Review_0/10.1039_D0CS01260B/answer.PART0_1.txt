[1] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."

[2] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

[3] "Non-oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) are thermodynamically limited reactions with highly endothermic properties, as shown below:"

[4] "Unlike olefin molecules possessing an unsaturated CC bond, ethane and propane consisting only of CC and CH bonds are more difficult to adsorb on the catalyst surface and to be activated."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production in light of growing global demand:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock constraints faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers exclusive selectivity to olefins, which is a unique advantage compared to other pathways like methanol-to-olefins (MTO), Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). This higher selectivity translates to improved process efficiency.

3. Product selectivity: PDH provides better control over product selectivity, focusing specifically on propylene production. This is particularly advantageous as global demand for propylene grows.

4. Flexibility: PDH serves as an effective supplement to conventional production methods, allowing for more flexible and diversified propylene production.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: The process is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring careful control of reaction conditions.

2. Catalyst development: Effective catalysts are needed to overcome the difficulty in activating propane molecules, which consist only of CC and CH bonds and are harder to adsorb on catalyst surfaces compared to olefins.

3. Energy requirements: Due to its endothermic nature, PDH requires significant energy input, which needs to be balanced against its advantages.

Despite these challenges, the advantages of PDH in terms of feedstock utilization, selectivity, and process flexibility make it a promising technology for addressing the growing global demand for propylene.

鉴于全球丙烯需求的不断增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，由于页岩气的大规模开发，丙烷供应充足。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料限制问题。

2. 工艺效率：作为非氧化性工艺，PDH提供了对烯烃的独特选择性，这是相比其他途径如甲醇制烯烃（MTO）、费托合成制烯烃（FTO）和氧化脱氢（ODH）的独特优势。这种更高的选择性转化为更高的工艺效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH提供了更好的产品选择性控制，专注于丙烯生产。随着全球丙烯需求的增长，这一点特别有优势。

4. 灵活性：PDH作为传统生产方法的有效补充，允许更灵活和多样化的丙烯生产。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 热力学限制：该过程高度吸热且受热力学限制，需要仔细控制反应条件。

2. 催化剂开发：需要开发有效的催化剂来克服丙烷分子的活化难度，因为丙烷仅由CC和CH键组成，比烯烃更难吸附在催化剂表面。

3. 能源需求：由于其吸热性质，PDH需要大量能量输入，需要权衡其优势。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH在原料利用、选择性和工艺灵活性方面的优势使其成为应对全球丙烯需求增长的有前景技术。
