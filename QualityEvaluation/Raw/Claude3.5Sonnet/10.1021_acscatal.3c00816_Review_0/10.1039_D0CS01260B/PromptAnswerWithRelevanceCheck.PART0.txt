[1] "Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates."

[2] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."

[3] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production in light of growing global demand:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock constraints faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers exclusive selectivity to olefins, which is a unique advantage compared to other pathways like methanol-to-olefins (MTO), Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO), and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). This higher selectivity translates to improved process efficiency.

3. Product selectivity: PDH provides better control over product selectivity, focusing specifically on propylene production. This is particularly advantageous as global demand for propylene grows.

4. Flexibility: PDH serves as an effective supplement to conventional production methods, allowing for more flexible and diversified propylene production.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: The process is highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited, requiring careful control of reaction conditions.

2. Catalyst development: Effective catalysts are needed to overcome the difficulty in activating propane molecules, which consist only of CC and CH bonds and are harder to adsorb on catalyst surfaces compared to olefins.

3. Energy requirements: Due to its endothermic nature, PDH requires significant energy input, which needs to be balanced against its advantages.

Despite these challenges, the advantages of PDH in terms of feedstock utilization, selectivity, and process flexibility make it a promising technology for addressing the growing global demand for propylene.
