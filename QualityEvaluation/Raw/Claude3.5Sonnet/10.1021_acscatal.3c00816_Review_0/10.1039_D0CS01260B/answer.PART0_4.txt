[1] "Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates."

[2] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."

[3] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

[4] "Considering the high chemical stability of the CH bonds in these two molecules, the direct dehydrogenation reactions require a high temperature to gain a satisfactory yield of olefins."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock limitations faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene. This simplicity offers potential efficiency advantages over multi-step processes like methanol-to-olefins (MTO) or Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO).

3. Product selectivity: PDH provides exclusive selectivity to olefins, which is a unique property compared to other processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). This high selectivity helps maximize propylene yield.

4. Flexibility: As a catalytic process, PDH can be optimized through catalyst and process improvements to enhance efficiency and selectivity further.

5. Sustainability: PDH does not require additional oxidants like O2, CO2, or N2O, potentially reducing overall process complexity and environmental impact.

However, PDH does face challenges, particularly the high temperatures required due to the stability of C-H bonds, and the need for efficient catalysts to achieve satisfactory yields. Ongoing research and development in catalyst design and process optimization are addressing these challenges to make PDH increasingly competitive and efficient for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，由于页岩气的大规模开采，丙烷供应充足。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料限制挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的一步法工艺。这种简单性相比甲醇制烯烃（MTO）或费托合成制烯烃（FTO）等多步骤工艺提供了潜在的效率优势。

3. 产品选择性：PDH提供了独特的烯烃专一性选择性，这是与氧化脱氢（ODH）等其他工艺相比的独特特性。这种高选择性有助于最大化丙烯产率。

4. 灵活性：作为一种催化过程，PDH可以通过催化剂和工艺改进进一步优化，以提高效率和选择性。

5. 可持续性：PDH不需要额外的氧化剂，如O2、CO2或N2O，potentially减少了整体工艺复杂性和环境影响。

然而，PDH确实面临挑战，特别是由于C-H键的稳定性而需要的高温，以及需要高效催化剂来实现满意的产率。正在进行的催化剂设计和工艺优化研究正在解决这些挑战，使PDH在满足日益增长的全球丙烯需求方面变得越来越具有竞争力和效率。
