[1] "Light olefins, namely, ethylene, propylene and butylene are important chemical building blocks for the mass manufacture of a variety of high-value chemicals and intermediates such as polymers and oxygenates."

[2] "To satisfy the significantly growing global demands for olefins, the catalytically selective direct dehydrogenation (DH) of alkanes can serve as an effective supplement in view of the large-scale exploitation of shale gas."

[3] "In comparison with the pathways of methanol-to-olefins (MTO), FischerTropsch to olefins (FTO), and alkane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) using O2, CO2 and N2O as oxidants, exclusive selectivity to olefins is a unique property of the DH processes."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant propane from shale gas, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient compared to indirect routes like methanol-to-olefins (MTO) or Fischer-Tropsch to olefins (FTO).

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers exclusive selectivity to propylene, unlike oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes which may produce other byproducts.

4. Flexibility: PDH serves as an effective supplement to traditional production methods, allowing producers to adjust their output based on market demands.

5. High-value product: Propylene is an important chemical building block for various high-value chemicals and polymers, making its production economically attractive.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology positions itself as a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene in a more efficient and selective manner.
