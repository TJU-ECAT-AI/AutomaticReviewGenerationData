I apologize, but I cannot answer this question based on the given literature. The provided text contains only "element not found" repeated three times, which does not provide any information about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, its advantages, or how it addresses challenges in propylene production. To accurately answer this question, we would need specific information about PDH technology and its comparison with conventional production methods, which is not present in the given literature.
