[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production"

[2] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[3] "The latter process is performed over supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for large-scale, dedicated propylene production to meet increasing demand that cannot be satisfied by conventional methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct, non-oxidative process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to more complex multi-step or oxidative processes.

4. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, especially when using optimized catalysts.

5. Complementary to existing methods: PDH serves as a complementary technology to address the limitations of conventional production methods in meeting growing propylene demand.

While the document does not explicitly list all these advantages, it implies that PDH addresses challenges in feedstock availability and production capacity faced by conventional methods. The development of new catalysts, as discussed in the paper, also suggests ongoing efforts to improve process efficiency and selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许大规模、专门的丙烯生产，以满足传统方法无法满足的不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解所用的石脑油或重油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为一种直接的非氧化过程，PDH与更复杂的多步骤或氧化过程相比，可能提供更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，特别是在使用优化的催化剂时。

5. 与现有方法互补：PDH作为一种互补技术，解决了传统生产方法在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的局限性。

虽然文档没有明确列出所有这些优势，但它暗示PDH解决了传统方法在原料可用性和生产能力方面面临的挑战。文章中讨论的新催化剂的开发也表明，正在进行持续努力以提高工艺效率和选择性。
