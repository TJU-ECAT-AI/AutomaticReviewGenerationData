[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production"

[2] "The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions"

[3] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed for large-scale propylene production, addressing the gap between supply from traditional methods and growing demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Process efficiency: As a dedicated process for propylene, PDH can achieve higher yields and efficiencies compared to non-specific cracking methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity towards propylene, reducing unwanted byproducts.

5. Complementary to existing methods: PDH complements traditional production methods, helping to meet the increasing global demand for propylene that cannot be satisfied by conventional processes alone.

While the document does not explicitly state all these advantages, they can be inferred from the context of PDH being developed as an on-purpose production method to address the limitations of conventional processes in meeting growing propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为丙烯生产最有前景方法的主要优势包括：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于大规模丙烯生产，弥补了传统方法供应与不断增长需求之间的差距。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解所用的石脑油或重油馏分更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为专门的丙烯生产工艺，PDH可以实现比非特定裂解方法更高的产率和效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH提供了较高的丙烯选择性，减少了不需要的副产品。

5. 对现有方法的补充：PDH补充了传统生产方法，有助于满足仅凭传统工艺无法满足的不断增长的全球丙烯需求。

虽然文件并未明确陈述所有这些优势，但从PDH作为一种定向生产方法被开发以解决常规工艺在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的局限性这一背景中可以推断出这些优势。
