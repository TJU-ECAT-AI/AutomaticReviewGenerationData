[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production"

[2] "The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions"

[3] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for dedicated, large-scale propylene production to meet increasing demand, which traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot satisfy.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in conventional methods.

3. Higher selectivity: PDH is a more selective process for propylene production compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a range of products.

4. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency than multi-step processes like metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes.

5. Independence from oil refining: Unlike steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, PDH is not tied to oil refining operations, allowing for more flexible production.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, these advantages address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods, making PDH a promising technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许专门的大规模丙烯生产，以满足不断增长的需求，而传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解无法满足这一需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，比传统方法中使用的石脑油或重油馏分更容易获得。

3. 更高的选择性：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH是一个更具选择性的丙烯生产过程，后者会产生一系列产品。

4. 过程效率：作为一个直接转化过程，PDH可能比乙烯和2-丁烯的复分解等多步骤过程提供更高的效率。

5. 独立于石油精炼：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解不同，PDH不依赖于石油精炼操作，允许更灵活的生产。

虽然在给定的文本中没有明确说明，但这些优势解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使PDH成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的有前景技术。
