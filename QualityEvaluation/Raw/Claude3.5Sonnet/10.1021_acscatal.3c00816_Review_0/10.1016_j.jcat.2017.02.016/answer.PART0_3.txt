[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production"

[2] "The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions"

[3] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed for large-scale propylene production, addressing the growing demand that conventional methods cannot meet.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a direct feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in traditional methods.

3. Process efficiency: As a dedicated process, PDH can be optimized for propylene production, potentially offering higher yields and efficiency compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is designed to selectively produce propylene, potentially resulting in higher propylene selectivity compared to multi-product processes like steam cracking.

5. Complementary to existing methods: PDH serves as an additional production route, helping to balance the supply-demand gap created by limitations of conventional methods.

While the literature does not explicitly state all these advantages, they can be inferred from the context of PDH being developed as an on-purpose production method to address the increasing demand for propylene that conventional methods cannot satisfy.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为丙烯生产最有前景方法的主要优势包括：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于大规模丙烯生产，解决了传统方法无法满足的日益增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法使用的石脑油或重油馏分，更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为一种专用工艺，PDH可以针对丙烯生产进行优化，与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，可能提供更高的产率和效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH旨在选择性地生产丙烯，与蒸汽裂解等多产品工艺相比，可能获得更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 补充现有方法：PDH作为额外的生产途径，有助于平衡传统方法局限性造成的供需差距。

虽然文献没有明确列出所有这些优势，但从PDH作为一种定向生产方法开发，以解决常规方法无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求这一背景中可以推断出这些优势。
