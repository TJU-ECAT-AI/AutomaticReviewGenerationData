          [1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production"
          [2] "The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions"
          [3] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed for large-scale propylene production, addressing the growing demand that traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in conventional methods.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to multi-step processes or traditional cracking methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, as it is designed specifically for propylene production rather than producing a mix of olefins.

5. Complementary to existing methods: PDH serves as an additional production route, helping to balance the supply-demand gap left by conventional methods.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. While not all advantages are explicitly stated in the given text, they can be inferred from the context of PDH being developed as an on-purpose production method to address the limitations of traditional processes in meeting increasing propylene demand.

          丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于大规模丙烯生产，解决了蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等传统方法无法满足的不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法中使用的石脑油或重油馏分更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为一个直接转化过程，PDH与多步骤过程或传统裂解方法相比，可能提供更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，因为它专门设计用于丙烯生产，而不是生产混合烯烃。

5. 补充现有方法：PDH作为一种额外的生产路线，有助于平衡传统方法留下的供需缺口。

这些优势解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。虽然给定的文本中没有明确说明所有这些优势，但可以从PDH被开发为定向生产方法以解决传统工艺在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的局限性这一背景中推断出这些优势。
