[1] "Propene is one of the most important petrochemicals mainly used in polymer production"

[2] "The most common processes for synthesis of this olefin are steam cracking of naphtha and fluidized catalytic cracking of heavy oil fractions"

[3] "Since they cannot match the continuously increasing demand for propene, other processes have been commercialized for on-purpose large-scale production, which are metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes as well as non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed for large-scale propylene production, addressing the growing demand that traditional methods cannot meet.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to the multi-step processes involved in steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, as it is designed specifically for propylene production rather than producing a mix of olefins.

5. Complementary to existing methods: PDH serves as an additional production route, helping to balance the supply-demand gap left by conventional methods.

While the document does not explicitly list all these advantages, they can be inferred from the context of PDH being developed as an on-purpose production method to address the limitations of traditional processes in meeting increasing propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于大规模丙烯生产，解决了传统方法无法满足的不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化所用的石脑油或重质油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化的多步骤工艺相比，可能提供更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，因为它专门设计用于丙烯生产，而不是生产混合烯烃。

5. 补充现有方法：PDH作为一种额外的生产路线，有助于平衡传统方法留下的供需缺口。

虽然文档没有明确列出所有这些优势，但从PDH被开发为定向生产方法以解决传统工艺在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面的局限性的背景中，可以推断出这些优势。
