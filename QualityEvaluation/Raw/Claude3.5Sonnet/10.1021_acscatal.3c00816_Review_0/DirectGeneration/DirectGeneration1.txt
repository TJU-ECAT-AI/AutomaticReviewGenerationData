Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as a promising technology to address the increasing global demand for propylene production, offering several advantages over conventional methods. As traditional propylene production techniques, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, face limitations in meeting the growing market needs, PDH has gained significant attention from industry professionals and researchers alike. This innovative process allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, resulting in higher yields and improved selectivity compared to conventional methods. PDH also offers greater flexibility in feedstock sourcing, as it can utilize abundant and relatively inexpensive propane from shale gas production. Furthermore, the process is more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions and reducing the carbon footprint of propylene production. As a result, PDH technology is increasingly being adopted by chemical manufacturers worldwide, with numerous new plants being constructed or planned to capitalize on its benefits and help meet the escalating demand for this crucial petrochemical feedstock.
