The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include:

1. Non-petroleum based route: PDH provides an alternative pathway to produce propylene that is not dependent on petroleum feedstocks, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Industrial relevance: The technology has significant industrial relevance, indicating its potential for large-scale implementation.

3. Potential for more environmentally friendly catalysts: While current commercial PDH catalysts face issues with scarcity (platinum) and toxicity (chromium), there is great interest in developing alternative catalysts using more abundant and non-toxic metals like zinc. This addresses environmental concerns and sustainability issues associated with conventional methods.

4. Specificity: PDH is a direct method to produce propylene from propane, which can potentially offer higher product selectivity compared to other processes that produce propylene as a byproduct.

5. Feedstock flexibility: PDH allows the use of propane as a feedstock, which can be sourced from natural gas processing or as a byproduct of refinery operations, providing flexibility in raw material sourcing.

While the document does not explicitly discuss process efficiency, the ongoing research into improved catalysts suggests that PDH technology has the potential for enhanced efficiency as the technology develops further.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为丙烯生产最有前景方法的主要优势包括：

1. 非石油基路线：PDH提供了一种不依赖石油原料的替代途径来生产丙烯，解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应挑战。

2. 工业相关性：该技术具有重要的工业相关性，表明其具有大规模实施的潜力。

3. 更环保催化剂的潜力：虽然目前商业PDH催化剂面临稀缺性(铂)和毒性(铬)问题，但业界对开发使用更丰富和无毒金属(如锌)的替代催化剂有很大兴趣。这解决了与传统方法相关的环境问题和可持续性问题。

4. 特异性：PDH是一种直接从丙烷生产丙烯的方法，与其他将丙烯作为副产品生产的工艺相比，可能提供更高的产品选择性。

5. 原料灵活性：PDH允许使用丙烷作为原料，可以从天然气处理或作为炼油厂操作的副产品中获得，提供了原材料采购的灵活性。

虽然文档没有明确讨论工艺效率，但对改进催化剂的持续研究表明，随着技术的进一步发展，PDH技术有提高效率的潜力。
