[1] "We report the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance for gas phase propane dehydrogenation of single-site Co2+ ions supported on silica."

[2] "For catalytic propane dehydrogenation, single-site Co2+/SiO2 exhibits selectivities >95% at 550 C and >90% at 650 C with stable activity over 24 h."

[3] "Given the recent examples of low-temperature, homogeneous Co hydrocarbon chemistry, along with observation of CH bond activation at higher temperatures in Co-exchanged zeolites, we chose to explore whether a similar type of single-site Con+ species could be stabilized on SiO2."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, it does describe some advantages of a specific PDH catalyst. The single-site Co2+/SiO2 catalyst shows high selectivity (>95% at 550°C and >90% at 650°C) for propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It also demonstrates stable activity over 24 hours. These properties suggest good process efficiency and product selectivity for this particular PDH catalyst. The study focuses on developing a well-defined single-site catalyst to better understand the molecular-level origins of catalytic activity and selectivity, which could potentially lead to improved PDH technology. However, the paper does not discuss feedstock availability or compare PDH to conventional propylene production methods.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论全球对丙烯的需求,也没有将丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)与其他生产方法进行比较。然而,它确实描述了一种特定PDH催化剂的一些优点。单点Co2+/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯时表现出高选择性(550°C时>95%,650°C时>90%)。它还展示了24小时内的稳定活性。这些特性表明该特定PDH催化剂具有良好的工艺效率和产品选择性。该研究致力于开发一种明确定义的单点催化剂,以更好地理解催化活性和选择性的分子水平起源,这可能会导致PDH技术的改进。然而,该论文并未讨论原料的可用性,也没有将PDH与传统的丙烯生产方法进行比较。
