The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, it does describe some advantages of a specific PDH catalyst.

The single-site Co2+/SiO2 catalyst developed for propane dehydrogenation shows high selectivity towards propene, with little formation of byproducts like ethylene and methane. It exhibits selectivities above 95% at 550°C and above 90% at 650°C. The catalyst also demonstrates stable activity over 24 hours.

These properties suggest that this PDH catalyst could potentially offer improved product selectivity and process efficiency compared to some conventional methods. However, the literature does not provide information on feedstock availability or directly compare this technology to other propylene production methods in terms of addressing global demand challenges.

该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）与其他生产方法进行比较。但是，它确实描述了一种特定PDH催化剂的一些优点。

为丙烷脱氢开发的单位点Co2+/SiO2催化剂对丙烯表现出高选择性，生成乙烯和甲烷等副产品很少。在550°C时，其选择性高于95%，在650°C时高于90%。该催化剂还表现出24小时内的稳定活性。

这些特性表明，与一些传统方法相比，这种PDH催化剂可能会提供更好的产品选择性和过程效率。然而，该文献并未提供关于原料可用性的信息，也未直接将该技术与其他丙烯生产方法在应对全球需求挑战方面进行比较。
