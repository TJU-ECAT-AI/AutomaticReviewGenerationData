The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, it does describe some advantages of a specific PDH catalyst.

The single-site Co2+/SiO2 catalyst shows high selectivity for propene production from propane dehydrogenation, with selectivities above 95% at 550°C and above 90% at 650°C. It exhibits stable activity over 24 hours and produces little ethylene or methane byproducts. These properties suggest good efficiency and product selectivity for propylene production.

While the text doesn't discuss feedstock availability or compare PDH to conventional methods, the high selectivity and stability of this catalyst could potentially address some challenges in propylene production. However, without more context on global propylene demand or other production methods, it's not possible to fully answer the question about PDH's overall advantages or how it compares to other technologies.

该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)与其他生产方法进行比较。然而，它确实描述了一种特定PDH催化剂的一些优点。

单位点Co2+/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢生产丙烯方面表现出高选择性，在550°C时选择性高于95%，在650°C时选择性高于90%。它在24小时内表现出稳定的活性，并且产生很少的乙烯或甲烷副产品。这些特性表明该催化剂在丙烯生产方面具有良好的效率和产品选择性。

虽然文本没有讨论原料供应情况或将PDH与传统方法进行比较，但该催化剂的高选择性和稳定性可能会解决丙烯生产中的一些挑战。然而，由于缺乏关于全球丙烯需求或其他生产方法的更多背景信息，无法全面回答有关PDH整体优势或其与其他技术相比如何的问题。
