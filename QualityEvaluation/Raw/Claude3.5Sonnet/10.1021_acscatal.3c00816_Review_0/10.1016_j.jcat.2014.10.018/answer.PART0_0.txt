The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in the context of global propylene demand or compare it to conventional production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some potential advantages of the single-site Co2+/SiO2 catalyst for PDH:

1. High selectivity: The catalyst shows selectivities above 95% at 550°C and above 90% at 650°C, indicating efficient conversion of propane to propylene with minimal side products.

2. Stability: The catalyst exhibits stable activity over 24 hours, suggesting good durability under reaction conditions.

3. Simplicity: The use of a single-site catalyst on silica support may offer advantages in terms of catalyst synthesis and characterization compared to more complex multi-component systems.

4. Efficiency: The high selectivity towards propene with little formation of ethylene and methane suggests efficient use of the propane feedstock.

While these features are promising, the literature does not provide information on how this specific PDH technology compares to conventional production methods in terms of addressing global propylene demand, feedstock availability, or overall process efficiency.

该文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术相对于全球丙烯需求的优势，也没有将其与传统生产方法进行比较。然而，根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断出单点Co2+/SiO2催化剂用于PDH的一些潜在优势：

1. 高选择性：该催化剂在550°C时的选择性高于95%，在650°C时高于90%，表明丙烷到丙烯的转化效率高，副产品少。

2. 稳定性：催化剂在24小时内表现出稳定的活性，说明在反应条件下具有良好的耐久性。

3. 简单性：使用硅胶负载的单点催化剂可能在催化剂合成和表征方面比更复杂的多组分系统具有优势。

4. 效率：对丙烯的高选择性以及很少形成乙烯和甲烷，表明对丙烷原料的利用效率高。

虽然这些特征很有前景，但文献并未提供关于这种特定PDH技术如何在解决全球丙烯需求、原料可用性或整体工艺效率方面与传统生产方法相比较的信息。
