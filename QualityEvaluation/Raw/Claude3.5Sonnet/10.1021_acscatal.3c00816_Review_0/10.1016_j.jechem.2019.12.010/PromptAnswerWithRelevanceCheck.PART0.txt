<quotes>

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas"

[2] "Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts generally suffer from low catalytic stability due to the coke formation onto the catalyst surface to cover the active sites."

[3] "The exploitation of an efficient catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly compare PDH to conventional propylene production methods or discuss its specific advantages in detail. However, it implies that PDH is promising due to growing propylene demand and increased propane availability from shale gas. The key challenges for PDH appear to be developing catalysts with high selectivity and long-term stability, as industrial catalysts suffer from coke formation and deactivation. The text does not provide enough information to fully address feedstock availability, process efficiency, or product selectivity compared to other methods.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It addresses the growing demand for propylene.

2. It utilizes the increasing supply of propane from shale gas as feedstock.

3. It offers a direct and efficient route to produce propylene.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and selectivity. The main issue is coke formation on catalyst surfaces, which reduces catalytic activity over time. Therefore, developing catalysts with high selectivity and long-term stability is crucial but challenging for PDH technology.

While the document does not explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods, it implies that PDH can better address feedstock availability by utilizing propane from shale gas. The focus on improving catalyst performance suggests that PDH has the potential for better process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods, though these aspects are not directly stated in the given text.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它满足了不断增长的丙烯需求。

2. 它利用了页岩气中日益增加的丙烷供应作为原料。

3. 它提供了一种直接高效的丙烯生产途径。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性和选择性方面。主要问题是催化剂表面的积碳形成，这会随时间降低催化活性。因此，开发具有高选择性和长期稳定性的催化剂对PDH技术至关重要，但具有挑战性。

虽然文档没有明确将PDH与传统生产方法进行比较，但它暗示PDH可以通过利用页岩气中的丙烷更好地解决原料可用性问题。对改进催化剂性能的关注表明，与传统方法相比，PDH在工艺效率和产品选择性方面具有更好的潜力，尽管这些方面在给定的文本中并未直接说明。
