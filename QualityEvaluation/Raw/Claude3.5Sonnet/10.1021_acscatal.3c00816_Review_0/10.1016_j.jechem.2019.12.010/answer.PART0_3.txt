[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas"

[2] "Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts generally suffer from low catalytic stability due to the coke formation onto the catalyst surface to cover the active sites."

[3] "The exploitation of an efficient catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. It addresses the growing demand for propylene.

2. It utilizes the increasing production of propane from shale gas as feedstock.

3. It offers a direct and efficient route to produce propylene.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and selectivity. The main issues are:

1. Low catalytic stability due to coke formation on catalyst surfaces.

2. Difficulty in developing catalysts with both high selectivity and long-term stability.

The document does not provide specific information on how PDH addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of process efficiency and product selectivity compared to other technologies. However, it implies that PDH is a more direct route for propylene production from propane, which could potentially offer advantages in efficiency and selectivity if the catalyst challenges can be overcome.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为丙烯生产最有前景方法的主要优势包括：

1. 它满足了不断增长的丙烯需求。

2. 它利用了来自页岩气的丙烷产量增加作为原料。

3. 它提供了一种直接高效的丙烯生产路线。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性和选择性方面。主要问题是：

1. 由于催化剂表面结焦导致催化稳定性低。

2. 难以开发既具有高选择性又具有长期稳定性的催化剂。

文献没有提供PDH如何解决传统生产方法在工艺效率和产品选择性方面所面临挑战的具体信息。但它暗示PDH是一种从丙烷生产丙烯的更直接路线，如果能克服催化剂挑战，可能在效率和选择性方面具有优势。
