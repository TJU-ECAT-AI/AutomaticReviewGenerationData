[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas"

[2] "Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts generally suffer from low catalytic stability due to the coke formation onto the catalyst surface to cover the active sites."

[3] "The exploitation of an efficient catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene.

2. It utilizes the increasing supply of propane from shale gas as feedstock.

3. It offers a more direct and potentially efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional methods.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and selectivity. The main issues are coke formation on catalyst surfaces, which reduces catalytic stability, and achieving high selectivity to propylene. The development of efficient catalysts with both high selectivity and long-term stability is crucial but challenging for PDH technology.

While the document does not explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods, it implies that PDH can better address feedstock availability by utilizing propane from shale gas. It also suggests that improving catalyst performance in PDH could lead to better process efficiency and product selectivity compared to existing methods.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它直接满足了对丙烯日益增长的需求。

2. 它利用页岩气生产的丙烷作为原料，而丙烷供应正在增加。

3. 与传统方法相比，它提供了一种更直接、潜在更高效的丙烯生产路线。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性和选择性方面。主要问题是催化剂表面的积碳形成，这降低了催化稳定性，以及如何实现对丙烯的高选择性。开发具有高选择性和长期稳定性的高效催化剂对PDH技术至关重要，但具有挑战性。

虽然文档没有明确将PDH与传统生产方法进行比较，但它暗示PDH可以通过利用页岩气中的丙烷更好地解决原料可用性问题。它还表明，改进PDH中催化剂的性能可能会导致比现有方法更好的工艺效率和产品选择性。
