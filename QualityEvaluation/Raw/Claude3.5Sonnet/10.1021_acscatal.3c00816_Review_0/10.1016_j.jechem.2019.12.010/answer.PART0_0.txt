[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas"

[2] "Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts generally suffer from low catalytic stability due to the coke formation onto the catalyst surface to cover the active sites."

[3] "The exploitation of an efficient catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make."

The literature does not directly compare PDH to conventional propylene production methods or discuss its specific advantages in detail. However, it implies that PDH is promising due to growing propylene demand and increased propane availability from shale gas. The key challenges for PDH appear to be developing catalysts with high selectivity and long-term stability, as industrial catalysts suffer from coke formation and deactivation. The text does not provide enough information to fully address feedstock availability, process efficiency, or product selectivity compared to other methods.

该文献并未直接比较PDH与传统丙烯生产方法，也没有详细讨论其具体优势。但它暗示PDH前景广阔，原因是丙烯需求增长和页岩气提供了更多的丙烷。PDH的主要挑战似乎是开发具有高选择性和长期稳定性的催化剂，因为工业催化剂会受到积碳形成和失活的影响。文本没有提供足够的信息来全面解决与其他方法相比的原料供应、工艺效率或产品选择性问题。
