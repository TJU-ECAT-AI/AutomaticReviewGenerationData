[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn particular attention in recent years due to the growing demand of propylene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas"

[2] "Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts generally suffer from low catalytic stability due to the coke formation onto the catalyst surface to cover the active sites."

[3] "The exploitation of an efficient catalyst with both high catalytic selectivity and long-term stability toward PDH is of great importance but challenging to make."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It addresses the growing demand for propylene.

2. It utilizes the increasing supply of propane from shale gas as feedstock.

3. It offers a direct and efficient route to produce propylene.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and selectivity. The main issue is coke formation on catalyst surfaces, which reduces catalytic activity over time. Developing catalysts with both high selectivity and long-term stability remains a significant challenge for PDH technology.

While the document does not directly compare PDH to conventional production methods, it implies that PDH offers advantages in feedstock availability by utilizing propane from shale gas. The focus on improving catalyst performance also suggests that PDH has the potential for high efficiency and selectivity if catalyst issues can be overcome.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产中的主要优势包括：

1. 它满足了不断增长的丙烯需求。

2. 它利用页岩气中日益增加的丙烷供应作为原料。

3. 它提供了一种直接高效的丙烯生产路线。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性和选择性方面。主要问题是催化剂表面的积碳形成，这会随时间降低催化活性。开发具有高选择性和长期稳定性的催化剂仍然是PDH技术面临的一个重大挑战。

虽然文献没有直接将PDH与传统生产方法进行比较，但它暗示PDH通过利用页岩气中的丙烷在原料可用性方面具有优势。对改进催化剂性能的关注也表明，如果能够克服催化剂问题，PDH有潜力实现高效率和高选择性。
