[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

[5] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH addresses the challenge of dwindling petroleum reserves by utilizing propane, which is abundantly available due to the recent shale gas boom. This has made the United States a low-cost chemical producer, spurring significant investments in the industry.

2. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which have high energy demands, PDH is a more efficient conversion technology. It allows for the direct and selective production of propylene from propane.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields exclusively propylene, rather than a mixture of products. This high selectivity is a significant advantage over traditional methods, which often produce a range of olefins and require further separation processes.

4. Economic viability: The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. Current market conditions, with relatively cheap propane from shale gas and high demand for propylene, make PDH particularly favorable.

5. Scalability and growth potential: The PDH industry is experiencing rapid growth, with numerous new installations being announced and constructed worldwide. This expansion indicates the technology's potential to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

These advantages make PDH a highly attractive solution to address the challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术之所以成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，主要有以下几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH解决了石油储量日益减少的挑战，利用了页岩气繁荣带来的丰富丙烷资源。这使美国成为低成本化学品生产国，刺激了该行业的大量投资。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等传统方法相比，PDH是一种更高效的转化技术。它允许直接且选择性地从丙烷生产丙烯。

3. 产品选择性：PDH是一种定向技术，专门生产丙烯，而不是产品混合物。这种高选择性是相对于传统方法的显著优势，后者通常会产生一系列烯烃并需要进一步的分离过程。

4. 经济可行性：PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异。目前的市场条件，即来自页岩气的相对便宜的丙烷和对丙烯的高需求，使PDH特别有利。

5. 可扩展性和增长潜力：PDH行业正经历快速增长，全球范围内宣布和建设了许多新装置。这种扩张表明该技术有潜力满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。

这些优势使PDH成为解决传统丙烯生产方法所面临挑战的极具吸引力的解决方案，特别是在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面。
