[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."

[4] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

[5] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available from shale gas and natural gas liquids. This addresses the challenge of dwindling petroleum reserves faced by conventional naphtha-based production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an on-purpose technique that produces propylene exclusively, unlike conventional methods that yield a mixture of products. This results in higher efficiency and easier product separation.

3. Product selectivity: Industrial dehydrogenation processes have been optimized to produce polymer-quality propylene with high purity. This addresses the low selectivity issues of conventional methods.

4. Economic viability: The availability of cheap natural gas liquids as feedstock makes PDH more economical compared to oil-based naphtha cracking.

5. Flexibility: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, helping to address the growing demand specifically for this olefin, which has become constrained due to the shift towards ethane cracking in traditional steam crackers.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology provides a more efficient, selective, and economically viable route for propylene production, making it well-positioned to meet the growing global demand for this critical chemical building block.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，这种原料在页岩气和天然气液中丰富可得。这解决了传统基于石脑油生产方法面临的石油储量日益减少的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种定向技术，专门生产丙烯，不像传统方法那样产生混合产品。这导致更高的效率和更容易的产品分离。

3. 产品选择性：工业脱氢工艺已经被优化，可以生产高纯度的聚合物级丙烯。这解决了传统方法选择性低的问题。

4. 经济可行性：廉价天然气液体作为原料的可用性使PDH与基于石油的石脑油裂解相比更具经济性。

5. 灵活性：PDH允许专门生产丙烯，有助于解决由于传统蒸汽裂解向乙烷裂解转变而导致的丙烯需求增长约束。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了一条更高效、更具选择性和经济可行性的路径，使其能够很好地满足这种关键化学基础原料日益增长的全球需求。
