[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[5] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production in light of growing global demand:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant and cheap propane from shale gas, addressing the challenge of dwindling petroleum reserves and rising oil prices faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an on-purpose technique that directly converts propane to propylene, avoiding the high-energy demands and low selectivity issues associated with traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: Dehydrogenation yields exclusively propylene, unlike conventional methods that produce a mixture of olefins. This addresses the challenge of declining propylene supply from ethane cracking.

4. Economic viability: The abundance of cheap shale gas-derived propane has made PDH economically attractive, especially in regions like the United States.

5. Flexibility: As an on-purpose technology, PDH can be scaled and implemented to meet specific propylene demand, offering more control over production compared to conventional methods.

These advantages allow PDH to address the limitations of traditional propylene production methods, making it well-suited to meet the growing global demand for propylene in a more efficient and economical manner.

鉴于全球丙烯需求不断增长，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气中丰富且廉价的丙烷，解决了传统生产方法面临的石油储量减少和油价上涨的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种定向技术，可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了传统方法（如蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化）所面临的高能耗和低选择性问题。

3. 产品选择性：脱氢专门生产丙烯，不像传统方法那样产生混合烯烃。这解决了乙烷裂解导致的丙烯供应下降的问题。

4. 经济可行性：廉价的页岩气衍生丙烷的丰富使PDH在经济上具有吸引力，特别是在美国等地区。

5. 灵活性：作为一种定向技术，PDH可以根据特定的丙烯需求进行规模调整和实施，与传统方法相比，对生产具有更多的控制。

这些优势使PDH能够解决传统丙烯生产方法的局限性，使其能够以更高效和经济的方式满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。
