<quotes>

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

[5] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

</quotes>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH addresses the challenge of dwindling petroleum reserves by utilizing propane, which is abundantly available due to the recent shale gas boom. This has made the United States a low-cost chemical producer, spurring significant investments in the industry.

2. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which have high energy demands, PDH is a more efficient conversion technology. It allows for the direct and selective production of propylene from propane.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields exclusively propylene, rather than a mixture of products. This high selectivity is a significant advantage over traditional methods, which often produce a range of olefins and require further separation processes.

4. Economic viability: The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. Current market conditions, with relatively cheap propane from shale gas and high demand for propylene, make PDH particularly favorable.

5. Scalability and growth potential: The PDH industry is experiencing rapid growth, with numerous new installations being announced and constructed worldwide. This expansion indicates the technology's potential to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

These advantages make PDH a highly attractive solution to address the challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the recent boom in shale gas production, which has made propane an economical feedstock compared to petroleum-based sources. This addresses the issue of dwindling petroleum reserves and rising oil prices.

2. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods that are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, PDH is an on-purpose technique that yields exclusively propylene. This improved efficiency helps to meet the growing global demand for propylene more effectively.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology produces polymer-grade propylene without the mixture of other products typically obtained from traditional cracking processes. This high selectivity is particularly advantageous in the current market conditions where propylene demand is outpacing that of other olefins.

4. Economic viability: The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. Current market conditions, with low-cost propane from shale gas, make PDH highly favorable economically.

5. Scalability and future growth: The PDH industry is experiencing rapid growth, with numerous new installations announced worldwide. This expansion demonstrates the technology's ability to address the increasing global demand for propylene.

6. Flexibility: As an on-purpose technique, PDH allows producers to adjust propylene production independently of other petrochemical processes, providing greater flexibility in meeting market demands.

These advantages make PDH technology well-positioned to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, while meeting the growing global demand for this crucial chemical building block.
