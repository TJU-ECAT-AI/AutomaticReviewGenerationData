[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[5] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production in light of growing global demand:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH takes advantage of the abundant and low-cost propane from shale gas resources, addressing the challenge of dwindling petroleum reserves faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: Unlike traditional methods such as steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, PDH is an on-purpose technique specifically designed for propylene production. This results in higher efficiency and lower energy demands compared to conventional processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH yields exclusively propylene, rather than a mixture of products. This high selectivity addresses the challenge faced by conventional methods, particularly ethane steam cracking, which produces mainly ethylene with negligible amounts of other olefins.

4. Economic viability: The combination of cheap feedstock and efficient conversion makes PDH economically attractive, especially in regions with access to low-cost shale gas.

5. Flexibility: As an on-purpose technology, PDH can be scaled and implemented to meet specific market demands for propylene, providing a more targeted approach to production.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods, making it a promising solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

鉴于全球丙烯需求不断增长，丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用了来自页岩气资源的丰富且低成本的丙烷，解决了传统生产方法面临的石油储量减少的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解等传统方法不同，PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的定向技术。与传统工艺相比，这导致了更高的效率和更低的能源需求。

3. 产品选择性：PDH专门生产丙烯，而不是产品混合物。这种高选择性解决了传统方法面临的挑战，特别是乙烷蒸汽裂解，后者主要生产乙烯，而其他烯烃的产量可以忽略不计。

4. 经济可行性：廉价原料和高效转化的结合使PDH在经济上具有吸引力，特别是在能够获得低成本页岩气的地区。

5. 灵活性：作为一种定向技术，PDH可以根据丙烯的具体市场需求进行规模调整和实施，为生产提供了更有针对性的方法。

这些优势使PDH能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使其成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的有前景的解决方案。
