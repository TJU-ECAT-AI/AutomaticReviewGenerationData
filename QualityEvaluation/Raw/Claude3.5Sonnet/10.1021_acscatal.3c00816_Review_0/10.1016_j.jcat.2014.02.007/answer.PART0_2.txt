[1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."

[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36)."

[3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."

[4] "Conversion of propane resulted in a high selectivity to propene on H-[Fe] zeolites with lower activation energies when compared to H-[Al] zeolites."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, based on the information provided, some advantages of iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation can be inferred:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show much higher selectivity for dehydrogenation compared to cracking, with dehydrogenation rates nearly 20 times higher than cracking rates. This is in contrast to aluminum-based zeolites, which have low dehydrogenation selectivity.

2. Lower activation energy: The activation energy for propane conversion is lower for iron-silicate zeolites compared to aluminum-based zeolites, potentially allowing for more energy-efficient processes.

3. High propene selectivity: The conversion of propane over iron-silicate zeolites results in high selectivity to propene, which is the desired product in PDH.

These advantages suggest that iron-silicate zeolites could potentially improve process efficiency and product selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. However, the literature does not provide information on feedstock availability or compare this method to conventional production methods, so those aspects of the question cannot be addressed based on the given information.

该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)与其他生产方法进行比较。然而，根据所提供的信息，可以推断出铁硅沸石用于丙烷脱氢的一些优势：

1. 更高的选择性：与铝基沸石相比，铁硅沸石显示出更高的脱氢选择性，脱氢速率几乎是裂解速率的20倍。这与具有低脱氢选择性的铝基沸石形成对比。

2. 较低的活化能：与铝基沸石相比，铁硅沸石的丙烷转化活化能较低，可能允许更高能效的过程。

3. 高丙烯选择性：在铁硅沸石上进行丙烷转化可获得高选择性的丙烯，这是PDH过程中所需的产物。

这些优势表明，铁硅沸石可能会提高丙烷脱氢过程的效率和产品选择性。然而，该文献并未提供有关原料可用性的信息，也未将此方法与传统生产方法进行比较，因此无法根据给定信息回答问题中的这些方面。
