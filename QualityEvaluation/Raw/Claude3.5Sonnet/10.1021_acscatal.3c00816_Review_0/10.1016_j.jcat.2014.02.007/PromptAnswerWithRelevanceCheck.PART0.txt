[1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."

[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36)."

[3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."

[4] "The viability of [Fe] zeolite for dehydrogenation of propane was examined and compared to chromia catalysts."

</quotes>

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in the context of global propylene demand. However, it does provide some insights into the potential benefits of using iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show significantly higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, which suggests better selectivity for propylene production.

2. Lower activation energy: H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has a lower activation energy than H-[Al]ZSM-5, potentially indicating improved process efficiency.

3. Potential alternative to chromia catalysts: The study compares [Fe] zeolites to chromia catalysts, suggesting they may be a viable alternative for propane dehydrogenation.

While these points indicate some advantages of using iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, the document does not provide comprehensive information on how PDH technology addresses challenges in feedstock availability or compares to conventional production methods on a global scale.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在全球丙烯需求背景下的优势。但是，它确实提供了一些关于使用铁硅沸石进行丙烷脱氢的潜在好处的见解：

1. 更高的选择性：铁硅沸石显示出显著更高的脱氢率相比于裂解率，这表明对丙烯生产有更好的选择性。

2. 更低的活化能：H-[Fe]ZSM-5 比 H-[Al]ZSM-5 具有更低的活化能，可能表明过程效率得到改善。

3. 铬催化剂的潜在替代品：该研究将 [Fe] 沸石与铬催化剂进行了比较，表明它们可能是丙烷脱氢的可行替代品。

虽然这些点表明了使用铁硅沸石进行丙烷脱氢的一些优势，但该文档并没有提供关于 PDH 技术如何解决原料可用性问题或在全球范围内与传统生产方法相比的全面信息。

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to conventional production methods. However, it does provide some insights into the advantages of using iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show much higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, with nearly 20 times higher selectivity for dehydrogenation than aluminum-containing zeolites.

2. Lower activation energy: H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has a lower activation energy compared to H-[Al]ZSM-5, which could lead to improved process efficiency.

3. Novel reaction mechanism: A redox catalytic cycle is proposed for the reaction over iron sites, which may offer advantages over the traditional protolytic mechanism in terms of selectivity and energy requirements.

These properties suggest that iron-silicate zeolites could potentially address challenges in propylene production by improving selectivity and efficiency. However, the document does not provide information on feedstock availability or direct comparisons to conventional production methods.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）与传统生产方法进行比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于使用铁硅酸盐沸石进行丙烷脱氢的优势的见解：

1. 更高的选择性：铁硅酸盐沸石显示出比裂解率高得多的脱氢率，其脱氢选择性几乎是铝含量沸石的20倍。

2. 更低的活化能：H-[Fe]ZSM-5比H-[Al]ZSM-5具有更低的活化能，这可能会提高过程效率。

3. 新型反应机制：对铁位点上的反应提出了一种氧化还原催化循环机制，这可能在选择性和能量需求方面比传统的质子化机制具有优势。

这些特性表明，铁硅酸盐沸石可能通过提高选择性和效率来解决丙烯生产中的挑战。然而，该文件并未提供关于原料可用性或与传统生产方法的直接比较的信息。

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, based on the information provided, some advantages of iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation can be inferred:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show much higher selectivity for dehydrogenation compared to cracking, with dehydrogenation rates nearly 20 times higher than cracking rates. This is in contrast to aluminum-based zeolites, which have low dehydrogenation selectivity.

2. Lower activation energy: The activation energy for propane conversion is lower for iron-silicate zeolites compared to aluminum-based zeolites, potentially allowing for more energy-efficient processes.

3. High propene selectivity: The conversion of propane over iron-silicate zeolites results in high selectivity to propene, which is the desired product in PDH.

These advantages suggest that iron-silicate zeolites could potentially improve process efficiency and product selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. However, the literature does not provide information on feedstock availability or compare this method to conventional production methods, so those aspects of the question cannot be addressed based on the given information.
