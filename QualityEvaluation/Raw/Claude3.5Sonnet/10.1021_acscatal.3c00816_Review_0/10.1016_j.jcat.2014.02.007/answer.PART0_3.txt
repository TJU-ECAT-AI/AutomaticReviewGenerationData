[1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."

[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36)."

[3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."

[4] "Conversion of propane resulted in a high selectivity to propene on H-[Fe] zeolites with lower activation energies when compared to H-[Al] zeolites."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, it does provide some insights into the advantages of iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show much higher selectivity for dehydrogenation compared to cracking, with dehydrogenation rates nearly 20 times higher than cracking rates. This is in contrast to aluminum-based zeolites, which show low dehydrogenation selectivity.

2. Lower activation energy: The activation energy for propane dehydrogenation is lower for iron-silicate zeolites compared to aluminum-based zeolites, which could potentially lead to more efficient processes.

3. High propene selectivity: The conversion of propane over iron-silicate zeolites results in high selectivity to propene, which is the desired product in PDH.

These properties suggest that iron-silicate zeolites could potentially address challenges in process efficiency and product selectivity for propane dehydrogenation. However, the literature does not provide information on feedstock availability or compare PDH to conventional production methods, so a complete answer to the question cannot be given based solely on this document.

该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）与其他生产方法进行比较。然而，它确实提供了一些关于铁硅酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢方面优势的见解：

1. 更高的选择性：与裂解相比，铁硅酸盐沸石表现出更高的脱氢选择性，脱氢速率几乎是裂解速率的20倍。这与铝基沸石形成对比，后者显示出较低的脱氢选择性。

2. 较低的活化能：与铝基沸石相比，铁硅酸盐沸石的丙烷脱氢活化能更低，这可能会导致更高效的过程。

3. 高丙烯选择性：在铁硅酸盐沸石上转化丙烷会产生高选择性的丙烯，这是PDH中所需的产品。

这些特性表明，铁硅酸盐沸石可能有助于解决丙烷脱氢过程中的效率和产品选择性挑战。然而，该文献并未提供有关原料供应的信息，也未将PDH与传统生产方法进行比较，因此仅基于这份文档无法给出完整的回答。
