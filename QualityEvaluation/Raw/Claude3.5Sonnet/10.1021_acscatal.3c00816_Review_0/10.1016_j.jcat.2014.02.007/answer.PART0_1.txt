[1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."

[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36)."

[3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."

[4] "A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to conventional production methods. However, it does provide some insights into the advantages of using iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show much higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, with nearly 20 times higher selectivity for dehydrogenation than aluminum-containing zeolites.

2. Lower activation energy: H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has a lower activation energy compared to H-[Al]ZSM-5, which could lead to improved process efficiency.

3. Novel reaction mechanism: A redox catalytic cycle is proposed for the reaction over iron sites, which may offer advantages over the traditional protolytic mechanism in terms of selectivity and energy requirements.

These properties suggest that iron-silicate zeolites could potentially address challenges in propylene production by improving selectivity and efficiency. However, the document does not provide information on feedstock availability or direct comparisons to conventional production methods.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）与传统生产方法进行比较。但是，它确实提供了一些关于使用铁硅酸盐沸石进行丙烷脱氢的优势的见解：

1. 更高的选择性：铁硅酸盐沸石显示出比裂解率高得多的脱氢率，其脱氢选择性几乎是铝含量沸石的20倍。

2. 更低的活化能：H-[Fe]ZSM-5比H-[Al]ZSM-5具有更低的活化能，这可能会提高过程效率。

3. 新型反应机制：对铁位点上的反应提出了一种氧化还原催化循环机制，这可能在选择性和能量需求方面比传统的质子化机制具有优势。

这些特性表明，铁硅酸盐沸石可能通过提高选择性和效率来解决丙烯生产中的挑战。然而，该文件并未提供关于原料可用性或与传统生产方法的直接比较的信息。
