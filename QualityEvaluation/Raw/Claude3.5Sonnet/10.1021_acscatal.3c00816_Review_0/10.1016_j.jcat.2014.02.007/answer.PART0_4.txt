[1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."

[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36)."

[3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."

[4] "Conversion of propane resulted in a high selectivity to propene on H-[Fe] zeolites with lower activation energies when compared to H-[Al] zeolites."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or discuss propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in the broader context of propylene production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some potential advantages of iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites exhibit much higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, potentially leading to improved propylene selectivity.

2. Lower activation energy: H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts show lower activation energy compared to H-[Al]ZSM-5, which could result in more energy-efficient processes.

3. Improved catalyst performance: The iron-silicate zeolites demonstrate superior catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation compared to traditional aluminosilicate zeolites.

While these advantages suggest potential benefits for propane dehydrogenation processes, the literature does not provide information on how this technology specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability or compares to other conventional production methods on a broader scale.

该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或在更广泛的丙烯生产方法背景下讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术。然而，根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断铁硅酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢方面的一些潜在优势：

1. 更高的选择性：铁硅酸盐沸石表现出比裂解率高得多的脱氢率，可能会导致更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 更低的活化能：H-[Fe]ZSM-5催化剂与H-[Al]ZSM-5相比表现出更低的活化能，这可能会导致更高能效的过程。

3. 改进的催化剂性能：与传统的铝硅酸盐沸石相比，铁硅酸盐沸石在丙烷脱氢方面表现出更优越的催化性能。

虽然这些优势暗示了丙烷脱氢过程的潜在益处，但该文献并未提供有关这种技术如何具体解决原料可用性挑战或在更广泛的范围内与其他传统生产方法相比较的信息。
