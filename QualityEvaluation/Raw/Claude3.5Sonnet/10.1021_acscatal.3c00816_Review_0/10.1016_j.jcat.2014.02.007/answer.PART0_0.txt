[1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."

[2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36)."

[3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."

[4] "The viability of [Fe] zeolite for dehydrogenation of propane was examined and compared to chromia catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in the context of global propylene demand. However, it does provide some insights into the potential benefits of using iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation:

1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show significantly higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, which suggests better selectivity for propylene production.

2. Lower activation energy: H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has a lower activation energy than H-[Al]ZSM-5, potentially indicating improved process efficiency.

3. Potential alternative to chromia catalysts: The study compares [Fe] zeolites to chromia catalysts, suggesting they may be a viable alternative for propane dehydrogenation.

While these points indicate some advantages of using iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, the document does not provide comprehensive information on how PDH technology addresses challenges in feedstock availability or compares to conventional production methods on a global scale.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在全球丙烯需求背景下的优势。但是，它确实提供了一些关于使用铁硅沸石进行丙烷脱氢的潜在好处的见解：

1. 更高的选择性：铁硅沸石显示出显著更高的脱氢率相比于裂解率，这表明对丙烯生产有更好的选择性。

2. 更低的活化能：H-[Fe]ZSM-5 比 H-[Al]ZSM-5 具有更低的活化能，可能表明过程效率得到改善。

3. 铬催化剂的潜在替代品：该研究将 [Fe] 沸石与铬催化剂进行了比较，表明它们可能是丙烷脱氢的可行替代品。

虽然这些点表明了使用铁硅沸石进行丙烷脱氢的一些优势，但该文档并没有提供关于 PDH 技术如何解决原料可用性问题或在全球范围内与传统生产方法相比的全面信息。
