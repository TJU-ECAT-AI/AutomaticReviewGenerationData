[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

[3] "This olefin is second to ethene as an important building block of the chemical industry with an annual production of about 80 million metric tons."

[4] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Environmental friendliness: PDH is more environmentally friendly compared to oil-based cracking technologies, as it uses natural/shale gas feedstock containing fewer impurities.

2. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH has been developed specifically to address the gap between propylene demand and supply, which is crucial given propylene's importance as the second most important building block in the chemical industry.

3. Growing contribution: The contribution of PDH technology to overall propene production is expected to increase, as evidenced by the construction of new plants.

4. Feedstock availability: By utilizing propane from natural/shale gas, PDH takes advantage of the increasing availability of this feedstock, especially in regions with abundant shale gas resources.

5. Process efficiency: While not explicitly stated in the quotes, PDH generally offers better process efficiency compared to traditional cracking methods, as it is a dedicated process for propylene production.

6. Product selectivity: PDH typically provides higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a wider range of products.

These advantages position PDH as a promising solution to address the challenges of conventional production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock flexibility, environmental impact, and meeting the growing demand for propylene in the chemical industry.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 环境友好性：与基于石油的裂解技术相比，PDH更加环保，因为它使用含有较少杂质的天然气/页岩气原料。

2. 解决供需缺口：PDH技术的开发专门用于解决丙烯供需之间的差距，这对于丙烯作为化工行业第二重要的基础原料来说至关重要。

3. 贡献增长：PDH技术对整体丙烯生产的贡献预计会增加，这一点从新工厂的建设中可以得到证实。

4. 原料可用性：通过利用天然气/页岩气中的丙烷，PDH利用了这种原料日益增加的可用性，特别是在页岩气资源丰富的地区。

5. 工艺效率：虽然引用中没有明确提到，但PDH通常比传统裂解方法提供更好的工艺效率，因为它是专门用于丙烯生产的过程。

6. 产品选择性：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH通常提供更高的丙烯选择性，后者会产生更广泛的产品范围。

这些优势使PDH成为解决传统生产方法面临的挑战的有力方案，特别是在原料灵活性、环境影响和满足化工行业日益增长的丙烯需求方面。
