[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

[3] "This olefin is second to ethene as an important building block of the chemical industry with an annual production of about 80 million metric tons."

[4] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Environmental friendliness: PDH is more environmentally friendly compared to oil-based cracking technologies, as it uses natural gas or shale gas feedstock containing fewer impurities.

2. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH has been developed specifically to address the gap between propylene demand and supply, making it a targeted solution for the growing global demand.

3. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from natural gas or shale gas, which are increasingly abundant resources, ensuring better feedstock availability compared to oil-based methods.

4. Growing contribution: The contribution of PDH technology to overall propene production is expected to increase, as evidenced by new plants under construction.

5. Process efficiency: While not explicitly stated in the quotes, PDH is generally considered more efficient than traditional cracking methods, as it directly converts propane to propylene in a single step.

6. Product selectivity: PDH typically offers higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mixture of olefins.

These advantages make PDH technology well-suited to address the challenges of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, while also offering environmental benefits.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 环境友好性：与基于石油的裂解技术相比，PDH更加环保，因为它使用含有较少杂质的天然气或页岩气作为原料。

2. 解决供需差距：PDH的开发专门用于解决丙烯供需之间的差距，为不断增长的全球需求提供了有针对性的解决方案。

3. 原料可用性：PDH利用来自天然气或页岩气的丙烷，这些资源日益丰富，与基于石油的方法相比，确保了更好的原料可用性。

4. 贡献不断增长：PDH技术对整体丙烯产量的贡献预计将增加，这从正在建设的新工厂可以看出。

5. 工艺效率：虽然在引用中没有明确说明，但PDH通常被认为比传统的裂解方法更有效，因为它在单一步骤中直接将丙烷转化为丙烯。

6. 产品选择性：与产生混合烯烃的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH通常提供更高的丙烯选择性。

这些优势使PDH技术非常适合解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战，同时还提供环境效益。
