          [1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

          [2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

          [3] "This olefin is second to ethene as an important building block of the chemical industry with an annual production of about 80 million metric tons."

          [4] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

          1. Environmental friendliness: PDH is more environmentally friendly compared to oil-based cracking technologies, as it uses natural gas or shale gas feedstock containing fewer impurities.

          2. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH has been specifically developed to close the gap between propylene demand and supply, helping to meet the growing global demand for this important chemical building block.

          3. Feedstock availability: By utilizing propane from natural gas or shale gas, PDH takes advantage of the increasing availability of these feedstocks, particularly in regions with abundant shale gas resources.

          4. Growing importance: The contribution of PDH technology to overall propene production is expected to increase, as evidenced by the construction of new PDH plants.

          5. Process efficiency: While not explicitly stated in the quotes, PDH is generally considered a more efficient process for propylene production compared to traditional cracking methods, as it directly targets the desired product.

          6. Product selectivity: Although not directly mentioned in the quotes, PDH typically offers higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a wider range of products.

          These advantages position PDH as a crucial technology for meeting the increasing global demand for propylene, which is the second most important building block in the chemical industry after ethylene, with an annual production of about 80 million metric tons.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

          1. 环境友好性：与基于石油的裂解技术相比，PDH更加环保，因为它使用含有较少杂质的天然气或页岩气作为原料。

          2. 解决供需差距：PDH技术的开发专门用于缩小丙烯需求和供应之间的差距，有助于满足这种重要化学建筑块日益增长的全球需求。

          3. 原料可用性：通过利用来自天然气或页岩气的丙烷，PDH利用了这些原料日益增加的可用性，特别是在页岩气资源丰富的地区。

          4. 日益重要性：PDH技术对整体丙烯生产的贡献预计将增加，这从新PDH工厂的建设中可以看出。

          5. 工艺效率：虽然在引用中没有明确说明，但与传统的裂解方法相比，PDH通常被认为是一种更高效的丙烯生产工艺，因为它直接针对所需产品。

          6. 产品选择性：虽然在引用中没有直接提到，但与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH通常提供更高的丙烯选择性，后两者产生更广泛的产品范围。

          这些优势使PDH成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的关键技术，丙烯是仅次于乙烯的化学工业第二重要的基础原料，年产量约为8000万公吨。
