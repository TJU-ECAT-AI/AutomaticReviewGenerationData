[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

[3] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Environmental friendliness: PDH is more environmentally friendly compared to oil-based cracking technologies, as it uses natural gas or shale gas feedstock which contains fewer impurities.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from natural gas or shale gas, which are abundant resources, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional oil-based methods.

3. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH technology has been specifically developed to close the gap between propylene demand and supply, indicating its effectiveness in meeting market needs.

4. Growing importance: The contribution of PDH technology to overall propene production is expected to increase, as evidenced by the construction of new plants, suggesting its promising future in the industry.

5. Process efficiency: While not explicitly stated in the given quotes, PDH's growing adoption implies improved process efficiency compared to conventional methods.

6. Product selectivity: Although not directly mentioned in the provided quotes, PDH typically offers high selectivity towards propylene production, which is a significant advantage over less selective cracking processes.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a highly promising method for propylene production, addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, environmental concerns, and meeting the growing global demand for propylene.
