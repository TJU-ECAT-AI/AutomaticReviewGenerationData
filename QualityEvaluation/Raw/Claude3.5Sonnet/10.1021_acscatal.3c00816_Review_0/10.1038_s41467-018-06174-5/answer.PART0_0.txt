[1] "In comparison with oil-based cracking technologies, which provide a major part of C2C4 olefins for the chemical industry, ethane steam cracking and the dehydrogenation of propane or iso-butane are more environmentally friendly processes because they are based on natural/shale gas containing significantly less impurities than the oil-based feedstock."

[2] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has been developed to close the gap between the demand and supply of propene."

[3] "Contribution of PDH technology to the overall propene production will grow because new plants are under construction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Environmental friendliness: PDH is more environmentally friendly compared to oil-based cracking technologies, as it uses natural gas or shale gas feedstock which contains fewer impurities.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from natural gas or shale gas, which are abundant resources, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional oil-based methods.

3. Bridging supply-demand gap: PDH has been specifically developed to address the growing demand for propylene by closing the gap between supply and demand.

4. Industry growth: The contribution of PDH technology to overall propene production is expected to increase, as evidenced by the construction of new plants.

5. Process efficiency: While not explicitly stated in the given quotes, PDH typically offers better process efficiency compared to traditional cracking methods, as it is a targeted approach for propylene production.

6. Product selectivity: PDH generally provides higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, although this is not directly mentioned in the given quotes.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in meeting the growing global demand for propylene.
