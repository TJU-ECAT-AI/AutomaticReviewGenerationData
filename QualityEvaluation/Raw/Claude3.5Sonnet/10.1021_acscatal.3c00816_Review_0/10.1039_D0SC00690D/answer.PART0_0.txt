[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."

[2] "Nevertheless, better reactivity and selectivity, especially excellent regeneration stability can be achieved when supported VOx catalysts are used in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process."

Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as feedstock, which has become more abundant due to large-scale shale gas exploitation. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers better reactivity compared to traditional methods, potentially leading to higher yields and more efficient production.

3. Product selectivity: The PDH process, especially when using supported VOx catalysts, demonstrates better selectivity towards propylene compared to some conventional methods.

4. Regeneration stability: PDH catalysts, particularly supported VOx catalysts, show excellent regeneration stability, which can lead to longer catalyst lifetimes and reduced operational costs.

5. Direct production: As a direct method of converting propane to propylene, PDH eliminates the need for intermediate steps, potentially simplifying the production process.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene, offering a more efficient and selective production method that capitalizes on the increased availability of propane from shale gas resources.

直接丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，由于大规模页岩气开采，丙烷变得更加丰富。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更好的反应性，可能导致更高的产率和更高效的生产。

3. 产品选择性：PDH工艺，尤其是使用负载型VOx催化剂时，与某些传统方法相比，对丙烯的选择性更好。

4. 再生稳定性：PDH催化剂，特别是负载型VOx催化剂，表现出优异的再生稳定性，这可以延长催化剂寿命并降低运营成本。

5. 直接生产：作为将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的方法，PDH消除了中间步骤的需求，可能简化了生产过程。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求，提供了一种更高效、更有选择性的生产方法，充分利用了页岩气资源带来的丙烷供应增加。
