[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."

[2] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."

[3] "Nevertheless, better reactivity and selectivity, especially excellent regeneration stability can be achieved when supported VOx catalysts are used in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process."

Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane as feedstock, which has become abundantly available due to large-scale shale gas exploitation. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers better reactivity compared to traditional methods. The use of supported vanadium oxide catalysts in non-oxidative PDH processes has shown competitive performance, enhancing overall process efficiency.

3. Product selectivity: PDH demonstrates improved selectivity towards propylene production, especially when using supported VOx catalysts in non-oxidative conditions.

4. Cost-effectiveness: Supported vanadium oxide catalysts used in PDH are more cost-effective compared to conventional Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts.

5. Environmental considerations: VOx-based catalysts have low toxicity, making PDH a more environmentally friendly option compared to processes using toxic catalysts.

6. Regeneration stability: PDH processes using supported VOx catalysts exhibit excellent regeneration stability, ensuring consistent performance over time.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene while overcoming challenges associated with conventional production methods.

直接丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术因几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷作为原料，由于大规模页岩气开采，丙烷变得丰富可得。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料稀缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更好的反应活性。在非氧化PDH过程中使用负载型钒氧化物催化剂显示出具有竞争力的性能，提高了整体工艺效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH展示了更好的丙烯生产选择性，特别是在非氧化条件下使用负载型VOx催化剂时。

4. 成本效益：PDH使用的负载型钒氧化物催化剂比传统的铂基和铬氧化物基催化剂更具成本效益。

5. 环境考虑：VOx基催化剂毒性低，使PDH成为比使用有毒催化剂的工艺更环保的选择。

6. 再生稳定性：使用负载型VOx催化剂的PDH工艺表现出优异的再生稳定性，确保了长期稳定的性能。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求，同时克服与传统生产方法相关的挑战。
