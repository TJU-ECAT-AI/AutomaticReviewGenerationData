[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."

[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."

[3] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."

Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane as feedstock, which has become increasingly available due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock supply faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which can be more efficient compared to other multi-step processes.

3. Product selectivity: While not explicitly stated in the given text, PDH typically offers high selectivity towards propylene compared to other processes that may produce multiple products.

4. Cost-effectiveness: The development of supported vanadium oxide catalysts for PDH offers a competitive performance at a lower cost compared to traditional Pt-based catalysts.

5. Environmental and safety benefits: Vanadium oxide catalysts are less toxic than the conventional CrOx-based catalysts, addressing environmental and safety concerns.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene, offering an efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendlier production route compared to conventional methods.

直接丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术因其几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气的大规模开发，丙烷变得越来越容易获得。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化过程，与其他多步骤工艺相比可能更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：虽然在给定文本中没有明确说明，但PDH通常比可能产生多种产品的其他工艺提供更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 成本效益：支持的氧化钒催化剂在PDH中的开发提供了具有竞争力的性能，同时成本低于传统的铂基催化剂。

5. 环境和安全优势：氧化钒催化剂比传统的CrOx基催化剂毒性更低，解决了环境和安全问题。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合解决全球日益增长的丙烯需求，与传统方法相比，提供了一种更高效、更具成本效益和更环保的生产路线。
