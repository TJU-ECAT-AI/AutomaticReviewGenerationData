[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."

[2] "Nevertheless, better reactivity and selectivity, especially excellent regeneration stability can be achieved when supported VOx catalysts are used in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process."

Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the abundant supply of propane from shale gas, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers better reactivity compared to traditional production methods, potentially leading to higher yields and more efficient use of resources.

3. Product selectivity: The PDH process, especially when using supported VOx catalysts, demonstrates improved selectivity towards propylene production.

4. Regeneration stability: PDH catalysts, particularly supported VOx catalysts, show excellent regeneration stability, which is crucial for long-term operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

5. Direct conversion: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially simplifying the production process compared to other methods that may require multiple steps or additional feedstocks.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene, offering a more efficient and flexible production method that can take advantage of the changing landscape of feedstock availability.
