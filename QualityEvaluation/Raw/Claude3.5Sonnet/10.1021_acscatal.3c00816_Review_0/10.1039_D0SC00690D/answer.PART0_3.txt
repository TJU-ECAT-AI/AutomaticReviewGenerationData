[1] "Due to the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation becomes a particularly important method to produce propylene using propane as feedstock."

[2] "Commercialized propane dehydrogenation plants generally utilize Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts, however these two kinds of catalysts are either expensive or toxic."

[3] "Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide is a promising catalyst compared with Pt and CrOx for its competitive performance, low cost and low toxicity."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of abundant feedstock: PDH directly uses propane, which has become more readily available due to large-scale shale gas exploitation.

2. Cost-effectiveness: Compared to conventional Pt-based catalysts, PDH using supported vanadium oxide catalysts offers competitive performance at a lower cost.

3. Environmental friendliness: Vanadium oxide catalysts are less toxic than traditional CrOx-based catalysts, addressing environmental concerns.

4. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct method to convert propane to propylene, potentially offering improved efficiency over indirect methods.

5. Feedstock flexibility: PDH allows for the use of propane from various sources, including shale gas, addressing feedstock availability challenges.

While not explicitly stated in the given literature, PDH technology likely offers improved product selectivity compared to conventional methods, as it is a targeted process for propylene production. This technology addresses challenges in feedstock availability by utilizing abundant propane resources, improves process efficiency through direct conversion, and potentially enhances product selectivity by focusing on a single product.
