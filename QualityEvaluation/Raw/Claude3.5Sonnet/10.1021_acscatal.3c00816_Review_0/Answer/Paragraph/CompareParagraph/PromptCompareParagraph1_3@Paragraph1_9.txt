Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundantly available from shale gas and natural gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods relying on dwindling petroleum reserves [10.1016/j.mcat.2021.112081]. The recent boom in shale gas production has made propane feedstock extremely cheap and plentiful [10.1039/D2QI00653G].

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene, offering improved efficiency compared to multi-step conventional methods [10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012]. It allows for higher propylene yields and fewer byproducts, improving overall process efficiency [10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345].

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology offers high selectivity towards propylene, typically achieving over 90% selectivity [10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345]. This high selectivity reduces the need for extensive separation and purification steps, thereby improving the overall economics of the process [10.1039/D2QI00653G].

4. Economic viability: The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. Current market conditions, with low-cost propane from shale gas, make PDH highly favorable economically [10.1021/cr5002436].

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology provides a scalable solution to meet the ever-increasing global demand for propylene, which conventional methods struggle to satisfy [10.1016/j.cej.2019.122423].

6. Environmental considerations: PDH generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to naphtha cracking, as it requires less energy input and produces fewer CO2 emissions [10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345].

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures (generally above 500°C) [10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012].

2. Catalyst deactivation: Issues like coking, sintering, and other side reactions can affect catalyst longevity and performance [10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012].

3. Cost considerations: Some effective catalysts, like Pt-based ones, are expensive, driving research into more cost-effective alternatives [10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012].

Despite these challenges, ongoing research in catalyst development and process optimization continues to enhance the efficiency and viability of PDH technology, making it an increasingly attractive option for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of PDH technology represents a significant shift in propylene production, driven by changing feedstock availability and increasing demand. As the petrochemical industry continues to evolve, PDH is likely to play an increasingly important role in propylene production.

Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Advanced catalyst design: Developing novel catalysts that combine high activity, selectivity, and stability while being cost-effective and environmentally friendly. This could involve exploring new materials or optimizing existing ones.

2. Process intensification: Investigating innovative reactor designs or process configurations that can overcome the thermodynamic limitations of PDH, potentially allowing for lower operating temperatures or improved conversion rates.

3. Integration with renewable energy: Exploring ways to couple PDH processes with renewable energy sources to address the high energy requirements and further reduce the carbon footprint.

4. Circular economy approaches: Investigating the potential for integrating PDH technology into circular economy models, possibly by utilizing propane derived from renewable sources or waste streams.

5. Hybrid technologies: Exploring synergies between PDH and other emerging technologies, such as membrane reactors or chemical looping, to enhance overall process efficiency and sustainability.

These research directions could further cement PDH's position as a key technology in the future of propylene production, addressing both economic and environmental concerns in the petrochemical industry.

Recent Progress in Metal-Molecular Sieve Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation
1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is the important raw material for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, propylene oxide, etc. (Figure 1a). (1) According to a report from IHS Markit Ltd. and Dow Chemical Inc., the global propylene supply demand market renders a big gap since 2015, and the propylene demand would keep growing at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% up to 2030 (Figure 1b). (2,3) Conventional propylene production mainly comes from fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and heavy oil. Due to the rapid consumption of crude oil, these traditional propylene production technologies cannot satisfy current and future demands well. Therefore, the development of highly efficient propylene production technologies is of vital importance. Over the past few decades, researchers have developed several new technologies for propylene production, including propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH), propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), methanol-to-olefin (MTO), and Fischer&ndash;Tropsch to olefin (FTO). Especially, PDH is recognized as the most promising method considering following aspects: (1) The shale gas can be extracted on a massive scale, which produces cheap and plentiful propane feedstock for the PDH process; (2) The undesired overoxidation in ODH can be inhibited in PDH; (4,5) (3) PDH is a proprietary technology with high propylene selectivity, which differentiates it from the hybrid products in MTO and FTO processes (Figure 1c). (2)
To date, several PDH technologies have been developed and industrialized. Among them, Oleflex and Catofin have the widest applications, which, respectively, rely on Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts. The high cost of Pt and environmental issues of CrOx drive researchers to explore efficient nonprecious and nontoxic alternatives. (2,4) PDH is acknowledged as a structure-insensitive reaction where the C&ndash;H bond cleavage can occur on every metal or metal&ndash;oxygen site, while the undesired C&ndash;C cracking reactions are typical structure-sensitive reactions that prefer to occur on aggregated sites. (6) Therefore, the design of subnanometric or single-site reactive centers could benefit the propylene yield, which is also the general trend for developing PDH catalysts. (1,2,4,7−9) However, PDH is a typical thermodynamically limited process that requires a high reaction temperature. In the meantime, the removal of coke deposits from spent catalysts requires frequent regeneration. The harsh PDH conditions (i.e., high temperature, strongly reductive atmosphere, and frequent regeneration) easily cause catalyst deactivation through sintering and structural reconstruction. The stabilization of subnanometric active sites requires large surface area support with a strong metal&ndash;support interaction, which cannot be fully satisfied by conventional Al2O3 support. Researchers have developed defective Al2O3 to improve the metal stabilization and catalytic performance. (10−12) Unfortunately, the insufficient Al3+5c concentration (∼27%) restricts the amount of stabilized metal sites (10) and thereby limits the catalytic performance. Besides, the relatively complicated synthesis procedure (synthesis of 0.5 g of defective Al2O3 nanosheets requires ∼180 mL of precursor) also limits the large-scale application. (10,13)
Valuable lessons could be learned from the mature fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) technologies that also operate in harsh conditions, which initially employ the SiO2&ndash;Al2O3-based catalysts and gradually turn to molecular sieve (zeolite)-based catalysts. (14) Compared to Al2O3 or other oxide supports, the molecular sieve supports possess a larger specific surface area and well-defined pores/cavities, which have been proven to possess stronger capability to prevent subnanometric metal species from sintering. (15)
Considering these advantages of molecular sieves, researchers have developed several efficient strategies to stabilize highly dispersed active sites on/within molecular sieves, which exhibit outstanding catalytic PDH performance, especially in catalytic lifetime and propylene selectivity. (16−40) In the past decade, the number of studies about molecular sieve-based PDH catalysts has reached up to 783 and is still rapidly growing based on the data from Web of Science (Figure 1d).
PDH serves as an important industrial reaction, and there have been several reviews involving the PDH technologies and catalyst development. (1,2,4,6−9) In 2014, Sattler (1) reported a pioneering review that summarized the catalytic alkane dehydrogenation on metals and metal oxides. The advances in catalyst design, such as single-atom catalysis, subsurface modification, organometallic chemistry, metal-hydrides chemistry, and so on, were further summarized in several recent reviews. (2,6−8,41) Othroshchenko (9) reviewed the developments of defective bulk oxide catalysts (e.g., ZrO2, TiO2, and γ-Al2O3) for the PDH reaction, wherein the coordinative unsaturated metal sites (MCus) due to oxygen vacancies display promising PDH performance. In addition to catalyst design, Li et al. (4) reviewed the advances in understanding PDH mechanisms (stepwise or concerted pathway) as well as the novel moving-bed and fluidized-bed PDH reactors. These previous PDH reviews generally summarize the catalytic systems based on elements of the active site, which describe the metal-molecular sieve catalysts as a part of support regulation. Recently, Sun et al. (42) summarized the advances in zeolite-based PDH catalysts. As indicated in Figure 1e, apart from zeolites, ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) and hierarchical zeolites are also typical molecular sieves. To provide a direct impression of the catalyst development based on molecular sieve supports, Tables 1&ndash;2 provide an overview of metal-molecular sieve PDH catalysts and representative catalysts on the basis of metal-oxide supports or bulk catalysts. Figure 2 illustrates an activity comparison of catalysts tested under industrial relevant conditions (propane conversion of at least 20% at reactants contain at least 20 vol % propane (9)) with respect to propylene productivity and the deactivation rate.

The hierarchical zeolite supported Pt catalysts typically show propylene productivity of 4&ndash;6 kgC3H6·kgcat&ndash;1·h&ndash;1 at a deactivation rate of 0&ndash;0.02 h&ndash;1, which are superior to those on OMS, zeolite, and metal-oxide supports. Several promising Pt-hierarchical zeolite materials exhibit outstanding catalytic lifetimes that lasted longer than 300 h under industrially relevant conditions. (38,39,60) As for Pt-free catalysts, the promising Co and Zn-containing molecular sieve catalysts exhibit propylene productivity of 0.5&ndash;2 kgC3H6·kgcat&ndash;1·h&ndash;1) at a deactivation rate of 0&ndash;0.2 h&ndash;1, which exhibits certain superiority compared to the counterparts on metal-oxide supports and the represented bulk ZrO2. In this regard, a review about the synthesis and structure&ndash;function relationships of these molecular sieve-supported materials for PDH reaction is necessary and informative. Hereafter, we will discuss the advances in PDH based on metal-OMS materials (section 2), metal-zeolites (section 3), and metal-hierarchical zeolites (section 4). Several representative metal&ndash;organic framework (MOF) derived PDH catalysts on MFI zeolites were also introduced in section 3. Afterward, the challenges and perspectives on molecular sieve-based PDH materials were proposed (section 5). We expect that this perspective can provide some scientific guidance for designing more efficient PDH catalysts.
