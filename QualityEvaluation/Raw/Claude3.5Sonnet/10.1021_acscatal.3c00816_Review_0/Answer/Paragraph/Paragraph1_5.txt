Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the abundant and cheap propane from shale gas and natural gas liquids, addressing the issue of dwindling petroleum reserves and rising oil prices faced by conventional naphtha-based methods [10.1021/cr5002436]. The recent boom in shale gas production has made propane feedstock for PDH extremely cheap and plentiful [10.1039/D2QI00653G].

2. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods that are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, PDH is an on-purpose technique that directly converts propane to propylene, resulting in higher efficiency and lower energy demands [10.1021/cr5002436]. As a direct conversion process, PDH offers improved efficiency compared to traditional multi-step processes or methods that produce propylene as a byproduct [10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.026].

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology produces polymer-grade propylene with high purity, without the mixture of other products typically obtained from traditional cracking processes [10.1021/cr5002436]. Some catalysts can achieve propylene selectivity as high as 95% at 550°C [10.1016/j.jcat.2014.10.018].

4. Economic viability: The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. Current market conditions, with low-cost propane from shale gas, make PDH highly favorable economically [10.1021/cr5002436]. The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable [10.1039/D2QI00653G].

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology helps bridge the supply gap created by the inability of traditional production methods to meet the continually increasing global demand for propylene and its downstream products [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022]. The Dow Chemical Company forecasts that propylene demand will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity [10.1039/D0CS00814A].

6. Environmental benefits: PDH generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to naphtha cracking, as it requires less energy input and produces fewer CO2 emissions [10.146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345]. Some PDH catalysts, like Pt-based ones, are more environmentally friendly compared to conventional CrOx-based catalysts [10.1016/j.cej.2022.139794].

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures (typically above 550°C) [10.1016/j.cjche.2021.11.020].

2. Catalyst deactivation: Issues like coking, sintering, and other side reactions can affect catalyst longevity and performance [10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012].

3. Cost considerations: Some effective catalysts, like Pt-based ones, are expensive, driving research into more cost-effective alternatives [10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advantages of PDH technology position it as a crucial solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene in an era of shifting feedstock availability and increasing environmental concerns. The ability to utilize abundant propane from shale gas resources not only addresses feedstock challenges but also offers economic benefits that make PDH increasingly attractive.

Looking forward, the development of more efficient and stable catalysts will be critical in overcoming the current limitations of PDH technology. Research into novel catalyst materials, such as single-atom alloys or advanced zeolite supports, could lead to breakthroughs in selectivity, stability, and energy efficiency. Additionally, integrating PDH processes with renewable energy sources could further enhance its environmental benefits and economic viability.

As the petrochemical industry continues to evolve, PDH technology is likely to play an increasingly important role in propylene production. Its flexibility and scalability make it well-suited to adapt to changing market conditions and regional feedstock availability. Future research may also explore the potential of combining PDH with other emerging technologies, such as CO2 utilization or biomass conversion, to create even more sustainable and efficient propylene production pathways.

直接丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术已经成为生产丙烯最有前景的方法，因为它具有几个关键优势，解决了传统生产方法所面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用了页岩气和天然气液体中丰富且廉价的丙烷，解决了传统石脑油基方法面临的石油储量减少和油价上涨问题[10.1021/cr5002436]。最近页岩气生产的繁荣使PDH的丙烷原料变得极其便宜和丰富[10.1039/D2QI00653G]。

2. 工艺效率：与能源密集且选择性低的传统方法不同，PDH是一种直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的定向技术，从而提高了效率并降低了能源需求[10.1021/cr5002436]。作为直接转化过程，PDH比传统的多步骤工艺或将丙烯作为副产品的方法提供了更高的效率[10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.026]。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术生产高纯度的聚合级丙烯，避免了传统裂解工艺通常得到的其他产品混合物[10.1021/cr5002436]。一些催化剂在550°C下可以达到高达95%的丙烯选择性[10.1016/j.jcat.2014.10.018]。

4. 经济可行性：PDH的盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异。目前，由于页岩气带来的低成本丙烷，市场条件使PDH在经济上非常有利[10.1021/cr5002436]。丙烯和丙烷之间的价格差异以及不断增长的丙烯市场使PDH异常盈利[10.1039/D2QI00653G]。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术有助于弥补传统生产方法无法满足持续增长的全球丙烯及其下游产品需求所造成的供应缺口[10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022]。陶氏化学公司预测，到2035年，丙烯需求将以平均每年2%至3%的速度增长，预计将超过生产能力[10.1039/D0CS00814A]。

6. 环境效益：与石脑油裂解相比，PDH通常具有较低的碳足迹，因为它需要较少的能源输入并产生较少的CO2排放[10.146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345]。一些PDH催化剂，如基于Pt的催化剂，比传统的基于CrOx的催化剂更环保[10.1016/j.cej.2022.139794]。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：该过程是吸热的，需要高反应温度（通常高于550°C）[10.1016/j.cjche.2021.11.020]。

2. 催化剂失活：焦炭沉积、烧结和其他副反应等问题会影响催化剂的寿命和性能[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012]。

3. 成本考虑：一些有效的催化剂，如基于Pt的催化剂，价格昂贵，推动了对更具成本效益的替代品的研究[10.1021/accountsmr.0c00012]。
