Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which has become increasingly abundant due to the shale gas revolution and natural gas production. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods that rely on naphtha or heavy oil fractions [10.1016/j.cej.2019.122423]. The low cost and wide availability of propane make PDH economically attractive and provide a stable feedstock supply [10.1039/D2QI00653G].

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step conversion process from propane to propylene, offering improved efficiency compared to multi-step conventional methods [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022]. The process can achieve high propane conversion rates, with some catalysts demonstrating conversion up to 66.7% [10.1002/cctc.202101069].

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology offers high selectivity towards propylene production, typically achieving over 90% selectivity [10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345]. This high selectivity reduces the need for extensive separation and purification steps, improving overall process economics [10.1039/D2QI00653G].

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene, which conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking struggle to satisfy [10.1016/j.cej.2019.122423]. The Dow Chemical Company forecasted propylene demand to grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, exceeding production capacity [10.1039/D0CS00814A].

5. Economic viability: The price difference between propane and propylene, combined with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable [10.1039/D2QI00653G]. The low cost of propane feedstock from shale gas further enhances the economic attractiveness of PDH [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022].

6. Environmental benefits: PDH generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to naphtha cracking, as it requires less energy input and produces fewer CO2 emissions [10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345]. Some catalysts, like Pt-based ones, are more environmentally friendly compared to traditional CrOx catalysts [10.1039/C9CY01907C].

7. Flexibility and scalability: PDH plants can be operated independently of refinery or petrochemical complexes, providing greater flexibility in terms of location and scale of production [10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-060817-084345]. This allows for better adaptation to market demands and optimization of supply chains.

Despite these advantages, PDH technology faces some challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and energy requirements. The process is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures (typically above 550Â°C) to achieve satisfactory propylene yields [10.1016/S1872-2067(17)62805-5]. This can lead to catalyst deactivation through coking and sintering, necessitating frequent regeneration [10.1016/j.jcat.2021.03.022].

However, ongoing research is addressing these challenges through the development of more stable and efficient catalysts. For example, recent advancements in catalyst design, such as the use of single atom alloys (SAAs), have shown promise in simultaneously enhancing propylene selectivity and propane conversion while improving catalyst stability [10.1038/s41467-018-06967-8].



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advantages of PDH technology position it as a transformative solution for the propylene industry, addressing key challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. As global demand for propylene continues to grow, PDH is likely to play an increasingly important role in meeting this demand sustainably and economically.

Future research efforts may focus on further improving catalyst performance, particularly in terms of stability and resistance to coking. This could involve exploring novel support materials, optimizing catalyst compositions, or developing innovative regeneration techniques. Additionally, process intensification strategies, such as membrane reactors or advanced reactor designs, could be investigated to enhance overall efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

The integration of PDH technology with renewable energy sources could also be an area of interest, potentially leading to more sustainable propylene production. Furthermore, the development of bio-based propane sources could open up new avenues for green propylene production, aligning with global efforts towards carbon neutrality.

As PDH technology continues to evolve, it may drive significant changes in the petrochemical industry landscape, potentially reshaping supply chains and influencing investment decisions in propylene production capacity worldwide.
