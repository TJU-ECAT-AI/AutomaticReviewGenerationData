          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production"

[2] "This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution."

[3] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s"

[4] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

          The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which has become more abundant due to the shale gas revolution. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process for converting propane to propylene, which can be more efficient compared to multi-step conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: While traditional catalysts face challenges with selectivity due to coke deposition, advances in catalyst technology (such as PtSn bimetallic catalysts and ongoing research into new materials like PtREE intermetallic compounds) aim to improve selectivity to propylene and reduce deactivation.

4. Growing importance: PDH has become one of the most important petrochemical processes for worldwide propylene production, indicating its effectiveness in meeting global demand.

5. Adaptability to market changes: The increased interest in PDH due to the surge in propane supply demonstrates its ability to adapt to changing feedstock availability, addressing challenges faced by other production methods that may rely on different raw materials.

6. Dedicated propylene production: Unlike some conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct, PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, allowing for better control and optimization of the process.

However, challenges remain, such as catalyst deactivation and the need for frequent regeneration in current industrial processes. Ongoing research aims to further improve the efficiency, selectivity, and longevity of PDH catalysts, making it an increasingly attractive option for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气革命，丙烷变得更加丰富。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的一步法工艺，与更复杂的多步骤传统方法相比，可能更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：虽然传统催化剂在选择性方面面临着由于焦炭沉积导致的挑战，但催化剂技术的进步（如PtSn双金属催化剂和对新材料如PtREE金属间化合物的持续研究）旨在提高对丙烯的选择性并减少催化剂失活。

4. 重要性增长：PDH已成为全球丙烯生产最重要的石化工艺之一，表明其在满足全球需求方面的有效性。

5. 适应市场变化：由于丙烷供应激增而对PDH的兴趣增加，表明其能够适应原料可用性的变化，解决了其他可能依赖不同原材料的生产方法所面临的挑战。

6. 专门的丙烯生产：与一些将丙烯作为副产品生产的传统方法不同，PDH专门设计用于丙烯生产，允许更好地控制和优化工艺。

然而，仍然存在一些挑战，如催化剂失活和当前工业过程中频繁再生的需求。正在进行的研究旨在进一步提高PDH催化剂的效率、选择性和寿命，使其成为满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求的越来越具吸引力的选择。
