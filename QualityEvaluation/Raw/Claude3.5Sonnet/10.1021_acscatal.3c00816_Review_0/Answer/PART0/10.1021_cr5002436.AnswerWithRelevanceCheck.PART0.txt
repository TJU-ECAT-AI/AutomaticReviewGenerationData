          [1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."

[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."

[3] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."

[4] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."

[5] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

[6] "Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins."

[7] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."

[8] "In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages that address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the abundant and cheap propane from shale gas and natural gas liquids, addressing the issue of dwindling petroleum reserves and rising oil prices faced by conventional naphtha-based methods.

2. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods that are energy-intensive and have low selectivity, PDH is an on-purpose technique that directly converts propane to propylene, resulting in higher efficiency and lower energy demands.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology produces polymer-grade propylene with high purity, without the mixture of other products typically obtained from traditional cracking processes. This high selectivity is particularly advantageous in the current market conditions where propylene demand is outpacing that of other olefins.

4. Economic viability: The profitability of PDH is largely determined by the price difference between propane and propylene. Current market conditions, with low-cost propane from shale gas, make PDH highly favorable economically.

5. Flexibility: As an on-purpose technique, PDH allows producers to adjust propylene production independently of other petrochemical processes, providing greater flexibility in meeting market demands.

6. Scalability and future growth: The PDH industry is experiencing rapid growth, with numerous new installations announced worldwide. This expansion demonstrates the technology's ability to address the increasing global demand for propylene.

These advantages make PDH technology well-positioned to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, while meeting the growing global demand for this crucial chemical building block.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术之所以成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，主要是因为它具有几个关键优势，可以解决传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用了页岩气和天然气液中丰富且廉价的丙烷，解决了传统基于石脑油方法面临的石油储备减少和油价上涨的问题。

2. 工艺效率：与能源密集且选择性低的传统方法不同，PDH是一种直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的定向技术，结果是更高的效率和更低的能源需求。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术生产高纯度的聚合物级丙烯，而不会像传统裂解工艺那样产生其他产品的混合物。这种高选择性在当前丙烯需求超过其他烯烃的市场条件下特别有优势。

4. 经济可行性：PDH的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异。目前的市场条件，加上页岩气带来的低成本丙烷，使PDH在经济上极具吸引力。

5. 灵活性：作为一种定向技术，PDH允许生产商独立于其他石化工艺调整丙烯产量，在满足市场需求方面提供了更大的灵活性。

6. 可扩展性和未来增长：PDH行业正在经历快速增长，全球已宣布多个新装置。这种扩张表明该技术能够满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。

这些优势使PDH技术能够很好地解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，同时满足这一关键化学原料不断增长的全球需求。
