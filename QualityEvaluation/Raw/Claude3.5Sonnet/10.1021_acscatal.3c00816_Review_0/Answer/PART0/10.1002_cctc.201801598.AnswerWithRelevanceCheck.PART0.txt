          [1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."

          [2] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."

          [3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."

          [4] "Though the former shows the advantage of reducing coke formation, it is still associated with the problem that the oxidation degree is hard to be controlled during actual industrial application, thus leading to safety issues and low propene yield inevitably."

          [5] "In fact, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

          1. Addressing growing demand: PDH directly produces propylene from propane, helping meet increasing market needs for propylene.

          2. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas, which is abundant and increasingly produced worldwide. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by traditional propylene production methods.

          3. Cost-effectiveness: Using propane from shale gas is expected to reduce production costs, making PDH more commercially attractive.

          4. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH avoids issues associated with controlling oxidation degrees in oxidative dehydrogenation, which can lead to safety concerns and low propene yields. This makes PDH a more efficient and safer process.

          5. Commercial viability: PDH has already been implemented in industrial applications, demonstrating its practicality and scalability.

          6. Product selectivity: While not explicitly stated, PDH generally offers good selectivity to propylene. The ability to optimize catalyst compositions, like using low Cr loadings for better dispersion of active species, contributes to improved selectivity.

          7. Adaptability to market demands: As a dedicated propylene production method, PDH can be more easily scaled or adjusted to meet fluctuating market demands compared to byproduct-based production methods.

          These advantages make PDH a promising technology for addressing the challenges of propylene production, particularly in terms of meeting growing demand with improved efficiency, selectivity, and cost-effectiveness.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，原因如下：

          1. 满足需求增长：PDH直接从丙烷生产丙烯，有助于满足不断增长的丙烯市场需求。

          2. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气的丙烷，而页岩气在全球范围内储量丰富且产量不断增加。这解决了传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料稀缺问题。

          3. 成本效益：使用页岩气中的丙烷预计将降低生产成本，使PDH在商业上更具吸引力。

          4. 工艺效率：作为非氧化性工艺，PDH避免了氧化脱氢中控制氧化程度相关的问题，这些问题可能导致安全隐患和低丙烯产率。这使PDH成为一个更高效、更安全的过程。

          5. 商业可行性：PDH已在工业应用中实施，证明了其实用性和可扩展性。

          6. 产品选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但PDH通常对丙烯有良好的选择性。优化催化剂组成的能力，如使用低铬负载以获得更好的活性物种分散，有助于提高选择性。

          7. 适应市场需求：作为一种专门的丙烯生产方法，与副产品生产方法相比，PDH可以更容易地根据波动的市场需求进行规模调整或调节。

          这些优势使PDH成为解决丙烯生产挑战的有前途的技术，特别是在以提高效率、选择性和成本效益来满足不断增长的需求方面。
