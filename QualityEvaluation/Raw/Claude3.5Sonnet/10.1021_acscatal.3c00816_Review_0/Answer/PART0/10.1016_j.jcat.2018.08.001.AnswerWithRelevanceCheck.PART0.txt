          [1] "Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas"

          [2] "PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion"

          [3] "However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity"

          [4] "Supported platinum based catalysts are highly active for PDH while susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition"

          [5] "Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under the high-temperature and oxidizing conditions"

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

          1. Utilization of abundant propane feedstock: PDH takes advantage of the increasing supply of propane from shale gas exploration, addressing feedstock availability challenges.

          2. High conversion efficiency: PDH operates at high temperatures (>550°C) to achieve high propane conversion rates, improving process efficiency.

          3. Direct production route: PDH provides a more direct route to propylene compared to conventional methods, potentially offering better overall efficiency.

          4. Catalyst innovations: Supported platinum catalysts offer high activity for PDH, although they face challenges with coke deposition and sintering.

          However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

          1. Product selectivity: High temperatures favor undesired side reactions like cracking and coking, resulting in low propylene selectivity.

          2. Catalyst deactivation: Coke deposition leads to catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration.

          3. Catalyst sintering: The high-temperature regeneration process can cause irreversible sintering of platinum catalysts.

          Ongoing research aims to address these issues, particularly in developing catalysts that can improve selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates, making PDH a promising method for propylene production.

          丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

          1. 利用丰富的丙烷原料：PDH利用页岩气勘探带来的丙烷供应增加，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

          2. 高转化效率：PDH在高温(>550°C)下运行，以实现高丙烷转化率，提高了工艺效率。

          3. 直接生产路线：与传统方法相比，PDH提供了更直接的丙烯生产路线，可能提供更好的整体效率。

          4. 催化剂创新：负载型铂催化剂对PDH具有高活性，尽管面临积碳和烧结的挑战。

          然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

          1. 产品选择性：高温有利于不需要的副反应，如裂解和结焦，导致丙烯选择性低。

          2. 催化剂失活：积碳导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。

          3. 催化剂烧结：高温再生过程可能导致铂催化剂不可逆烧结。

          正在进行的研究旨在解决这些问题，特别是开发能够在保持高转化率的同时提高选择性的催化剂，使PDH成为有前景的丙烯生产方法。
