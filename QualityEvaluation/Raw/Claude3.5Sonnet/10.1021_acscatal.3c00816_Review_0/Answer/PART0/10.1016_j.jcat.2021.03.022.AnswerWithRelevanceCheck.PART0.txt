          [1] "Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile"

[2] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."

[3] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes"

[4] "So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes."

[5] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

[6] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is a strong endothermic reaction with small chemical equilibrium constant, and thus requires high reaction temperatures"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant propane as feedstock, addressing the limitations of traditional naphtha cracking which cannot meet growing global demand. This also addresses concerns related to oil price fluctuations and the growth of shale gas production.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional cracking processes, where propylene is only a by-product.

3. Product selectivity: Supported Pt catalysts used in PDH are highly selective for C-H activation while minimizing unwanted C-C cracking, leading to improved propylene yields and fewer unwanted by-products.

4. Economic viability: PDH allows for the production of high-value olefins from cheaper alkane feedstocks, making it attractive in the face of oil price fluctuations and increased shale gas production.

5. Scalability and versatility: Large-scale PDH units have already been implemented worldwide, demonstrating the technology's viability for industrial-scale propylene production. PDH units can be integrated into existing petrochemical complexes or built as standalone facilities.

6. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology helps bridge the supply gap created by the inability of traditional production methods to meet the continually increasing global demand for propylene and its downstream products.

However, it's worth noting that PDH technology also faces challenges, such as the need for high reaction temperatures due to the endothermic nature of the reaction and small chemical equilibrium constant. This can lead to issues like coking and catalyst deactivation, which researchers are working to address through improved catalyst designs and process optimizations.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用便宜且丰富的丙烷作为原料，解决了传统石脑油裂解无法满足全球需求增长的限制。这也解决了与石油价格波动和页岩气生产增长相关的担忧。

2. 工艺效率：与传统裂解工艺相比，PDH提供了一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线，在传统工艺中丙烯只是副产品。

3. 产品选择性：PDH中使用的负载型铂催化剂对C-H活化具有高选择性，同时最大限度地减少不需要的C-C裂解，从而提高丙烯产率并减少不需要的副产品。

4. 经济可行性：PDH允许从更便宜的烷烃原料生产高附加值烯烃，这在面对油价波动和页岩气产量增加时具有吸引力。

5. 可扩展性和多功能性：大规模PDH装置已在全球范围内实施，证明了该技术在工业规模丙烯生产中的可行性。PDH装置可以集成到现有的石化综合体中，也可以作为独立设施建设。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术有助于弥补传统生产方法无法满足持续增长的全球丙烯及其下游产品需求所造成的供应缺口。

然而，值得注意的是，PDH技术也面临一些挑战，例如由于反应的吸热性质和小的化学平衡常数，需要高反应温度。这可能导致结焦和催化剂失活等问题，研究人员正在通过改进催化剂设计和工艺优化来解决这些问题。
