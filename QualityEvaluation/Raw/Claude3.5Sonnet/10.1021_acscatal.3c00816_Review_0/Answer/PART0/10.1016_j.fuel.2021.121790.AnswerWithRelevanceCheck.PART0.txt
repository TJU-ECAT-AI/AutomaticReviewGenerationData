          [1] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases"

[2] "Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand"

[3] "In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes."

[4] "Currently, two representative of PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts have been commercially applied in the PDH process"

[5] "Such catalysts perform high activity and selectivity, but some corresponding drawbacks are accompanied, 1) the high-price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI); 2) the rapid deactivation caused by the sintering of metal particles and the coke deposition; 3) the successive regeneration resulting in activity attenuation and massive CO2 emissions."

[6] "To cater to the foregoing issues, numerous groups' efforts have been dedicated to design various catalysts, such as the supported catalysts with active metal oxides (e.g., CoOx, VOx, GaOx, and SnOx, etc.), which exhibit considerable activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction. Nevertheless, such catalysts still yet suffer from rapid deactivation easily."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant shale gas and natural gas as feedstocks, addressing the issue of limited naphtha and crude oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is more energy-efficient compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes, which are highly energy-consuming.

3. Environmental impact: PDH is a more environmentally-friendly process, producing fewer CO2 and NOx emissions compared to conventional methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH offers higher propylene selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene, unlike steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking which produce a mixture of products.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH helps address the ever-growing demand for propylene that conventional methods can no longer satisfy.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. Catalyst limitations: Current commercial catalysts (PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3) have drawbacks including high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation due to coking and sintering.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Frequent regeneration of catalysts leads to activity loss over time and increased CO2 emissions.

3. Catalyst development: While alternative catalysts (e.g., CoOx, VOx, GaOx, SnOx) show promise in activity and selectivity, they still suffer from rapid deactivation.

Overall, PDH technology offers significant potential to address the growing demand for propylene by overcoming challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, further advancements in catalyst design and process optimization are needed to fully realize its benefits and overcome existing limitations.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用廉价且丰富的页岩气和天然气作为原料，解决了传统生产方法面临的石脑油和原油资源有限的问题。

2. 工艺效率：与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺相比，PDH更加节能，而传统工艺则非常耗能。

3. 环境影响：PDH是一种更环保的工艺，与传统方法相比，产生的CO2和NOx排放更少。

4. 产品选择性：PDH提供更高的丙烯选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，不像蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解那样产生混合产品。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH有助于满足传统方法无法满足的日益增长的丙烯需求。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 催化剂限制：当前商业催化剂（PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3）存在缺点，包括成本高、毒性和由于结焦和烧结导致的快速失活。

2. 催化剂再生：频繁的催化剂再生会导致活性随时间损失并增加CO2排放。

3. 催化剂开发：虽然替代催化剂（如CoOx、VOx、GaOx、SnOx）在活性和选择性方面显示出前景，但它们仍然容易快速失活。

总的来说，PDH技术通过克服与原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性相关的挑战，在满足日益增长的丙烯需求方面具有巨大潜力。然而，需要在催化剂设计和工艺优化方面取得进一步进展，以充分实现其效益并克服现有限制。
