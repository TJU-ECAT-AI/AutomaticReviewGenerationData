          [1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored."

[5] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which has become more abundant due to vast shale gas deposits. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which can be more efficient than traditional methods that may involve multiple steps or complex separations. While it requires high reaction temperatures due to its endothermic nature, it can achieve economically attractive yields.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene when using appropriate catalysts, addressing the challenge of product selectivity in conventional methods.

4. Flexibility: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, enabling producers to adjust output based on market demand.

5. Catalyst stability and regeneration: The use of CeO2 as a support addresses the challenge of catalyst deactivation. It facilitates the redispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens, making the catalyst more stable and easily regenerable.

6. Coke suppression: The redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which significantly reduces coke formation during the reaction. This addresses a major challenge in high-temperature hydrocarbon conversion processes.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly related to high reaction temperatures required for economically attractive yields. These high temperatures can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation, which need to be addressed for optimal performance. The development of more stable and regenerable catalysts, as described in the literature, aims to address these issues and further improve the viability of PDH technology for propylene production.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面提供了几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷，由于大量页岩气储量的存在，丙烷现在更加丰富。这解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化过程，这可能比涉及多个步骤或复杂分离的传统方法更有效率。虽然由于其吸热性质需要高反应温度，但它可以实现经济上有吸引力的产率。

3. 产品选择性：使用适当的催化剂时，PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，解决了传统方法中产品选择性的挑战。

4. 灵活性：PDH允许定向丙烯生产，使生产商能够根据市场需求调整产量。

5. 催化剂稳定性和再生：使用CeO2作为支持物解决了催化剂失活的挑战。它促进了Pt的再分散，无需使用腐蚀性卤素，使催化剂更稳定且易于再生。

6. 积碳抑制：CeO2的氧化还原特性允许使用水蒸气，这显著减少了反应过程中的积碳形成。这解决了高温碳氢化合物转化过程中的一个主要挑战。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是与获得经济吸引力产量所需的高反应温度有关。这些高温可能导致催化剂通过烧结和积碳而失活，需要解决这些问题以获得最佳性能。文献中描述的更稳定和可再生催化剂的开发旨在解决这些问题，并进一步提高PDH技术在丙烯生产中的可行性。
