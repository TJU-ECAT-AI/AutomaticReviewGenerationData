          [1] "In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance."

[2] "However, the high cost of Pt- based catalysts and the unavoidable toxicity of CrOx-based catalysts are not enough to satisfy its evolving demand."

[3] "Accordingly, there is a growing desire for cheap and environment-friendly catalysts."

          While the literature does not directly address all aspects of the question, it provides some relevant information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology. PDH technologies have seen rapid application and development due to their economic performance. However, current catalysts face challenges: Pt-based catalysts are expensive, and CrOx-based catalysts are toxic. This has led to a growing demand for cheaper and more environmentally friendly catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The text doesn't provide comprehensive information about PDH's advantages over conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

          虽然文献没有直接回答问题的所有方面，但它提供了一些关于丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术的相关信息。由于经济性能优异，PDH技术已经得到快速应用和发展。然而，当前的催化剂面临挑战：基于铂的催化剂成本高昂，而基于铬氧化物的催化剂具有毒性。这导致了对更便宜、更环保的丙烷脱氢催化剂的需求不断增长。文本并未提供关于PDH在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面相对于传统方法的综合优势信息。
