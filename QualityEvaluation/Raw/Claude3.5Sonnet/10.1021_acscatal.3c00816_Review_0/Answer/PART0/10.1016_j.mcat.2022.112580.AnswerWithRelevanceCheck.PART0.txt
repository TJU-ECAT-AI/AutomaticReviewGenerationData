          [1] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[2] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

[3] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block in petrochemical industry, which could be used for the synthesis of various chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile etc"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High propylene selectivity: PDH provides significantly higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Feedstock availability: With the development of shale gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies, propane has become more abundant and cheaper, making PDH more economically viable.

3. Lower energy consumption: Unlike FCC and steam cracking, which suffer from high energy consumption, PDH is generally more energy-efficient.

4. Meeting growing demand: Conventional methods are struggling to meet the increasing demand for propylene, while PDH has the potential to bridge this gap.

5. Process efficiency: PDH offers a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene from propane, compared to the multi-step processes involved in conventional methods.

6. Versatility: Propylene produced through PDH can be used in the synthesis of various valuable chemicals, including polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability (by utilizing abundant propane), process efficiency (through a more direct conversion process), and product selectivity (by offering higher propylene selectivity). PDH technology provides a more efficient, selective, and economically viable solution for propylene production compared to conventional methods, while also meeting the increasing global demand for this vital petrochemical building block.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 高丙烯选择性：与流化催化裂化（FCC）和石脑油蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比，PDH提供了显著更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 原料可用性：随着页岩气和天然气水合物开采技术的发展，丙烷变得更加丰富和便宜，使PDH在经济上更加可行。

3. 较低的能源消耗：与能耗高的FCC和蒸汽裂解不同，PDH通常更加节能。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：传统方法难以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，而PDH有潜力弥补这一差距。

5. 工艺效率：与传统方法涉及的多步骤过程相比，PDH提供了一种更直接、更高效的从丙烷生产丙烯的路径。

6. 多用途性：通过PDH生产的丙烯可用于合成各种有价值的化学品，包括聚丙烯、丙烯酸和丙烯腈。

这些优势使PDH能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性（通过利用丰富的丙烷）、工艺效率（通过更直接的转化过程）和产品选择性（通过提供更高的丙烯选择性）方面面临的挑战。PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了更高效、更具选择性和更具经济可行性的解决方案，同时还能满足这种重要石化基础原料日益增长的全球需求。
