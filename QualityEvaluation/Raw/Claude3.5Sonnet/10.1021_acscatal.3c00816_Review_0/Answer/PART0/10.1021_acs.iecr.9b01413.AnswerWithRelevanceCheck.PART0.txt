          [1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene could be carried out in the presence or absence of oxidants. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with molecular oxygen involves an exothermic process, meaning that the reaction could be operated at a medium high temperature (normally <600 C). At the same time, the existence of oxygen in the feedstock is helpful to restrict the coke formation, but the drawbacks are also obvious because the activation of CH bonds in alkanes is difficult, and deep oxidation usually occurs, leading to the generation of thermodynamically stable products COx."

[2] "Up to date, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is still in the research stage. In such a background, the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes a more favorable method to produce propylene because of (i) simpler reactant and product distribution, (ii) less investment, and (iii) easier integration with present technology."

[3] "On the other hand, the recent boom in natural gas production including the exploitation of shale gas supplies abundant, economical, and steady sources of light alkanes like methane, ethane, and propane."

[4] "The conventional processes for propylene production including the steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha originate from the petrochemical industry. (4) However, the productivity is hard to meet the demand from the continuous growth of the propylene market."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Simpler reactant and product distribution: PDH involves a straightforward conversion of propane to propylene, without the complications of oxidative processes.

2. Lower investment costs: The simplicity of the PDH process translates to lower capital expenditure compared to alternative methods.

3. Easier integration with existing technology: PDH can be more readily incorporated into current petrochemical infrastructure.

4. Feedstock availability: The recent boom in natural gas production, including shale gas exploitation, provides abundant, economical, and steady sources of propane for PDH.

5. Process efficiency: Unlike oxidative dehydrogenation, PDH avoids the formation of unwanted COx byproducts that result from deep oxidation.

6. Improved selectivity: PDH offers better control over the reaction, leading to higher propylene selectivity compared to oxidative processes.

7. Meeting growing demand: PDH addresses the challenge of meeting the continuously growing demand for propylene, which conventional methods struggle to satisfy due to their limited productivity.

These advantages directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

- Feedstock availability: PDH leverages the increased availability of propane from natural gas sources, reducing dependence on traditional petroleum-based feedstocks.

- Process efficiency: By avoiding oxidative processes, PDH eliminates the energy-intensive step of oxygen separation and reduces the formation of unwanted byproducts.

- Product selectivity: The absence of oxidants in PDH allows for better control of the reaction, resulting in higher propylene yields and fewer side products.

Overall, PDH technology provides a more targeted, efficient, and economically viable solution for propylene production, making it better suited to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in the current market scenario.
