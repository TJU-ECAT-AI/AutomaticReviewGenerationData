          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

          [2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

      <English>
          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as feedstock, which is relatively abundant compared to the diminishing fossil fuel resources used in conventional methods like naphtha steam cracking.

          2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, producing propylene from propane in a single step. This can lead to improved efficiency compared to multi-step conventional processes.

          3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer by-products compared to conventional methods, resulting in higher propylene selectivity and purity.

          4. Meeting growing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet increasing propylene demand, PDH offers a scalable solution to bridge the supply gap.

          5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, potentially reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

          6. Sustainability: By using propane, a by-product of natural gas processing and oil refining, PDH helps in better resource utilization.

          These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of:

          - Feedstock availability: PDH uses more readily available propane, addressing the scarcity of traditional fossil fuel feedstocks.
          - Process efficiency: The direct conversion process of PDH offers improved efficiency over multi-step conventional methods.
          - Product selectivity: With fewer by-products, PDH provides higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional processes.

          Overall, PDH technology offers a more targeted, efficient, and potentially more sustainable approach to propylene production in the face of growing global demand.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法的主要优势包括：

          1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解所使用的日益减少的化石燃料资源，丙烷相对更加丰富。

          2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，在单一步骤中从丙烷生产丙烯。这可能比多步骤传统工艺带来更高的效率。

          3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH产生的副产品较少，从而提高了丙烯的选择性和纯度。

          4. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法难以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH提供了一个可扩展的解决方案来弥补供应缺口。

          5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，潜在地减少运输成本并提高供应链效率。

          6. 可持续性：通过使用天然气处理和石油精炼的副产品丙烷，PDH有助于更好地利用资源。

          这些优势解决了传统生产方法在以下方面面临的挑战：

          - 原料可用性：PDH使用更容易获得的丙烷，解决了传统化石燃料原料稀缺的问题。
          - 工艺效率：PDH的直接转化过程比多步骤传统方法提供了更高的效率。
          - 产品选择性：由于副产品较少，PDH比传统工艺提供了更高的丙烯选择性。

          总的来说，PDH技术在面对不断增长的全球需求时，提供了一种更有针对性、更高效、可能更可持续的丙烯生产方法。
