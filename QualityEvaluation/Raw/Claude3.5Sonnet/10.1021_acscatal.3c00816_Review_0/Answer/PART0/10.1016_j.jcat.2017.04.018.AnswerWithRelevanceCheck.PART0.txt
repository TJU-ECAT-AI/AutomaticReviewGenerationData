          [1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of abundant alkanes, as an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, has attracted great attention recently."

          [2] "Due to the detrimental effect of Cr2O3-based catalyst and high cost of Pt-based catalyst, the exploration of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost is still one of the urgent issues."

          [3] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

          [4] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

          While the provided literature does not directly address all aspects of the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in the context of global propylene demand, it offers insights into potential benefits:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane, described as an "abundant alkane," addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

          2. Process efficiency: The Sn-HMS catalyst developed for propane dehydrogenation shows high propane conversion (40%) and good stability for up to 170 hours, indicating efficient and stable process.

          3. Product selectivity: The focus on developing catalysts for propane dehydrogenation suggests good selectivity for propylene production.

          4. Cost-effectiveness: The research aims to develop a "novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost," addressing the issue of expensive Pt-based catalysts currently used in industry.

          5. Environmental considerations: The pursuit of non-toxic catalysts like Sn-HMS addresses environmental concerns associated with conventional Cr2O3-based catalysts.

          While not directly comparing PDH to other propylene production methods, the text suggests that PDH technology, particularly with improved catalysts, can address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and potentially product selectivity, while also considering cost and environmental factors.

          虽然提供的文献并未直接回答丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在全球丙烯需求背景下的所有优势方面，但它提供了一些潜在好处的见解：

          1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，文中描述为"丰富的烷烃"，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

          2. 工艺效率：为丙烷脱氢开发的Sn-HMS催化剂显示出40%的高丙烷转化率，并在长达170小时内保持良好的稳定性，表明这是一个高效且稳定的过程。

          3. 产品选择性：对开发丙烷脱氢催化剂的关注表明，这种方法可能为丙烯生产提供良好的选择性。

          4. 成本效益：研究旨在开发"新型无毒低成本脱氢催化剂"，解决了目前工业上使用昂贵的铂基催化剂的问题。

          5. 环境考虑：对Sn-HMS等无毒催化剂的追求解决了与传统Cr2O3基催化剂相关的环境问题。

          虽然文本没有直接将PDH与其他丙烯生产方法进行比较，但它表明PDH技术，特别是在改进的催化剂的帮助下，可以解决原料可用性、工艺效率，可能还有产品选择性方面的挑战，同时也考虑了成本和环境因素。
