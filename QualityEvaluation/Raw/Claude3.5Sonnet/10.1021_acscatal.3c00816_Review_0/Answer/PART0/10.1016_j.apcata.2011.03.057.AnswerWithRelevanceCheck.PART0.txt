          [1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

          [2] "Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 1 bar and 600 C."

          [3] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."

          [4] "The primary production method of propylene in the petrochemical industry is naphtha cracking, wherein ethylene is co-produced. The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

          1. Addresses supply shortfall: PDH directly targets the growing demand for propylene that outpaces ethylene demand and cannot be met by traditional steam cracking methods.

          2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in conventional cracking.

          3. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route for propylene production compared to steam cracking, which produces multiple products.

          4. Improved selectivity: The use of catalysts like PtSn improves selectivity towards propylene. PDH offers higher propylene selectivity compared to naphtha cracking, where propylene is a co-product.

          5. Tailored production: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, unlike steam cracking which co-produces ethylene. This enables producers to adjust output based on market demand.

          6. Mild operating conditions: The process can be carried out at relatively low pressure (1 bar) and moderate temperature (600°C), potentially offering energy efficiency benefits.

          7. Independence from oil refining: Unlike steam cracking, PDH is not tied to oil refining processes, allowing for more flexibility in production.

          8. Catalyst innovations: Ongoing research into catalysts like PtSn/ZnAl2O4 is improving stability and reducing coke formation, addressing key challenges in the PDH process.

          These advantages make PDH technology well-suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, making it a promising solution for meeting the growing global propylene demand.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法：

          1. 解决供应短缺：PDH直接针对超过乙烯需求增长且传统蒸汽裂解方法无法满足的丙烯需求。

          2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统裂解所用的石脑油更容易获得。

          3. 工艺效率：与生产多种产品的蒸汽裂解相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。

          4. 提高选择性：使用PtSn等催化剂可以提高对丙烯的选择性。与石脑油裂解相比，PDH提供更高的丙烯选择性，在石脑油裂解中丙烯只是副产品。

          5. 定制生产：PDH允许专门生产丙烯，不像蒸汽裂解会同时生产乙烯。这使生产商能够根据市场需求调整产量。

          6. 温和的操作条件：该过程可以在相对较低的压力（1巴）和适中的温度（600°C）下进行，可能提供能源效率方面的优势。

          7. 独立于石油炼制：与蒸汽裂解不同，PDH不依赖于石油炼制过程，允许更灵活的生产。

          8. 催化剂创新：对PtSn/ZnAl2O4等催化剂的持续研究正在提高稳定性并减少积碳形成，解决了PDH过程中的关键挑战。

          这些优势使PDH技术非常适合解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使其成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的一个有前景的解决方案。
