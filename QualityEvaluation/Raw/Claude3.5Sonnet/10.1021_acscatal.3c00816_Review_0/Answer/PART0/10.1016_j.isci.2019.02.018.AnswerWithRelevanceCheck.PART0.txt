          [1] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive reaction from both an industrial and a scientific viewpoint because it allows direct large-scale production of propene and fundamental analysis of C-H activation respectively."

          [2] "The main challenges are related to achieving high activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability of environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals."

          [3] "Propene selectivity of about 90% at 44.4% propane conversion was achieved at 600C after nearly 6 h on stream."

          The literature provides some insights into the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, although it does not fully address all aspects of the question or provide a comprehensive comparison with conventional production methods. Based on the available information:

          1. Large-scale production: PDH allows for direct large-scale production of propene, which is advantageous for meeting growing global demand.

          2. High selectivity: The technology demonstrates high selectivity, with the study reporting about 90% propene selectivity at 44.4% propane conversion.

          3. Process efficiency: PDH can achieve high activity and on-stream stability, as demonstrated by the performance after 6 hours on stream.

          4. Cost-effectiveness: The technology uses environment-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts without non-noble metals, potentially lowering production costs compared to methods requiring more expensive catalysts.

          5. Scientific value: PDH enables fundamental analysis of C-H activation, which is valuable from a scientific perspective.

          However, the literature does not provide specific information on how PDH compares to conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability or detailed efficiency metrics. More comprehensive data would be needed to fully assess PDH's advantages in these areas.

          文献对丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的优势提供了一些见解，尽管它没有全面回答问题的所有方面，也没有与传统生产方法进行全面比较。根据可用信息：

          1. 大规模生产：PDH允许直接大规模生产丙烯，这有利于满足不断增长的全球需求。

          2. 高选择性：该技术表现出高选择性，研究报告在44.4%的丙烷转化率下达到约90%的丙烯选择性。

          3. 过程效率：PDH可以实现高活性和在线稳定性，如在流程中6小时后的表现所示。

          4. 成本效益：该技术使用环境友好和成本效益高的非贵金属催化剂，与需要更昂贵催化剂的方法相比，可能降低生产成本。

          5. 科学价值：PDH能够对C-H活化进行基础分析，从科学角度来看具有价值。

          然而，文献并未提供有关PDH在原料可用性或详细效率指标方面如何与传统方法相比的具体信息。需要更全面的数据来充分评估PDH在这些领域的优势。
