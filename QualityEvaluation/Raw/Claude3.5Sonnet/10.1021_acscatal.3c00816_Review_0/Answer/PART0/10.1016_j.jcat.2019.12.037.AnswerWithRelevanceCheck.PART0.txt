          [1] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."

[2] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation"

[3] "Thus, it is still urgent and challenging to design a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene."

[4] "Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction"

[5] "Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH"

          PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is low-priced and abundant, as a feedstock. This addresses the challenge of depleting oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, upgrading propane to the more valuable propylene. This offers improved efficiency compared to traditional methods that may require multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: While some alternative catalysts achieved lower propylene selectivity, efforts are being made to develop catalysts with high selectivity. This suggests that PDH technology has the potential for excellent product selectivity when optimized.

4. Environmental considerations: Conventional CrOx and Pt catalysts suffer from "environmental hostility." PDH technology using alternative catalysts could potentially offer a more environmentally friendly approach.

5. Economic benefits: By converting low-priced propane to higher-value propylene, PDH offers economic advantages over methods that rely on more expensive feedstocks.

PDH specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. It reduces dependence on oil-based feedstocks, which are becoming increasingly scarce.
2. It offers a more direct and potentially more efficient route to propylene production.
3. It provides opportunities for developing catalysts with improved selectivity and longevity.

However, challenges remain in developing catalysts that are simultaneously green, low-cost, highly reactive, and selective for propylene production. Current industrial PDH catalysts (CrOx and Pt) face issues such as high costs, environmental problems, and rapid deactivation. Ongoing research aims to address these challenges and further improve PDH technology.

          PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用价格低廉且丰富的丙烷作为原料。这解决了传统生产方法面临的石油资源枯竭问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，将丙烷升级为更有价值的丙烯。与可能需要多个步骤或复杂分离的传统方法相比，这提供了更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：虽然一些替代催化剂的丙烯选择性较低，但正在努力开发高选择性催化剂。这表明PDH技术在优化后具有出色的产品选择性潜力。

4. 环境考虑：传统的CrOx和Pt催化剂存在"环境敌意"问题。使用替代催化剂的PDH技术可能提供更环保的方法。

5. 经济效益：通过将低价丙烷转化为高价值丙烯，PDH比依赖更昂贵原料的方法提供了经济优势。

PDH具体解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 减少对日益稀缺的石油基原料的依赖。
2. 提供了一种更直接、可能更高效的丙烯生产路线。
3. 为开发具有改进的选择性和寿命的催化剂提供了机会。

然而，在开发同时具有绿色、低成本、高反应性和选择性的丙烯生产催化剂方面仍然存在挑战。当前工业用PDH催化剂（CrOx和Pt）面临着高成本、环境问题和快速失活等挑战。持续的研究旨在解决这些挑战并进一步改进PDH技术。
