          [1] "Propylene is a basic building block that has been widely utilized for developing polypropylene, acetone and propylene oxide in industrial applications. However, the demand for propylene was far from meeting the amount of around 116000000 tons in 2020."

[2] "Taking into account the cost of the technical process and environmental effects, the propane to propylene process is often regarded as the most promising pathway with high-valued target products."

[3] "Furthermore, with advancements in the hydraulic fracturing technology, the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane were further promoted through the extraction of Earth-abundant shale gas, thus urging strengthening of the conversion and utilization of low-valued propane."

[4] "The reaction equation (C3H8  C3H6 + H2) reveals its economic efficiency with the generation of high-valued products by using only propane reactants."

[5] "PDH is a typical highly endothermic reaction process, which requires an elevated temperature to realize a reasonable propane conversion (ΔHθ298K = 124 KJ mol1)."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH generates high-value propylene using only propane as a reactant, maximizing the value extraction from the feedstock. The simple reaction equation (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2) demonstrates its economic efficiency.

2. Feedstock availability: The advancement of hydraulic fracturing technology has increased the availability of low-cost propane from shale gas, providing abundant feedstock for PDH.

3. Process selectivity: Unlike conventional methods, PDH is a direct conversion process, offering higher selectivity towards propylene production.

4. Environmental considerations: Compared to other processes, PDH has a lower environmental impact, making it more sustainable.

5. Market demand alignment: PDH helps address the significant gap between propylene demand and supply, with global demand reaching around 116 million tons in 2020.

6. Technological simplicity: The straightforward reaction allows for easier process control and optimization.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of:

- Feedstock availability: Utilizing more abundant and low-cost propane from shale gas.
- Process efficiency: Offering a direct, selective conversion of propane to propylene.
- Product selectivity: Providing higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional cracking methods.

However, it's worth noting that PDH is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures, which presents its own set of challenges in terms of energy efficiency and catalyst stability.
