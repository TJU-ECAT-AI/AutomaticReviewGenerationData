          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention"
          [2] "Dehydrogenation of low-cost hydrocarbons to corresponding value-added olefins makes this route more economic dominance"
          [3] "Since the traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention"
          [4] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield"
          [5] "Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts."
          [6] "As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid etc."
          [7] "At present, the effective routes for producing propene mainly contain steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes low-cost propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha used in steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

          2. Economic efficiency: The use of low-cost hydrocarbons (propane) to produce higher-value olefins (propylene) provides economic advantages over conventional methods.

          3. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene, involving fewer steps compared to traditional methods.

          4. Product selectivity: PDH offers higher selectivity towards propylene production, potentially resulting in higher yields and purity of the desired product.

          5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built on a smaller scale and closer to end-users, providing more flexibility in production and distribution.

          6. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology helps address the increasing global demand for propylene that traditional production methods are struggling to meet.

          However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

          1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high temperatures to achieve considerable propylene yields.

          2. Equilibrium limitations: Lower pressure conditions are needed to overcome equilibrium limitations and achieve higher yields.

          3. Catalyst deactivation: The demanding conditions can lead to side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in catalyst deactivation.

          Ongoing research focuses on developing better catalysts, optimizing reaction conditions, and improving process designs to address these challenges and further enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

          1. 原料可用性：PDH利用低成本的丙烷作为原料，与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解所使用的石脑油等传统原料相比，丙烷更容易获得。

          2. 经济效率：使用低成本的碳氢化合物（丙烷）生产高附加值的烯烃（丙烯）比传统方法具有经济优势。

          3. 工艺效率：PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线，与传统方法相比，涉及的步骤更少。

          4. 产品选择性：PDH提供了更高的丙烯生产选择性，可能会带来更高的目标产品产率和纯度。

          5. 灵活性：PDH装置可以建造得更小，更靠近终端用户，从而在生产和分配方面提供更大的灵活性。

          6. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术有助于满足传统生产方法难以满足的全球不断增长的丙烯需求。

          然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

          1. 高能耗要求：该过程是高度吸热的，需要高温才能实现可观的丙烯产率。

          2. 平衡限制：需要较低的压力条件来克服平衡限制并获得更高的产率。

          3. 催化剂失活：苛刻的条件可能导致副反应，如裂解和焦炭沉积，导致催化剂失活。

          目前的研究重点是开发更好的催化剂、优化反应条件和改进工艺设计，以解决这些挑战并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和选择性。
