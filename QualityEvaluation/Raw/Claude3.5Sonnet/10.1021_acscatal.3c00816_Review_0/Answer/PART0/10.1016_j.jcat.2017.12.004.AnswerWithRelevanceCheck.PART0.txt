          [1] "Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives"

[2] "Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used"

[3] "Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts"

[4] "DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, providing a dedicated process for its production.

2. PDH utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks used in other methods.

3. The process offers higher selectivity towards propylene compared to conventional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. PDH technology has already been commercialized, demonstrating its viability for industrial use.

5. It provides better process efficiency as it's a single-step conversion from propane to propylene, unlike steam cracking which produces multiple products.

6. Non-oxidative PDH avoids the thermodynamic equilibrium limitations present in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, potentially leading to higher yields.

7. Current research focuses on developing novel catalysts (like V-, Ga-, and Sn-based) to overcome the limitations of traditional Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, potentially improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact.

8. PDH offers more flexibility in production capacity, as plants can be scaled more easily than large steam crackers.

9. It addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is often a byproduct of other processes or available from shale gas processing.

These advantages collectively make PDH a versatile and potentially more sustainable option for meeting the growing propylene demand, especially in regions with abundant propane resources. It specifically addresses challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 它直接满足了丙烯不断增长的需求，提供了一种专门的生产过程。

2. PDH使用丙烷作为原料，与其他方法使用的传统原料相比，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 与传统方法（如蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解）相比，该过程对丙烯的选择性更高。

4. PDH技术已经在商业应用中实现，证明了其工业应用的可行性。

5. 它提供了更好的工艺效率，因为它是从丙烷到丙烯的单步转化过程，不像蒸汽裂解那样产生多种产品。

6. 非氧化PDH避免了氧化脱氢工艺中存在的热力学平衡限制，可能导致更高的产率。

7. 目前的研究集中在开发新型催化剂（如基于V、Ga和Sn的催化剂）上，以克服传统Pt和Cr基催化剂的局限性，潜在地提高效率并减少环境影响。

8. PDH在生产能力方面提供了更大的灵活性，因为工厂比大型蒸汽裂解装置更容易调整规模。

9. 它通过利用丙烷（通常是其他过程的副产品或来自页岩气加工）解决了原料供应的挑战。

这些优势共同使PDH成为一种versatile和潜在更可持续的选择，以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，特别是在丙烷资源丰富的地区。它具体解决了传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
