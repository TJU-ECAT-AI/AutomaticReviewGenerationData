          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes, to produce this industrially important platform chemical"
          [2] "The commercial PDH technologies utilizing Cr-containing (refs. 3,4) or Pt-containing (refs. 5,6,7,8) catalysts suffer from the toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds or the need to use ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration"
          [3] "Here, we introduce a method for preparation of environmentally compatible supported catalysts based on commercial ZnO."
          [4] "The developed catalyst reveals about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity."

          While the literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, we can infer some advantages based on the information provided:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH is presented as an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for propene production, suggesting it may address feedstock availability issues associated with oil-based methods. PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which can be an advantage in regions where propane is more readily available than oil-based feedstocks.

          2. Process efficiency: The newly developed ZnO-based catalyst demonstrates about three times higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity compared to existing catalysts, indicating improved process efficiency.

          3. Environmental compatibility: The research introduces a new environmentally compatible catalyst based on commercial ZnO, which addresses the environmental concerns associated with current commercial PDH technologies that use toxic Cr(VI) compounds or require ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration.

          4. Product selectivity: While not explicitly stated, the new catalyst maintains similar propene selectivity while significantly improving productivity, suggesting that PDH technology can maintain high product selectivity while addressing efficiency challenges.

          Although the text doesn't comprehensively compare PDH to all conventional production methods, it highlights improvements in environmental compatibility, feedstock flexibility, and process efficiency, which are likely key factors in making PDH a promising method for propylene production.

          虽然文献并未直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的主要优势的所有方面，但根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断出PDH技术的一些优势：

          1. 原料可用性：PDH被描述为生产丙烯的一种重要的替代油基裂解工艺，这表明它可能解决了与油基方法相关的原料供应问题。PDH使用丙烷作为原料，在丙烷比油基原料更容易获得的地区可能是一个优势。

          2. 工艺效率：新开发的基于ZnO的催化剂在保持类似丙烯选择性的同时，展现出约三倍于现有催化剂的丙烯生产力，表明工艺效率得到了提高。

          3. 环境兼容性：该研究介绍了一种基于商业ZnO的新型环境兼容催化剂，解决了当前商业PDH技术使用有毒Cr(VI)化合物或需要使用生态有害氯进行催化剂再生的环境问题。

          4. 产品选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但新催化剂在显著提高生产力的同时保持了类似的丙烯选择性，这表明PDH技术可以在解决效率挑战的同时保持高产品选择性。

          尽管文本没有全面比较PDH与所有传统生产方法，但它强调了环境兼容性、原料灵活性和工艺效率的改进，这可能是使PDH成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法的关键因素。
