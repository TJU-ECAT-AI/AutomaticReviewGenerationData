          [1] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene"

[2] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit"

[3] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers"

[4] "However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas"

[5] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance, causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes"

[6] "Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition"

[7] "Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process"

[8] "On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d), but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl"

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are:

1. Efficiency: PDH is considered the most efficient process among emerging methods for meeting the large demand for propylene.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha crackers, especially with the increased production of ethane from natural gas and shale gas.

3. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the imbalance created by the shift towards ethane cracking for ethylene production.

4. Selectivity: While not explicitly stated, PDH typically offers higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional cracking methods.

5. Flexibility: PDH provides a dedicated route for propylene production, allowing producers to adjust output based on market demand.

PDH addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: It utilizes propane, which is more readily available due to increased natural gas and shale gas production.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is more efficient for propylene production compared to traditional naphtha cracking or other emerging methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH focuses specifically on propylene production, allowing for better control of the product slate compared to less selective processes like naphtha cracking.

However, PDH also faces some challenges:

1. High temperature requirements: The process needs to operate at high temperatures (773 K or higher) to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Current catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 suffer from rapid deactivation and require frequent regeneration.

3. Environmental and safety concerns: Some catalyst regeneration processes involve toxic and corrosive materials.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research in catalyst development aims to improve PDH technology and address these issues, further cementing its position as a promising method for propylene production.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法的主要优势包括：

1. 效率：PDH被认为是新兴方法中满足大量丙烯需求的最高效过程。

2. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石脑油裂解，丙烷更容易获得，特别是随着天然气和页岩气中乙烷产量的增加。

3. 定向生产：PDH允许针对性地生产丙烯，解决了由于转向乙烷裂解生产乙烯而造成的不平衡。

4. 选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但PDH通常比传统裂解方法提供更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 灵活性：PDH为丙烯生产提供了一条专门的路线，允许生产商根据市场需求调整产量。

PDH通过以下方式解决传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：它利用丙烷，由于天然气和页岩气产量的增加，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 工艺效率：与传统的石脑油裂解或其他新兴方法相比，PDH在丙烯生产方面更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：PDH专注于丙烯生产，与石脑油裂解等选择性较低的工艺相比，可以更好地控制产品组合。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 高温要求：该工艺需要在高温（773 K或更高）下运行以克服热力学限制。

2. 催化剂失活：当前的催化剂如CrOx/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3会快速失活，需要频繁再生。

3. 环境和安全问题：一些催化剂再生过程涉及有毒和腐蚀性材料。

尽管存在这些挑战，但正在进行的催化剂开发研究旨在改进PDH技术并解决这些问题，进一步巩固其作为有前景的丙烯生产方法的地位。
