          [1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[3] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability, which makes the process not only complex but also expensive."

[4] "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production to address supply shortfalls from conventional crackers like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha or ethane used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH can potentially offer higher efficiency compared to cracking methods that produce multiple products.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is more selective towards propylene production compared to cracking processes.

5. Scalability: PDH units can be built at various scales to meet specific market demands.

6. Independence from refinery operations: Unlike FCC, PDH is not tied to refinery operations, allowing for more flexible production.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and coking issues:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Coking leads to catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration.

2. Complexity and cost: The need for catalyst regeneration adds complexity and cost to the process.

3. Selectivity issues: Cracking reactions can still occur, affecting product selectivity.

Ongoing research aims to improve catalyst performance, process efficiency, and address these challenges to further enhance the advantages of PDH technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许针对性地生产丙烯，以解决传统裂解方法（如流化催化裂化FCC）的供应短缺问题。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油或乙烷更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH可能比生产多种产品的裂解方法提供更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：与裂解工艺相比，PDH对丙烯生产的选择性更高。

5. 可扩展性：PDH装置可以按不同规模建造，以满足特定的市场需求。

6. 独立于炼油厂操作：与FCC不同，PDH不依赖于炼油厂的操作，允许更灵活的生产。

然而，PDH技术仍面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性和结焦问题方面：

1. 催化剂失活：结焦导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。

2. 复杂性和成本：催化剂再生的需求增加了工艺的复杂性和成本。

3. 选择性问题：裂解反应仍可能发生，影响产品选择性。

持续的研究旨在改进催化剂性能、提高工艺效率，并解决这些挑战，以进一步增强PDH技术在满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求方面的优势。
