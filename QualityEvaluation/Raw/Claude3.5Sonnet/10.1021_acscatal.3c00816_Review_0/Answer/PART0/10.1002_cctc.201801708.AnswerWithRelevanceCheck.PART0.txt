          [1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."

[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundantly available compared to the depleting petroleum resources used in traditional production methods. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). It allows for better control of the reaction and potentially higher yields.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods, which often produce a mixture of products. With proper catalyst design and reaction conditions, PDH can minimize unwanted side reactions and maximize propylene yield.

4. Economic advantage: There is a significant price gap between propane (feedstock) and propylene (product), making PDH economically attractive and potentially offering better profit margins.

5. Meeting growing demand: As traditional methods struggle to meet the increasing global demand for propylene due to petroleum depletion, PDH technology provides a scalable solution to bridge the supply gap.

6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages and improving supply chain efficiency.

7. Reduced dependence on petroleum: By using propane instead of naphtha or other petroleum-derived feedstocks, PDH helps diversify propylene production sources and reduces reliance on crude oil.

These advantages collectively make PDH a promising technology to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统生产方法所使用的日益枯竭的石油资源，丙烷更加丰富。这解决了传统方法面临的原料稀缺挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。它允许更好地控制反应并可能获得更高的产率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性，而传统方法通常会产生混合产品。通过适当的催化剂设计和反应条件，PDH可以最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，最大化丙烯产率。

4. 经济优势：丙烷（原料）和丙烯（产品）之间存在显著的价格差距，使PDH在经济上具有吸引力，可能提供更好的利润空间。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法由于石油枯竭而难以满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH技术提供了一种可扩展的解决方案来弥补供应缺口。

6. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，提供物流优势并提高供应链效率。

7. 减少对石油的依赖：通过使用丙烷而不是石脑油或其他石油衍生的原料，PDH有助于多样化丙烯生产来源，减少对原油的依赖。

这些优势共同使PDH成为一种有前途的技术，可以解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
