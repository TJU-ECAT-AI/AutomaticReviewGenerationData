          [1] "Propylene has a great commercial value in industrial production of different kinds of chemicals and raw materials, such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, etc. Its steadily increasing demand requires further capacity expansion through efficient production processes not limited to the conventional fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha."

[2] "Benefited from the mass exploitation of shale gas resource, catalytically nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been recently developed as an available complement to produce propylene"

[3] "For propane dehydrogenation (PDH), two main groups of commercial catalysts have been applied, including PtSn/Al2O3- and CrOx/Al2O3-based catalysts from Oleflex and Catofin craft, respectively"

[4] "However, considering of their existing drawbacks, i.e., high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life, it is necessary to screen the alternative catalysts with rationally designed structure and satisfactory performance"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from abundant shale gas resources, addressing the limitations of conventional naphtha-based processes and providing a more cost-effective feedstock.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct, non-oxidative catalytic process, PDH offers improved efficiency compared to traditional methods like fluid catalytic cracking or steam cracking of naphtha.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology allows for higher propylene selectivity, potentially reducing unwanted byproducts and improving overall yield.

4. Capacity expansion: PDH provides an efficient way to expand propylene production capacity, helping to meet the steadily increasing global demand for this valuable chemical feedstock.

5. Complementary production: PDH serves as a valuable complement to existing propylene production methods, diversifying the supply chain and offering production flexibility.

6. Potential for improved catalysts: Current research focuses on developing alternative catalysts with better performance, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact compared to existing commercial catalysts (PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3) which face challenges such as high cost, high toxicity, and low cycling life.

These advantages position PDH as a promising solution to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, while meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用来自丰富的页岩气资源的丙烷，解决了传统石脑油基工艺的局限性，并提供了更具成本效益的原料。

2. 工艺效率：作为一种直接的、非氧化催化过程，PDH比传统方法（如流化催化裂化或石脑油蒸汽裂解）提供了更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术允许更高的丙烯选择性，可能减少不需要的副产品并提高整体产率。

4. 产能扩张：PDH提供了一种高效的方式来扩大丙烯生产能力，有助于满足这种有价值的化学原料不断增长的全球需求。

5. 互补生产：PDH作为现有丙烯生产方法的有价值补充，使供应链多样化并提供生产灵活性。

6. 改进催化剂的潜力：当前的研究集中在开发性能更好、成本更低、环境影响更小的替代催化剂，以解决现有商业催化剂（PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3）面临的高成本、高毒性和低循环寿命等挑战。

这些优势使PDH成为一个有前景的解决方案，可以解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，同时满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求。
