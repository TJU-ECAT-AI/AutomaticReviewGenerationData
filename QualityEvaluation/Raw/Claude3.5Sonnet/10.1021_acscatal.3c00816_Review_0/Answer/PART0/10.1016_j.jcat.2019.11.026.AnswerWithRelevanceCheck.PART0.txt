          [1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein"

          [2] "The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

          [3] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst"

          [4] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."

          [5] "Development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts (e.g., Ga-, Zn- or Sn-based candidates) remains as an important catalytic challenge"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes abundant propane reserves from shale gas deposits, addressing the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional production methods.

          2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to traditional multi-step processes or methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

          3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene, which is crucial given the increasing global demand for this specific product.

          4. Economic viability: While current commercial PDH processes use expensive Pt-based or toxic Cr-based catalysts, ongoing research aims to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, potentially improving the economic viability of the process.

          5. Flexibility: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, providing flexibility to adjust production based on market demands.

          6. Growing demand: PDH directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene, which is used in manufacturing various important products.

          These advantages position PDH as a promising solution to address challenges in propylene production, including feedstock limitations, process inefficiencies, and environmental concerns associated with conventional methods. However, challenges remain in catalyst development to overcome the limitations of current commercial catalysts and further improve the process efficiency and sustainability.
