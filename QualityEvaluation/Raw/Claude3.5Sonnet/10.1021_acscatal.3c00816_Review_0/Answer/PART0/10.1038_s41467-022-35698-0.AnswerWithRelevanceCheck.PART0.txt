          [1] "With the growing demand for propylene and the explosion of the shale gas revolution, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has become more commercially attractive, which exhibits significant environmental and energy implications."

          [2] "However, commercial PDH processes using high cost of PtSn/Al2O3 and high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have restricted their further developments."

          [3] "Recently, the well-defined and highly dispersed sites of Fe, Ga, Zn, Co and Y, obtained via grafting tailored metal precursors within hydroxyl on the silica supports, have shown the capability to break C-H bonds of alkanes."

          [4] "Among these catalysts, highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)) have gained much interest, due to its superior PDH catalytic potential."

          [5] "The as-synthesized catalyst is attempted to the propane dehydrogenation, which shows better reactivity when compared with other reported Co based catalysts."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes abundant propane from the shale gas revolution, addressing feedstock challenges faced by conventional methods.

          2. Commercial attractiveness: Growing propylene demand and shale gas revolution have made PDH more economically viable.

          3. Environmental benefits: PDH exhibits significant environmental implications compared to traditional methods.

          4. Energy efficiency: The process is more energy-efficient, contributing to its commercial attractiveness.

          5. Improved catalysts: Development of highly dispersed metal catalysts, particularly tetrahedral Co(II) sites, has shown superior catalytic potential for PDH, improving process efficiency and selectivity.

          6. Cost-effectiveness: PDH addresses the high costs associated with conventional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3.

          7. Reduced toxicity: It offers an alternative to highly toxic catalysts such as Cr/Al2O3 used in some commercial processes.

          PDH specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods by:

          1. Utilizing more readily available propane feedstock from shale gas.
          2. Offering a more environmentally friendly process.
          3. Potentially lowering costs compared to expensive platinum-based catalysts.
          4. Improving selectivity towards propylene with newer catalyst formulations.
          5. Providing a more efficient, direct route for propylene production to meet growing demand.
