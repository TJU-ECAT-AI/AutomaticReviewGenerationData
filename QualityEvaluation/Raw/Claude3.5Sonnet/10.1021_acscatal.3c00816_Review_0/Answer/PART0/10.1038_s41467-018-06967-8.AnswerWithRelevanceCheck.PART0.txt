          [1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

          [2] "Herein, we describe an approach to breaking the scaling relationship for propane dehydrogenation, an industrially important reaction, by assembling single atom alloys (SAAs), to achieve simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion."

          [3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

          1. Breaking the scaling relationship: PDH using single atom alloys (SAAs) can simultaneously enhance propylene selectivity and propane conversion, overcoming the trade-off between activity and selectivity faced by conventional catalysts.

          2. High selectivity and conversion: SAA catalysts, particularly Pt/Cu SAA, can achieve high propylene selectivity while maintaining good conversion rates.

          3. Excellent stability at high temperatures: Pt/Cu SAA catalysts demonstrate exceptional stability, operating for over 120 hours at high temperatures (520°C) under atmospheric pressure. This is a significant improvement over previous SAA applications that were limited to lower temperatures.

          4. Improved efficiency: By breaking the scaling relationship, PDH technology addresses the challenge of side reactions that typically reduce selectivity in conventional methods.

          5. Process simplification: Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a simpler process compared to conventional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

          6. Cost-effectiveness: The use of single atom alloys with a low platinum loading (0.1wt%) on copper nanoparticles suggests a potentially more cost-effective catalyst compared to traditional platinum-based catalysts.

          These advantages directly address the challenges of feedstock utilization efficiency, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, making PDH with SAA catalysts a promising technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

          1. 打破尺度关系：使用单原子合金（SAAs）的PDH可以同时提高丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率，克服了传统催化剂在活性和选择性之间的权衡。

          2. 高选择性和转化率：SAA催化剂，特别是Pt/Cu SAA，可以在保持良好转化率的同时实现高丙烯选择性。

          3. 高温下的优异稳定性：Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出卓越的稳定性，在大气压下高温（520°C）运行超过120小时。这比之前仅限于低温应用的SAA有了显著改进。

          4. 提高效率：通过打破尺度关系，PDH技术解决了传统方法中通常会降低选择性的副反应问题。

          5. 过程简化：与传统方法（如蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解）相比，丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯是一个更简单的过程。

          6. 成本效益：使用低铂载量（0.1wt%）的单原子合金在铜纳米粒子上，表明与传统的铂基催化剂相比，可能具有更高的成本效益。

          这些优势直接解决了传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料利用效率、过程效率和产品选择性的挑战，使得采用SAA催化剂的PDH技术成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的有前景的技术。
