          [1] "Isomorphously substituted iron-silicate zeolites were prepared and their catalytic properties for the monomolecular propane reaction were investigated."

          [2] "The iron-silicate zeolites exhibited nearly 20 times higher dehydrogenation rates than cracking rates while H-[Al]ZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio (26) showed low dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenationto-cracking ratio 0.36)."

          [3] "The activation energy for H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is also lower than the activation energy for H-[Al]ZSM-5."

          [4] "Conversion of propane resulted in a high selectivity to propene on H-[Fe] zeolites with lower activation energies when compared to H-[Al] zeolites."

          [5] "A redox catalytic cycle is suggested for the hydrocarbon reaction over isolated Fe framework sites in [Fe] zeolites via the formation of propane radical cations since a protolytic mechanism seems to be unable to explain the observed differences in activation energy and selectivity."

          [6] "The viability of [Fe] zeolite for dehydrogenation of propane was examined and compared to chromia catalysts."

          While the literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or comprehensively compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to conventional production methods, it provides insights into the advantages of using iron-silicate zeolites for propane dehydrogenation:

          1. Higher selectivity: Iron-silicate zeolites show significantly higher dehydrogenation rates compared to cracking rates, with nearly 20 times higher selectivity for dehydrogenation than aluminum-containing zeolites. This suggests better selectivity for propylene production.

          2. Lower activation energy: H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has a lower activation energy than H-[Al]ZSM-5, potentially indicating improved process efficiency and more energy-efficient processes.

          3. High propene selectivity: The conversion of propane over iron-silicate zeolites results in high selectivity to propene, which is the desired product in PDH.

          4. Novel reaction mechanism: A redox catalytic cycle is proposed for the reaction over iron sites, which may offer advantages over the traditional protolytic mechanism in terms of selectivity and energy requirements.

          5. Potential alternative to chromia catalysts: The study compares [Fe] zeolites to chromia catalysts, suggesting they may be a viable alternative for propane dehydrogenation.

          These properties suggest that iron-silicate zeolites could potentially address challenges in propylene production by improving selectivity and efficiency. However, the document does not provide information on feedstock availability or direct comparisons to conventional production methods on a global scale.

          虽然该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或全面比较丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）与传统生产方法，但它提供了关于使用铁硅酸盐沸石进行丙烷脱氢的优势的见解：

          1. 更高的选择性：铁硅酸盐沸石显示出显著更高的脱氢率相比于裂解率，其脱氢选择性几乎是铝含量沸石的20倍。这表明对丙烯生产有更好的选择性。

          2. 更低的活化能：H-[Fe]ZSM-5比H-[Al]ZSM-5具有更低的活化能，可能表明过程效率得到改善，并且可能实现更高能效的过程。

          3. 高丙烯选择性：在铁硅酸盐沸石上进行丙烷转化可获得高选择性的丙烯，这是PDH过程中所需的产物。

          4. 新型反应机制：对铁位点上的反应提出了一种氧化还原催化循环机制，这可能在选择性和能量需求方面比传统的质子化机制具有优势。

          5. 铬催化剂的潜在替代品：该研究将[Fe]沸石与铬催化剂进行了比较，表明它们可能是丙烷脱氢的可行替代品。

          这些特性表明，铁硅酸盐沸石可能通过提高选择性和效率来解决丙烯生产中的挑战。然而，该文件并未提供关于原料可用性的信息，也未在全球范围内与传统生产方法进行直接比较。
