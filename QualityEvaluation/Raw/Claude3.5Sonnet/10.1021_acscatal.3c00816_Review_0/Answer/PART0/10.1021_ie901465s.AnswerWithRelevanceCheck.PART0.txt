          [1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products. The propylene market demand reached the average annual growth rate of 56%."

          [2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes. Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."

          [3] "It is the era of highly selective catalysts for olefins production in the petrochemical industries. Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

          1. Feedstock availability: Propane is cheap and readily available as a byproduct of various petrochemical processes. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional production methods.

          2. Cost-effectiveness: PDH technology does not require large investments, as existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted. This makes it an economically attractive option compared to building new, dedicated propylene production plants.

          3. Process efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is a more straightforward and efficient process compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce propylene as a byproduct.

          4. Product selectivity: The development of highly selective catalysts, such as PtSn/SAPO-34, has significantly improved the selectivity of propylene production in PDH processes. This addresses the challenge of low propylene yields in conventional methods.

          5. Market responsiveness: With propylene demand growing at an annual rate of 5-6%, PDH technology allows for more flexible and targeted propylene production to meet this increasing demand.

          6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be designed to produce propylene as the primary product, allowing for better control over production volumes and market responsiveness. They can also be built closer to end-users, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

          These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, while meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

          1. 原料可用性：丙烷作为各种石化过程的副产品，价格低廉且易于获得。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料稀缺问题。

          2. 成本效益：PDH技术不需要大量投资，因为现有生产设施可以以较低成本进行改造。与建设新的传统方法设施相比，这是一个经济上更具吸引力的选择。

          3. 工艺效率：丙烷直接转化为丙烯是一个更直接、更高效的过程，相比之下，传统方法涉及多个步骤或复杂的分离过程。

          4. 产品选择性：高选择性催化剂（如PtSn/SAPO-34）的开发显著提高了PDH过程中丙烯生产的选择性。这解决了传统方法中丙烯产率低的问题。

          5. 市场响应能力：随着丙烯需求以每年5-6%的速度增长，PDH技术允许更灵活、更有针对性的丙烯生产，以满足这一不断增长的需求。

          6. 灵活性：PDH装置可以设计为以丙烯为主要产品，允许更好地控制生产量和市场响应能力。它们还可以建在更靠近终端用户的地方，降低运输成本，提高供应链效率。

          这些优势共同使PDH技术成为解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性挑战的有前景的解决方案，同时满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求。
