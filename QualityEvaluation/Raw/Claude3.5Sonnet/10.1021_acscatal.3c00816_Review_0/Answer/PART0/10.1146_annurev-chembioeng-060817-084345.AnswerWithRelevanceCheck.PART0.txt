      <English>
          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as one of the most promising methods for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is readily available from natural gas processing, petroleum refining, and shale gas sources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods that rely on naphtha cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more selective and efficient process compared to traditional methods. It allows for higher propylene yields and fewer byproducts, improving overall process efficiency. The direct conversion of propane to propylene results in fewer unwanted byproducts, leading to improved overall process efficiency.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology offers high selectivity towards propylene, typically achieving over 90% selectivity. This high selectivity reduces the need for extensive separation and purification steps, thereby improving the overall economics of the process.

4. On-purpose production: PDH allows for dedicated, on-purpose propylene production, which helps to address the growing demand-supply gap for propylene that cannot be met by conventional production methods alone.

5. Economic viability: With the increased availability of low-cost propane, especially from shale gas in North America, PDH has become economically attractive.

6. Operational flexibility: PDH plants can be operated independently of refinery or petrochemical complexes, providing greater flexibility in terms of location and scale of production.

7. Environmental considerations: PDH generally has a lower carbon footprint compared to naphtha cracking, as it requires less energy input and produces fewer CO2 emissions. The more efficient conversion of propane to propylene in PDH processes can lead to lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional production methods.

8. Scalability: PDH technology is suitable for both world-scale plants and smaller, on-purpose propylene production units, addressing different market needs.

9. Catalyst advancements: Ongoing research in catalyst development has led to improved catalysts with higher activity, selectivity, and stability, further enhancing the efficiency of PDH processes.

10. Lower energy consumption: Compared to steam cracking, PDH generally requires less energy input per unit of propylene produced, contributing to improved energy efficiency and reduced operating costs.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene, especially in regions with abundant propane resources. However, it's worth noting that PDH technology also faces some challenges, such as catalyst deactivation and the need for periodic regeneration, which continue to be areas of ongoing research and development in the field.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法之一：

1. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料可以从天然气加工、石油精炼和页岩气源中获得。这解决了传统生产方法（如石脑油裂解或流化催化裂化）面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与传统方法相比，PDH是一个更具选择性和效率的过程。它可以实现更高的丙烯产率和更少的副产品，从而提高整体工艺效率。丙烷直接转化为丙烯产生较少的不需要的副产品，从而提高了整体工艺效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术对丙烯具有高度选择性，通常可以达到90%以上的选择性。这种高选择性减少了对广泛分离和纯化步骤的需求，从而改善了工艺的整体经济性。

4. 定向生产：PDH允许专门的、定向的丙烯生产，这有助于解决仅靠传统生产方法无法满足的丙烯供需缺口。

5. 经济可行性：随着低成本丙烷（特别是北美页岩气）可用性的增加，PDH变得经济上具有吸引力。

6. 操作灵活性：PDH装置可以独立于炼油厂或石化综合体运营，在生产地点和规模方面提供更大的灵活性。

7. 环境考虑：与石脑油裂解相比，PDH通常具有较低的碳足迹，因为它需要较少的能量输入并产生较少的CO2排放。PDH工艺中丙烷到丙烯的更高效转化可以导致比传统生产方法更低的CO2排放。

8. 可扩展性：PDH技术适用于世界级大型装置和较小的专用丙烯生产装置，可满足不同的市场需求。

9. 催化剂进展：催化剂开发的持续研究导致了活性、选择性和稳定性更高的改进催化剂，进一步提高了PDH工艺的效率。

10. 较低的能源消耗：与蒸汽裂解相比，PDH每单位丙烯产量通常需要较少的能量输入，有助于提高能源效率和降低运营成本。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合解决全球日益增长的丙烯需求，尤其是在丙烷资源丰富的地区。然而，值得注意的是，PDH技术也面临一些挑战，如催化剂失活和需要定期再生等问题，这些仍然是该领域正在进行的研究和开发的重点领域。
