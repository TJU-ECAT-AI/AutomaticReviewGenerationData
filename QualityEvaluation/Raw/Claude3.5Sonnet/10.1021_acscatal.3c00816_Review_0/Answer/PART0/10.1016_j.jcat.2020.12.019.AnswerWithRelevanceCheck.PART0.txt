          [1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."

[3] "The gap between supply and demand becomes increasingly wide, which has greatly promoted the development of new technologies for the production of propylene"

[4] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas"

[5] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant propane from shale gas resources, addressing the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process for converting propane to propylene, leading to higher efficiency compared to more complex multi-step processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity to propylene, which is crucial for maximizing yield and reducing unwanted by-products.

4. Valuable by-product: The process produces hydrogen as a valuable by-product, which can be used in other industrial applications or as a clean energy source.

5. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH helps bridge the widening gap between propylene supply and demand, which has become increasingly evident due to the large consumption of downstream products derived from propylene.

6. Eco-friendly potential: There is ongoing research to develop eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for PDH, which could further improve its sustainability compared to conventional methods.

7. Cost-efficiency: With the right catalysts and process optimizations, PDH technology can offer a cost-efficient route to propylene production, especially in regions with access to cheap propane feedstock.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
