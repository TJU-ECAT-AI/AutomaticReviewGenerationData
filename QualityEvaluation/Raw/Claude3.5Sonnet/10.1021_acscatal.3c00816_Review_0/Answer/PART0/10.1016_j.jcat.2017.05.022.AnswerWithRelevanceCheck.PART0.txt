          [1] "Besides these two major processes, on-purpose production of lower olefins becomes more important to fulfill the growing demand especially for propene. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and isobutane is such attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, respectively."

[2] "Catalysts with supported VOx are among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

[3] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were also reported to be active and selective in DH of n-butane"

[4] "Recently, we published a comparative study of isobutane DH over VOx species dispersed on SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2-Al2O3. Highest selectivity to isobutene was obtained over VOx/Al2O3 whereas VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, on-demand production of propylene, addressing the growing global demand more directly than conventional methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient than steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking in producing propylene.

4. High selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity to propylene, especially when using catalysts like VOx/MCM-41 or VOx/Al2O3, which show good selectivity and stability.

5. Good stability: Supported VOx catalysts demonstrate good onstream stability, allowing for consistent production over time.

6. Reduced byproducts: Unlike steam cracking, PDH does not produce unwanted byproducts like ethylene, allowing for a more focused production of propylene.

7. Lower energy consumption: PDH generally requires less energy compared to the high temperatures needed for steam cracking.

These advantages specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of:

- Feedstock availability: By using propane, PDH addresses the issue of diminishing naphtha feedstock.
- Process efficiency: The direct conversion process of PDH offers improved efficiency compared to multi-step processes.
- Product selectivity: PDH achieves high propylene selectivity, especially with optimized catalysts, minimizing unwanted byproducts.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性、按需生产丙烯，比传统方法更直接地满足不断增长的全球需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH在生产丙烯方面比蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解更有效率。

4. 高选择性：PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，特别是使用像VOx/MCM-41或VOx/Al2O3这样的催化剂时，表现出良好的选择性和稳定性。

5. 良好的稳定性：负载型VOx催化剂表现出良好的在线稳定性，可以长期稳定生产。

6. 减少副产品：与蒸汽裂解不同，PDH不会产生不需要的副产品如乙烯，从而实现更集中的丙烯生产。

7. 降低能耗：与蒸汽裂解所需的高温相比，PDH通常需要较少的能量。

这些优势特别解决了传统生产方法在以下方面面临的挑战：

- 原料可用性：通过使用丙烷，PDH解决了石脑油原料日益减少的问题。
- 工艺效率：PDH的直接转化过程与多步骤工艺相比提供了更高的效率。
- 产品选择性：PDH实现了高丙烯选择性，特别是使用优化的催化剂，最大限度地减少了不需要的副产品。
