          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels."

          [2] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."

          [3] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes because of their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

          [4] "High reaction temperature (500700C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes the increasing supply of propane from shale gas, providing a stable and abundant clean energy source. This addresses the challenge of feedstock supply faced by conventional production methods.

          2. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, efficient production of propylene, helping to meet the growing global demand more effectively than traditional byproduct-based methods.

          3. Process efficiency: PDH uses Pt-based catalysts that are highly effective at activating paraffinic C-H bonds while having low activity for C-C cleavage. This leads to efficient conversion of propane to propylene.

          4. Product selectivity: The use of specialized catalysts in PDH enables high selectivity towards propylene production, minimizing unwanted byproducts.

          5. Flexibility: PDH can be implemented as a standalone process and operate at high temperatures (500-700°C) to achieve reasonable conversion levels, allowing for process optimization based on market demands.

          6. Reduced dependence on other processes: PDH provides a direct route to propylene, reducing reliance on byproducts from other petrochemical processes and decreasing dependence on naphtha cracking, which is sensitive to oil prices.

          These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, making it a promising technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

          1. 原料可用性：PDH利用了来自页岩气的不断增加的丙烷供应，提供了稳定和丰富的清洁能源源。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应挑战。

          2. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性的、高效的丙烯生产，比传统的副产品基生产方法更有效地满足不断增长的全球需求。

          3. 工艺效率：PDH使用的铂基催化剂在活化烷基C-H键方面非常有效，同时对C-C键的裂解活性较低。这导致了丙烷到丙烯的高效转化。

          4. 产品选择性：PDH中使用的专门催化剂能够实现对丙烯生产的高选择性，最大限度地减少了不需要的副产品。

          5. 灵活性：PDH可以作为独立过程实施，并可以在高温（500-700°C）下运行以达到合理的转化水平，允许根据市场需求优化工艺。

          6. 减少对其他工艺的依赖：PDH提供了一条直接生产丙烯的路径，减少了对其他石化工艺副产品的依赖，并降低了对石脑油裂解的依赖，后者对油价敏感。

          这些优势使PDH能够解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使其成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的一项有前途的技术。
