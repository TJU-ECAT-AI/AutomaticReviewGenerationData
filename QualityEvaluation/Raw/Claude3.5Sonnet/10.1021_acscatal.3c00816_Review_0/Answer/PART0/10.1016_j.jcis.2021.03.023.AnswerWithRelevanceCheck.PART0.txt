          [1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

[4] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile"

          PDH technology is emerging as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: The growing reserves of propane from shale gas deposits provide an abundant and cost-effective feedstock for PDH. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to more complex traditional routes that may involve multiple steps.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to indirect methods of propylene production. Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500°C, which can achieve significant propane conversion rates.

4. Product selectivity: PDH has the potential for high propylene selectivity, especially with the development of new catalysts and processes aimed at improving selectivity.

5. Meeting market demand: PDH helps meet the growing global demand for propylene, which is used in various important products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene, and acrylonitrile.

6. Overcoming limitations of current methods: PDH technology aims to address issues with conventional catalysts, such as the toxicity of chromium and the high cost of platinum, by developing new, more sustainable catalysts.

7. Process flexibility: PDH can be operated independently of petroleum refining, allowing for more flexible production based on market demands.

However, challenges remain in developing efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for PDH that can operate at high temperatures while maintaining selectivity and conversion rates. The severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt in current commercial processes greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, highlighting the urgent demand for new catalysts.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因以下几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：页岩气开采带来的丙烷储量增加，为PDH提供了丰富且具有成本效益的原料。这解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 直接生产：PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与可能涉及多个步骤的更复杂传统路线相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷转化为丙烯的直接、单步工艺，与间接的丙烯生产方法相比，可能提供更高的效率。商业PDH工艺在500°C以上的温度下运行，可以实现显著的丙烷转化率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH具有高丙烯选择性的潜力，特别是随着旨在提高选择性的新型催化剂和工艺的开发。

5. 满足市场需求：PDH有助于满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求，丙烯用于多种重要产品的生产，如环氧丙烷、聚丙烯和丙烯腈。

6. 克服当前方法的局限性：PDH技术旨在通过开发新的、更可持续的催化剂来解决传统催化剂的问题，如铬的毒性和铂的高成本。

7. 工艺灵活性：PDH可以独立于石油炼制运行，允许根据市场需求进行更灵活的生产。

然而，在开发能够在高温下运行并保持选择性和转化率的高效、稳定和具有成本效益的PDH催化剂方面仍然存在挑战。目前商业工艺中铬的严重毒性和铂的高价格极大地限制了PDH行业的进一步发展，突显了对新型催化剂的迫切需求。
