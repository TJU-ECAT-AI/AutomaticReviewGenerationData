          [1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."

[4] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

[5] "There are two undesirable aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction: one is high energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, and a large amount of unconverted propane must be recycled back to the reactor after separation, leading to large equipment investment and high energy consumption."

[6] "As for the development of the reactor, it should be noted that low operation pressure is beneficial for improving the single-pass conversion, decreasing the amount of unconverted alkane recycled back to the reactor, and reducing the energy consumption of the whole process."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is readily available from natural gas processing and oil refining. This addresses the challenge of feedstock limitations faced by conventional methods.

2. Atom economy and process efficiency: PDH is an atom-economic reaction, where one mole of propane generates one mole of propylene and one mole of hydrogen. Both products are high value-added, maximizing resource utilization and efficiency.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity to propylene compared to other processes like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mix of olefins.

4. Flexibility and scalability: PDH plants can be built in various capacities and locations close to propane sources or propylene markets, offering flexibility in production and scalability according to market demand.

5. Potential for process improvements: Ongoing research focuses on increasing single-pass conversion, optimizing reaction conditions, and developing better catalysts. These improvements aim to further enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and address challenges such as high energy consumption and thermodynamic limitations.

6. Independence from oil-based feedstocks: As a gas-based process, PDH reduces reliance on oil-derived feedstocks, providing a more stable and potentially cost-effective propylene production route.

7. Energy efficiency: Developments in reactor design, particularly focusing on low operation pressure, are improving single-pass conversion and reducing overall energy consumption of the process.

While PDH technology faces challenges such as high energy consumption and the need for large equipment investments due to the recycling of unconverted propane, its advantages in feedstock utilization, product selectivity, and potential for improvement make it a highly promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术之所以成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，主要基于以下几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料可以从天然气处理和石油精炼中大量获得。这解决了传统方法面临的原料限制问题。

2. 原子经济性和工艺效率：PDH是一个原子经济性反应，一摩尔丙烷生成一摩尔丙烯和一摩尔氢气。两种产品都具有高附加值，最大限度地利用了资源并提高了效率。

3. 产品选择性：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解等生产混合烯烃的其他工艺相比，PDH对丙烯的选择性更高。

4. 灵活性和可扩展性：PDH装置可以以不同的产能建造，并且可以靠近丙烷来源或丙烯市场，提供生产的灵活性和根据市场需求进行规模调整的能力。

5. 工艺改进潜力：正在进行的研究集中在提高单程转化率、优化反应条件和开发更好的催化剂上。这些改进旨在进一步提高效率、降低成本，并解决高能耗和热力学限制等挑战。

6. 不依赖石油基原料：作为一种基于气体的工艺，PDH减少了对石油衍生原料的依赖，为丙烯生产提供了一种更稳定且可能更具成本效益的路线。

7. 能源效率：反应器设计的发展，特别是低操作压力的应用，正在提高单程转化率并降低整个过程的能耗。

虽然PDH技术面临着高能耗和由于未转化丙烷的回收而需要大量设备投资等挑战，但其在原料利用、产品选择性和改进潜力方面的优势使其成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的极具前景的解决方案。
