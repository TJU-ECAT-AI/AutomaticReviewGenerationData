[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present."

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."

[4] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Addressing feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha or ethane used in steam cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an atom-economic reaction, where one mole of propane produces one mole of propylene and one mole of hydrogen, both of which are valuable products. This high efficiency addresses the challenge of yield optimization faced by conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity towards propylene compared to other processes like steam cracking, which produce a mix of olefins.

4. Flexibility and scalability: PDH plants can be scaled according to market demand, offering more flexibility than large-scale steam crackers.

5. Lower energy consumption: While still energy-intensive, PDH generally requires less energy than steam cracking, especially when considering the energy required for product separation.

6. Potential for improvement: There is significant room for enhancing PDH technology, particularly in areas like increasing single-pass conversion and reducing pressure drop in reactors, which can further improve efficiency and reduce costs.

These advantages make PDH particularly attractive in addressing the growing global demand for propylene, especially in regions with abundant propane resources. The technology's rapid development and increasing capacity, particularly in China, demonstrate its potential to become a major contributor to global propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，主要有以下几个关键优势：

1. 解决原料供应问题：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解所用的石脑油或乙烷等传统原料，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 工艺效率高：PDH是一个原子经济性反应，一摩尔丙烷产生一摩尔丙烯和一摩尔氢气，两者都是有价值的产品。这种高效率解决了传统方法面临的产率优化挑战。

3. 产品选择性高：与蒸汽裂解等生产混合烯烃的工艺相比，PDH对丙烯的选择性更高。

4. 灵活性和可扩展性强：PDH装置可以根据市场需求进行规模调整，比大型蒸汽裂解装置更具灵活性。

5. 能耗较低：虽然仍然是能源密集型工艺，但PDH的能耗通常低于蒸汽裂解，特别是考虑到产品分离所需的能源时。

6. 改进潜力大：PDH技术还有很大的改进空间，特别是在提高单程转化率和降低反应器压降等方面，这可以进一步提高效率并降低成本。

这些优势使得PDH在应对全球日益增长的丙烯需求方面特别具有吸引力，尤其是在丙烷资源丰富的地区。该技术的快速发展和产能的不断增加，特别是在中国，展示了它有潜力成为全球丙烯生产的主要贡献者。
