[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."

[4] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Atom economy: PDH is a highly efficient process where one mole of propane produces one mole of propylene and one mole of hydrogen, both valuable products. This high atom efficiency addresses the challenge of feedstock utilization faced by conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is readily available from natural gas processing and oil refining. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional propylene production methods that rely on naphtha cracking or other oil-based processes.

3. Process selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity to propylene compared to other processes like steam cracking. This high selectivity helps maximize propylene yield and minimize unwanted byproducts.

4. Flexibility and scalability: PDH plants can be built in various capacities and locations close to propane sources or propylene markets, offering flexibility in production.

5. Potential for process improvements: Ongoing research focuses on increasing single-pass conversion, optimizing reaction conditions, and developing better catalysts. These improvements aim to further enhance efficiency and reduce costs.

6. Independence from oil-based feedstocks: As a gas-based process, PDH reduces reliance on oil-derived feedstocks, providing a more stable and potentially cost-effective propylene production route.

While PDH technology faces challenges such as high energy consumption and catalyst deactivation, its advantages in feedstock utilization, product selectivity, and potential for improvement make it a highly promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术之所以成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，主要基于以下几个关键优势：

1. 原子经济性：PDH是一个高效过程，一摩尔丙烷可以生产一摩尔丙烯和一摩尔氢气，两者都是有价值的产品。这种高原子效率解决了传统方法面临的原料利用问题。

2. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，而丙烷可以从天然气处理和石油精炼中获得。这解决了传统丙烯生产方法（如石脑油裂解或其他基于石油的工艺）所面临的原料可用性挑战。

3. 工艺选择性：与蒸汽裂解等其他工艺相比，PDH对丙烯的选择性更高。这种高选择性有助于最大化丙烯产量并最小化不需要的副产品。

4. 灵活性和可扩展性：PDH装置可以以不同的产能建造，并且可以靠近丙烷来源或丙烯市场，提供生产的灵活性。

5. 工艺改进潜力：正在进行的研究集中在提高单程转化率、优化反应条件和开发更好的催化剂上。这些改进旨在进一步提高效率和降低成本。

6. 不依赖石油基原料：作为一种基于气体的工艺，PDH减少了对石油衍生原料的依赖，为丙烯生产提供了一种更稳定且可能更具成本效益的路线。

虽然PDH技术面临着高能耗和催化剂失活等挑战，但其在原料利用、产品选择性和改进潜力方面的优势使其成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的极具前景的解决方案。
