[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."

[4] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Atom economy: PDH is a highly efficient process where one mole of propane produces one mole of propylene and one mole of hydrogen, both valuable products. This high atom efficiency addresses the challenge of feedstock utilization faced by conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is readily available from natural gas processing and oil refining. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional propylene production methods that rely on naphtha cracking or other oil-based processes.

3. Process selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity to propylene compared to other processes like steam cracking. This high selectivity helps maximize propylene yield and minimize unwanted byproducts.

4. Flexibility and scalability: PDH plants can be built in various capacities and locations close to propane sources or propylene markets, offering flexibility in production.

5. Potential for process improvements: Ongoing research focuses on increasing single-pass conversion, optimizing reaction conditions, and developing better catalysts. These improvements aim to further enhance efficiency and reduce costs.

6. Independence from oil-based feedstocks: As a gas-based process, PDH reduces reliance on oil-derived feedstocks, providing a more stable and potentially cost-effective propylene production route.

While PDH technology faces challenges such as high energy consumption and catalyst deactivation, its advantages in feedstock utilization, product selectivity, and potential for improvement make it a highly promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "There are two undesirable aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction: one is high energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, and a large amount of unconverted propane must be recycled back to the reactor after separation, leading to large equipment investment and high energy consumption."

[4] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple.

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Addressing feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is increasingly available due to the shale gas boom. This addresses the challenge of limited propylene supply from traditional sources like steam crackers and refineries.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an atom-economical reaction, producing only propylene and hydrogen from propane. This high selectivity towards the desired product makes it more efficient compared to other processes that generate multiple byproducts.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity to propylene, which is a significant advantage over conventional methods that produce a mix of olefins requiring complex separation processes.

4. Flexibility and on-purpose production: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, enabling producers to adjust output based on market demand more easily than integrated processes.

5. Potential for improvement: While PDH faces challenges like high energy consumption and thermodynamic limitations, there is significant room for technological improvements in catalysts and reactor designs to enhance conversion rates and reduce energy use.

However, PDH also faces challenges, including high energy consumption and the need for large equipment investments due to the recycling of unconverted propane. Ongoing research focuses on increasing single-pass conversion rates through measures such as optimizing reaction temperatures, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressures, and lowering H2 partial pressures to address these issues and further improve the technology's efficiency and economic viability.
