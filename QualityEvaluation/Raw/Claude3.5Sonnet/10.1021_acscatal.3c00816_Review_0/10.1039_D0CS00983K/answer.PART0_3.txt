[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "There are two undesirable aspects of the dehydrogenation reaction: one is high energy consumption, i.e., the heat needed for the complete conversion of one mole of propane to propylene is approximately 120 kJ mol1; the other is that propane conversion for a single pass is not high due to the limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium, and a large amount of unconverted propane must be recycled back to the reactor after separation, leading to large equipment investment and high energy consumption."

[4] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple. To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Addressing feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is increasingly available due to the shale gas boom. This addresses the challenge of limited propylene supply from traditional sources like steam crackers and refineries.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an atom-economical reaction, producing only propylene and hydrogen from propane. This high selectivity towards the desired product makes it more efficient compared to other processes that generate multiple byproducts.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity to propylene, which is a significant advantage over conventional methods that produce a mix of olefins requiring complex separation processes.

4. Flexibility and on-purpose production: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, enabling producers to adjust output based on market demand more easily than integrated processes.

5. Potential for improvement: While PDH faces challenges like high energy consumption and thermodynamic limitations, there is significant room for technological improvements in catalysts and reactor designs to enhance conversion rates and reduce energy use.

However, PDH also faces challenges, including high energy consumption and the need for large equipment investments due to the recycling of unconverted propane. Ongoing research focuses on increasing single-pass conversion rates through measures such as optimizing reaction temperatures, reducing hydrocarbon partial pressures, and lowering H2 partial pressures to address these issues and further improve the technology's efficiency and economic viability.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术已成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，原因如下：

1. 解决原料供应问题：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气革命，丙烷供应越来越充足。这解决了传统蒸汽裂解和炼油厂丙烯供应有限的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个原子经济性反应，仅从丙烷生产丙烯和氢气。这种对目标产品的高选择性使其比产生多种副产品的其他工艺更高效。

3. 产品选择性：PDH对丙烯具有高选择性，这比需要复杂分离过程的常规方法产生的混合烯烃具有显著优势。

4. 灵活性和定向生产：PDH允许定向生产丙烯，使生产商能够比集成工艺更容易根据市场需求调整产量。

5. 改进潜力：虽然PDH面临高能耗和热力学限制等挑战，但在催化剂和反应器设计方面仍有巨大的技术改进空间，以提高转化率并降低能耗。

然而，PDH也面临挑战，包括高能耗和由于未转化丙烷的回收而需要大量设备投资。目前的研究重点是通过优化反应温度、降低烃类分压和降低H2分压等措施来提高单程转化率，以解决这些问题并进一步提高技术的效率和经济可行性。
