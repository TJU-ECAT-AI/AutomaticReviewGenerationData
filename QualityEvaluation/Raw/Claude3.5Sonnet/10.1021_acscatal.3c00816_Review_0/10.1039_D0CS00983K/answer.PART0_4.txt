[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies. In particular, in China, it is predicted that the processing capacity of propane dehydrogenation will increase to 30 million t per annum by 2030 from about 7 million t per annum at present."

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "Obviously, increasing the conversion of propane for a single pass is an effective way to reduce the equipment investment and operation cost; however, it is not simple."

[4] "As for the development of the reactor, it should be noted that low operation pressure is beneficial for improving the single-pass conversion, decreasing the amount of unconverted alkane recycled back to the reactor, and reducing the energy consumption of the whole process."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is abundantly available from natural gas processing and oil refining. This addresses the challenge of feedstock limitations faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an atom-economic reaction, where one mole of propane generates one mole of propylene and one mole of hydrogen. Both products are high value-added, maximizing resource utilization.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity to propylene compared to other processes like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Scalability: The technology allows for dedicated propylene production facilities, which can be scaled according to market demand.

5. Energy efficiency: Ongoing developments in reactor design, particularly focusing on low operation pressure, are improving single-pass conversion and reducing energy consumption.

6. Economic viability: Increasing the single-pass conversion of propane reduces equipment investment and operation costs, making PDH more economically attractive.

7. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to end-users, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene, especially in regions with access to low-cost propane feedstock.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术因其几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料可以从天然气处理和石油精炼中大量获得。这解决了传统方法面临的原料限制问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个原子经济性反应，一摩尔丙烷生成一摩尔丙烯和一摩尔氢气。两种产品都具有高附加值，最大限度地利用了资源。

3. 产品选择性：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解等其他工艺相比，PDH对丙烯的选择性更高。

4. 可扩展性：该技术允许建立专门的丙烯生产设施，可以根据市场需求进行规模调整。

5. 能源效率：反应器设计的持续发展，特别是低操作压力的应用，正在提高单程转化率并降低能耗。

6. 经济可行性：提高丙烷的单程转化率可以降低设备投资和运营成本，使PDH在经济上更具吸引力。

7. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近最终用户的地方，降低运输成本并提高供应链效率。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合解决全球日益增长的丙烯需求，尤其是在能够获得低成本丙烷原料的地区。
