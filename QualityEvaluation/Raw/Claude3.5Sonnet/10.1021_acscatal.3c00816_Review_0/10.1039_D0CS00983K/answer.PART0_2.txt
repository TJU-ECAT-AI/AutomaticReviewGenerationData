[1] "In recent years, the ever-increasing demand for propylene has driven the rapid application and development of propane dehydrogenation technologies."

[2] "Theoretically, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an atom-economic reaction. That is, one mole of propane generates one mole propylene and one mole H2 through dehydrogenation, and both of the products are high value-added."

[3] "To increase the conversion of propane, from the view of thermodynamic equilibrium, there are three measures we can take: increasing the reaction temperature, reducing the partial pressure of hydrocarbons and lowering the partial pressure of H2."

[4] "Obviously, operating below atmospheric pressure is favorable for dehydrogenation, but the potential risk lies in air leakage into the unit."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Atom economy: PDH is highly efficient, directly converting one mole of propane into one mole of propylene and one mole of hydrogen, both of which are valuable products.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from various sources, addressing challenges related to feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

3. Process control: PDH allows for precise control over reaction conditions, including temperature and pressure, enabling optimization of propylene yield and selectivity.

4. Reduced energy consumption: Operating at lower pressures can improve single-pass conversion and reduce overall energy requirements compared to some conventional methods.

5. Product purity: PDH typically produces high-purity propylene, reducing the need for extensive separation and purification steps.

6. Scalability: PDH plants can be designed to meet specific capacity requirements, offering flexibility in production scale.

These advantages allow PDH to address challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as naphtha cracking, which may be limited by feedstock availability or produce a wider range of byproducts. PDH's ability to efficiently convert propane directly to propylene makes it particularly attractive as global demand for propylene continues to grow.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原子经济性：PDH效率高，可以直接将一摩尔丙烷转化为一摩尔丙烯和一摩尔氢气，两者都是有价值的产品。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用来自各种来源的丙烷，解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

3. 过程控制：PDH允许精确控制反应条件，包括温度和压力，从而优化丙烯产量和选择性。

4. 降低能耗：与一些传统方法相比，在较低压力下运行可以提高单程转化率并降低整体能源需求。

5. 产品纯度：PDH通常生产高纯度丙烯，减少了广泛分离和纯化步骤的需求。

6. 可扩展性：PDH装置可以根据特定的产能要求进行设计，提供生产规模的灵活性。

这些优势使PDH能够解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，如石脑油裂解可能受到原料可用性限制或产生更广泛的副产品。随着全球对丙烯需求的持续增长，PDH高效地将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的能力使其特别具有吸引力。
