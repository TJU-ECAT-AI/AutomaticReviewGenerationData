[1] "With the growing demand for propylene and the explosion of the shale gas revolution, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has become more commercially attractive, which exhibits significant environmental and energy implications."

[2] "However, commercial PDH processes using high cost of PtSn/Al2O3 and high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have restricted their further developments."

[3] "Recently, the well-defined and highly dispersed sites of Fe, Ga, Zn, Co and Y, obtained via grafting tailored metal precursors within hydroxyl on the silica supports, have shown the capability to break C-H bonds of alkanes."

[4] "Among these catalysts, highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)) have gained much interest, due to its superior PDH catalytic potential."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which has become more abundant and cost-effective due to the shale gas revolution. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene, offering potentially higher efficiency compared to multi-step conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: Recent developments in catalyst technology, particularly highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites, have shown superior catalytic potential for PDH, potentially improving product selectivity.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH exhibits significant environmental implications, likely due to its more straightforward process and potential for cleaner operation compared to conventional methods.

5. Economic attractiveness: The commercial attractiveness of PDH has increased, driven by growing propylene demand and feedstock availability.

6. Overcoming limitations of current commercial catalysts: PDH technology aims to address the drawbacks of existing commercial catalysts, such as the high cost of PtSn/Al2O3 and high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts.

These advantages collectively make PDH a promising solution to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.
