[1] "With the growing demand for propylene and the explosion of the shale gas revolution, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has become more commercially attractive, which exhibits significant environmental and energy implications."

[2] "However, commercial PDH processes using high cost of PtSn/Al2O3 and high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have restricted their further developments."

[3] "Recently, the well-defined and highly dispersed sites of Fe, Ga, Zn, Co and Y, obtained via grafting tailored metal precursors within hydroxyl on the silica supports, have shown the capability to break C-H bonds of alkanes."

[4] "Among these catalysts, highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)) have gained much interest, due to its superior PDH catalytic potential."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which has become more abundant and cost-effective due to the shale gas revolution. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, single-step process to convert propane to propylene, which can be more efficient than multi-step conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: The development of highly dispersed catalysts, especially tetrahedral Co(II) sites, has shown superior catalytic potential for PDH. This improved catalyst design allows for better selectivity towards propylene production.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH exhibits significant environmental implications, likely due to its more straightforward process and potentially lower emissions compared to traditional methods.

5. Energy implications: The process is becoming more commercially attractive, suggesting it may have favorable energy economics compared to alternatives.

6. Overcoming limitations of current commercial catalysts: PDH technology is addressing the challenges of high costs associated with PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts and the high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts used in current commercial processes.

These advantages collectively make PDH a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene while addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
