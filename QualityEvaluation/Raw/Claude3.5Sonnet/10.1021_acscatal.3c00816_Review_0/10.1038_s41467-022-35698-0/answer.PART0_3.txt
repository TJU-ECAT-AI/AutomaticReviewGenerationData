[1] "With the growing demand for propylene and the explosion of the shale gas revolution, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has become more commercially attractive, which exhibits significant environmental and energy implications."

[2] "However, commercial PDH processes using high cost of PtSn/Al2O3 and high toxicity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts have restricted their further developments."

[3] "Recently, the well-defined and highly dispersed sites of Fe, Ga, Zn, Co and Y, obtained via grafting tailored metal precursors within hydroxyl on the silica supports, have shown the capability to break C-H bonds of alkanes."

[4] "Among these catalysts, highly dispersed tetrahedral Co(II) sites (Td-cobalt(II)) have gained much interest, due to its superior PDH catalytic potential."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH takes advantage of the abundant propane supply from the shale gas revolution, addressing feedstock challenges faced by conventional methods.

2. Environmental benefits: PDH exhibits significant environmental implications compared to traditional propylene production methods.

3. Energy efficiency: The process is more energy-efficient, contributing to its commercial attractiveness.

4. Catalytic advancements: Development of highly dispersed metal catalysts, particularly tetrahedral Co(II) sites, has shown superior catalytic potential for PDH, improving process efficiency.

5. Selectivity: The use of well-defined and highly dispersed catalytic sites enhances the ability to selectively break C-H bonds in alkanes, potentially improving product selectivity.

6. Cost-effectiveness: PDH addresses the high costs associated with conventional catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3.

7. Reduced toxicity: It offers an alternative to highly toxic catalysts such as Cr/Al2O3 used in some commercial processes.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene while addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
