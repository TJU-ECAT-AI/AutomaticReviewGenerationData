[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."

[2] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity."

[3] "As shown in Figure5c, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some key advantages of PDH technology:

1. High selectivity: The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst developed through ultrafast encapsulation demonstrated a selectivity of about 99% throughout a long-time reaction, indicating that PDH can achieve very high product selectivity for propylene.

2. Improved catalyst performance: The novel Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited high conversion rates (70% initially, 45% after 24 hours) and long catalyst lifetime, addressing efficiency challenges in propylene production.

3. Potential for innovation: The article mentions that propane dehydrogenation is attracting great attention for catalyst innovation, suggesting that there is room for further improvements in process efficiency and performance.

4. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, which could potentially address feedstock availability issues by utilizing propane as a readily available feedstock.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional methods, these advantages demonstrate why PDH technology is considered promising for propylene production. The high selectivity, improved catalyst performance, and potential for further innovation could help address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.

虽然文献没有直接比较丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术与传统生产方法的优势，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断PDH技术的一些关键优势：

1. 高选择性：通过超快速包覆开发的Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂在长时间反应中表现出约99%的选择性，表明PDH可以实现非常高的丙烯产品选择性。

2. 改进的催化剂性能：新型Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出高转化率（初始70%，24小时后45%）和长催化剂寿命，解决了丙烯生产中的效率挑战。

3. 创新潜力：文章提到丙烷脱氢正吸引着大量催化剂创新的关注，表明在工艺效率和性能方面还有进一步改进的空间。

4. 直接生产：PDH允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，这可能通过利用丙烷作为现成可用的原料来解决原料可用性问题。

尽管文档没有明确将PDH与传统方法进行比较，但这些优势表明了为什么PDH技术被认为是丙烯生产的有前途方法。高选择性、改进的催化剂性能以及进一步创新的潜力可以帮助解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
