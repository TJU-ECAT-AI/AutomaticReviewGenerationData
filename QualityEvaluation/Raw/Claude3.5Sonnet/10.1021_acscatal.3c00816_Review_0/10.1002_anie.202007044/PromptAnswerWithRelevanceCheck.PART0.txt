[1] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."

[3] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity."

[4] "As shown in Figure5c, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some key advantages of PDH technology using the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst:

1. High selectivity: The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates extremely high selectivity (about 99%) for propylene production, which addresses the challenge of product selectivity in propylene production.

2. High conversion rate: The catalyst shows a high initial conversion rate of about 70%, which indicates good process efficiency.

3. Stability and longevity: The catalyst maintains high conversion (45%) even after 24 hours of operation, demonstrating excellent stability and addressing the challenge of catalyst deactivation.

4. Regeneration capability: The catalyst can be regenerated and still maintain high activity and selectivity, which contributes to its long-term efficiency.

5. Feedstock utilization: By directly converting propane to propylene, this method potentially allows for better utilization of available feedstocks, especially in regions with abundant natural gas resources.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional methods, these characteristics suggest that PDH technology using advanced catalysts like Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 could offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and stability for propylene production.
