[1] "Catalytic performance of the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity."

[3] "As shown in Figure5c, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology using the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst:

1. High selectivity: The catalyst demonstrated about 99% selectivity for propylene throughout long reaction times.

2. High conversion rate: Initial conversion rates of about 70% were achieved.

3. Long catalyst lifetime: The catalyst maintained high activity even after 24 hours of operation.

4. Stability: The catalyst showed good performance even after regeneration at high temperatures.

5. Efficient use of feedstock: The high selectivity and conversion rates suggest efficient use of the propane feedstock.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional methods, these characteristics suggest that the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst could potentially address challenges in process efficiency and product selectivity. However, the article does not provide information on feedstock availability or direct comparisons to other propylene production methods.

虽然文献并未直接讨论全球对丙烯的需求或将丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)与其他生产方法进行比较，但根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断使用Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH技术具有以下优势：

1. 高选择性：该催化剂在长时间反应中表现出约99%的丙烯选择性。

2. 高转化率：初始转化率达到约70%。

3. 催化剂寿命长：即使运行24小时后，催化剂仍保持高活性。

4. 稳定性：即使在高温再生后，催化剂仍表现出良好的性能。

5. 原料利用效率高：高选择性和转化率表明对丙烷原料的利用效率高。

虽然文档没有明确将PDH与传统方法进行比较，但这些特征表明Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂可能有助于解决工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。然而，文章并未提供有关原料可用性或与其他丙烯生产方法的直接比较的信息。
