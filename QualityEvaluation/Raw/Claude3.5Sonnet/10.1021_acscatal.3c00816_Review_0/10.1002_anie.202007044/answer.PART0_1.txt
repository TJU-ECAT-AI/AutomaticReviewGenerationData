[1] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."

[3] "As shown in Figure5c, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, it does highlight some advantages of PDH technology using the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst:

1. High activity and stability: The catalyst shows exceptional activity and remains stable over long periods, with high conversion rates even after 24 hours of operation.

2. Excellent selectivity: The catalyst achieves about 99% selectivity for propene throughout the reaction, indicating very efficient conversion of propane to the desired product.

3. Regeneration capability: The catalyst can be regenerated through oxidation and reduction cycles while maintaining high activity and selectivity, suggesting good long-term performance.

4. Potential for innovation: The paper notes that propane dehydrogenation is attracting great attention for catalyst innovation, implying that there is room for further improvements in the technology.

While the document doesn't specifically compare PDH to conventional methods or discuss feedstock availability, the high performance of this catalyst suggests that PDH technology could address efficiency and selectivity challenges in propylene production.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论全球对丙烯的需求，也没有将丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)与其他生产方法进行比较。然而，它确实强调了使用Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH技术的一些优势：

1. 高活性和稳定性：该催化剂表现出卓越的活性，并在长时间内保持稳定，即使在运行24小时后仍保持高转化率。

2. 优异的选择性：该催化剂在整个反应过程中实现了约99%的丙烯选择性，表明丙烷到目标产物的转化非常有效。

3. 再生能力：该催化剂可以通过氧化和还原循环进行再生，同时保持高活性和选择性，这表明其具有良好的长期性能。

4. 创新潜力：文章指出，丙烷脱氢正在吸引大量关注以进行催化剂创新，这意味着该技术还有进一步改进的空间。

虽然文档没有具体比较PDH与传统方法，或讨论原料可用性，但这种催化剂的高性能表明PDH技术可能能够解决丙烯生产中的效率和选择性挑战。
