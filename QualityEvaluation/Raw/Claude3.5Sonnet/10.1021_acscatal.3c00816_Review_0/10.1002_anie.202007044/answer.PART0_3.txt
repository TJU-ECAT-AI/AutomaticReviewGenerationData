[1] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."

[3] "As shown in Figure5c, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology:

1. High selectivity: The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated exceptional selectivity, maintaining about 99% selectivity throughout long reaction times.

2. Good conversion rates: The catalyst showed high initial conversion rates of about 70%, maintaining 45% conversion even after 24 hours of operation.

3. Stability: The catalyst exhibited stability over extended periods, which is crucial for industrial applications.

4. Potential for innovation: The article mentions that propane dehydrogenation is attracting great attention for catalyst innovation, suggesting it's an area of active research and development.

5. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, which may offer advantages in terms of process simplicity compared to some alternative methods.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods or discuss feedstock availability, the high performance of the catalyst described suggests that PDH technology has the potential to address efficiency and selectivity challenges in propylene production.

虽然文献没有直接讨论全球对丙烯的需求或将丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）与其他生产方法进行比较，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断PDH技术的一些优势：

1. 高选择性：Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂表现出卓越的选择性，在长时间反应中保持约99%的选择性。

2. 良好的转化率：催化剂显示出约70%的高初始转化率，即使在运行24小时后仍保持45%的转化率。

3. 稳定性：催化剂在长时间内表现出稳定性，这对工业应用至关重要。

4. 创新潜力：文章提到丙烷脱氢正在吸引催化剂创新的极大关注，表明这是一个活跃的研究和开发领域。

5. 直接生产：PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这可能在工艺简单性方面相对于一些替代方法具有优势。

虽然文档没有明确比较PDH与传统生产方法或讨论原料可用性，但所描述的催化剂的高性能表明PDH技术有潜力解决丙烯生产中的效率和选择性挑战。
