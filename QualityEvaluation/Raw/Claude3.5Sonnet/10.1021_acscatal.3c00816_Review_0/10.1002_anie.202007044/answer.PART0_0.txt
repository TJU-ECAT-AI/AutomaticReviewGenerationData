[1] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 exhibited exceptional activity and selectivity with stability in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene."

[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propene, a catalytic reaction of high potential for facilitating propene production and thus attracting a great attention toward catalyst innovation."

[3] "The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 prepared via the ultrafast encapsulation exhibited a much longer lifetime while maintaining high conversion and selectivity."

[4] "As shown in Figure5c, the ultrafast-encapsulated Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 zeolite exhibited a high conversion of about 70% in the beginning, and the conversion remained as high as 45% even after running for 24h. The selectivity was about 99% throughout the long-time reaction."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some key advantages of PDH technology using the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst:

1. High selectivity: The Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrates extremely high selectivity (about 99%) for propylene production, which addresses the challenge of product selectivity in propylene production.

2. High conversion rate: The catalyst shows a high initial conversion rate of about 70%, which indicates good process efficiency.

3. Stability and longevity: The catalyst maintains high conversion (45%) even after 24 hours of operation, demonstrating excellent stability and addressing the challenge of catalyst deactivation.

4. Regeneration capability: The catalyst can be regenerated and still maintain high activity and selectivity, which contributes to its long-term efficiency.

5. Feedstock utilization: By directly converting propane to propylene, this method potentially allows for better utilization of available feedstocks, especially in regions with abundant natural gas resources.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional methods, these characteristics suggest that PDH technology using advanced catalysts like Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 could offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and stability for propylene production.

虽然文献没有直接比较丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术与传统生产方法的优势，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出使用Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH技术具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 高选择性：Pt/Sn-ZSM-5催化剂在丙烯生产中表现出极高的选择性（约99%），这解决了丙烯生产中产品选择性的挑战。

2. 高转化率：催化剂显示出约70%的高初始转化率，表明了良好的过程效率。

3. 稳定性和长寿命：催化剂在运行24小时后仍能保持高转化率（45%），展示了优异的稳定性，并解决了催化剂失活的问题。

4. 再生能力：催化剂可以被再生，并仍然保持高活性和选择性，这有助于其长期效率。

5. 原料利用：通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，这种方法可能允许更好地利用可用的原料，特别是在天然气资源丰富的地区。

虽然文档没有明确比较PDH与传统方法，但这些特性表明，使用像Pt/Sn-ZSM-5这样的先进催化剂的PDH技术可能在效率、选择性和稳定性方面为丙烯生产提供显著优势。
