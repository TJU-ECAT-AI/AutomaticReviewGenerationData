[1] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[2] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

[3] "Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive on-purpose strategy for propylene production."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it promising for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas, providing a new and abundant feedstock source as hydraulic fracturing technology improves.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an "on-purpose" strategy for propylene production, allowing for more targeted and efficient production compared to traditional methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer byproducts compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Meeting demand: PDH helps address the gap between current production capacity and the rapidly increasing demand for propylene that conventional methods struggle to meet.

5. Flexibility: As a dedicated propylene production method, PDH offers greater flexibility in adjusting production to market demands compared to the multi-product output of steam cracking and FCC.

These advantages position PDH as a promising solution to address the challenges of feedstock limitations, process inefficiencies, and inadequate selectivity faced by traditional propylene production methods.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的有前景方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气的丙烷，随着水力压裂技术的改进，提供了一种新的且丰富的原料来源。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种"定向"的丙烯生产策略，与传统方法相比，允许更有针对性和高效的生产。

3. 产品选择性：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化等传统方法相比，PDH产生的副产品更少。

4. 满足需求：PDH有助于弥合当前产能与传统方法难以满足的快速增长的丙烯需求之间的差距。

5. 灵活性：作为一种专门的丙烯生产方法，与蒸汽裂解和FCC的多产品输出相比，PDH在调整生产以适应市场需求方面提供了更大的灵活性。

这些优势使PDH成为解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料限制、工艺效率低下和选择性不足等挑战的有前景的解决方案。
