<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[2] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

[3] "PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575C. As shown in Figure3, the initial propane conversion significantly increases from 18.8% to 66.7% while propylene selectivity decreases with the stepwise increasing temperature."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant propane from shale gas, addressing the limited supply of traditional petroleum-based feedstocks.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, on-purpose method for propylene production, allowing for better control and optimization of the process compared to traditional methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer byproducts compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, resulting in higher propylene selectivity.

4. Flexibility: PDH can be operated at various temperatures to balance conversion and selectivity, allowing producers to adjust to market demands.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH helps address the gap between increasing propylene demand and the limited production capacity of conventional methods.

These advantages enable PDH to overcome challenges faced by conventional production methods, making it a more sustainable and efficient solution for propylene production in the face of growing global demand.
