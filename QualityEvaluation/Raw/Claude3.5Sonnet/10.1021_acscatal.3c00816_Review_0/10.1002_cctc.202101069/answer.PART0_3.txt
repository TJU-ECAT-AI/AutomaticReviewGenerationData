[1] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[2] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

[3] "Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive on-purpose strategy for propylene production."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas, which has become more abundant due to improved hydraulic fracturing technology. This addresses the limited feedstock availability of conventional petroleum-based methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an "on-purpose" technology specifically designed for propylene production, likely offering better efficiency compared to non-selective processes like steam cracking or FCC.

3. Product selectivity: PDH has the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to conventional methods, allowing for higher propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting demand: PDH helps address the rapidly increasing demand for propylene that current production capacities from petroleum-based methods cannot fully meet.

5. Flexibility: As a dedicated propylene production method, PDH allows producers to adjust output based on market demand, independently of other refinery operations.

These advantages position PDH as a promising solution to address challenges in propylene production, offering a more targeted, efficient, and adaptable approach compared to conventional methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前途的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气中的丙烷，由于水力压裂技术的改进，页岩气变得更加丰富。这解决了传统石油基方法原料供应有限的问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的"定向"技术，相比蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化等非选择性工艺，可能提供更好的效率。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH具有产生较少副产品的优势，从而实现更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 满足需求：PDH有助于满足石油基方法的当前生产能力无法完全满足的快速增长的丙烯需求。

5. 灵活性：作为一种专用的丙烯生产方法，PDH允许生产商根据市场需求调整产量，独立于其他炼油厂操作。

这些优势使PDH成为解决丙烯生产挑战的一个有前途的解决方案，与传统方法相比，提供了一种更有针对性、更高效和更适应性的方法。
