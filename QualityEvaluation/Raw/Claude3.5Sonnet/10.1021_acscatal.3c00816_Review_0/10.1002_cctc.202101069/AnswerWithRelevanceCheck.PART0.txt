          [1] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

          [2] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

          [3] "Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive on-purpose strategy for propylene production."

          [4] "PDH reactions were also carried out over 5%Zn/S-1 catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 500, 525, 550 and 575C. As shown in Figure3, the initial propane conversion significantly increases from 18.8% to 66.7% while propylene selectivity decreases with the stepwise increasing temperature."

          PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

          1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant propane from shale gas, which has become more accessible due to improved hydraulic fracturing technology. This addresses the challenge of limited feedstock in conventional methods.

          2. Process efficiency: PDH is an "on-purpose" strategy specifically designed for propylene production, allowing for better control and optimization of the process compared to traditional methods where propylene is a byproduct.

          3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer byproducts compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, resulting in higher propylene selectivity.

          4. Meeting demand: PDH helps address the rapidly increasing global demand for propylene that current production capacities from petroleum-derived processes cannot fully meet.

          5. Flexibility: PDH can be operated at various temperatures to balance conversion and selectivity, allowing producers to adjust to market demands. For example, propane conversion can be increased from 18.8% to 66.7% by adjusting the reaction temperature.

          These advantages enable PDH to overcome challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a more sustainable and efficient solution for propylene production in the face of growing global demand.

          PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

          1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷，由于水力压裂技术的改进，这些资源变得更加容易获取。这解决了传统方法中原料有限的挑战。

          2. 工艺效率：PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的"定向"策略，与传统方法相比，可以更好地控制和优化生产过程，而在传统方法中丙烯只是副产品。

          3. 产品选择性：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解相比，PDH产生的副产品更少，从而实现更高的丙烯选择性。

          4. 满足需求：PDH有助于满足快速增长的全球丙烯需求，而目前石油衍生工艺的生产能力无法完全满足这一需求。

          5. 灵活性：PDH可以在不同温度下操作，以平衡转化率和选择性，使生产商能够适应市场需求。例如，通过调整反应温度，丙烷转化率可以从18.8%提高到66.7%。

          这些优势使PDH能够克服传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，在面对全球不断增长的需求时，成为一种更可持续、更高效的丙烯生产解决方案。
