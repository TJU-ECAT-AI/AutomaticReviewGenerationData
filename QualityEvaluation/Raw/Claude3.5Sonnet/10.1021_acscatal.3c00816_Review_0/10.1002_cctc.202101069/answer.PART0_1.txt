[1] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[2] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

[3] "Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive on-purpose strategy for propylene production."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize large volumes of propane from shale gas, which has become more abundant due to improved hydraulic fracturing technology. This addresses the challenge of limited feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an "on-purpose" strategy specifically designed for propylene production, making it more efficient compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer byproducts compared to conventional methods, resulting in higher propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting demand: PDH helps address the rapidly increasing demand for propylene that current production capacities from petroleum-derived processes cannot fully meet.

These advantages make PDH technology a promising solution to overcome the challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气的大量丙烷，由于水力压裂技术的改进，这种原料变得更加丰富。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性有限的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的"定向"策略，与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）方法相比，效率更高。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH产生的副产品较少，从而实现更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 满足需求：PDH有助于满足快速增长的丙烯需求，而目前石油衍生工艺的生产能力无法完全满足这一需求。

这些优势使PDH技术成为克服传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面所面临挑战的有前景的解决方案。
