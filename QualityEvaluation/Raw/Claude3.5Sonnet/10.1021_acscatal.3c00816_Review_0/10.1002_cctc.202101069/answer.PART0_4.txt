[1] "Propylene is generally produced from petroleum-derived steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process. However, the current production capacity cannot fully meet the rapidly increasing demand."

[2] "As the hydraulic fracturing technology improves, large volumes of shale gas containing propane can be extracted and direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) attracts wide attention for propylene production with the advantage of less byproducts."

[3] "Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive on-purpose strategy for propylene production."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant propane from shale gas, which has become more accessible due to improved hydraulic fracturing technology. This addresses the challenge of limited feedstock in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an "on-purpose" strategy, meaning it's specifically designed to produce propylene. This focused approach likely results in higher efficiency compared to traditional methods where propylene is a byproduct.

3. Product selectivity: PDH has the advantage of producing fewer byproducts compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. This higher selectivity towards propylene is crucial for meeting the growing demand.

4. Meeting demand: Conventional production methods are struggling to keep up with the rapidly increasing global demand for propylene. PDH technology offers a dedicated solution to bridge this gap.

5. Flexibility: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, providing a more straightforward and potentially more controllable process compared to the complex chemistry involved in steam cracking or FCC.

These advantages position PDH as a promising technology to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷，由于水力压裂技术的改进，这些资源变得更加容易获取。这解决了传统方法中原料有限的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种"定向"策略，意味着它是专门设计用于生产丙烯的。与传统方法相比，这种集中的方法可能会带来更高的效率，在传统方法中丙烯只是副产品。

3. 产品选择性：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化等传统方法相比，PDH具有产生较少副产品的优势。这种对丙烯的更高选择性对于满足不断增长的需求至关重要。

4. 满足需求：传统的生产方法正在努力跟上全球快速增长的丙烯需求。PDH技术提供了一个专门的解决方案来弥补这个差距。

5. 灵活性：PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与蒸汽裂解或FCC涉及的复杂化学反应相比，提供了一个更直接、可能更容易控制的过程。

这些优势使PDH成为一种有前景的技术，可以解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
