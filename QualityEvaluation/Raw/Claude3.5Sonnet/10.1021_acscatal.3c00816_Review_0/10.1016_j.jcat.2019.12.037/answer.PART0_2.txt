[1] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."

[2] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation"

[3] "Alternatively, several transition metals, void of shortcomings typical of CrOx and Pt catalysts, have been investigated for the PDH reaction"

[4] "Unfortunately, they achieved much lower catalytic activity or propylene selectivity for PDH"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is low-priced and abundant, as a feedstock. This addresses the challenge of depleting oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, upgrading propane to the more valuable propylene. This offers improved efficiency compared to traditional methods that may require multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: While the literature mentions that some alternative catalysts achieved lower propylene selectivity, it also describes efforts to develop catalysts with high selectivity. This suggests that PDH technology has the potential for excellent product selectivity when optimized.

4. Environmental considerations: The text mentions that conventional CrOx and Pt catalysts suffer from "environmental hostility." PDH technology using alternative catalysts could potentially offer a more environmentally friendly approach.

5. Economic benefits: By converting low-priced propane to higher-value propylene, PDH offers economic advantages over methods that rely on more expensive feedstocks.

However, it's important to note that PDH technology still faces some challenges, particularly in catalyst development. The ideal catalyst should be low-cost, environmentally friendly, highly active, and selective towards propylene production. Ongoing research, as described in the literature, aims to address these challenges and further improve PDH technology.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用价格低廉且丰富的丙烷作为原料。这解决了传统生产方法面临的石油资源枯竭问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，将丙烷升级为更有价值的丙烯。与可能需要多个步骤或复杂分离的传统方法相比，这提供了更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：虽然文献提到一些替代催化剂的丙烯选择性较低，但也描述了开发高选择性催化剂的努力。这表明PDH技术在优化后具有出色的产品选择性潜力。

4. 环境考虑：文本提到传统的CrOx和Pt催化剂存在"环境敌意"问题。使用替代催化剂的PDH技术可能提供更环保的方法。

5. 经济效益：通过将低价丙烷转化为高价值丙烯，PDH比依赖更昂贵原料的方法提供了经济优势。

然而，需要注意的是，PDH技术仍面临一些挑战，特别是在催化剂开发方面。理想的催化剂应该是低成本、环境友好、高活性和高丙烯选择性的。文献中描述的持续研究旨在解决这些挑战并进一步改进PDH技术。
