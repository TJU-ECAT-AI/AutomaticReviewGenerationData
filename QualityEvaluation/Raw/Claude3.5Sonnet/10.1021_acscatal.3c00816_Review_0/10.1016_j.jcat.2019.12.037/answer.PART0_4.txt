[1] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."

[2] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation"

[3] "Thus, it is still urgent and challenging to design a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the issue of global oil depletion by providing an alternative production route.

2. It upgrades low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, improving resource utilization.

3. It offers high selectivity towards propylene production.

4. It has the potential to be more environmentally friendly than conventional methods, especially if green and low-priced catalysts can be developed.

5. It can potentially overcome the limitations of current industrial catalysts (CrOx and Pt) which suffer from high costs, environmental issues, and rapid deactivation.

PDH specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of:

1. Feedstock availability: It uses propane, which is more abundant than oil-based feedstocks used in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: Direct conversion of propane to propylene is potentially more efficient than extracting propylene from other processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, which is crucial for maximizing yield and minimizing waste.

However, the development of cost-effective, environmentally friendly catalysts with high activity and selectivity remains a challenge for PDH technology.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 它直接解决了全球石油耗竭的问题，提供了一种替代生产路径。

2. 它将低价且丰富的丙烷升级为高附加值的丙烯，提高了资源利用率。

3. 它对丙烯生产具有高选择性。

4. 如果能开发出绿色和低价的催化剂，它有潜力比传统方法更环保。

5. 它可能克服当前工业催化剂（CrOx和Pt）的局限性，这些催化剂存在成本高、环境问题和快速失活等问题。

PDH具体解决了传统生产方法在以下方面面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：它使用丙烷，比传统方法中使用的基于石油的原料更丰富。

2. 工艺效率：丙烷直接转化为丙烯可能比从其他工艺中提取丙烯更有效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，这对于最大化产率和最小化废物至关重要。

然而，开发具有高活性和选择性的经济有效、环境友好的催化剂仍然是PDH技术面临的一个挑战。
