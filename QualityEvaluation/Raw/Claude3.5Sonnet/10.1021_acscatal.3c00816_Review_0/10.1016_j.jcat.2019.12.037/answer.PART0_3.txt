[1] "Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."

[2] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene."

[3] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation"

PDH technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It utilizes abundant and low-cost propane as feedstock, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. It directly converts propane to propylene, improving process efficiency compared to more complex multi-step processes.

3. It can achieve high propylene selectivity, addressing the challenge of product selectivity.

4. It provides an alternative production route as global oil supplies deplete, reducing reliance on traditional oil-based feedstocks.

5. It has the potential to use more environmentally friendly catalysts, avoiding issues with current industrial catalysts like CrOx and Pt that are expensive, harmful to the environment, and prone to deactivation.

Overall, PDH technology offers a more sustainable, efficient, and selective route to produce propylene to meet growing global demand, while addressing key challenges of conventional production methods.

PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 它利用丰富且低成本的丙烷作为原料，解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与更复杂的多步骤过程相比，提高了工艺效率。

3. 它可以实现高丙烯选择性，解决了产品选择性的挑战。

4. 随着全球石油供应的减少，它提供了一种替代生产路线，减少了对传统石油基原料的依赖。

5. 它有潜力使用更环保的催化剂，避免了当前工业催化剂如CrOx和Pt存在的问题，这些催化剂昂贵、对环境有害，并且容易失活。

总的来说，PDH技术为满足不断增长的全球需求提供了一种更可持续、高效和选择性的丙烯生产路线，同时解决了传统生产方法的关键挑战。
