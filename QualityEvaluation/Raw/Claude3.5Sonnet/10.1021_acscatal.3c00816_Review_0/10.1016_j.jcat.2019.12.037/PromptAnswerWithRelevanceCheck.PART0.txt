<quotes>

[1] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."

[2] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation"

[3] "Thus, it is still urgent and challenging to design a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene."

</quotes>

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is low-priced and abundant, as a feedstock. This addresses the challenge of depleting oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, upgrading propane to the more valuable propylene. This offers improved efficiency compared to traditional methods that may require multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: While the literature mentions that some alternative catalysts achieved lower propylene selectivity, it also describes efforts to develop catalysts with high selectivity. This suggests that PDH technology has the potential for excellent product selectivity when optimized.

4. Environmental considerations: The text mentions that conventional CrOx and Pt catalysts suffer from "environmental hostility." PDH technology using alternative catalysts could potentially offer a more environmentally friendly approach.

5. Economic benefits: By converting low-priced propane to higher-value propylene, PDH offers economic advantages over methods that rely on more expensive feedstocks.

However, it's important to note that PDH technology still faces some challenges, particularly in catalyst development. The ideal catalyst should be low-cost, environmentally friendly, highly active, and selective towards propylene production. Ongoing research, as described in the literature, aims to address these challenges and further improve PDH technology.
