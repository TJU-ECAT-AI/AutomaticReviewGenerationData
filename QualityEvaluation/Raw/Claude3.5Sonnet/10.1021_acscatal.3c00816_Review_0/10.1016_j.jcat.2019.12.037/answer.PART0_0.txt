[1] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."

[2] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation"

[3] "Thus, it is still urgent and challenging to design a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene."

PDH technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It addresses the issue of feedstock availability by utilizing abundant and low-cost propane as a raw material.

2. It provides a direct and efficient process for converting propane to propylene, improving overall process efficiency.

3. It allows for high product selectivity, producing propylene as the main product.

4. It helps meet the growing global demand for propylene by offering an alternative production method.

5. It has the potential to be more environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods, especially if green catalysts can be developed.

PDH technology specifically addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods by:

1. Reducing dependence on oil-based feedstocks, which are becoming increasingly scarce.

2. Offering a more direct and potentially more efficient route to propylene production.

3. Providing opportunities for developing catalysts with improved selectivity and longevity.

4. Potentially lowering production costs by using cheaper feedstock and more efficient processes.

However, challenges remain in developing catalysts that are simultaneously green, low-cost, highly reactive, and selective for propylene production.
