[1] "Continuous global oil depletion provokes the urgent demand to find an alternative way to produce propylene. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) to propylene is thus of great significance in the chemical industry, upgrading low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene."

[2] "Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts used in the PDH industry exhibit very high catalytic activity, but suffer from various problems such as high price, environmental hostility, and fast deactivation"

[3] "Thus, it is still urgent and challenging to design a green and low-priced PDH catalyst with high reactivity and great selectivity to propylene."

PDH technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It addresses the issue of global oil depletion by providing an alternative production method.

2. It upgrades low-priced and abundant propane to value-added propylene, improving resource utilization.

3. It offers a more direct and potentially more efficient route to propylene compared to conventional methods.

4. It has the potential for high selectivity, which is crucial for maximizing propylene yield.

5. It can use propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than the oil-based feedstocks used in conventional methods.

However, current industrial PDH catalysts (CrOx and Pt) face challenges such as high costs, environmental issues, and rapid deactivation. The development of green, low-cost PDH catalysts with high reactivity and selectivity is still an active area of research to fully realize the potential of this technology.

PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 它通过提供替代生产方法解决了全球石油枯竭的问题。

2. 它将低价且丰富的丙烷升级为高附加值的丙烯，提高了资源利用率。

3. 与传统方法相比，它为丙烯生产提供了一条更直接、潜在效率更高的路径。

4. 它具有高选择性的潜力，这对于最大化丙烯产量至关重要。

5. 它可以使用丙烷作为原料，而丙烷比传统方法中使用的基于石油的原料更容易获得。

然而，当前工业用PDH催化剂（CrOx和Pt）面临着高成本、环境问题和快速失活等挑战。开发绿色、低成本、高反应性和高选择性的PDH催化剂仍然是一个活跃的研究领域，以充分实现这项技术的潜力。
