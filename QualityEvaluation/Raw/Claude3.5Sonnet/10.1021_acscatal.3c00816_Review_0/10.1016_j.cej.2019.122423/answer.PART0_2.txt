[1] "Propylene is an important basic petrochemical materials and it could be utilized to make plentiful downstream products such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile and propylene oxide."

[2] "Currently, propylene is mainly produced as a co-product by steam cracking or catalytic cracking processes at high temperatures"

[3] "However, the conventional processes consume a large amount of energy and usually appear a gap between demand and supply of propene"

[4] "The direct transformation of propane has being an efficient way to increase the production of propylene"

[5] "The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered to be the promising routes alternative to conventional cracking processes and has being the emerging technology used today."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Efficient use of feedstock: PDH directly converts propane to propylene, providing a more targeted and efficient route compared to conventional cracking processes that produce propylene as a co-product.

2. Energy efficiency: Unlike conventional high-temperature cracking processes that consume large amounts of energy, PDH operates at lower temperatures, potentially reducing energy consumption.

3. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH helps address the gap between propylene demand and supply that often occurs with conventional production methods.

4. Feedstock flexibility: With abundant natural gas and shale gas resources providing a stable source of propane, PDH offers flexibility in feedstock utilization.

5. Emerging technology: As an emerging technology, PDH represents a promising alternative to conventional cracking processes, indicating potential for further optimization and improvement.

6. Product selectivity: By focusing specifically on propylene production, PDH potentially offers higher selectivity compared to cracking processes that yield multiple products.

These advantages allow PDH to address challenges in feedstock availability by utilizing propane from natural gas sources, improve process efficiency through more targeted production, and potentially enhance product selectivity by focusing on propylene as the primary product.
