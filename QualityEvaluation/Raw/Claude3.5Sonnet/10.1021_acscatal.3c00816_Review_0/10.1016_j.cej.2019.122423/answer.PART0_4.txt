Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundantly available from natural gas and shale gas resources. This provides a stable and cheap source of feedstock compared to conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more efficient and direct route to produce propylene compared to steam cracking or catalytic cracking processes. It consumes less energy and can be operated at lower temperatures.

3. Product selectivity: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers higher selectivity towards propylene production compared to conventional cracking methods that produce multiple products.

4. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH technology helps address the gap between propylene demand and supply that exists with conventional production methods.

5. Emerging technology: PDH is considered an emerging technology that offers a promising alternative to conventional cracking processes for on-purpose propylene production.

6. Flexibility: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, providing greater flexibility to adjust output based on market demand compared to propylene as a co-product.

By offering these advantages, PDH technology specifically addresses the challenges of high energy consumption, limited feedstock options, and supply-demand imbalance faced by conventional propylene production methods.
