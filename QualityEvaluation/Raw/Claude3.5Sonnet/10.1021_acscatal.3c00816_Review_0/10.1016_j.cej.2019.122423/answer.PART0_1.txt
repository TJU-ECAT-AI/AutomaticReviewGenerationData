[1] "Propylene is an important basic petrochemical materials and it could be utilized to make plentiful downstream products such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile and propylene oxide."

[2] "Currently, propylene is mainly produced as a co-product by steam cracking or catalytic cracking processes at high temperatures"

[3] "However, the conventional processes consume a large amount of energy and usually appear a gap between demand and supply of propene"

[4] "The direct transformation of propane has being an efficient way to increase the production of propylene"

[5] "The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered to be the promising routes alternative to conventional cracking processes and has being the emerging technology used today."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available from natural gas and shale gas resources. This provides a stable and cheap source of feedstock compared to conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more efficient process compared to steam cracking or catalytic cracking. It consumes less energy and allows for targeted production of propylene.

3. Product selectivity: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers higher selectivity towards propylene production compared to conventional cracking methods which produce propylene as a co-product.

4. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH technology helps address the gap between propylene demand and supply that exists with conventional production methods.

5. Emerging technology: PDH is considered an emerging technology that offers a promising alternative to conventional cracking processes for on-purpose propylene production.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology provides a more efficient, selective, and economically viable route for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，这种原料可从天然气和页岩气资源中大量获得。与传统方法相比，这提供了一个稳定且廉价的原料来源。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解或催化裂解相比，PDH是一个更高效的过程。它消耗更少的能源，并允许有针对性地生产丙烯。

3. 产品选择性：作为一种非氧化过程，PDH提供了比传统裂解方法更高的丙烯生产选择性，传统方法中丙烯只是作为副产品生产。

4. 解决供需差距：PDH技术有助于解决传统生产方法中存在的丙烯供需差距。

5. 新兴技术：PDH被认为是一种新兴技术，为定向生产丙烯提供了一种很有前途的替代传统裂解工艺的方法。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术为满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求提供了一种更高效、更有选择性和更具经济可行性的路径。
