<quotes>

[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[2] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[3] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[4] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Energy efficiency: PDH is more environmentally friendly in terms of energy consumption compared to conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods.

2. Flexibility: PDH can be performed with or without oxidants, allowing for process optimization based on specific needs and conditions.

3. Targeted production: As an on-purpose technology, PDH directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, unlike traditional methods that produce a range of products.

4. Scalability: PDH can help fill the "propene gap" as existing processes cannot meet the predicted increase in demand (from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030).

5. Potential for sustainability: While current propane sources are mostly non-renewable, PDH technology can be coupled with emerging green propane production methods to create a more sustainable propylene production process.

6. Catalyst innovation: Ongoing research into active and selective catalysts is improving the efficiency and selectivity of PDH processes, addressing challenges in feedstock conversion and product yield.

By offering these advantages, PDH technology directly addresses the challenges of feedstock availability (by utilizing propane), process efficiency (through improved energy consumption and targeted production), and product selectivity (via catalyst development) faced by conventional production methods.
