[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[2] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[3] "The increased interest in direct propane dehydrogenation has been enhanced by the fall in propane price, which is the direct result of the discovery of vast shale gas reserves in North America."

[4] "Direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, unlike steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking which produce a range of products. This allows for better control over production volumes to meet growing demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from various sources, including shale gas, which has become more abundant and cheaper in recent years. This addresses feedstock availability challenges faced by conventional methods.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is highly atom-efficient compared to steam cracking and methanol-to-olefins processes. This means less waste and better utilization of raw materials.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH does not use toxic reactants or generate toxic by-products. It can potentially use renewable propane feedstocks, making it more environmentally friendly than conventional methods.

5. Selectivity: With the development of advanced catalysts, PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene. This addresses the selectivity challenges faced by less targeted production methods.

6. Adaptability: PDH can be performed with or without oxidants (O2, CO2, N2O), allowing for process flexibility and optimization based on specific requirements.

7. Economic viability: The falling prices of propane, especially from shale gas, have made PDH more economically attractive compared to other production methods.

These advantages position PDH as a promising technology to fill the growing "propene gap" that cannot be met by existing production processes alone. The continued development of selective catalysts further enhances the potential of PDH technology in addressing the challenges of propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，不同于蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解这些产生多种产品的方法。这允许更好地控制生产量以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用来自各种来源的丙烷，包括近年来变得更加丰富和便宜的页岩气。这解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

3. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解和甲醇制烯烃工艺相比，PDH具有很高的原子效率。这意味着更少的废物和更好的原材料利用。

4. 环境效益：PDH不使用有毒反应物或产生有毒副产品。它有可能使用可再生丙烷原料，使其比传统方法更环保。

5. 选择性：通过开发先进的催化剂，PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性。这解决了传统生产方法面临的选择性挑战。

6. 适应性：PDH可以在有或没有氧化剂（O2、CO2、N2O）的情况下进行，允许根据具体要求进行工艺灵活性和优化。

7. 经济可行性：丙烷价格的下降，特别是来自页岩气的丙烷，使PDH与其他生产方法相比更具经济吸引力。

这些优势使PDH成为一种有前景的技术，可以填补现有生产工艺无法单独满足的不断增长的"丙烯缺口"。选择性催化剂的持续开发进一步增强了PDH技术在解决丙烯生产挑战方面的潜力。
