[1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."

[2] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."

[4] "From an environmental perspective, ODH-CO2 has the greatest potential in the context of a circular economy. Although the formation of water is less desirable than hydrogen, ODH-CO2 has the benefit of consuming CO2 in the process, and this is often cited as the motivation for investigating this route."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Meeting growing demand: PDH directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene, which is expected to grow significantly by 2030. Conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet this growing demand alone.

2. On-purpose production: PDH is a direct, on-purpose process specifically designed to produce propylene. This allows for better control over production and helps fill the "propene gap" left by traditional methods.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can be performed with or without oxidants, allowing for process optimization based on available feedstocks. It can use propane as a direct feedstock, which is more readily available than the heavier feedstocks used in steam cracking.

4. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to the multi-step processes involved in steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

5. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking and FCC, which produce a range of products.

6. Environmental considerations: While not as environmentally friendly as oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2 (ODH-CO2), PDH still offers improvements over traditional methods in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

7. Technological maturity: PDH is already commercially implemented, making it a proven technology that can be readily scaled up to meet growing demand.

These advantages position PDH as a crucial technology to bridge the gap between propylene supply and demand, offering a more efficient, selective, and potentially more sustainable route to this essential chemical feedstock.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH直接解决了全球不断增长的丙烯需求，预计到2030年需求将显著增长。传统方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解单独无法满足这一不断增长的需求。

2. 定向生产：PDH是专门设计用于生产丙烯的直接、定向工艺。这允许更好地控制生产，并有助于填补传统方法留下的"丙烯缺口"。

3. 原料灵活性：PDH可以在有或没有氧化剂的情况下进行，允许根据可用原料优化工艺。它可以直接使用丙烷作为原料，比蒸汽裂解中使用的重质原料更容易获得。

4. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解涉及的多步骤工艺相比，可能提供更高的效率。

5. 产品选择性：与生产一系列产品的蒸汽裂解和FCC相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

6. 环境考虑：虽然不如使用CO2的氧化脱氢（ODH-CO2）环保，但PDH在能源消耗和CO2排放方面仍比传统方法有所改进。

7. 技术成熟度：PDH已经商业化实施，使其成为一种可以迅速扩大规模以满足不断增长需求的成熟技术。

这些优势使PDH成为弥合丙烯供需差距的关键技术，为这种重要的化学原料提供了更高效、更有选择性和潜在更可持续的生产路线。
