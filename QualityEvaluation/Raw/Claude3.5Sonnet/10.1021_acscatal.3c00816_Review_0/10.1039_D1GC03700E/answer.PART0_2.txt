[1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."

[2] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."

[3] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[4] "Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Energy efficiency: PDH is more environmentally friendly in terms of energy consumption compared to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the growing demand that cannot be met by existing processes.

3. Feedstock flexibility: While current propane sources are mostly non-renewable, PDH technology can be adapted to use renewable "green propane" as it becomes more available.

4. Sustainability: The development of new catalytic processes for PDH opens up possibilities for more sustainable propylene production.

5. Meeting demand: PDH helps fill the "propene gap" created by the limitations of traditional production methods.

6. Future-proofing: As a major platform chemical, propylene's importance in modern society is assured, making investments in efficient production methods like PDH valuable for the long term.

These advantages address challenges faced by conventional methods by offering a more targeted, efficient, and potentially sustainable approach to propylene production, with the flexibility to adapt to changing feedstock availability and environmental concerns.
