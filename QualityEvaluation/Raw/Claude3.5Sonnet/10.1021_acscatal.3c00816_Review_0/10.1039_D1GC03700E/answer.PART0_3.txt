[1] "Propene is a major platform chemical with applications in the polymer and chemical industry and its place in modern society is guaranteed over the coming decades."

[2] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[3] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane."

[4] "DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking."

[5] "Atom economy is a measurement of the percentage of atomic mass in the starting reagents that ends up in the final product. It serves as a useful indicator of how chemically efficient a process could be."

[6] "In the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Addressing growing demand: PDH directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene, which is expected to grow significantly by 2030. Existing processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking cannot meet this growing demand.

2. On-purpose production: PDH is a direct, on-purpose process specifically designed to produce propylene. This allows for better control over production volumes and quality compared to traditional methods where propylene is a by-product.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from various sources, including natural gas liquids and potentially renewable sources in the future. This provides flexibility in feedstock selection and potentially reduces dependence on traditional petroleum sources.

4. High atom economy: PDH has a very high atom economy of up to 95%, meaning that a large percentage of the starting material is converted into the desired product. This makes the process highly efficient in terms of raw material utilization.

5. Selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene, especially when compared to cracking processes that produce a range of products.

6. Commercial viability: PDH is the only direct dehydrogenation process that has been successfully commercialized, demonstrating its technical and economic feasibility.

7. Potential for improvement: While current catalysts face challenges like coking, ongoing research into new catalysts and process improvements offers potential for even better performance in the future.

These advantages collectively make PDH a promising technology to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 满足日益增长的需求：PDH直接解决了全球日益增长的丙烯需求，预计到2030年需求将显著增长。现有的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解等工艺无法满足这一增长需求。

2. 定向生产：PDH是专门设计用于生产丙烯的直接、定向工艺。与传统方法相比，这允许更好地控制产量和质量，在传统方法中丙烯只是副产品。

3. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用来自各种来源的丙烷，包括天然气液体和未来潜在的可再生资源。这提供了原料选择的灵活性，并可能减少对传统石油来源的依赖。

4. 高原子经济性：PDH具有高达95%的原子经济性，意味着大部分起始材料被转化为所需产品。这使得该过程在原材料利用方面非常高效。

5. 选择性：与产生一系列产品的裂解工艺相比，PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性。

6. 商业可行性：PDH是唯一成功商业化的直接脱氢工艺，证明了其技术和经济可行性。

7. 改进潜力：虽然当前的催化剂面临结焦等挑战，但对新催化剂和工艺改进的持续研究为未来更好的性能提供了潜力。

这些优势共同使PDH成为一项有前景的技术，可以解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
