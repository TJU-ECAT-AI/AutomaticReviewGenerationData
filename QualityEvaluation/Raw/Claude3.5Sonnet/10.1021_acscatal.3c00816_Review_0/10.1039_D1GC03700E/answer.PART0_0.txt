[1] "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

[2] "Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

[3] "The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

[4] "At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Energy efficiency: PDH is more environmentally friendly in terms of energy consumption compared to conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking methods.

2. Flexibility: PDH can be performed with or without oxidants, allowing for process optimization based on specific needs and conditions.

3. Targeted production: As an on-purpose technology, PDH directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, unlike traditional methods that produce a range of products.

4. Scalability: PDH can help fill the "propene gap" as existing processes cannot meet the predicted increase in demand (from 130 megatonnes in 2019 to 191 megatonnes by 2030).

5. Potential for sustainability: While current propane sources are mostly non-renewable, PDH technology can be coupled with emerging green propane production methods to create a more sustainable propylene production process.

6. Catalyst innovation: Ongoing research into active and selective catalysts is improving the efficiency and selectivity of PDH processes, addressing challenges in feedstock conversion and product yield.

By offering these advantages, PDH technology directly addresses the challenges of feedstock availability (by utilizing propane), process efficiency (through improved energy consumption and targeted production), and product selectivity (via catalyst development) faced by conventional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 能源效率：与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化方法相比，PDH在能源消耗方面更加环保。

2. 灵活性：PDH可以在有或没有氧化剂的情况下进行，允许根据特定需求和条件优化工艺。

3. 定向生产：作为一种定向技术，PDH直接解决了丙烯需求增长的问题，不同于传统方法会产生一系列产品。

4. 可扩展性：PDH可以帮助填补"丙烯缺口"，因为现有工艺无法满足预计的需求增长（从2019年的1.3亿吨增加到2030年的1.91亿吨）。

5. 可持续性潜力：虽然目前的丙烷来源主要是非可再生的，但PDH技术可以与新兴的绿色丙烷生产方法相结合，创造更可持续的丙烯生产工艺。

6. 催化剂创新：对活性和选择性催化剂的持续研究正在提高PDH工艺的效率和选择性，解决原料转化和产品产率方面的挑战。

通过提供这些优势，PDH技术直接解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性（利用丙烷）、工艺效率（通过改善能源消耗和定向生产）和产品选择性（通过催化剂开发）等挑战。
