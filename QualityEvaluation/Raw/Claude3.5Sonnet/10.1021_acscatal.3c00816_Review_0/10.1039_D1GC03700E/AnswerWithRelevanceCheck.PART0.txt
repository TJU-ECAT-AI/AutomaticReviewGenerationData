          "Direct dehydrogenation can be performed either with or without an oxidant present, and O2, CO2 and N2O can all participate as oxidants to form propene from propane. The discovery of active and selective catalysts is central to the development of these on-purpose technologies and is the focus of the current review."

"Annual propene production was around 130 megatonnes in 2019 and is predicted to increase to 191 megatonnes by 2030. Significantly, the expected growth in propane demand cannot be met by existing processes, which are based on steam-cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). Instead, direct or on-purpose processes are being developed to fill the so-called propene gap."

"The direct formation of propene from propane is a well-established commercial process, which on the basis of energy consumption, is environmentally preferred to the current large-scale sources of propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking."

"At present, sources of propane are mostly non-renewable, but the development of technologies to produce renewable green propane are gaining traction, which coupled with new catalytic processes will provide the platform to produce green propene."

"Direct propane dehydrogenation satisfies many principles of green chemistry in comparison to SC and MTO benchmarks: it is highly atom-economic, does not use toxic reactants (or generate toxic by-products) and can in principle, utilise renewable feedstocks."

"DDH is to date the only reaction that has been operated commercially. The most active catalysts reported in the literature are based on chromium oxide or platinum promoted with tin oxide, but even these require frequent regeneration due to coking."

"In the case of dehydrogenation only H2 is generated as a by-product, meaning an atom economy of 95% is possible."

"From an environmental perspective, ODH-CO2 has the greatest potential in the context of a circular economy. Although the formation of water is less desirable than hydrogen, ODH-CO2 has the benefit of consuming CO2 in the process, and this is often cited as the motivation for investigating this route."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, addressing the growing demand that cannot be met by existing processes like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. Energy efficiency: PDH is more environmentally friendly in terms of energy consumption compared to traditional methods.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from various sources, including potential renewable sources in the future.

4. High atom economy: PDH has a very high atom economy of up to 95%, making it highly efficient in terms of raw material utilization.

5. Environmental benefits: PDH does not use toxic reactants or generate toxic by-products, and it can potentially use renewable feedstocks.

6. Process flexibility: PDH can be performed with or without oxidants, allowing for process optimization based on specific requirements.

7. Commercial viability: PDH is the only direct dehydrogenation process that has been successfully commercialized.

8. Catalyst innovation: Ongoing research into active and selective catalysts is improving the efficiency and selectivity of PDH processes.

9. Potential for sustainability: PDH technology can be coupled with emerging green propane production methods to create a more sustainable propylene production process.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. PDH offers a more targeted, efficient, and potentially sustainable approach to propylene production, with the flexibility to adapt to changing feedstock availability and environmental concerns.
