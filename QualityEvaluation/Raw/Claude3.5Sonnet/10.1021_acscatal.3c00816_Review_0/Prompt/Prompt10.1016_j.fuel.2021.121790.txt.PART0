Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a prospective benign process for the production of propylene, but generally depends on high-price Pt and toxic Cr(VI) catalysts that often suffer from the rapid deactivation derived from metal sintering and severe coke deposition. To overcome these problems, the breakthroughs in an alternative catalyst design with efficient, low-cost and eco-friendly play a crucial role in successfully developing this process. Here, we facilely fabricate the bimetallic-site catalyst of Ni-Zn anchored in the zeolitic framework of silicalite-1 (depicted as NiZn-S-1) by employing ligand-protected strategy, which performs high temperature stability. Under comparable conditions, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) exhibits superior catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with low deactivation rate (0.0778 h1) and great propylene selectivity (>90%) after 30 h on stream. In particular, the catalytic performance on this catalyst almost keeps same as that of fresh catalyst after 4 successive oxidationreduction cycles. Multiple characterizations further demonstrate that the enhancement of PDH performance ought to be attributed to the synergistic effect between bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, which favors the selective activation of CH bond and propylene desorption to reduce the formation of coke species with high graphitization degree, boosting the improvement of catalyst stability. The design of novel bimetallic-sites catalyst can give a new idea on the development of alternative PDH catalysts with economical- and environment-friendly in the future.

1. Introduction
Propylene as a basic chemical raw material has been extensively applied to produce a plenty of downstream products (e.g., polypropylene, propylene oxide and acrylonitrile, etc.)
[1]
. Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand
[2]
. In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes. In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins
[3]
and propane dehydrogenation (PDH)
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
, etc., for propylene production are desirable.
Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases
[4]
,
[5]
. Currently, two representative of PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts have been commercially applied in the PDH process
[1]
,
[7]
,
[8]
. Such catalysts perform high activity and selectivity, but some corresponding drawbacks are accompanied, 1) the high-price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI); 2) the rapid deactivation caused by the sintering of metal particles and the coke deposition; 3) the successive regeneration resulting in activity attenuation and massive CO2 emissions. Thus, developing alternative PDH catalysts with low-cost and eco-friendly are imperative.
To cater to the foregoing issues, numerous groups' efforts have been dedicated to design various catalysts, such as the supported catalysts with active metal oxides (e.g., CoOx
[9]
,
[10]
,
[11]
, VOx
[4]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
, GaOx
[15]
, and SnOx
[16]
, etc.), which exhibit considerable activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction. Nevertheless, such catalysts still yet suffer from rapid deactivation easily. Through analysis in-depth, the catalytic stabilities of catalysts strongly rely on the structural properties of metal active phases on the supports. For instance, large Co3O4 crystallites formed over the CoOx/Al2O3 are easily reduced to metallic Co particles in favor of propane cracking reactions
[17]
. However, if the CoOx species are confined into the silanols of SiBeta support, the ultrasmall metallic Co formed in situ during the PDH reaction can become dehydrogenation active sites
[11]
. A similar phenomenon is also reflected in the VOx-based catalysts. Yan's group
[18]
has found that low-polymerized V(IV) species in the γ-Al2O3 support are more active than isolated V species in PDH reaction. However, David et al.
[19]
has reported that the isolated VOx species in the MCM-41 perform superior activity than the oligomeric species. To sum up, the complexity and uncontrollability in the chemical speciations of active phases (from isolated species, polymeric species to nanoclusters) on different supports have been always a roadblock for the further exploration of PDH reaction.
Based on the above status quo, some scholars' attention has turned to single-site catalysts in recent years, which play Lewis acid site role in the PDH reaction. This strategy not only can realize the precise design of active sites in the catalysts, but also can allow to easily elucidate the PDH reaction route. Miller et al.
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
has fabricated single-site Zn(II), Fe(II) and Co(II) on silica catalysts, which perform excellent propylene selectivity above 95%. Further calculations with hybrid density functional theory support a non-redox mechanism for activation of CH and H-H bonds. Yang et al.
[23]
also has reported γ-Al2O3 sheet-stabilized isolate Co2+ for catalytic PDH. The catalyst has exhibited the catalytic stability in highly selective PDH reaction (propylene selectivity > 97%), owing to the tetrahedral Co2+ isolated site stabilized on the γ-Al2O3, promoting propylene desorption to inhibit coke deposition and other byproducts and to free the active Co site Recently, Xiao's group
[24]
has designed single-site Fe(II) incorporated into silicalite-1 zeolite catalyst (FeS-1-EDTA), which performs high conversion of 26.3 %, high stability of 200 h and C2H4 selectivity of 97.5 % for ethane dehydrogenation, while it's not very effective for PDH (a conversion of 17.2% and C3H6 selectivity of 52.2%). Seen from the reported studies, although both the catalyst stability and propylene selectivity are improved to some extent, the (intrinsic) catalytic activities of single-site catalysts are undesirable.
Stimulated by the aforementioned researches, Ni-based catalysts seem expected to solve the foregoing issue, mainly due to the superior ability in activating CH and HH bonds. Such catalysts have been widely applied in dry reforming of methane and perform excellent catalytic performance
[25]
,
[26]
. While, few literatures have studied the supported Ni catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, mainly ascribed to be easily reduced to zerovalent Ni nanoparticles that usually exhibit poor stability, rapid coke deposition and low alkene selectivity
[27]
,
[28]
. To change this actuality, the Ni-based catalyst with a promoter (e.g., NiSn
[29]
, NiS
[30]
and NiP
[31]
, etc.) has been studied for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. However, to the best of our knowledge, excellent catalytic performance has been not achieved over the reported Ni-based catalysts.
Herein, we facilely fabricate the bimetallic Ni-Zn site anchored in the siliceous zeolite framework (silicalite-1, S-1) by ligand-protected method. A series of as-prepared catalysts are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), H2 pulse chemisorption, in situ Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (in situ FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, etc., to gain deep insight into the physico-chemical properties. Catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts is evaluated for PDH reaction in a fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. Moreover, possible reaction mechanism of propane on the bimetallic site is further investigated to better understand the stability of novel NiZn-S-1 catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, >98 %), Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, AR, 25 wt% aqueous solution), ethylenediamine monohydrate (EDA, AR, 98 %), pyridine (Py, GC, >99.9 %) were supplied by Aladdin Chemical Reagent Ltd.. Ni(NO3)·6H2O (AR, 98 %) and Zn(NO3)·6H2O (AR, 98 %) were purchased by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Ltd., China.
2.2. Catalyst synthesis
Synthesis of silicalite-1 (S-1). S-1 zeolite was synthesized with a molar ratio of 1.0 TEOS: 0.4 TPAOH: 35 H2O
[32]
. A specific procedure was that 8.32 g of TEOS and 13.0 g of TPAOH were added in 15 mL of de-ionized water, and vigorously stirred for 4 h. The obtained mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and crystallized at 170 C for 4 days. The resulting white solid was filtrated and washed with de-ionized water until pH of 7, dried at 80 C for overnight, and then calcined in air at 550 C for 8 h.
Synthesis of NiZn-S-1. The NiZn-S-1 zeolite samples were prepared with a molar composition of TEOS: TPAOH: H2O: a[Ni(EDA)2](NO3)2: b[Zn(EDA)2](NO3)2 = 1: 0.4: 35: a: b (na/nb = 3/1, 2/1, 1/1, 1/2 and 1/3). A certain quality of Ni(NO3)3·6H2O and Zn(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in 10 mL of de-ionized water, followed by adding 2 mL EDA and stirring for another 0.5 h, obtaining the solution A. The solution B was prepared by adding 8.32 g TEOS and 13.0 g TPAOH in 15 mL of de-ionized water, and stirring for 4 h. Afterwards, the solution A was slowly dropped into the solution B, stirring for another 2 h. The remaining steps were followed the S-1 preparation process. The final samples were named as xNiyZn-S-1, where × and y expressed theoretical Ni and Zn loadings, respectively. The actual values could be seen in Tables 1 and S1.
Synthesis of NiZn/S-1. The sample was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. As a typical case, 0.0097 g of Ni(NO3)3·6H2O and 0.0033 g of Zn(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in 10 mL of de-ionized water and made 1 g S-1 disperse the prepared solution. After rotation evaporation at 50 C for 3 h, calcining at 550 C for 8 h, the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 was obtained.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
2.3.1. General characterization
Elemental compositions of the samples were measured on an inductively coupled plasma with atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, iCAP-6300, Thermo). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a D/MAXRB XRD instrument (Rigaku, Japan) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm, 40 kV, 30 mA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a FEI Titan G2 TF30 with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. HAADF-STEM images were performed on a FISCHIONE electron microscopy with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV and EDS mappings were performed on a CCD system. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured at 196 C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020
[33]
.
2.3.2. Optical spectroscopy measurements
In situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of hydroxyls, pyridine-dosing adsorption and CO-dosing adsorption on the samples were measured on a Bruker VERTEX 70 spectroscopy. For the CO-FTIR experiment, the sample was reduced consisting for 2 h at 600 C under 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min). Then, cooled the sample to 30 C and the sample was exposed to the CO vapors at 30 C for 30 min under 50% CO/Ar (10 mL/min) and followed by purification for 30 min under Ar (30 mL/min). Other FTIR operational procedures referred to our previous studies
[33]
,
[34]
. The skeletal vibrations IR spectra were performed on the spectrometer by using the KBr method.
C3H8-dosing FTIR experiments were measured to trace dynamic conversion process in adsorbed species and intermediate products on the samples, in order to elucidate possible PDH reaction and deactivation mechanisms. The sample wafer (10  15 mg) was firstly pre-treated in a stainless steel cell at 500 C (higher temperature was not affordable for the instrument) for 30 min with 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min). At each measured temperature, the sample was retained 10 min before the acquisition of IR spectrum. Afterwards, the sample was cooled to 100 C, followed by purging in Ar for 30 min. Background spectrum was recorded. Subsequently, the 10% C3H8/Ar mixture (20 mL/min) was dosed into the cell for 10 min, and then was purged in Ar for 30 min. Final spectrum was collected at 100 C. The spectrum of 200, 300, 400 and 500 C were obtained, following the above procedures.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiles of catalyst samples were conducted on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe II spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The diffuse reflectance UVVis spectra were obtained on a TU-1901 spectrophotometer in the diffuse reflectance mode equipped with an integrating sphere with BaSO4 as the standard for solid samples. The Raman spectra were recorded on a HR800 Raman spectrometer equipped with an Ar excitation source (λ = 514 nm) at room temperature.
2.3.3. Temperature programmed measurements
H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and H2 pulse chemisorption were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 analyzer
[33]
. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst sample (ca. 100 mg) was pre-treated under a Ar flow at 500 C for 1 h, cooling to room temperature, and then 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) was introduced. The sample reduction process was conducted from 50 to 1000 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min for the signal recording. For H2 pulse chemisorption, 400 mg sample in U-tube reactor was first reduced under 10% H2/Ar at 600 C for 1 h using a heating rate of 10 C/min. Then, the sample was purged with Ar at this temperature for 1 h and cooled to 30 C for the chemisorption measurements at each 5 min interval according to the pulse method until saturation adsorption. The volume of the loop was 0.141 mL.
Differential thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTA) was performed on a STA449F3 Jupiter instrument. The variation in the weight of spent sample (ca. 20 mg) was monitored by increasing the temperature in air (50 mL/min) from 50 to 800 C (10 C/min).
C3H6-TPD experiment was also measured to investigate the interaction between propylene and active sites. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst (ca. 10 mg) was pre-treated at 600 C for 1 h with 10% H2/Ar (30 mL/min), and then cooled down to 30 C before C3H6 adsorption. Subsequently, the 10% C3H6/Ar (30 mL/min) was dosed into the system at 30 C until the samples adsorbed to saturation. Then, the above sample was exposed to Ar (30 mL/min) for 1 h to remove gaseous and physical adsorption C3H6 molecules. Desorption process was performed from 30 to 700 C with a heating rate of 10 C/min. The corresponding C3H6 desorption signal was measured using a TCD detector.
2.4. Catalytic testing
PDH experiment was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor equipped with a quartz tube (20 mm × 7 mm × 40 cm, corresponding to outer diameter, inner diameter and length). In a typical experiment, the catalyst (ca. 320 mg, 40 to 60 mesh) was placed in the center of reactor. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was pre-treated at 600 C with 10% H2/Ar flow of 30 mL/min for 1 h and the feed was switched to a gas mixture containing 5.0 mL/min C3H8 and 16.5 mL/min Ar as the balance gas. The dehydrogenation reaction was performed at 600 C and the outlet products were analyzed on an online gas chromatograph (Fuli, GC9790II) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). After the reaction, the system was cooled down to room temperature with Ar flow as purge gas. The regeneration test was carried out and the sample was calcined in air at 600 C for 2 h to remove the coke. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity were calculated as follows:
(1)
(2)
The turnover frequency (TOF) of C3H8, the formation rate of C3H6, and the deactivation rate constant (kd) were defined using the following equations:
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)
Where FC3H8, X and Y were the C3H8 flow rate, the C3H8 conversion, and the C3H6 selectivity, respectively; mcat. and wNi represented the weight of catalyst and the weight of supported Ni in the catalyst, respectively. Therein, the formation rate of C3H6 was determined under integral conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of bimetallic Ni-Zn zeolite catalysts
In this work, a feasible route is proposed to fabricate bimetallic Ni-Zn species into the siliceous zeolite (NiZn-S-1), as depicted in
Scheme 1
. Firstly, the Ni2+ and Zn2+ cations are coordinated with EDA to form the Ni[(EDA)2]2+ and Zn[(EDA)2]2+ complexes, which are added into the S-1 zeolitic gel. During in situ crystallization, these metal precursors can be easily captured by the Si(OH)4 tetrahedron generated from the hydrolysis of TEOS. After calcination, the bimetallic species may be located in the S-1 with at least three possible chemical speciations, such as anchored into the S-1 framework, encapsulated in the S-1 and fell in between, which strongly rely on the metal loadings
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
. To achieve the fabrication of bimetallic Ni-Zn site, therefore, the relatively low metal loadings are considered in this paper. For comparison, monometallic Ni-S-1 and Zn-S-1 catalysts are also synthesized under similar processes. The actual Ni and Zn loadings of as-synthesized catalysts are measured by ICP-AES (cf. Tables 1 and S1).

3.2. Structural properties of as-synthesized Ni-Zn zeolite catalysts
Fig. 1
a and S1 provide the XRD patterns of all the as-synthesized catalysts to verify possible change in the zeolitic structures. Typical characteristic diffraction peaks assigned to MFI structures can be observed for all the samples
[32]
. Besides, no characteristic diffraction peaks associated with Ni-Zn species can be detected
[37]
,
[38]
, implying no large aggregated metal clusters in the as-synthesized samples. Notably, the intensities of diffraction peaks are slightly strengthened for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1 samples, possibly due to single metal cations accelerating the induction of nucleation and crystallization of zeolites during in situ synthesis
[32]
,
[37]
,
[39]
. However, the above phenomenon cannot be found on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, and the intensities of all peaks are weakened on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, which may be caused by the difference in the chemical speciations of bimetallic Ni-Zn species in the S-1.

N2 adsorption isotherms of S-1, 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 zeolite samples are shown in
Fig. 1
b. All the samples exhibit typical I type isotherms, assigned to the micropore material property
[32]
. After the incorporation of Ni and Zn species in the S-1, no change in the BET surface area and total pore volume can be seen, while a slight decline in the micropore surface area and micropore volume is detected (cf.
Table 1
). Two possible situations may be used to explain the phenomenon. One is ascribed to the formation of ultrasmall Ni-Zn nanoclusters occupied in micropores, as the PtZn@S-1 catalysts reported in the literatures
[36]
,
[37]
,
[40]
. Another is associated with the formation of few mesoporous structures during bimetallic Ni-Zn species incorporated into the framework of S-1. In either case, the decline is not enough to affect the mass transfer of the reactants and products.

TEM, HAADF-STEM and EDX elemental mapping images are provided to analysis the morphologies of zeolites and the distributions of Ni-Zn elements in the structures, as shown in
Fig. 2
. The nanosized zeolite crystals can be observed (cf.
Fig. 2
a and d)
[32]
,
[36]
. For the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 zeolite, no Ni-Zn nanoclusters can be seen in the TEM images. Meanwhile, it also does not observe small bright spots associated with Ni-Zn nanoclusters in the HAADF-STEM image, only the appearance of large bright region, spreading all over the zeolite (cf.
Fig. 2
c). The corresponding EDX elemental mapping images perform that the Ni and Zn elements are evenly distributed in the internal surface of zeolite. All the abovementioned phenomena point out that the Ni and Zn species are supposed to be anchored in siliceous zeolite framework, rather than the formation of Ni-Zn nanoclusters. This is consistent with the second explanation of change in the pore structure. However, the Ni-Zn nanoclusters with 5  7 nm can be found on the external surface of 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 zeolite (cf.
Fig. 2
d, e and f). Furthermore, the corresponding EDX elemental mapping images show that the Zn species are uniformly dispersed onto the surface of zeolite, but the Ni species are easily aggregated after high temperature treatment, which can verify the XRD results.

3.3. The nature of bimetallic Ni-Zn species in the zeolite catalysts
To further confirm the nature of metal active sites in the as-synthesized zeolites, various characterization techniques have been employed.
Fig. 3
a gives in situ FTIR difference spectra (derived from the results of
Fig. S2
) of reduced 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 samples with CO adsorption for 30 min and then degassing for 30 min at 30 C (to removal the gaseous and physical adsorbed CO). In all the IR spectrum, a main absorption band at 2045 cm1 on the three zeolites can be observed. At present, most studies have ascribed the infrared absorption peak at this position to linearly adsorbed CO on metal nanoparticles (i.e., Pt, Ni and Zn, etc.)
[36]
,
[37]
,
[39]
,
[40]
. This assignment is inconsistent with the TEM observations. Meanwhile, Yu et al. has reported that the Zn2+ cations can be anchored in zeolitic framework and keep stable during the reduction process until 750 C
[36]
. Corma et al. also has detected the appearance of band at 2042 cm1 assigned to the single-site Ir atoms of the 0.24Ir@MWW
[41]
. To clarify the specific assignment of this band, the 0.2Ni-S-1 zeolite as a typical representative is treated by H2 and Ar, respectively. The FTIR difference spectra of CO adsorbed on the 0.2Ni-S-1-H2 and 0.2Ni-S-1-Ar samples are shown in
Figs. S2
c, S2d and S3. Surprisingly, the band at 2045 cm1 also can be seen in the 0.2Ni-S-1-Ar sample. Thus, it can confirm that the band at 2045 cm1 in this work should be ascribed to the linearly adsorbed CO on the metallic sites, rather than the metal nanoparticles. This situation implies that the metallic sites are very stable and are difficult to be reduced (seen in the next H2-TPR profiles)
[20]
,
[24]
,
[31]
,
[36]
. The intensities of the band at 2045 cm1 on the three samples are consistent with its actual metal loadings. Besides, the band of bridging CO on Ni species at 1887 cm1 is apparently affected by the support, because the band is also found on the S-1 (cf.
Fig. S2
).

To further prove the above fact, the reduction abilities of 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Zn-S-1, 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 samples are tested by H2-TPR (cf.
Fig. 3
b and S4). As shown in
Fig. S4
, a broad H2 consumption peak at about 300  450 C is observed on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 sample, which can be assigned to the reduction of bulk NiO crystallites located on the external surface of S-1 by a weak interaction
[37]
. The result is in line with the TEM observations. Interestingly, H2 consumption peaks on the 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 samples cannot completely detected, even if the reduction temperature is up to 1000 C. Meanwhile,
Fig. 3
c gives H2 pulse chemisorption profiles of 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 samples after reduced at 600 C. After H2-dosing at each interval, the H2 signals keep basically unchanged, indicating that no zerovalent Ni nanoparticles that can adsorb H2 molecules are formed. The above results can further indicate that the Ni and Zn species are indeed anchored into the framework of S-1 zeolite, leading to the formation of unreducible monometallic sites on the 0.2Ni-S-1 (and 0.2Zn-S-1) and bimetallic sites on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 that remain good stability at high temperatures, which also give an evidence for the assignment of the abovementioned band at 2045 cm1 in the CO-FTIR spectra.
XPS spectroscopy is implemented to characterize the valence state and chemical environment of elements Ni and Zn in the S-1 zeolite. XPS spectra of 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalysts are collected before and after depth profile (cf.
Fig. 3
d, S5 and S6). In the Ni2p and Zn2p XPS spectra of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, no XPS signals associated with Ni and Zn species can be found. After depth profile (Ar+ bombardment twice, 50 s of each time), however, the Ni2p peak at 854.2 eV assigned to the divalent Ni species and the Zn2p peak at 1022.7 eV associated with the divalent Zn species can be detected
[38]
,
[41]
,
[42]
. The above results further suggest that the divalent Ni and Zn species are absolutely anchored into the framework of S-1 zeolite, rather than on the external surface, which coincides with those abovementioned results. Besides, special attention is that the Ni2p and Zn2p binding energies values of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 shift lower by 1.0 eV and higher by 0.4 eV, respectively, relative to the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni-S-1 zeolites (cf.
Figs. S5 and S6
), implying that the Ni site and Zn site ought to be adjacent to each other, constituting a group of synergistic active sites. A similar fact over the PtNi@S-1 zeolites also has been proved by Liu et al.
[37]
.
Furthermore, the UVVis and Raman spectra are applied to explore the status of Ni and Zn species on the framework of zeolite catalysts. As shown in
Fig. 3
e, no absorption bands can be observed in the S-1. After incorporating Ni and/or Zn species, two absorption bands at 276 and 417 nm on the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, and two absorption bands at 247 and 336 nm on the 0.2Zn-S-1 appear, which can be ascribed to the charge-transfer of O2  Ni2+ and O2  Zn2+, respectively. The low wavelength absorption bands at 276 and 247 nm are associated with the tetrahedral Ni2+ and Zn2+ species, respectively
[37]
. While, the high wavelength absorption bands at 417 and 336 nm are assigned to the pseudo-tetrahedral Ni2+ and Zn2+ species, possibly caused by the surrounding Si-OH groups (cf.
Fig. 4
A), which is in line with the Miller et al. reported
[20]
. For the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, the absorption bands at 247 and 336 nm assigned to the tetrahedral Zn2+ species can be seen, but the band associated with the tetrahedral Ni2+ species cannot be detected, implying the formation of bulk Ni nanoclusters, which is in line with the TEM observations.

Fig. 3
f gives the Raman spectra of S-1, 0.2Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 zeolites. Except for the absorption bands of S-1 at 296, 378 and 808 cm1, the 0.2Zn-S-1 catalyst is prevailed by the bands at 247, 446 and 515 cm1, associated with the linkage of stable Zn-O-Si species (the formation of monometallic Znδ+ sites)
[24]
. For the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, a new Raman band at 471 cm1 emerges, implying the formation of monometallic Niδ+ sites (Ni-O-Si species). Notably, the band at 446 cm1 occurs a red shift on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, further suggesting that there is a close interaction between Niδ+ site and Znδ+ site, which coincides with the XPS results.
According to the above results, the Ni and/or Zn species are proved to be anchored in the framework of S-1 zeolite with the monometallic sites and/or bimetallic sites. Both of them are associated with SiOH groups.
Fig. 4
A shows the hydroxyls vibrational FTIR spectra of the as-prepared zeolite samples. For the S-1, four infrared absorption peaks at 3740, 3725, 3690 and 3520 cm1 can be observed, which can be assigned to the terminal silanols at external surface, geminal silanols in the internal cavities, vicinal silanols in the internal pores, and silanol nest interacted by H-bonding, respectively (cf.
Fig. S7
A)
[43]
. Relative to the S-1, the intensities of the bands at 3740 and 3520 cm1 are weakened slightly on the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1, while the intensities of bands at 3725 and 3690 cm1 are weakened apparently. The results show that the monometallic Niδ+ or Znδ+ species are easily captured by the geminal and vicinal silanols in the internal of zeolite during in situ synthesis, forming the Si-O-Ni or Si-O-Zn structures that coordinated with terminal silanols (cf.
Fig. S7
B), which is in line with the UVVis and Raman spectra. While for the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, except for the band at 3520 cm1, the intensities of other bands are weakened obviously, implying that possible chemical speciation of bimetallic Ni-Zn site is the [Ni-O-Si-O-Zn] species by the role of those bands, which can prove the XRD results. As for the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, the intensities of all the bands are weakened obviously due to the occupation of Ni-Zn nanoclusters.
Further,
Fig. 4
B provides the skeletal vibration FTIR spectra of the samples. The characteristic vibration bands at 1000  1100 cm1 are associated with the five- and six- member ring of T-O-T in the MFI structure
[37]
,
[44]
. A band at 1063 cm1 assigned to the skeletal vibrations of Si-O-Si can be found on the S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, implying that the Ni-Zn species cannot be incorporated into the internal framework of S-1 by incipient wetness impregnation. When the Ni and/or Zn species are introduced during in situ synthesis, however, the band ascribed to T-O-T shifts towards high frequency, changing in the about 25 cm1 for the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 and 43 cm1 for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Zn-S-1. The differences are determined by the symmetry of Niδ+ and Znδ+ cations in the framework of S-1. The better the symmetry, the smaller the shift. This fully implies that the Niδ+ and Znδ+ cations are adjacent to each other in the framework of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, which is consistent with XPS and Raman results.
Depending on the above results, the monometallic sites on the 0.2Ni-S-1 (and 0.2Zn-S-1), and the bimetallic Ni-Zn sites on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 are fabricated, which ought to serve as the dehydrogenation active sites for the PDH reaction. Hence, the acidic properties of as-prepared catalysts become very important. The in situ FTIR spectra of the samples with pyridine adsorption are presented in
Fig. 5
, providing detailed information about the specific assignments and the amount of active sites. Only one band at 1446 cm1 on the S-1 sample can be observed, assigning to the Si-OH groups
[43]
. When the Ni and Zn species are anchored into the S-1, a new IR absorption band at 1452 cm1 is detected, which can be ascribed to the abovementioned monometallic (Niδ+ or Znδ+) site and bimetallic Ni-Zn site species, acting as the Lewis acid sites. The acidic amount are calculated by the equation reported by Emeis
[45]
. The results can be seen in
Table 2
. The total acidic densities of all the samples are as follows: 0.2Ni-S-1 (2.83 μmol·g1) < 0.2Zn-S-1 (3.94 μmol·g1) < 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 (4.68 μmol·g1), which is accordance with the actual metal loadings. When the desorption temperature is up to 400 C, the band at 1446 cm1 disappears absolutely, indicating that the acidity of SiOH groups is relatively weak. Meanwhile, the intensity of the band at 1452 cm1 is weakened partially, implying that most of Ni and Zn species act as weak Lewis acid sites. Notably, the amount of strong Lewis acid sites still abide by the above regulation, which ought to be authentically considered as the active sites for the PDH reaction at high temperatures.

3.4. Catalytic performance for PDH reaction
In view of the foregoing characterization results, the monometallic (Niδ+ or Znδ+) sites and bimetallic Ni-Zn sites with strong Lewis acidity on the S-1 zeolite have been fabricated, which ought to be supposed to the active sites in the alkane dehydrogenation reaction. To determine the appropriate PDH reaction conditions over the NiZn-S-1 catalysts,
Fig. S8
gives the propylene selectivity as a function of propane conversion at different temperatures with a WSHV of 7.4 h1. A similar trend in the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 can be found, that is, the propylene selectivity decreases with the increasing of propane conversion. Relative to the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1, the downtrend is relatively slower for the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 below 600 C, which can attain appropriate propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
Given the above situation, catalytic performance of all the catalysts for the PDH is tested at 600 C with a WHSV of 7.4 h1. As shown in
Fig. 6
a and b, the initial propane conversion of 20.0 % with the 84.8 % propylene selectivity is achieved over the 0.2Ni-S-1 catalyst. After 8 h, both the conversion and selectivity dramatically decrease to 8.0 % and 67.1 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the formation rate of propylene is also on a continuously downward trend from 3.9 to 1.3 mol·g-1Ni·h1 (cf.
Fig. 6
c). This can attribute to the carbon deposition caused by overcracking of propane (cf.
Fig. S9
), rather than the Ni sintering due to the high temperature stability of monometallic Niδ+ sites (cf.
Fig. 3
b). Although the propane conversion and propylene selectivity over the 0.2Zn-S-1 are <10% and 70%, respectively, it's worth noting that the propylene selectivity keeps a stable value, indicating that the monometallic Znδ+ sites ought to guarantee the catalyst stability. When the Ni and Zn species are co-incorporated into S-1, excellent catalytic performance can be achieved over the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst. The initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity can reach 32.5% and 90.3%, respectively. After about 2.0 h on stream, both can remain unchanged, above 20 % and 90%. Meanwhile, the formation rate of propylene just drops from 6.6 to 4.3 mol·g-1Ni·h1, and afterwards, it can remain stable. By contrast, the catalytic performance of impregnated 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 sample is not so desirable, including the propane conversion, propylene selectivity, propylene formation rate and especially for the stability. The above results fully confirm that the synergistic effect between Niδ+ site and Znδ+ site over the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 plays a key role in improving the catalytic performance of PDH reaction. To further prove it, the catalytic tests of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 treated by H2 and Ar are carried out at the same condition (cf.
Fig. S10
), it can be found that the propane conversion, propylene selectivity and catalyst stability over the two samples are very similar. The result further indicates that the enhanced catalytic performance should be ascribed to the contribution of bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, rather than the role of Ni-Zn alloys (or nanoparticles) encapsulated in the S-1.

Data showing the propane conversion (a), propylene selectivity (b) and propylene formation rate (c) of the as-prepared catalysts; (d) Comparison of propylene formation rate as a function of deactivation rate over some representative catalysts represented in the literatures and in this work (cf. Table S3). Reaction conditions: 320 mg catalyst, 5 mL/min C3H8, 16.5 mL/min Ar, 1 atm, 600 C and WHSV = 7.4 h1.
Although the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst shows the considerable PDH activity, the stability also needs to be emphatically concerned. In the context of deactivation, a first order deactivation model is applied to evaluate the stability of catalyst, as shown in
Fig. 6
d. The detailed propylene formation rate and deactivation rate of some typical PDH catalysts from the literatures and this work are listed in
Table S3
. A relatively lower deactivation rate of 0.0778 h1 and a great propylene formation rate of 4.3 mol·g-1Ni·h1 over the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst for 8 h (or even for 30 h, cf.
Fig. 8
) demonstrate its higher catalytic activity and stability than that of the 0.2Ni-S-1 (0.1786 h1, 1.3 mol·g-1Ni·h1) and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 catalyst (0.1278 h1, 0.9 mol·g-1Ni·h1). Notably, the values of propylene formation rate and deactivation rate over the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 are slight lower than that of Pt-based catalysts, but are more superior than that of other non-noble metal catalysts (e.g., Cr, Co, Ga, Fe, V and Zn, etc.). It is confirmed that the stability of bimetallic Ni-Zn sites can be enhanced significantly due to the anchoring role of Si-OH groups during the synthesis of zeolite sample (cf.
Fig. 4
A).
As mentioned above, the presence of Zn species can prompt the catalytic stability for PDH reaction by modulating the electronic property of Ni species. To further illustrate the influence of Zn content in NiZn-S-1 samples on catalytic performance, the catalytic tests of catalyst samples with different Ni/Zn molar ratios (changing Zn loadings) are performed (cf.
Figs. S11 and S12
). With the increasing of Zn loading, the initial propane conversion exhibits a volcanic type change, which can reach a maximum of 35.8 % over the 0.2Ni0.2Zn-S-1. However, the propylene selectivity is only about 77.6 %. In contrast, the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst shows a satisfactory propylene selectivity (90.3%) and formation rate (6.6 mol·g-1Ni·h1), despite of slightly lower propane conversion (32.5%). Beside, the stability of NiZn-S-1 becomes poor with the decreasing of Ni/Zn molar ratio. This is mainly because that high Zn loading can result in the propane overcracking (cf.
Fig. S9
). Combining with the results of catalytic performance and the influence of Zn loadings, therefore, it can be concluded that the intrinsic active sites of the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst for PDH ought to be appropriate bimetallic Ni-Zn sites with Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1, rather than the nanoparticles and monometallic sites.
To determine the intrinsic activity of catalysts, the PDH reaction tests are carried out over the samples at 500 C with a high WHSV of 15 h1 to eliminate the influence of diffusion factors and thermal cracking at high temperatures. The turnover frequency (TOF, h1), for example, the propane molecules converted per hour per metal cation, is calculated if assuming all Ni and Zn atoms are active (cf. eq.
(3)
). As shown in
Fig. 7
a, the intrinsic catalytic activity of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 reaches about 96.7 h1, which is higher than that of 0.2Ni-S-1 (47.2 h1) and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 (60.1 h1). In fact, the metallic sites with strong Lewis acid sites ought to be regarded as the intrinsic dehydrogenation active sites for 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalysts, but are not suitable for 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 (the role of Ni-Zn nanoparticles). According to the eq.
(4)
, the intrinsic catalytic activity of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 attains 28.5 min1, which is far higher than that of 0.2Ni-S-1 (13.0 min1) and the literatures reported (cf.
Table S3
). The above results suggest that high intrinsic activity of bimetallic Ni-Zn sites can ensure maximum utilization of metal during the PDH reaction.

Each cycle includes a 5 h PDH step at 600 C, followed by treatment in air at 600 C for 1.0 h to remove the deposited coke. The reactor is flushed with Ar between these steps. Reaction conditions: 320 mg catalyst, 1 atm, WHSV = 7.4 h1, C3H8:Ar = 10:33 with a total flow rate 21.5 mL/min.
By fitting an Arrhenius plot, the apparent activation energies (Eapp) of PDH over the three samples are calculated and the results are depicted in
Fig. 7
b. All the catalysts exhibit relatively lower activation energies, similar to platinum-based catalysts
[40]
,
[46]
. The Eapp values of 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 catalysts are about 69.2, 65.4 and 66.9 kJ/mol. The results further reflect that the selective activation ability in the propane CH bonds of bimetallic Ni-Zn sites is superior to that of monometallic Ni sites and Ni-Zn nanoparticles.
3.5. Stability and regeneration
Metal sintering over the supported catalysts for the PDH reaction under high temperature condition has been considered as one of concerned common problems, which are related to the stability and retrievability of catalyst to evaluate the importance for practical application. Hence, the long-time test of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst is carried out at 600 C (cf.
Fig. 8
a). After 30 h, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity still can keep above 20 % and 90 %, respectively, indicating that such catalyst exhibits a good stability during the PDH process. Meanwhile, the recycling stability by successive oxidationreduction cycles is also performed (cf.
Fig. 8
b). It can be observed that the catalytic activity on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst is almost same as that of fresh catalyst during 4 cycles. Furthermore, the amount of active sites, metal loadings and crystalline structures of the catalyst basically remain unchanged (cf.
Table S2
,
Figs. S13 and S14
). The results show that the bimetallic Ni-Zn sites in the framework of 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 are very stable, proving its excellent cycling and regeneration performance.
3.6. Formation of coke species
The formation of coke species is another important evaluation index for PDH reaction, which is also a main factor of catalyst deactivation. Once the coke deposit onto the surface of catalyst, the pore structure and catalytic active sites will be covered, obstructing the diffusion of propane and propylene molecules. Therefore, the coke-resistance abilities of catalysts are very important.
Fig. 9
a, b and S15 provide the TG and DTG curves of spent catalysts to measure coke content. Only one stage of weight loss over all the spent samples can be observed, except for the 0.2Zn-S-1. After 30 h, the coke content on the spent 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst is only about 1.0 %, which is obviously lower than that of 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 and NiZn-S-1 with different Ni/Zn molar ratios catalysts (after 8 h). The result illustrates that the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst exhibits strong coke-resistance ability during PDH reaction, in good accordance with its excellent catalytic stability, which is strongly dependent on the synergistic catalysis of bimetallic Ni-Zn sites.

Raman spectra are further applied to detect the types of carbon species. As shown in
Fig. 9
c, two main Raman signals on the spent catalysts can be found, associated with D and G bands, respectively. Therein, the G band at 1602 cm1 is assigned to the doubly degenerate phonon mode with E2g symmetry at the Brillouin zone for perfect graphite lattices
[47]
. The D band is fitted into four bands: D1 at 1220 cm1, D2 at 1620 cm1, D3 at 1386 cm1, D4 at 1485 cm1, which are ascribed to double-resonant Raman scattering of the graphene lattices with defects and in-plane transverse optic phonon modes, E2g symmetry vibration of disordered graphitic lattices (absence in the Raman spectra), amorphous carbon, and disordered graphitic lattices with A1g symmetry, respectively

. The difference in the types of coke species can be seen on the spent catalysts, which strongly relies on catalytic active sites. As shown in
Table 3
, the disordered graphite and ideal graphite are easily formed on the spent 0.2Ni-S-1 with monometallic Niδ+ sites, especially on the spent 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 with Ni-Zn nanoparticles. However, the amorphous carbon species are easier generated on the spent 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 with bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, which is in line with the catalytic performance.

3.7. Possible reaction mechanisms of propane over the Ni-based catalysts
To investigate the interaction between propylene and active sites, the C3H6 profiles of the as-prepared catalysts are shown in
Fig. 10
. For the S-1, no evident desorption peaks can be observed, implying a weak interaction between propylene and Si-OH groups. While, a propylene desorption peak at 415 C over the 0.2Ni-S-1 can be observed, implying the strong interaction between propylene and monometallic Niδ+ site
[40]
, causing the coke deposition with high graphitization degree and catalyst deactivation rapidly. Notably, the desorption peak over the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst shifts to a lower temperature (about 338 C), in comparison with that of 0.2Ni-S-1, indicating that the Znδ+ sites can enhance the electronic density of Niδ+ sites to enhance the desorption ability of propylene on the bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, in combination with the XPS results. However, the formation Ni-Zn nanoparticles over the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 is not conducive to the propylene desorption that needs higher temperature at about 538 C. To sum up, it can be concluded that the electron-rich Niδ+ sites in the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 catalyst are beneficial to repel the electron-rich propylene and coke precursors and thereby increase the stability of catalyst and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction, which is in line with the Raman results.

To further reveal the reaction mechanisms of propane over the catalysts,
Fig. 11
gives in situ FTIR spectra of propane over the 0.2Ni-S-1, 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 catalysts at different temperatures. Three infrared absorption bands at 2960, 2877 and 1460 cm1 can be observed over all the samples at a system temperature of 100 C (cf.
Fig. 11
, line a), which are assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration, symmetrical stretching vibration and in-plane asymmetric bending vibration of CH bond of CH3 groups in the propane, respectively
[13]
,
[52]
. Meanwhile, all the bands associated with the SiOH groups almost disappear. The above results suggest that the propane cannot be absorbed on the SiOH groups. Meaning the propane adsorbed on the metallic sites or metal nanoparticles.

With the increasing of system temperatures (cf.
Fig. 11
, lines b and c), the intensities of bands at 2960 and 2877 cm1 associated with the adsorbed propane are weakened apparently, accompanied with the appearance of the bands assigned to the SiOH groups, implying that adsorbed species generated by propane ought to be induced by interaction between the metal sites and adjacent SiOH groups. Note-worthily, a new band at 1608 cm1 is emerged, especially for the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, which may be assigned to the stretching vibration of the CC bond or CC band. As reported in some literatures, the band is a feature of unsaturated or aromatic hydrocarbons
[52]
,
[53]
. In fact, the bands (3010  3030 cm1) associated with the stretching vibration of CH bond cannot be found. At this situation, therefore, the band ought to be the dissociative adsorption of propane, forming the alkyl intermediates (such as 1-propyl and 2-propyl) on metallic active sites
[54]
,
[55]
. In comparison with 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1, the intensity of band on the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 is stronger, implying the formation of more alkyl intermediates.
When the system temperatures are further increased (cf.
Fig. 11
, lines d and e), the intensity of band at 2960 cm1 is strengthened, but the band at 2877 cm1 is completely vanished on the 0.2Ni-S-1 and 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1. Meanwhile, two new bands at 2930 and 2860 cm1 assigned to the asymmetric stretching vibration and symmetrical stretching vibration of CH bond of CH2 groups can be observed
[13]
,
[52]
,
[53]
,
[55]
. The above results may be ascribed to the hydrogenolysis and desorption from CH3 groups adsorbed on the metallic sites. At this time, the band at 1460 cm1 appears again. Notably, the intensity of band at 1608 cm1 on the 0.2Ni-S-1 is obviously stronger than that on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1. While, the intensities of other bands (2960, 2930, 2860 and 1460 cm1) are obvious stronger on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1. Meanwhile, the color of 0.2Ni-S-1 sample becomes black, suggesting the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as coke precursors derived from excessive hydrogenolysis and eventually leading to the generation of carbon deposition (cf.
Fig. 11
D). However, the alkyl intermediates on the Ni-Zn sites (0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) are easily desorbed to form the propylene molecules (cf.
Fig. 11
E). In combination with XPS spectra, this may be because the Znδ+ sites can contribute more electrons to Niδ+ sites, reducing the hydrogenolysis of alkyl intermediates, boosting the propylene desorption, which is consistent with C3H6-TPD results. By contrast, except for the obvious strengthening of the band at 1608 cm1, all the abovementioned phenomena cannot be found on the 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1. The result indicates that coke precursors with higher graphitization degree are easily generated on the Ni-Zn nanoparticles of 0.2Ni0.06Zn/S-1 (cf.
Fig. 11
F), leading to the rapid deactivation of catalyst, which is in line with the TG-DTG, Raman and C3H6-TPD results.
4. Conclusions
In this work, we facilely fabricate the bimetallic-sites catalyst of Ni-Zn anchored in the zeolite framework of silicalite-1 (depicted as NiZn-S-1) by ligand-protected method, which performs high temperature stability and anti-sintering. Comprehensive comparison, the NiZn-S-1 catalyst with high Ni/Zn molar ratio of 3:1 (named 0.2Ni0.06Zn-S-1) shows excellent catalytic activity (initial propane conversion of 32.5 % and actual TOFpropane of 28.5 min1) with relatively lower deactivation rate (about 0.0778 h1) and great C3H6 selectivity (>90 %) after 30 h on stream. Particularly, this catalyst exhibits high regeneration performance after 4 successive oxidationreduction cycles. Multiple characterizations further reveal that the enhancement of PDH performance ought to be attributed to the synergistic effect between bimetallic Ni-Zn sites, which is beneficial for the selective activation of CH bond and propylene desorption to reduce the formation of coke species with high graphitization degree, improving the catalyst stability. The design of novel bimetallic- sites catalyst gives a new idea on the development of alternatively efficient PDH catalysts with low-cost and eco-friendly.
