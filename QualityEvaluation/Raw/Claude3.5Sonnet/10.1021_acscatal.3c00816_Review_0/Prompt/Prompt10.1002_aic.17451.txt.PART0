Abstract
Cobalt-based catalysts are promising alternatives to replace Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, the sintering and reduction of unstable Co sites cause fast deactivation. Herein, the ultrasmall cobalt oxide clusters encapsulated within silicalite-1 zeolites (CoO@S-1) has been obtained via a ligand assistance in situ crystallization method. This CoO@S-1 catalyst exhibits an attractive propylene formation rate of 13.66mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 with selectivity of >92% and is durable during 120-h PDH reaction with five successive regeneration cycles. The high PDH activity of CoO@S-1 is assigned to the encapsulated CoO clusters are favorable for propane adsorption and can better stabilize the detached H* species from propane, leading to the lower dehydrogenation barriers than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles. Additionally, the π-binding propylene on CoO clusters can prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction compared with the di-σ binding propylene on metallic Co, leading to the superior propylene selectivity and catalytic stability.
1 INTRODUCTION
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands. The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products.1-3 To date, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst are the most widely used technologies for the industrial PDH reaction. However, the high cost of Pt and serious pollution issues of Cr(VI) greatly restrict the further development.4 As a result, the exploration of a cost-effective and environmentally friendly PDH catalyst is of significance and remains as an important challenge.
Among developed alternatives, cobalt-based catalysts have attracted much attention due to its efficient CH activation ability and inexpensive, nontoxic characters.5-11 It is widely recognized that the single-site (isolated) Co2+ species, acting as the Lewis acidic sites, can effectively catalyze the PDH reaction. However, the as-prepared well-dispersed Co sites tend to aggregate and are reduced to metallic Co (Co0) under high temperature and strongly reducing PDH atmosphere, which exacerbates the formation of coke deposit and is unfavorable for catalyst stability. The highly dispersed metal sites can be stabilized by strong metalsupport interaction on carriers. For example, Hu and Estes synthesized the isolated Co2+ supported on silica by surface organometallic graft method, achieving highly selectivity toward propylene.5, 6 In another case, Dai proposed the isolated Co2+ stabilized by coordinately unsaturated Al3+ sites of Al2O3 nanosheets, which can efficiently catalyze the PDH reaction.8 However, the low ordered porous structure of these supporters still restricts the diffusion of reactants and products, lowering down the activity and stability of catalysts. In comparison, microporous zeolite with the ordered porous structure and outstanding thermal stability is an ideal support for anchoring metal sites. Unfortunately, the conventional impregnation cannot guarantee the metal precursor enter into the zeolite pores through subnanometric pore window, and a substantial of metal species will locate on the zeolite external surface, showing unsatisfied stability during PDH reaction. Recently, the encapsulation of metal species within zeolites (M@zeolite) by ligand-assistance in situ crystallization strategy has been frequently reported, which exhibits various advantages for light hydrocarbon catalytic reactions.12-17 For example, Gong and the colleagues reported the encapsulation of ultrasmall Pd clusters into sodalite zeolites.12 The acetylene cannot enter the channel of sodalite and thus indirectly react with the activated hydrogen on zeolite surface generated by encapsulated Pd sites, effectively preventing the over-hydrogenation reactions over exposed Pd sites. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the size and nature of the encapsulated metal species are highly affected by the ligand. For example, the different Fe sites (e.g., 1.9 nm FeOx clusters and isolated framework Feδ+ ions) confined in MFI zeolite have been obtained by regulating the organic ligand.16, 17 Thus, it is expected that different well-defined and stable Co sites can be encapsulated within zeolites by employing in situ crystallization method and regulating the ligands.
On the other hand, the catalytic performance of Co catalysts still needs further improvement, and a better understanding of the structureperformance relationship can guide the catalyst optimization. Although isolated Co2+ sites are widely considered as highly efficient reactive sites for PDH reaction, there still exist different viewpoints. For example, Chen' and Jeon' studies observed an induction period in Co/SiBeta and Co/Al2O3 systems; meanwhile, the characterizations of spent catalysts reveal the presence of Co0 species.7, 18 Accordingly, they suggest that the highly dispersed Co0 species, rather than oxidized Co, is real reactive centers in PDH reaction. Quite recently, Gao reported that the H2 prereduction can cause a multistage migration from framework Co2+ to extraframework Co0 species in Co@MCM-41 system. By correlating the prereduction condition and PDH activity, it is proposed that the small-size Co0 site with the moderate metalsupport interaction is highly reactive centers, while the framework Co2+ site is inactive for PDH reaction.19 In addition, the current studies often focus on the diverse activity of isolated and nanometric Co sites, but the PDH activity of subnanometric Co sites is still lack of study. Indeed, several recent reports have employed the subnanometric CoO clusters to catalyze oxidative alkane dehydrogenation reaction, achieving a promising result.20 In short, further revealing the unclear active site structure and promoting the catalytic performance of Co-based PDH catalysts are still highly desired.
In this work, the subnanometric CoO clusters, isolated framework Co2+, and Co3O4 nanoparticles encapsulated or loaded within/on the silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite were successfully prepared. The status of Co sites was characterized using Raman, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM), H2 temperature-programed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance (UVVis), and in situ diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis. The key findings of this study include the simple in situ crystallization method to obtain well-dispersed and anti-reducing CoO clusters encapsulated within S-1 channels. Moreover, it is revealed that the encapsulated CoO clusters exhibit superior catalytic PDH performance than framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Characterizations of fresh catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of prepared catalysts (Figure 1A) exhibit five typical diffraction peaks located around 8.2, 9.0, 23.3, 24.1, and 24.6. In Raman spectra (Figure 1B), the bands around 378cm1 are detected for all samples, which is assigned to the SiOSi species of MFI framework.21 These features indicate the successful preparation of MFI zeolite topology. The bands around 292 and 479cm1 are attributed to the twisting vibrations and stretching vibrations of CoO bonds in amorphous CoO clusters. Notably, the unique band sited around 825cm1 is only observed for Co-edta@S-1 catalyst, which is related to the CoOSi bond vibrations.22 In contrast, these CoO or CoOSi bands are not observed in Co/S-1 catalyst. Alternatively, new bands located at 188 and 672cm1 in Co/S-1 can be assigned to (CoO6) and (CoO4) species of Co3O4 crystallites. The absence of (CoO6)-related bands excludes the presence of Co3O4 crystallites in Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 catalyst. N2 physisorption isotherms of these catalysts indicate the microporous structure of prepared catalysts (Figure S4).23 As summarized in Table 1, the specific surface area (SBET) and micropore volume (VP) values of Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 are higher than that of Co/S-1, indicating the in situ crystallization method can better retain the zeolite pore structure than postsynthesis impregnation method. Meanwhile, the VP of Co-acac@S-1 is lightly lower than Co-edta@S-1, attributed to the partial occupation of zeolite micropores by CoO clusters.

Electronic microscopy characterizations were performed to investigate the morphology and cobalt distribution of catalysts. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and TEM images (Figure S5, S6 and Figure 2A,D) reveal that the catalysts exhibit the regular polyhedron prism morphology with diameter of about 200nm. Some superficial nanoparticles can be observed in impregnated Co/S-1 catalyst (Figure S5D). The TEM images (Figure S6) further indicate the presence of dense nanoparticles with the diameter of 35 nm in Co/S-1. In comparison, such nanoparticles are not observed in Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 catalysts, indicating that the Co species exist as subnanometric scale. The aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) images (Figure 2B) clearly indicate the ultrasmall clusters are encapsulated within the channels of zeolite in Co-acac@S-1, and the mean diameter of clusters was measured to be about 0.7 nm. When the view is changed to [010] direction (Figure 2C), the changed contrast indicates some of zeolite channels are filled by Co species. The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images (Figure 2G) indicate that Si and Co are uniformly distributed throughout the zeolite. Nevertheless, no detectable particles or clusters were noticed for Co-edta@S-1 under the same resolution AC-STEM images (Figure 2DF). Due to the presence of tiny Co spots uniformly dispersed throughout zeolite in EDS mapping images, it is reasonable to infer that the Co atoms of Co-edta@S-1 catalyst are inserted into the zeolite framework with an atomic scale.24

XPS measurements were implemented to analyze the surface components and their chemical states of the prepared catalysts (Figure 1C and Figure S8). As listed in Table S4, the investigation based on Co content obtained from XPS and XRF analysis (XPS/XRF) indicates the Co species are successfully encapsulated within the zeolite for Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1, while a substantial of Co species locate on the external surface of zeolite for Co/S-1 catalyst.25 The core-level binding energies (BEs) of Co 2p3/2 peak of Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 catalysts are, respectively, located at 782.6 eV and 782.9 eV, which is ascribed to Co2+ species9 (Figure 1C). For the impregnated Co/S-1 catalyst, the Co 2p3/2 signal should be divided into two peaks, including the Co2+ 2p3/2 peak at 783.4 eV and Co3+ 2p3/2 peak at 780.2 eV. The Co valence was further evidenced by analyzing the XPS satellite (Sat.) peaks, as the Co 2p Sat. peak is attributed to the charges transfer from ligand to 3d orbitals in high-spin Co2+ ions, while the Co3+ species do not contribute to such charge transfer.26 The intensity ratio of the Co 2p3/2 Sat. peak to main peak was calculated to be 0.96, 0.94, and 0.28 for Co-acac@S-1, Co-edta@S-1, and Co/S-1, respectively. Thus, the results further confirm that the Co2+ species are dominant in Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1, while Co2+ and Co3+ species are coexisted in Co/S-1 catalyst.
Being a typical late transition metal, Co with different valence and coordination geometry will exhibit different UVVis signals (Figure 1D). For Co/S-1 catalyst, the broad band around 312 and 673nm are ascribed to 1A1g1T2g and 1A1g1T1g transitions of octahedral coordinated (Oh) Co3+ in Co3O4 crystallites. Over Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1, the bands around 560 and 645nm are assigned to 4A2f4T1p and 4A2f4T1f transition of Co2+ species with tetrahedral geometry (Td).11, 27, 28 The bands at 363 and 393nm cannot be assigned straightforward, and related studies attribute them to the distorted Td Co in zeolite framework, or to the extraframework Oh Co species.28-30 Combined with the other characterization results, we assigned these two bands to Td Co2+ in zeolite framework and the extraframework Oh Co2+ species, respectively. The channel location of Co2+ species in Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 catalysts were further analyzed by Gaussian deconvolution method (Figure S8). Figure 1E presents the H2-TPR data of prepared catalysts. The Co-acac@S-1 exhibits only one peak at 723C, which is assigned to the reduction of CoO species confined within zeolite channels.21 In comparison, three reduction peaks were observed for Co/S-1 catalyst. The peaks at 311C and 460C are attributed to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and Co2+ to Co0 of superficial Co3O4 particles, which are consistent with the reference bulk Co3O4. Another peak at 712C is ascribed to the Co species that is also strongly bonded with the S-1 support. The relatively lower reduction temperature (712C vs. 723C) reveals the Co sites in impregnated Co/S-1 catalyst holds a weaker metalsupport interaction than Co-acac@S-1. Importantly, no detectable reduction peaks were found in Co-edta@S-1 catalyst, indicating the Co species are hardly reducible until 900C. This reduction temperature is higher than those in Co-exchanged ZSM-5 (about 855C)30 and Co-substituted dealumination Beta zeolite (about 847C).31 Thus, TPR results strongly suggest the Co sites of Co-edta@S-1 are embedded within zeolite framework. Considering the fact that the Co status were largely determined by the zeolite support, 29Si magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectra of prepared catalysts were implemented to explore the chemical environment of both Si and Co atoms. As shown in Figure 1F, the chemical shifts around 103ppm and 113ppm are assigned to Si(OSi)3(Q3) and Si(OSi)4(Q4) species, respectively. The Q3 peak slightly shifts toward higher chemical shift in Co-edta@S-1 catalyst compared with other two catalysts. Besides, the quantified results of the peak intensity ratios of Q3/Q4 were summarized in Table 1. Co-acac@S-1 and Co/S-1 exhibit similar Q3/Q4 values compared with that of S-1 zeolite, while the Co-edta@S-1 shows a much lower Q3/Q4 value. It is widely recognized that the heteroatoms will preferentially coordinate with the defect SiOH species of zeolite framework.23, 24 Thus, the shift of Q3 peak and the decrease of Q3/Q4 ratio can be considered as important evidence for the substitution of framework Si by Co atoms. Additionally, the intense spinning side band at around 50ppm is explained by dipolar interaction between unpaired electrons of Co species with 29Si atoms.32 This spinning side band indicates the presence of paramagnetic extraframework Co species in Co-acac@S-1 and Co/S-1 catalysts and also reveals the absence of extraframework Co species in Co-EDAT@S-1.
Due to the fact that PDH catalytic performance is essentially related to the nature of acidic sites, the pyridine adsorption FTIR (py-FTIR) spectra (Figure 3A,B) were measured to acquire detailed information of acid sites. The bands around 1450, 1490, and 1610cm1 are assigned to the vibrational modes of pyridine ring stretching modes coordinated with surface Lewis acid sites. The bands around 1596cm1 were observed for Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 at low temperature, which are attributed to hydrogen-bonded pyridine. No adsorption bands around 1540cm1 were observed for all tested catalysts, indicating the absence of Brnsted acid sites. The density of Lewis acid sites is determined by the integral intensity of characteristic band at 1450cm1 with the desorption temperature of 473K.33 As a result, Co-edta@S-1 exhibits much lower Lewis acid density (0.057μmol/g) in comparison with Co-acac@S-1 (0.117μmol/g) and Co/S-1 (0.125μmol/g). In addition, the DFT simulated vibrational frequencies are also consistent with above assignments (Figure S9). Specifically, the pyridine adsorbed on framework Co2+ in Co-edta@S-1 exhibits smaller vibration frequency than the Co sites in Co-acac@S-1 and Co/S-1.

The CO and NO in situ DRIFTS were carried out to further identify the Co sites. As shown in Figure 3C,D, the absence of bands around 1950 and 2066cm1 excludes the presence of Co3+ or Co0 species in tested catalysts. The bands at 2133 and 2141cm1 are correlated with physically adsorbed CO molecules.34 The bands at 2160cm1 are assigned to CO adsorbed on SiOH species,35 which is only observed in Co-acac@S-1 catalyst. Thus, we infer that the defect SiOH species in Co-edta@S-1 were consumed to coordinate with framework Co species, which is in line with CO-FTIR spectra in OH group region as discussed below. Importantly, the bands at 2176cm1 are ascribed to CO adsorbed on CoO clusters,34-36 which was only detected in Co-acac@S-1 catalyst. Besides, this band at 2176cm1 in Co-acac@S-1 is slightly blue shifted with the increasing of CO pressure, which is explained by the coupling of CO molecules adsorbed on adjacent Co atoms in clusters.37 In addition, the bands at 2025 and 1894cm1 in Co-acac@S-1 are ascribed to the Co(CO)x [x>1] species and bridge adsorbed CO species.38 These results reveal the presence of a few Co ensembles in Co-acac@S-1, which can account for the CO coupling effect and bridge adsorption. As for Co-edta@S-1 catalyst, the band located at 2167cm1 is attributed to the CO adsorbed on the framework Co2+ site. Importantly, the bands correlated with Co2+-CO species in Co-edta@S-1 remains its initial position with increasing CO pressure, and meantime, no bands ascribed to bridged adsorbed CO were observed, indicating the highly isolated framework Co2+ sites in this catalyst. The CO-FTIR spectra in OH group vibration range (Figure S10) can also support the conclusion that the CoO clusters and isolated framework Co2+ ions are dominant in Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1 catalysts. Moreover, the trends of simulated frequencies for CO adsorption were consistent with the experimental observation (Figure S11), and the DFT results well explain the absence of dicarbonyl-related bands in experiments. The NO adsorption FTIR spectra were also carried out as shown in Figure 3C,D. Co-acac@S-1 exhibits three main bands located at 1915, 1906, and 1880cm1, suggesting the coexistence of dinitrosyl (Co2+(NO)2) and mononitrosyl (Co2+(NO)) species.39, 40 In comparison, Co-edta@S-1 catalyst exhibits only one strong band at 1866cm1 (Figure 3F), which is assigned to the mononitrosyl Co2+(NO) species. The reason of absent dinitrosyl-related bands in experimental observation is also investigated by DFT simulation. Besides, the NO-related vibration frequency is also calculated (Figure S12), which is roughly consistent with the experimental values. Note that the distance between active Co sites and adsorbed probe molecules (pyridine, CO, and NO) of Co-edta@S-1 is larger than Co-acac@S-1 (Figures S9, S11, and S12), indicating the encapsulated CoO cluster is more favorable and accessible for adsorbing gas molecules than framework Co2+.
3.2 PDH catalytic performance and coke analysis
As shown in Figure 4A, Co-acac@S-1 exhibits the highest C3H8 conversion, which is about 47% and exhibit no obvious deactivation during the reaction. In contrast, Co-edta@S-1 exhibits a much lower propane conversion of about 4%. The initial C3H8 conversion over Co/S-1 catalyst (about 43%) is comparable with that of Co-acac@S-1 but soon dropped to about 14% within 2 h. On the other hand, steady C3H6 selectivity was obtained for all of tested catalysts, which was about 94.7%, 95.3%, and 90.1% for Co-acac@S-1, Co-edta@S-1, and Co/S-1, respectively. By increasing the WHSVC3H8, low-level conversion was measured to quantitatively compare the catalyst activity (r(C3H6) and TOFCo).8 As shown in Figure S13 and Figure 4B, the r(C3H6) values were calculated to be 13.66, 8.43, and 0.35mmolC3H6·gcat1·h1 for Co-acac@S-1, Co-edta@S-1, and Co/S-1 catalysts. The Co-related turnover frequencies (TOFCo) were 30.26, 15.10, and 2.63h1, respectively (Figure 4C). The results clearly demonstrate the PDH intrinsic activity follows the sequence of Co-acac@S-1>Co/S-1 >>Co-edta@S-1. According to the XPS measurements of spent catalysts (Figure S14) and the in situ CO-FTIR spectra (Figure S15), the Co sites in spent Co-acac@S-1 catalyst remains the +2 valence, while a substantial of Co species in Co/S-1 were reduced to Co0, which is consistent with the H2-TPR measurements. Moreover, the optimal Co-acac@S-1 shows obvious activity loss after 800C reduction, while the propane conversion rises again after re-oxidation in air at 550C (Figure S16A). The XRD, H2-TPR, and TEM analysis demonstrate no obvious particle sintering occur in above redox treatments and PDH reactions (Figure S16BD), indicating the encapsulation effect and metalsupport interaction can prevent the CoO clusters from reducing and sintering for Co-acac@S-1. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that the CoO clusters possess a superior PDH activity than Co0 sites based on the superior activity of Co-acac@S-1 than Co-acac@S-1 (800).

The deactivation rate (kd) values of these catalysts were calculated based on the first-order deactivation model,41 using low propane conversion data as shown in Figure S13. The largest kd value of Co/S-1 (0.158h1) indicates the fast deactivation. In comparison, the kd values were 0.028 and close to 0 h1 for Co-acac@S-1 and Co-edta@S-1, which is consistent with their steady catalytic performance. Moreover, a long-term test with five successive regeneration cycles further confirms the high stability of optimal Co-acac@S-1 catalyst (Figure S17). The coke amount and type in spent Co-acac@S-1 and Co/S-1 catalysts were investigated according to TGA, Raman, and SEM measurements (Figures S18 and S19). The results clearly reveal that the amount and polymerization degree of coke deposit is effectively restrained on Co-acac@S-1 in comparison with Co/S-1.
The catalytic kinetic study was performed based on the Arrhenius curves in the temperature range of 550610C. As shown in Figure 4D and Table 1, the apparent activation energy (Ea) was calculated to be 121.8, 111.7, and 173.6 kJ/mol for Co-acac@S-1, Co/S-1, and Co-edta@S-1, respectively. The lowest Ea value in Co-acac@S-1 demonstrates its lowest dehydrogenation barrier.7 In addition, the activation entropy (S*) is defined as the entropy loss of C3H8 molecules adsorbed on the catalyst surface. As summarized in Table 1, the larger S*value of Co-acac@S-1 (168.8 J/[mol·K]) reveals the stronger adsorption ability for gas-phase C3H8 molecules, which is much favorable for the subsequent dehydrogenation reaction.
For presenting the efficient activity of Co-acac@S-1, the effect of WHSVC3H8 on PDH activity was investigated. As shown in Figure S20, the propylene formation rate increases with WHSVC3H8 and reaches 13.17mmol C3H6 · gcat1 · h1 at WHSVC3H8 of 3.125h1. Further increasing the WHSVC3H8 to 4.5 h1 contribute little to the r(C3H6). In addition, we test the PDH activity under high propane pressure (600C, WHSVC3H8 = 2.4 h1, C3H8:H2 = 6:19).42 As shown in Figure S21, increasing the propane pressure leads to the loss of conversion. Under given conditions, the Co-acac@S-1 exhibits 26% propane conversion and 95% propylene selectivity, which is higher than Co-EDTA@S-1 and Co/S1. Moreover, our Co-acac@S-1 exhibits superior activity and much higher stability than reference CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure S22). As compared in Table S5, this Co-acac@S-1 catalyst exhibits an attractive activity and stability in PDH reaction compared with reported Co-based catalysts. These comparison results demonstrate the outstanding activity and stability of Co-acac@S-1 catalyst.
We further investigate the effect of Co loadings on structural property and PDH activity of series X% Co-acac@S-1 catalysts (X = 1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 15%). Based on the XRD, Raman, and H2-TPR results (Figure S23), increasing the Co loadings from 1% to 6% not significantly alter the structure of Co sites. As a result, the propylene formation rate increases linearly with increasing Co loadings from 1% to 6%. Further increasing Co loading would weaken the metalsupport interaction and promote the formation of Co3O4 crystallites thus not effectively promote the propylene formation rate and even lead to activity loss (Figures S24 and 25).
3.3 DFT calculation analysis
The propane adsorption was investigated in Figure S26. It is noted that the distance between central C atom and the reactive Co site in Co-edta@S-1 model (about 4.5 Å) is much larger than the other models (about 3.5 Å), indicating the framework Co sites may be less accessible for C3H8 molecules. The full potential energy surface (PES) of PDH reaction over various models was presented in Figure 5B, and the corresponding models of transition state were given in Figure 5A and S27. In the following discussion, all the intermediates with (*) refer that they adsorb on the surfaces. Over Co-acac@S-1 model, the first dehydrogenation (1st dehy.) step produces the C3H7* species bonded with five-coordinated Co (Co5c) atom, and the detached H* from propane is adsorbed on the O2c site. This process is endothermic by 0.41eV with barrier of 0.99eV. Starting from C3H7*, the second detached H* is preferably adsorbed on Co site forming a CoH moiety (endothermic by 0.32eV with barrier of 0.56eV), rather than bonded with the O3c site (endothermic by 0.69eV with barrier of 1.21eV, Figure S28). The subsequent steps involve the desorption of C3H6* and the regeneration of the catalyst surface by removal of the H2. The energy barrier of H2 formation is 0.67eV. As for the PES on Co-edta@S-1 model, the adsorbed C3H8* is activated by the framework four-coordinated framework Co (Co4c) and its adjacent three-coordinated O (O3c) atoms. After cleavage of the CH bonds, the two detached H* atoms are, respectively, bonded with the framework O3c atoms. These two processes are endothermic by 1.35 and 0.74eV with the activation barrier of 1.41eV and 2.25eV, respectively. After the desorption of C3H6, the remaining two H* would combine to form H2 with an energy barrier of 1.11eV. Finally, the H2 specie desorb to restore the catalyst surface with desorption energy of 0.06eV. For the PES over Co/S-1 surface, the H* dissociated from propane is bonded with the pseudo fcc site of Co (111) slab, leading to a strong H* adsorption. Thus, the second dehydrogenation (2nd dehy.) step barrier is greatly decreased to 0.37eV. In addition, the energy barrier of 1st dehy. step and the H2 formation step over Co/S-1 model are calculated to be 1.52 and 1.17eV, which is comparable with the values on Co-edta@S-1 model. The similar 1st dehy. step barriers over Co-edta@S-1 and Co/S-1 models can be attributed to this process is affected by the H* and C3H7 co-adsorption, while the 2nd dehy. step is primarily determined by H* adsorption.

The electronic density of states (DOS) of active centers was investigated as shown in Figure 5C. The lowest d-band center (ξd) and occupied p-band center (ξp) values of Co-edta@S-1 model are consistent with its highest dehydrogenation barrier. In comparison, the higher ξd and ξp values in Co-acac@S-1 are considered to be responsible for the higher activity. It should be noted that the O sites, acted as the Lewis basicity can better stabilize the detached H* species. Thus, although the metallic Co sites in Co/S-1 model exhibit the highest ξd values, the dehydrogenation barrier is also larger than Co-acac@S-1 model. Moreover, it is found that energy barrier of rate-determining step shows a positive correlation with dissociative H2 binding energy (Edis-2H*, related to the process of H2(g)2H*) (Figures S29 and 30), which can be a useful descriptor for further designing Co-based PDH catalysts.
Due to the fast C3H6* desorption can inhibit the over-dehydrogenation (over-dehy.) process, the fast propylene desorption plays a vital role in achieving high propylene productivity, Over Co/S-1 model, the CC bond in C3H6* interacts with two Co atoms via di-σ binding mode with a high desorption energy of 0.49eV (Figure S31). In comparison, propylene is easy to desorb over Co-edta@S-1 and Co-acac@S-1 surface due to the π binding mode, and the desorption energy is 0.11 and 0.05eV, respectively. We further investigate the competition between C3H6* desorption and over-dehy. on Co-acac@S-1 and Co/S-1 models. The Co-edta@S-1 model was not involved in this analysis due to the low PDH activity. As shown in Figure 5D, the energy barrier (0.49eV) of C3H6* over-dehy. on Co/S-1 surface is lower than the counterpart for desorption (0.69eV), resulting in a low selectivity toward propylene. In contrast, the C3H6* desorption on Co-acac@S-1 surface is a spontaneous process with exothermic by 0.05eV, and simultaneously, the C3H6* over-dehy. barrier is increased to 1.46eV. Thus, the coke deposit on Co-acac@S-1 catalyst can be effectively inhibited.
4 CONCLUSIONS
In summary, three different Co sites, including extraframework CoO clusters (Co-acac@S-1), isolated framework Co2+ (Co-edta@S-1), and Co3O4 particles (Co/S-1), were prepared to catalyze the PDH reaction. Compared with Co-edta@S-1 and Co/S-1, Co-acac@S-1 has achieved the highest activity and lowest deactivation rate, which is attributed to the ultrasmall CoO clusters with resistant to sinter and reduction due to the confinement effect and CoOsupport covalent interaction. In situ DRIFTS and activity test indicates that the CoO clusters have a stronger interaction with a variety of gas molecules (C3H8, CO, pyridine, NO) than framework Co2+ sites and metallic Co surface, which is also verified by DFT calculations. Moreover, DFT calculations reveal that the CoO clusters can better stabilize the detached H* species, and the propylene π binding mode on clusters can facilitate the propylene desorption and prevent the over-dehydrogenation reaction, which is responsible for the lowest dehydrogenation barriers and deactivation rate, and thus leading to the best PDH performance. For Co-EDTA@S-1, the isolated Co2+ sites within zeolite framework exhibit almost no catalytic activity, which is attributed to the highest dehydrogenation barrier due to spatial restrict of closed framework site. The fast deactivation of Co/S-1 is explained by the superficial Co3O4 is easily reduced to Co0, on which the formed C3H6 tends to over-dehydrogenation rather than desorption, thus leading to severe coke deposit. This joint computational and experimental study indicate that oxygenated extraframework CoO clusters are more active than isolated framework Co2+ cations and Co3O4 nanoparticles in PDH reaction, and the catalytic performance is expected to further improve by regulating the size and channel location of clusters.
