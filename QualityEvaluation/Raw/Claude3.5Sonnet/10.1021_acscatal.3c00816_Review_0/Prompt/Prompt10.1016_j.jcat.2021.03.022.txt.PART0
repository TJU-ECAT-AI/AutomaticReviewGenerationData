Skeleton-Sn anchoring isolated Pt site to confine subnanometric clusters within *BEA topology
Highlights
•
Confined subnanometric Pt clusters within Sn-Beta were synthesized by impregnation-reduction.
•
(Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] species sever as the key precursors of Pt clusters less than 1 nm.
•
Framework Sn coordinated Pt clusters show good stability in PDH at 500 C.
Abstract
Subnanometric clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) encapsulated inside the pores or cages of zeolite crystals can remarkably enhance their stability and then broaden the catalytic applications. We herein utilized the framework-Sn in Beta zeolite to anchor the guest platinum precursors in the impregnation process, forming Sn-Beta-confined Pt subnanometric clusters (Pt@Sn-Beta) in the following direct reduction. The solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming monodispersed precursor of (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5] and final active site of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115) was firstly provided in the present study by 119Sn NMR, XAFS and in-situ XPS spectra. The restrictions given by zeolite pores and electronic effect of Sn inhibited the coke formation and sintering of ultrafine Pt clusters, thereby achieving an excellent stability in propane dehydrogenation by maintaining 90% of the maximum propane conversion over 250 h at 99% propene selectivity. This finding has profound significance for understanding the mechanism of heteroatom-containing zeolites as a novel support for highly dispersed metal catalysts.

1. Introduction
Supported metal catalysts comprising single atoms or subnanometric clusters show superior atom utilization efficiency than traditional ones
[1]
. Especially for precious metals, such as Pt, Pd, Ru and Rh, the large dosage of metal active sites will undoubtedly multiply the cost of traditional metal catalysts, which is not conducive to large-scale industrial application
[2]
. The preparation of single-atom or subnanometric clusters has thus become the primary choice for precious metal catalysts. Once the active site becomes as small as single atom size, new features are expected to emerge such as a sharp increase of the surface free energy, quantum size effect, unsaturated ligand environment and strong metal-support interaction, rendering single-atom metal catalysts superior catalytic performance
[3]
.
Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile
[4][4]
,
[5]
. Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene. Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes
[6]
. So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes. Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking
[7]
. However, the dehydrogenation of propane is a strong endothermic reaction with small chemical equilibrium constant, and thus requires high reaction temperatures
[8]
. As such, the coking occurs easily during the reaction process and the Pt particles tend to grow large, resulting in rapid catalyst deactivation and decline of product selectivity
[9]
.
In fact, the growth of metal active sites under higher temperature environment during either preparation or subsequent catalytic reactions is a common issue that the supported metal catalysts encounter, especially for the single atoms or subnanometric clusters
[10]
. Choosing appropriate carriers and adding a second metal additive are two effective strategies to provide confinement effect and prohibit the growth of metals
[11]
. Microporous zeolite materials with highly crystalline structure, large specific surface area and well-defined pore channels show intrinsic confinement effect as the superb carriers for metal catalysts

[18]
. Unfortunately, the metal species hardly enter into the zeolite channels of subnano-sized pore windows by impregnation due to the diffusion constrains, but mainly locate on the crystal external surface, showing unsatisfied performance in stabilizing metal species under harsh reaction conditions
[19]
. Recently, in-situ encapsulation of metal species in constructing zeolite frameworks has been frequently reported

. Liu et al. incorporated Pt subnanometer clusters into the cups and cages of MWW framework during the structural transformation of the two-dimensional (2D) lamellar MCM-22 precursor into its corresponding three-dimensional (3D) structure
[16]
. Xiao group successfully fixed the metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ag) within zeolite crystals via a controllable seed-directed growth method
[17]
. Sun et al. synthesized single-atom Rh catalysts embedded in MFI-type zeolites under hydrothermal conditions and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction
[18]
.
For the supported Pt catalysts, Sn has been proved to be an outstanding additive, because it could impose not only geometric effect by preventing the collision of movable Pt active sites, but also electronic effect through the electron transfer from Sn species to the 5d orbital of Pt atoms when they are in close contact. The electronic effect has been reported to tune the adsorption strength of C3 intermediates in the PDH process
[8]
,
[20]
. To combine the complementary advantages of zeolite structure and additives in one matrix, several studies have tried to incorporate Pt into Sn-Beta zeolite, while only evenly dispersed surface nanoparticles were obtained. Xu et al. grafted HSnBu3 and Pt(COD)Me2 compounds successively onto the dealuminated Beta zeolite and then removed the organic ligands by H2 reduction, leading to the formation of Pt nanoparticles with an average diameter of 1.26 nm on the outer surface of the crystals, rather than in the confined pores
[21]
. In another case, it seemed that the Pt nanoclusters were also failed to be trapped in the framework because the Pt precursors readily turned to be large particles during the air calcination step
[22]
. Nevertheless, the metal aggregation upon air-calcination has been well suppressed in case of K-PtSn@MFI catalyst by introducing K+ in the synthetic gel, resulting in regioselective location of subnanometric Pt clusters in sinusoidal channels
[23]
. In the above two cases where Pt was introduced into Sn-Beta zeolite
[21]
,
[22]
, the framework Sn atoms favored higher Pt dispersion and superior catalytic performance, but no direct evidence was provided to show how the skeleton tin species anchor the platinum species. Very recently, Ryoo et al. reported a high-performance propane dehydrogenation catalyst with rare earth metals as auxiliaries, that is, rare-earth-platinum alloy nanoparticles confined in a mesoporous MFI zeolite
[24]
.
Herein, subnanometric Pt clusters (Pt single atoms and ultrafine clusters) were trapped into Sn-Beta zeolite by a simple wet impregnation of Pt salts onto Sn-Beta followed by direct hydrogen reduction, where the zeolite support with high framework Sn content was critical to provide enough anchors for Pt species. Specially, the solid proof for the anchoring effect by forming (Si-O)3(H2O)2Sn(IV)-(O)-[PtCl5]  species was revealed in the present study, which is the first report disclosing how framework Sn atoms are interacting with Pt species. The location of subnanometric Pt clusters (single atoms and ultrasmall clusters) within pores wall of *BEA crystals in the form of (Si-O)2Sn(II)-(O)-Ptn(n=115) were also revealed. Benefiting from the unique joint confinement effect of Sn and zeolite topology, the obtained Pt@Sn-Beta catalysts were highly active, selective and stable in PDH reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
All chemicals and reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers. H-Beta aluminosilicate (Si/Al = 11) was provided by Shanghai Xinnian Petrochemical Additives Co. Ltd., China. HNO3 solution (65 wt%), TEAOH solution (25 wt%), ammonium fluoride (>99%), and SnCl4·5H2O (>99%), were purchased from Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Chloroplatinic acid (>99.9%, Pt  37.5%) was purchased from CIVI. The chemicals were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The parent H-Beta was calcined in air at 600 C for 6 h and then it was refluxed in HNO3 solution (65 wt%) with a solid to liquid ratio of 1 g: 50 mL at 140 C for 2 h. The acid treatment was repeated twice, resulting a siliceous zeolite with a Si/Al ratio over 2000. The product, denoted as DA-Beta, was employed as the silica source for synthesizing Sn-Beta zeolite. Following our previous method
[25]
, Sn-Beta was hydrothermally synthesized via a structural reconstruction route. The gel with a molar composition of 1.0 SiO2: 1/x SnO2: 0.5 TEAOH: 7.5 H2O: 0.5 NH4F (x represents different Si/Sn ratios) was crystallized in a Teflon-lined autoclave at 140 C for 12 h under static condition. The as-made products were collected by filtration, washing with deionized water and dried at 80 C overnight, followed by calcination in air at 550 C for 6 h, denoted as Sn(x)-Beta. All silica Beta (Si-Beta) was prepared by the above method without adding Sn source. Pt catalysts (Pt loading = 0.375 wt%) supported on Si-Beta and Sn(80)-Beta zeolites were prepared by impregnation method with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 (H2PtCl6 = 0.5 mg·mL1). The impregnated samples were dried at 80 C for 4 h to obtain the catalyst precursors, named as Pt-Si-Beta-P and Pt-Sn-Beta-P. The catalyst precursors were in-situ reduced at 500 C under H2 flow, resulting in Pt-catalysts. More experimental details were presented in the
