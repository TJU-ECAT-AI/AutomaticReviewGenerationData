Framework-confined Sn in Si-beta stabilizing ultra-small Pt nanoclusters as direct propane dehydrogenation catalysts with high selectivity and stability
Industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts generally suffer from low catalytic stability due to coke deposition and metal sintering. Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts for PDH were prepared by an improved post-synthesis strategy, which consists of dealumination of H-beta and subsequent metal impregnation. It is indicated that Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states were incorporated into the framework of dealuminated beta (Si-beta). Meanwhile, Pt species were highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters on Pt/Sn-Si-beta due to the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(IV) sites confined in the Si-beta framework. The prepared Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, in which the propene formation rate was 2.3 mol g1Pt h1 with a propene selectivity of >99% at 550 C and the higher propene formation rate was 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C. Moreover, the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-beta framework inhibit the coke and sintering of Pt clusters, thereby achieving good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration with almost unchanged catalytic activity during four cycles at 550 C.
1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene.1,2 Currently, Pt-based catalysts have drawn particular attention due to their excellent catalytic performance and environment-friendly properties in commercial PDH processes.3,4 However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering.57 Thus it is important to develop new Pt-based catalysts with excellent anti-coking and anti-sintering capabilities. Many strategies have been suggested to reduce the formation of coke by doping additional promoters including Sn,812 In,13,14 Ga,7,15,16 Mn,17 Cu (ref. 18 and 19) and Zn (ref. 20) to Pt, which can effectively increase the electron density of Pt atoms and weaken the adsorption of the product alkene, thus reducing coke deposition. Among these promoters, Sn is known to be one of the most efficient promoters for decreasing the formation of coke. However, it failed to provide strong metalsupport interactions, leading to Pt sintering, thereby reducing the activity and regenerability. Therefore, the preparation of a stable Pt-based catalyst for the PDH reaction is still a great challenge.
To improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts, many efforts have been dedicated to strengthen metalsupport interactions by using various methods including the nanopore-encaged metal strategy,2124 wet-chemistry approach2529 and modification of supports.10,11,30,31 Among them, modification of supports is a relatively effective and simple method to improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts. For example, Lu et al. reported a PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst for PDH, exhibiting high activity, selectivity and stability.11 It was proposed that the enhanced stability in PDH was associated with γ-Al2O3 nanosheets containing a great deal of pentacoordinate Al3+ ions, which can stabilize PtSn clusters by strong interactions between metals and supports. Recent work by Ma et al. showed that the addition of Ga into Mg(Al)O layer double hydrotalcites could greatly enhance the stability of Pt catalysts in PDH.10 It may be due to the fact that pentacoordinate Ga3+ ions could disperse and stabilize PtSn clusters, thereby enhancing the electronic interactions between Pt and Ga. A similar conclusion regarding the importance of modification of supports has been reported in the case of PtSn/CeO2 catalysts.30 However, most of the Sn species dispersed on the exterior surface of the support by these methods, where Sn(iv) species tend to be reduced to metallic Sn during the reaction process due to the low melting point of Sn species, leading to the loss of the catalytic activity and regenerability.32,33 Therefore, it is highly desirable to exploit a new support, which can be used for anchoring Sn within its framework and enhancing the metalsupport interaction, and thus, facilitating the dispersion of Pt species effectively.
Zeolites, possessing high surface areas, well-defined channels, good thermal stability and tunable acidity, have been widely used as catalysts and supports in heterogeneous catalysis.23,3438 In particular, beta zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structures with 12-ring channel systems, which have larger pores than some other zeolites such as MFI zeolites.3944 The unique BEA-type structure provides a shape-selective reaction space for PDH to promote the diffusion of propene molecules, thus inhibiting both side reactions and coke formation. Moreover, the acidity of beta zeolites could be easily adjusted through removing lattice Al atoms from the zeolite framework.40,42 Meanwhile, this approach could produce lots of vacant T-atom sites related to silanol groups, creating an opportunity to anchor metal precursors and generating well-defined bimetallic systems by the introduction of other metals through the interaction between the introduced metal and supported metal nanoparticles.44 Therefore, this provides a way to tune and enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity for the PDH process, and also introduces unique stability characteristics for bimetallic systems.
Herein, highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared via an improved post-synthesis method and used for PDH, which exhibited high catalytic activity, good selectivity and excellent stability. For comparison, Pt species supported on Sn-H-beta were also prepared, exhibiting much lower catalytic performance and weaker stability than Pt/Sn-Si-beta for PDH. The influence of the interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework on the catalytic performance of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst was investigated in detail. Furthermore, characterization techniques of spent catalysts were carried out to confirm the excellent stability of Pt/Sn-Si-beta.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Catalyst preparation
All the chemicals and reagents were obtained from commercial sources and used as received. Hβ (SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) was provided by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co. Ltd, China. Nitric acid, zinc nitrate, tin(iv) chloride pentahydrate and chloroplatinic acid were purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chem. Co.
The Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by dealumination of H-beta and then the introduction of Sn species via dry impregnation.45 In a typical process, commercial H-beta zeolite was stirred in a 13 M nitric acid aqueous solution (20 mL gzeolite1) at 100 C for 10 h to obtain Si-beta. The mixture was centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times to remove residual nitric acid, then dried for 12 h in a vacuum oven (200 C, 0.1 MPa) to remove physisorbed water. Afterwards, 1.0 g of Si-beta was finely ground with a certain amount of SnCl4·5H2O in a glovebox and heated to 550 C for 6 h (heating rate of 5 C min1) under vacuum in a tubular reactor. After that, the solid mixture was calcined under flowing air at 550 C for 6 h (heating rate of 5 C min1) to obtain the final product, labeled as x%-Sn-Si-beta (x represents the calculated Sn loading amount in the sample). For comparison, Sn-H-beta was synthesized with a similar preparation procedure of the Sn-Si-beta sample.
The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst was prepared by introducing the platinum precursor onto Sn-Si-beta using the wet impregnation method. Before the introduction of Pt, the Sn-Si-beta sample was pretreated at 200 C for 12 h under vacuum to remove physisorbed water. Typically, 1 g of Sn-Si-beta was stirred in 20 mL of deionized water for 2 h. Then, the calculated H2PtCl6 solution (0.01 M) was added dropwise into the above solution, and the mixture was subsequently stirred at 25 C for 6 h. After that, the solvent was slowly evaporated at 80 C under stirring until the solvent was all evaporated, and the remaining solid was further dried at 100 C for 12 h. The resultant solid was calcinated in air at 550 C for 6 h with a 3 C min1 heating rate, and then reduced in a 20% H2/N2 gas mixture (60 mL min1) at 500 C for 1 h. Finally, Pt/Sn-Si-beta was obtained and placed in a drying dish. For reference, Pt/Sn-H-beta was also prepared by the same preparation procedure.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Mini Flex II diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were collected using the KBr pellet technique on the transmission module of a Bruker Tensor 37 FT-IR spectrometer with 64 scans at a resolution of 2 cm1. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the dehydrated samples were recorded on a Shimadzu 2450 spectrometer in the range of 190800 nm, and BaSO4 was used as a standard reference. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out on a TA SDT Q600 analyzer in air with a 10 C min1 heating rate and 100 mL min1 air flow rate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the dehydrated samples were carried out on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with an Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The platinum and stannum contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a ThermoFisher iCAP7400 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Before measurements, the samples were digested in the mixed solutions of H3PO4 and aqua regia at 60 C for 1 h.
The CO adsorption experiment was performed with a BRUKER TENSOR II using a resolution of 4 cm1. A self-supporting wafer was first reduced under 10% H2/Ar (30 mL min1) at 500 C for 1 h, followed by purging He (20 mL min1) at 500 C for 0.5 h to remove chemisorbed hydrogen species. Afterward, the sample was cooled in a flow of He to 30 C for collecting the background spectrum and then exposed to CO (10 mL min1) for 0.5 h. IR spectra were collected after purging He (30 mL min1) for 0.5 h and referenced to the background spectrum of the reduced catalyst.
Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) analyzer. Before this test, 0.05 g of the sample was degassed at 400 C for 1 h under a He flow (20 mL min1), and then cooled down to 60 C. Afterwards, the samples were purged with 10% H2/Ar (20 mL min1) until the baseline became flat and subsequently heated to 700 C with a 10 C min1 heating rate. The signals of desorbed compounds were detected using the TCD analyzer. H2O2 titration measurements were also performed on a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer. For each test, 100 mg catalyst was reduced under 10% H2/Ar (20 mL min1) at 500 C for 1 h, then purged with a He flow (20 mL min1) at the same temperature for 1 h and then cooled down to 60 C. The exact 1 mL pulses of 10% O2/Ar were injected to the reactor until the consumption peaks became stable. Subsequently, H2 chemisorption was carried out at the same temperature with injection pulses of 10% H2/Ar. It can be assumed that the adsorption stoichiometry factor (SF) of Pt/H2 = 2/3. The metal dispersity was calculated using the equation:
Dispersity(%) = VH2 × SF × MPt/mPt/224.14
where VH2 is the volume of adsorbed H2 (mL), SF is the stoichiometry factor, MPt is the atomic weight of Pt (g mol1), and mPt is the weight of supported Pt on the sample (g).
Ammonia and propene temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD and C3H6-TPD) experiments were also performed on the Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer with a TCD analyzer. Before all these tests, 0.2 g samples were pretreated at 400 C for 30 min under a He flow (20 mL min1), and subsequently cooled down to 80 C. Afterwards, the dried samples were saturated with 5% NH3/Ar (5% C3H6/N2) at 80 C. Then, the samples were purged with a He flow (20 mL min1) until the baseline became flat and subsequently heated to the target temperature with a 10 C min1 heating rate. The signals of desorbed compounds were detected using the TCD analyzer.
2.3 Catalytic activity test
The catalytic PDH performance of the prepared catalysts was investigated in a fixed-bed micro-reactor (5 mm i.d.) under atmospheric pressure. Typically, 50 mg catalyst was used in each experiment. A reaction gas mixture with a volume ratio of C3H8:N2 = 1:19 (20 mL min1) was passed through the catalyst bed. The products were measured using an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6890). The propane conversion, selectivity of the products and carbon balance were calculated using the following equations:
The turnover frequency (TOF) and propene rate were calculated as follows:
where FC3H8 represents the flow rate of propane; X and Y are the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propene, respectively; mcat, wPt, MPt and Dis. represent the catalyst weight, the percentage of Pt weight loading in the catalyst, the atomic mass of Pt and the dispersion of Pt, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Catalyst characterization
The Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were prepared by a post-synthesis procedure and used for PDH. As illustrated in Scheme 1, firstly, H-beta zeolite was completely dealuminated and then mixed with the calculated amount of Sn precursors. After calcination, the Sn precursors decomposed and reacted with the silanols produced by dealumination of the zeolite. Finally, Pt precursors were dispersed onto the Sn-Si-beta support by strong interaction between Pt and Sn after H2 reduction.

3.1.1 Incorporation of Sn into the Si-beta framework The XRD patterns are recorded to verify the structure changes of the beta zeolite after dealumination and metal incorporation. As shown in Fig. 1a, all the samples display similar diffraction patterns with a typical BEA topology, revealing that the dealumination and metal incorporation do not disturb the structure of the zeolite beta framework.45,46 However, the positions of the main diffraction peak around 22.5 (2θ), corresponding to d302 spacing, have slightly shifted for different samples.47 The d302 value of H-beta (2θ = 22.45) decreases from 3.956 to 3.939 Å for Si-beta (2θ = 22.55), indicating the contraction of the BEA matrix through dealumination.48 After metal incorporation, the d302 spacing increases to 3.951 and 3.953 Å for 0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta, respectively, evidencing the successful incorporation of Sn species into the framework of the beta zeolite.45

Drying of the samples was performed at 300 C in a dry N2 flow.
To analyse the changes of the silanol groups associated with vacant T-atom sites for beta zeolites after dealumination and metal incorporation procedures, infrared spectroscopy is carried out. As shown in Fig. 1b, there is no obvious band in the range of 9001000 cm1 for H-beta, but there is a band centered at 957 cm1 for Si-beta, which should be assigned to the defect silanol groups created by dealumination of H-beta.41,49 Subsequently, the introduction of Sn(iv) species results in a significant decrease in the band at 957 cm1, at the same time a new band appears at 961 cm1 for the Sn-Si-beta zeolite, indicating that the Sn species react with these SiOH groups and bound to the framework of the Si-beta zeolite.50,51 After the introduction of Pt, there is no change of the band for the Sn-Si-beta zeolite, which is probably due to the high dispersion of Pt.
3.1.2 Existence states of Sn species in Si-beta DR UV-vis spectroscopy is an effective method of understanding the chemical coordination of Sn species in the zeolite framework. As shown in Fig. 1c, the spectra of H-beta and SnO2 are considered as references. SnO2 exhibits a broad peak at 230330 nm, which is ascribed to the charge transfer from SnOSn bands.52 In contrast, 0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta display the peaks at 206 nm, attributed to the tetrahedral coordination of Sn species.53,54 In addition, no obvious bands are observed above 230 nm, excluding the existence of SnO2 species. The DR UV-vis results reveal that the Sn species existing in tetrahedral coordination states are incorporated into the framework of Si-beta.
XPS is performed to analyse the electronic states of Sn species in the selected samples (Fig. 1d). For pure SnO2, two peaks can be observed in the Sn 3d XPS spectra, corresponding to 3d5/2 (486.5 eV) and 3d3/2 (494.8 eV) photoelectrons of octahedral Sn species, respectively.41 While for Sn-H-beta, similar binding energy values are observed, which are the characteristic peaks of SnO2. However, two peaks at 487.3 and 495.6 eV can be seen in Sn-Si-beta, which are attributed to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons of the tetrahedral coordination of framework Sn species, respectively.55 These results indicate that Sn species in the framework of Sn-Si-beta are in a tetrahedral coordination, in agreement with the results of DR UV-vis analysis.
3.1.3 Pt dispersion induced by Sn sites confined in the Si-beta framework Fig. 2 shows the TEM and EDS elemental mapping images of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta. As for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta (Fig. 2a), no particles and aggregations can be observed in the channels and surface of 0.5Sn-Si-beta. The corresponding EDS mapping images reveal that the Pt species are highly dispersed throughout 0.5Sn-Si-beta with ultra-small nanoclusters, hinting a strong interaction between the Pt and Sn species (Fig. 2b). Similar results were also previously obtained in the case of Zn and Y supported on beta.6 With Pt loading increased to 1.5 wt% (Pt/Sn = 3/5), Pt nanoclusters were dominant (Fig. S1). It is indicated that the Sn species are still confined in the framework of Si-beta rather than migrating to Pt to form PtSn alloys despite the high Pt content. For 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, some large nanoclusters can be seen (Fig. 2c). The corresponding EDS mapping images indicate that Sn sites here aggregate together with Pt sites by the formation of PtSn bimetallic clusters (Fig. 2d). These results indicate that the Sn species confined in the Si-beta framework can facilitate the dispersion of Pt more significantly.

The influence of the Sn species on the properties of Pt centers was investigated by in situ infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on Pt-based catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3, there is no evident adsorption peak detectable in the pure Si-beta support, which suggests that CO adsorption takes place on the Pt-based catalysts. A strong adsorption band at around 2010 cm1 assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on Pt sites is noticeable in 0.3Pt/Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalysts, whereas a weak broad peak located at 1868 cm1 due to the bridge type of CO adsorption is detectable only in 0.3Pt/Si-beta.56,57 The absence of the bridge type of CO in the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst is mainly attributed to the Pt isolation effect by Sn species.9 Notably, an additional peak at 2085 cm1 appears in the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst. The double absorption bands at 2085 cm1 and 2010 cm1 are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of CO in the Pt(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl species on single Pt atoms and small Pt clusters.5860 This demonstrates that the Sn species confined in the Si-beta framework can facilitate the dispersion of Pt more significantly, which is consistent with the TEM results.

The interactions between Pt and Sn sites are certified by H2-TPR, and the results are shown in Fig. 4a. The H2-TPR profiles of 0.5Sn-H-beta and 0.5Sn-Si-beta show one visible reduction peak between 350 and 550 C, which is attributed to the reduction of Sn(iv) to Sn(ii).60,61 In the H2-TPR profiles, 0.5Sn-Si-beta displays a narrow peak at 503 C, while 0.5Sn-H-beta shows a broad one between 400 and 550 C. This indicates that the chemical environment of Sn(iv) species within the Si-beta framework is more homogeneous than that outside of the H-beta framework. In addition, the reduction of Sn(iv) species in 0.5Sn-Si-beta is more difficult than that in 0.5Sn-H-beta, which should be ascribed to the confinement of Sn(iv) in the framework of 0.5Sn-Si-beta.53 For 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, the reduction of Pt species could not be observed because of the low Pt loading, while the reduction temperatures of Sn(iv) increase to 521 and 497 C, respectively. The more difficulty of Sn reduction for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is probably due to the strong interactions between Pt and Sn(iv) species, and the confinement of Sn(iv) species further promotes the PtSn interaction. Accurately, the consumed hydrogen of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta (1.30 mmol of H2 per g) calculated from the H2-TPR profiles is higher than that of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta (0.75 mmol of H2 per g); similarly, the consumed hydrogen of 0.5Sn-Si-beta (1.28 mmol of H2 per g) is higher than that of 0.5Sn-H-beta (0.67 mmol of H2 per g). These results further suggest the strong interaction between Pt and Sn(iv) sites confined in the Si-beta framework.
Fig. 4 (a) H2-TPR curves of 0.5Sn-H-beta, 0.5Sn-Si-beta, 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta. (b) NH3-TPD curves of H-beta, Si-beta, 0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta with their corresponding Lewis acid site density shown inside.
NH3-TPD is employed to analyze the acid amounts of the samples. As shown in Fig. 4b, H-beta displays a strong desorption peak between 140 and 380 C, which reveals the existence of a great quantity of acid sites.62 The desorption peak of Si-beta does not appear after H-beta dealumination, which indicates that almost all the lattice Al atoms have been eliminated from the beta framework. Subsequently, Sn-Si-beta shows a broad ammonia desorption peak at 140350 C, which is due to the fact that the incorporation of Sn species into the Si-beta framework creates some Lewis acid sites.45 After the introduction of Pt, a relatively sharp peak of ammonia desorption centered at 230 C is observed for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta due to the interaction between Pt and Sn species confined in the Si-beta zeolite framework. Concretely, the Lewis acidity strengths of H-beta, Si-beta, 0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta are 0.42, 0.02, 0.11 and 0.15 mmolNH3 g1, respectively, consistent with the above results.
The above characterization results indicate that the Sn species existing in tetrahedral Sn(iv) have been successfully incorporated into the framework of the Si-beta zeolite, and Pt species are dispersed in the form of ultra-small clusters by the strong interactions between Pt and Sn(iv) species confined in the Si-beta framework. The unique structure of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is expected to show good reactivity and stability for PDH.
3.2 Catalytic performance
PDH tests were carried out at 500 C over all the prepared catalysts to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the catalysts for PDH. As shown in Fig. 5a, Pt/Si-beta shows unsatisfactory catalytic performance with a low propane TOF of 0.7 min1. In contrast, both beta supported bicomponent PtSn catalysts show higher TOFs than the Pt/Si-beta catalyst, though their catalytic performance varies greatly. A higher initial propane TOF of 4.6 min1 is achieved on Pt/Sn-Si-beta compared to Pt/Sn-H-beta (3.2 min1) under identical reaction conditions. Additionally, the propane conversion (27.1%) over the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst is close to the equilibrium conversion (30%) at 550 C with a pressure of 1 bar,1 which is much better than Pt/Sn-H-beta. Moreover, the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst exhibits excellent stability with a slight activity loss during 5 h time-on-stream at 550 C (Fig. 5b). These demonstrate that the highly dispersed Pt clusters on the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst could improve the catalytic performance, while the improved stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst might be ascribed to the interaction between Pt and Sn species confined in the Si-beta zeolite framework.
Fig. 5 Catalytic activity over different catalysts in PDH: (a) initial TOF values of catalysts at 500 C; (b) stability of different catalysts over 5 h; (c) the initial activities of the catalysts with a fixed amount of Pt (0.3 wt%) and an increasing content of Sn (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3 and 1.5 wt%); (d) the initial activities of the catalysts with a fixed amount of Sn (0.5 wt%) and a progressively changing content of Pt (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 wt%). Reaction conditions: 550 C (bd), 100 mg catalysts with a WHSV value of 1.0 h1.
The effects of Sn and Pt loadings on the PDH performance over Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts were further studied. The Sn and Pt loadings are measured by ICP-OES and the results are shown in Table S1. Sn loadings of Pt/Sn-Si-beta have a significant effect on the PDH reaction and the optimized Sn weight loading is 0.5% when the Pt weight loading is 0.3% (Fig. 5c). The effect of Sn loadings on PtSn catalysts should be attributed to the PtSn interactions.63 Furthermore, given the assumption that Pt atoms are individually dispersed in the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalyst, keeping the content of Sn (0.5 wt%) unchanged, the amount of Pt is added from 0.1 to 0.6 wt%, which guarantees the structure unchanged. The initial activity correlates linearly with the Pt content, which again suggests the formation of highly dispersed Pt catalysts supported on Sn-Si-beta (Fig. 5d). Note that the Pt weight loading of 0.3% could be optimized with the highest propane conversion and propene selectivity.
Then, at the optimized contents of Sn and Pt, the activity and stability of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta catalysts were investigated. As shown in Fig. 6a, the initial propene formation rate for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is 1.9 times of that for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, at the same time, the propane conversion increases to 27.1% for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta compared with 14.0% for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta. During the PDH at 550 C, the propene formation rate drops dramatically from 1.6 to 0.6 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta after 12 h on stream. As a contrast, the deactivation of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is not observed upon 12 h on stream and the propene formation rate only slightly decreases from 2.3 to 2.2 mol g1Pt h1 even after 24 h on stream (Fig. 6b). The calculated values of the carbon balance are about 96% for the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst, as shown in Fig. S2, verifying the correctness of the analytical determinations examined for the test. To further test the stability of the catalysts, the reaction temperature was increased to 600 C (Fig. 6a). During 12 h PDH, the propene formation rate drops from 2.0 to 0.9 mol g1Pt h1 for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, while for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta, the propene formation rate only decreases from 3.1 to 2.7 mol g1Pt h1, suggesting its higher activity and stability. A first-order deactivation model is used to estimate the stability of catalysts. Fig. 6c shows the specific activity and deactivation rate of the catalysts described in this work and in the literature (Table S2). As shown in Fig. 6c, the specific activity of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta at 550 C is superior, which is comparable to that of other reported PtSn catalysts at 590 C, and the catalyst life is also attractive.

(d) Catalytic performances over the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst for four successive dehydrogenation cycles at 550 C. Reaction conditions: 100 mg catalysts with a WHSV value of 1.0 h1.
In addition, the performance of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta for successive oxidationreduction cycles was examined (Fig. 6d). The formation rate and selectivity of propene over the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst have no change during four cycles at 550 C, confirming its good stability of dehydrogenation and regeneration.
3.3 Morphology and structure of spent catalysts
The spent catalysts were characterized to further certify the high stability of the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst. The diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectrum of the used dehydrated 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst (Fig. S3) showed no significant differences compared with that of the fresh dehydrated 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst, demonstrating that almost all Sn species existing as tetrahedral coordination states are still confined in the framework of the Si-beta zeolite after 12 h on stream. The TEM images of the spent catalysts after 5 h on stream are illustrated in Fig. 7. The Pt nanoparticles with 1.6 nm can be observed on the Sn-Si-beta support after the reaction, which may be due to the fact that a small portion of the Pt species (on the surface of the catalyst) is not confined by the Sn(iv) species, resulting in the growth of Pt species at a high reaction temperature (Fig. 7b). Moreover, the spent 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst after 12 h on stream was also characterized by TEM and EDS (Fig. S4). It is shown that the size of Pt nanoparticles almost remains unchanged (1.7 nm) and most of Pt species are still highly dispersed throughout 0.5Sn-Si-beta with ultra-small nanoclusters, indicating the high thermal stability of the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst at 550 C. And the metal loading amount in the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst almost remains unchanged (Table S3), further suggesting its high stability due to the strong PtSn interactions. However, for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, the particle size of Pt is increased obviously from 3.5 nm to 6.5 nm after the reaction (Fig. 7c and d), which may contribute to the quick deactivation of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta during the PDH reaction at 550 C. These results indicate a superior anti-sintering ability for Pt clusters supported on Sn-Si-beta.

During the PDH tests, the high reaction temperature would result in coke formation onto the catalyst surface. To quantify the coke content on the spent catalysts, TG experiments were carried out from room temperature to 700 C. As shown in Fig. S5, all the TG curves display two obvious weight losses in the temperature range of 30300 C and 300500 C, corresponding to the adsorbed water evaporation and coke combustion, respectively. As for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, it displays a weight loss of 5.9% after 12 h of reaction. However, 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta after 12 h on stream shows only a slight weight loss of 0.6%. Particularly, the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst after 24 h of the reaction has a weight loss of 0.8%, demonstrating the strong carbon deposition resistance of the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst. This is in good agreement with the excellent catalytic stability of the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst (Fig. 6).
3.4 Discussion
The influence of the high propene selectivity and catalytic stability could be explained by strong interaction between Pt and Sn confined in the Si-beta framework. To verify the relationship between the high propene selectivity and stability and the structure of Sn confined in the Si-beta framework and its influence on C3H6 desorption, the Sn 3d XPS and C3H6-TPD experiments of the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta catalysts were performed and then discussed.
3.4.1 Study of the electronic effects between Pt and Sn by XPS The strong interaction between Pt and Sn is investigated using XPS (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 8a, it can be observed that the binding energy of Sn in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is increased by 0.5 eV compared to that in 0.5Sn/Si-beta. Simultaneously, a 0.4 eV shift of Pt0 4f7/2 toward a lower binding energy is also observed in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta. The simultaneous shift of the binding energy of Pt and Sn, but in different directions, indicates the existence of the interaction between Pt and Sn (Fig. S6). For comparison, for 0.5Sn-H-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta (Fig. 8b), the PtSn interactions in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta increase the binding energy of Sn by 0.2 eV. This indicates that Sn species confined in the Si-beta framework could donate more electrons to Pt. As shown in Fig. 8a, about 10.2% Sn0 is present in the Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra on 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta after 12 h on stream (R-0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta), which indicates that most of the Sn sites are confined into the framework of the Si-beta zeolite. However, for 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, the percentage of Sn0 is increased obviously from 9.8% to 27% after 12 h on stream (R-0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta), which may contribute to the quick deactivation of 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta during the PDH reaction at 550 C (Fig. 8b). The Sn0 species in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta might act as a poison, resulting in a decrease in catalyst activity, which is consistent with the results of a previous report.63 These results further indicate that there is a strong interaction between the confined Sn(iv) sites and the supported Pt centers.

In order to better understand the interaction between Pt and metals confined in the Si-beta framework, 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-H-beta were prepared using the same preparation procedure as 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta and investigated by XPS (Fig. S7). The detailed synthesis procedures for 0.5Zn-H-beta, 0.5Zn-Si-beta, 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-H-beta are shown in the ESI. The binding energies for 0.5Zn-Si-beta are 1023.1 and 1045.8 eV, corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively,6 which are significantly higher than that of 0.5Zn-H-beta (1022.2 and 1045.2 eV), due to the formation of SiOZn bonds. For 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-Si-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-H-beta, similar binding energy values at 1022.5 and 1045.3 eV, and 1021.9 and 1044.9 eV, respectively, are observed. The higher shift values for Zn in 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-Si-beta compared to those in 0.3Pt/0.5Zn-H-beta should be due to the transfer of more electrons from Zn to Pt, which also indicates the strong interaction between Pt and Zn confined in the Si-beta framework.
3.4.2 Coke precursor and product interaction with PtSn catalysts by C3H6-TPD The interactions between propene and the PtSn catalyst were studied by C3H6-TPD. As shown in Fig. 9, 0.3Pt/Si-beta displays an obvious propene desorbed signal at 295 C, indicating the presence of the strong interaction between propene and catalysts. However, the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta and 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalysts show a weaker propene desorbed signal at 295 C than 0.3Pt/Si-beta. It is concluded that the Sn species tend to reduce the interaction between propene and catalysts, thus reducing the amount of propene.11 Note that the propane desorbed signal in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta is much weaker than that in 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-H-beta, indicating a weaker interaction between propene and Pt sites of the 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta catalyst. This weak interaction is attributed to the fact that electron-rich Pt sites from Sn species confined in the Si-beta framework tend to exclude the electron-rich propene and coke precursors. The results are in good accordance with the above catalyst performance and TG experiments, demonstrating that promoting the desorption of propene could prevent the conversion of propene into deep dehydrogenation products, thus decreasing the formation of coke and improving the selectivity of propene in PDH.

4. Conclusions
This work reports highly stable Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts, in which Pt species are highly dispersed in the form of ultra-small nanoclusters and interact strongly with the Sn sites confined in the Si-beta framework. Moreover, 0.3Pt/0.5Sn-Si-beta shows an excellent propene formation rate (2.3 mol g1Pt h1) with >99% selectivity at 550 C, and a higher propene formation rate of 3.1 mol g1Pt h1 at 600 C in PDH. For comparison, Pt species supported on the Sn-H-beta catalyst exhibit much lower catalytic performance for PDH and weaker stability than Pt/Sn-Si-beta. The confined Sn(iv) sites promote the high dispersion of Pt clusters and improve the catalyst stability by strong PtSn interactions. The catalytic performance over Pt/Sn-Si-beta can remain unchanged and no visible coke and sintering of Pt clusters are seen after 24 h time-on-stream. This work may provide an important instruction to design and synthesize stable dehydrogenation catalysts with high selectivity and stability.
