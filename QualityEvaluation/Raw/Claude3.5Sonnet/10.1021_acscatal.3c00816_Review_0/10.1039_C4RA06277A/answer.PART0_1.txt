[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical raw material, which can be used to produce polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, acrolein and other downstream products."

[2] "Because of growing demand for propylene, much effort has been paid to new propylene production routes. Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it make low-value propane to high valuable propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It utilizes low-value propane as feedstock to produce high-value propylene, addressing feedstock availability challenges.

2. It offers a more direct and efficient route compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

3. It provides a dedicated process for propylene production, potentially allowing for better control over product selectivity.

4. It helps meet the growing global demand for propylene by offering an additional production route.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how PDH addresses process efficiency and product selectivity challenges compared to conventional methods. More detailed comparisons would be needed to fully answer those aspects of the question.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它利用低价值的丙烷作为原料生产高价值的丙烯，解决了原料供应的挑战。

2. 与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）方法相比，它提供了一种更直接、更高效的路线。

3. 它为丙烯生产提供了一个专门的过程，可能允许更好地控制产品选择性。

4. 通过提供额外的生产途径，它有助于满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求。

然而，文献并未提供PDH如何解决与传统方法相比的工艺效率和产品选择性挑战的具体信息。需要更详细的比较才能全面回答这些问题的方面。
