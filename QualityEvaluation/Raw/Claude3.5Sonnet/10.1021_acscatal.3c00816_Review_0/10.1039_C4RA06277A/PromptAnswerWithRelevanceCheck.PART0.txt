<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical raw material, which can be used to produce polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, acrolein and other downstream products."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it make low-value propane to high valuable propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process."

[3] "However, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts due to the catalytic cracking and coking is a major challenge in DHP or ODHP process."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of low-value feedstock: PDH converts low-value propane into high-value propylene, improving resource utilization.

2. Direct production route: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, PDH offers a more direct and specific route to produce propylene.

3. Potential for higher selectivity: With proper catalyst design, PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity.

4. Addressing feedstock availability: As propane is more readily available than traditional naphtha feedstock, PDH helps diversify propylene sources.

5. Process flexibility: PDH can be operated independently of refinery operations, allowing for more flexible production.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coking. Ongoing research focuses on developing more stable and selective catalysts to improve process efficiency and longevity.
