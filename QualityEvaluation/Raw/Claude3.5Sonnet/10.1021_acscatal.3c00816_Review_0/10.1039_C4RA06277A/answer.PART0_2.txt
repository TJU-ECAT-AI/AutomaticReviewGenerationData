[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical raw material, which can be used to produce polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, acrolein and other downstream products."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it make low-value propane to high valuable propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process."

[3] "However, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts due to the catalytic cracking and coking is a major challenge in DHP or ODHP process."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of low-value feedstock: PDH converts relatively inexpensive propane into high-value propylene, improving process economics.

2. Direct production route: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, PDH offers a more direct and targeted route to produce propylene.

3. Flexibility in feedstock: PDH can utilize propane from various sources, addressing feedstock availability challenges.

4. Potential for higher selectivity: With optimized catalysts and conditions, PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity.

5. Independence from naphtha: PDH reduces reliance on naphtha, which is the primary feedstock for conventional steam cracking.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coking. Ongoing research focuses on developing more stable and selective catalysts to address this issue and improve overall process efficiency.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 利用低价值原料：PDH将相对便宜的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，提高了工艺经济性。

2. 直接生产路线：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH提供了更直接、更有针对性的丙烯生产路线。

3. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用来自不同来源的丙烷，解决了原料供应的挑战。

4. 更高选择性的潜力：通过优化催化剂和条件，PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性。

5. 减少对石脑油的依赖：PDH降低了对传统蒸汽裂解主要原料石脑油的依赖。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是由于结焦导致的催化剂失活。当前的研究重点是开发更稳定、更具选择性的催化剂，以解决这个问题并提高整体工艺效率。
