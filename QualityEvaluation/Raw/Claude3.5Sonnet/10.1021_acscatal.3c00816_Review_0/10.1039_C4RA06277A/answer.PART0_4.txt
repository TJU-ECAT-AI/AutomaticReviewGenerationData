[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical raw material, which can be used to produce polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, acrolein and other downstream products."

[2] "Because of growing demand for propylene, much effort has been paid to new propylene production routes. Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it make low-value propane to high valuable propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of low-value feedstock: PDH converts low-value propane into high-value propylene, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Direct and efficient process: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), PDH is a more direct route to produce propylene, potentially offering improved process efficiency.

3. Flexibility: PDH provides an alternative production route, helping to meet the growing demand for propylene that conventional methods may struggle to satisfy.

4. Product selectivity: While not explicitly stated, PDH likely offers better selectivity towards propylene compared to less targeted processes like steam cracking.

However, the document does not provide specific comparisons of PDH's efficiency or selectivity to conventional methods, so these advantages are inferred based on the information provided.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 利用低价值原料：PDH将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

2. 直接高效的工艺：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化(FCC)相比，PDH是一种更直接的丙烯生产路线，可能提供更高的工艺效率。

3. 灵活性：PDH提供了一种替代生产路线，有助于满足传统方法可能难以满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。

4. 产品选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但与蒸汽裂解等不太有针对性的工艺相比，PDH可能对丙烯提供更好的选择性。

然而，文档没有提供PDH效率或选择性与传统方法的具体比较，因此这些优势是基于所提供的信息推断出来的。
