[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical raw material, which can be used to produce polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, acrolein and other downstream products."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it make low-value propane to high valuable propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process."

[3] "However, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts due to the catalytic cracking and coking is a major challenge in DHP or ODHP process."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of low-value feedstock: PDH converts low-value propane into high-value propylene, improving resource utilization.

2. Direct production route: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, PDH offers a more direct and specific route to produce propylene.

3. Potential for higher selectivity: With proper catalyst design, PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity.

4. Addressing feedstock availability: As propane is more readily available than traditional naphtha feedstock, PDH helps diversify propylene sources.

5. Process flexibility: PDH can be operated independently of refinery operations, allowing for more flexible production.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coking. Ongoing research focuses on developing more stable and selective catalysts to improve process efficiency and longevity.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 利用低价值原料：PDH将低价值丙烷转化为高价值丙烯，提高了资源利用率。

2. 直接生产路线：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH提供了更直接和特定的丙烯生产路线。

3. 潜在的更高选择性：通过proper催化剂设计，PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性。

4. 解决原料供应问题：由于丙烷比传统的石脑油原料更容易获得，PDH有助于多样化丙烯来源。

5. 工艺灵活性：PDH可以独立于炼油厂运作，允许更灵活的生产。

然而，PDH技术仍面临挑战，特别是由于结焦造成的催化剂失活。当前研究重点是开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂，以提高工艺效率和使用寿命。
