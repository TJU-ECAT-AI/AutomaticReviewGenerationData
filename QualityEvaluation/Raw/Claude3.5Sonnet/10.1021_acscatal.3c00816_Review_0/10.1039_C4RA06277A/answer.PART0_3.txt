[1] "Propylene is an important basic chemical raw material, which can be used to produce polypropylene, epoxypropane, acrylonitrile, acrolein and other downstream products."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising industrial alternative to produce propylene since it make low-value propane to high valuable propylene, which is now mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process."

[3] "However, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts due to the catalytic cracking and coking is a major challenge in DHP or ODHP process."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of low-value feedstock: PDH converts low-value propane into high-value propylene, addressing feedstock availability issues.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is potentially more efficient than traditional steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can potentially offer higher propylene selectivity compared to less targeted cracking processes.

4. Flexibility: PDH provides an alternative production route, diversifying propylene sources beyond conventional methods.

However, the document also highlights a key challenge for PDH technology - catalyst deactivation due to coking, which needs to be addressed to improve process stability and efficiency. The growing demand for propylene is driving interest in PDH as a promising alternative to conventional production methods, though continued catalyst development is needed to fully realize its potential.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的主要优势包括：

1. 利用低价值原料：PDH将低价值的丙烷转化为高价值的丙烯，解决了原料可用性问题。

2. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH可能比传统的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解方法更有效率。

3. 产品选择性：与目标性较低的裂解工艺相比，PDH可能提供更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 灵活性：PDH提供了一种替代生产路线，使丙烯来源多样化，不仅限于传统方法。

然而，文献也指出了PDH技术的一个关键挑战——由于结焦导致的催化剂失活，这需要解决以提高工艺的稳定性和效率。丙烯需求的增长推动了对PDH作为传统生产方法有前景替代品的兴趣，但仍需继续开发催化剂以充分实现其潜力。
