Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is increasingly available from shale gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock supply faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers improved efficiency compared to traditional cracking methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is designed specifically to produce propylene, allowing for higher selectivity compared to less targeted processes.

4. Environmental considerations: PDH represents a cleaner, lower-carbon approach to utilizing fossil energy resources, aligning with carbon neutrality goals.

5. Economic factors: PDH reduces reliance on expensive and scarce platinum catalysts used in some conventional methods.

6. Reduced environmental impact: PDH avoids the use of toxic chromium catalysts that pose environmental concerns in some traditional processes.

These advantages position PDH as a highly promising technology to meet growing global propylene demand while addressing challenges in feedstock, efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability faced by conventional production methods.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，而丙烷从页岩气资源中越来越容易获得。这解决了传统方法面临的原料供应挑战。

2. 工艺效率：作为直接转化过程，PDH比传统的以丙烯为副产品的裂解方法提供了更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，与不太有针对性的工艺相比，允许更高的选择性。

4. 环境考虑：PDH代表了一种更清洁、低碳的化石能源利用方式，符合碳中和目标。

5. 经济因素：PDH减少了对某些传统方法中使用的昂贵且稀缺的铂催化剂的依赖。

6. 减少环境影响：PDH避免了使用一些传统工艺中存在环境问题的有毒铬催化剂。

这些优势使PDH成为一种极具前景的技术，能够满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求，同时解决传统生产方法在原料、效率、选择性和可持续性方面面临的挑战。
