Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is increasingly available from shale gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock supply faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient compared to traditional methods that involve multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, allowing for more targeted production of the desired product.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH contributes to cleaner and low-carbon utilization of fossil energy, aligning with carbon neutrality goals.

5. Economic advantages: PDH reduces reliance on expensive and scarce platinum catalysts used in some conventional methods.

6. Reduced environmental impact: PDH avoids the use of environmentally toxic chromium catalysts employed in some traditional processes.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges of feedstock constraints, process inefficiencies, and environmental concerns associated with conventional propylene production methods, making it well-suited to meet the growing global demand for propylene.
