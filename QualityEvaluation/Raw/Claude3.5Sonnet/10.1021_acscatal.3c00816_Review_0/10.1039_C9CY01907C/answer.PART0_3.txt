Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Higher selectivity: PDH provides better selectivity compared to other methods, allowing for more efficient propylene production.

2. Sustainability: PDH is considered a sustainable approach, which is crucial given the growing global demand for propylene.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes are known for their environment-friendly properties.

4. Excellent catalytic performance: The use of Pt-based catalysts in PDH offers superior catalytic performance.

5. Direct conversion: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially simplifying the production process.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability. The main issues are:

1. Coke deposition: This can lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

2. Metal sintering: Another factor contributing to catalyst deactivation.

To address these challenges, researchers are focusing on developing more stable catalysts, such as the Pt/Sn-Si-beta catalysts described in the literature, which show improved resistance to coke formation and metal sintering.

While the literature doesn't directly compare PDH to conventional production methods, the advantages mentioned suggest that PDH could potentially offer improvements in feedstock utilization (by directly using propane), process efficiency (through high selectivity and catalytic performance), and product selectivity compared to traditional methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 更高的选择性：与其他方法相比，PDH提供了更好的选择性，从而实现更高效的丙烯生产。

2. 可持续性：考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，PDH被认为是一种可持续的方法。

3. 环境友好：PDH过程中使用的铂基催化剂以其环境友好的特性而闻名。

4. 出色的催化性能：在PDH中使用铂基催化剂提供了卓越的催化性能。

5. 直接转化：PDH允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，可能简化了生产过程。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性方面。主要问题包括：

1. 焦炭沉积：这可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

2. 金属烧结：另一个导致催化剂失活的因素。

为了解决这些挑战，研究人员正在致力于开发更稳定的催化剂，例如文献中描述的Pt/Sn-Si-beta催化剂，这种催化剂显示出对焦炭形成和金属烧结的改进抗性。

虽然文献没有直接将PDH与传统生产方法进行比较，但所提到的优势表明，与传统方法相比，PDH可能在原料利用（通过直接使用丙烷）、过程效率（通过高选择性和催化性能）和产品选择性方面提供改进。
