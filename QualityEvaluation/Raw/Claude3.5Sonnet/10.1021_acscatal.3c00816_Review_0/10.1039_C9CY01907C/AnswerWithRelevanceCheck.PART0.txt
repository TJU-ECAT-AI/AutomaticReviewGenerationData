          [1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a sustainable approach and an attractive catalytic route with higher selectivity than other methods to produce propene."

[2] "Currently, Pt-based catalysts have drawn particular attention due to their excellent catalytic performance and environment-friendly properties in commercial PDH processes."

[3] "However, a major challenge of Pt-based catalysts during application is deactivation, which results from coke deposition and metal sintering."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Higher selectivity: PDH provides better selectivity compared to other methods, allowing for more efficient propylene production.

2. Sustainability: PDH is considered a sustainable approach, which is crucial given the growing global demand for propylene.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes are known for their environment-friendly properties.

4. Excellent catalytic performance: The use of Pt-based catalysts in PDH offers superior catalytic performance.

5. Direct conversion: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially simplifying the production process.

6. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which can be sourced from natural gas or other sources, addressing feedstock availability challenges.

PDH technology addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: By using propane as a feedstock, PDH reduces dependence on traditional feedstocks that may be less available or more expensive.

2. Process efficiency: The high selectivity and direct conversion nature of PDH improves overall process efficiency compared to other methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers higher propylene selectivity, reducing unwanted by-products and improving yield.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability. The main issues are:

1. Coke deposition: This can lead to catalyst deactivation over time.

2. Metal sintering: Another factor contributing to catalyst deactivation.

Ongoing research focuses on developing more stable catalysts to overcome these limitations and further improve the PDH process.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 更高的选择性：与其他方法相比，PDH提供了更好的选择性，允许更高效的丙烯生产。

2. 可持续性：考虑到全球对丙烯需求的增长，PDH被认为是一种可持续的方法。

3. 环境友好性：PDH过程中使用的铂基催化剂以其环境友好的特性而闻名。

4. 优异的催化性能：在PDH中使用铂基催化剂提供了卓越的催化性能。

5. 直接转化：PDH允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，可能简化了生产过程。

6. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，可以从天然气或其他来源获得，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

PDH技术通过以下方式解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 原料可用性：通过使用丙烷作为原料，PDH减少了对可能较少可用或更昂贵的传统原料的依赖。

2. 工艺效率：PDH的高选择性和直接转化性质相比其他方法提高了整体工艺效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH提供更高的丙烯选择性，减少了不需要的副产品，提高了产率。

然而，PDH技术仍面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性方面。主要问题包括：

1. 焦炭沉积：这可能导致催化剂随时间推移而失活。

2. 金属烧结：另一个导致催化剂失活的因素。

正在进行的研究集中在开发更稳定的催化剂，以克服这些限制并进一步改进PDH过程。
