Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Higher selectivity: PDH provides better selectivity compared to other methods, allowing for more efficient propylene production.

2. Sustainability: It is considered a sustainable approach, which is crucial given the growing global demand for propylene.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes are known for their environment-friendly properties.

4. Excellent catalytic performance: Pt-based catalysts demonstrate superior performance in commercial PDH processes.

PDH technology addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: By using propane as a feedstock, PDH reduces dependence on traditional feedstocks that may be less available or more expensive.

2. Process efficiency: The high selectivity of PDH improves overall process efficiency compared to other methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers higher propylene selectivity, reducing unwanted by-products and improving yield.

However, it's important to note that PDH technology still faces some challenges, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and metal sintering. Ongoing research aims to overcome these issues and further improve the stability and performance of PDH catalysts.
