[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."

[2] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."

[3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from abundant shale gas resources, which decreases production costs and improves commercial viability.

2. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers better control over the reaction compared to oxidative dehydrogenation methods, potentially leading to improved efficiency and safety.

3. Product selectivity: PDH directly converts propane to propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity compared to other production methods that may yield multiple products.

4. Market demand: PDH addresses the growing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production pathway.

5. Commercial viability: The technology has already been realized in commercial applications, demonstrating its practicality and scalability.

While the literature doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods, it suggests that PDH technology effectively addresses challenges related to feedstock availability and process efficiency, making it an attractive option for propylene production in the current market context.
