[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."

[2] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."

[3] "In fact, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained."

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of PDH to conventional propylene production methods or discuss its specific advantages in detail. However, based on the limited information provided:

PDH addresses the growing demand for propylene by directly converting propane to propylene. It has gained attention and been commercialized due to increasing propylene demand. The non-oxidative PDH process in particular has attracted interest, suggesting it may have advantages over oxidative processes. PDH using chromium catalysts can achieve good propylene selectivity when the catalyst is properly designed with well-dispersed active species.

The document does not contain sufficient information to comment on PDH's specific advantages regarding feedstock availability, process efficiency, or product selectivity compared to conventional methods. More context would be needed to fully answer the question as posed.

该文献并未全面比较PDH与传统丙烯生产方法,也没有详细讨论其具体优势。但根据有限的信息:

PDH通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯来满足不断增长的丙烯需求。由于丙烯需求的增加,PDH已经引起关注并实现了商业化。特别是非氧化PDH工艺引起了人们的兴趣,这表明它可能比氧化工艺具有优势。使用铬催化剂的PDH在催化剂设计合理、活性物种分散良好的情况下,可以获得良好的丙烯选择性。

文件中没有足够的信息来评论PDH在原料可用性、工艺效率或产品选择性方面相对于传统方法的具体优势。需要更多背景信息才能全面回答所提出的问题。
