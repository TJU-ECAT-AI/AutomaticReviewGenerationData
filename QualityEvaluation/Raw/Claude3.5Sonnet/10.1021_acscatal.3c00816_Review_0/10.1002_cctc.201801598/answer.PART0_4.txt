[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."

[2] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."

[3] "In fact, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the limited information available, we can infer a few points:

1. PDH addresses the growing global demand for propylene, which has led to increased interest in this technology.

2. PDH is a non-oxidative process, which may offer advantages in terms of process control and safety compared to oxidative methods.

3. PDH has gained attention and has been realized in commercial applications, suggesting it has practical advantages over some other methods.

4. The process efficiency and product selectivity of PDH can be influenced by catalyst composition, with low chromium loadings contributing to good dispersion of catalytically active species.

However, the text does not provide specific information on feedstock availability, detailed process efficiency comparisons, or product selectivity advantages of PDH over conventional methods. A more comprehensive analysis would require additional information not present in the given literature.

这篇文献并没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术相对于传统生产方法的关键优势的问题。然而，基于有限的可用信息，我们可以推断出几点：

1. PDH技术满足了全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，这导致了对这项技术的兴趣增加。

2. PDH是一个非氧化过程，相比氧化方法可能在过程控制和安全性方面提供优势。

3. PDH已经引起关注并在商业应用中实现，表明它比其他一些方法具有实际优势。

4. PDH的工艺效率和产品选择性可以通过催化剂组成来影响，低铬负载有助于催化活性物种的良好分散。

然而，文本并没有提供关于原料可用性、详细的工艺效率比较或PDH相对于传统方法的产品选择性优势的具体信息。要进行更全面的分析，需要额外的信息，而这些信息在给定的文献中并不存在。
