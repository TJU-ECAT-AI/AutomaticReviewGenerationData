[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."

[2] "Though the former shows the advantage of reducing coke formation, it is still associated with the problem that the oxidation degree is hard to be controlled during actual industrial application, thus leading to safety issues and low propene yield inevitably."

[3] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."

[4] "In fact, as for these reported literatures, the general knowledge is that low Cr loadings contribute to good dispersion of Cr species, and as a result, mononuclear Cr(VI) as well as some Cr(III) species with coordinative vacancies are obtained."

The growing global demand for propylene has led to increased interest in propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology. PDH offers several key advantages over conventional production methods:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available from sources like shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by traditional propylene production methods.

2. Process efficiency: Non-oxidative PDH avoids the control issues associated with oxidative dehydrogenation, which can lead to safety concerns and low propene yields. This makes PDH a more efficient and safer process.

3. Product selectivity: PDH allows for better control of the reaction conditions, potentially leading to higher propene selectivity compared to other methods. The ability to optimize catalyst compositions, like using low Cr loadings for better dispersion of active species, contributes to improved selectivity.

4. Commercial viability: PDH has already been realized in commercial applications, indicating its practicality and economic feasibility for large-scale propylene production.

5. Adaptability to market demands: As a dedicated propylene production method, PDH can be more easily scaled or adjusted to meet fluctuating market demands compared to byproduct-based production methods.

These advantages make PDH a promising technology for addressing the challenges of propylene production, particularly in terms of meeting growing demand with improved efficiency and selectivity.

全球对丙烯需求的增长导致了人们对丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的兴趣增加。与传统生产方法相比，PDH提供了几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，这种原料可以从页岩气等来源大量获得。这解决了传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料稀缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：非氧化性PDH避免了与氧化脱氢相关的控制问题，后者可能导致安全隐患和低丙烯产率。这使PDH成为一个更高效、更安全的过程。

3. 产品选择性：PDH允许更好地控制反应条件，可能导致比其他方法更高的丙烯选择性。优化催化剂组成的能力，如使用低铬负载以获得更好的活性物种分散，有助于提高选择性。

4. 商业可行性：PDH已经在商业应用中实现，表明其对大规模丙烯生产的实用性和经济可行性。

5. 适应市场需求：作为一种专门的丙烯生产方法，与副产品生产方法相比，PDH可以更容易地根据波动的市场需求进行规模调整或调节。

这些优势使PDH成为解决丙烯生产挑战的有前途的技术，特别是在以提高效率和选择性来满足不断增长的需求方面。
