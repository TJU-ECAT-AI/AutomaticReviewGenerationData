[1] "Recently, growing demand for propene has spurred an increased interest in the dehydrogenation reaction of propane."

[2] "Consequently, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been gained much attention and realized in commercial applications."

[3] "In particular, the recent conversion of propane from shale gas has anticipated to decrease the cost of production and made it to be more commercial and attractive, due to the vast amounts and growing production of shale gas worldwide."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. Addressing growing propylene demand: PDH directly produces propylene from propane, helping meet increasing market needs.

2. Commercial viability: PDH has already been implemented in industrial applications, demonstrating its practicality.

3. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas, which is abundant and increasingly produced worldwide.

4. Cost-effectiveness: Using propane from shale gas is expected to reduce production costs.

5. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH avoids issues associated with controlling oxidation degrees in oxidative dehydrogenation.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss product selectivity advantages, PDH generally offers good selectivity to propylene compared to other processes. The technology addresses feedstock challenges by leveraging abundant shale gas resources, improves efficiency through direct conversion, and provides a commercially proven route to meet growing propylene demand.
