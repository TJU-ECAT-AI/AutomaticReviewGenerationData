<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional propylene production methods. The document focuses on describing a specific catalyst (K-PtSn@MFI) for propane dehydrogenation and its characterization, but does not provide information on the broader context of PDH technology or its advantages over other propylene production methods.

The given scientific literature does not contain information specifically addressing propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or its advantages for propylene production. The document focuses on the characterization and catalytic performance of subnanometric PtSn clusters confined in zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the broader context of PDH technology or compare it to other propylene production methods. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the information provided in the given text.

The given scientific literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional production methods for propylene. The document focuses on the characterization and performance of specific catalysts (K-PtSn@MFI) for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the broader context of propylene production or the advantages of PDH technology in general. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based solely on the information provided in the given literature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional propylene production methods. The document focuses on the development and characterization of a specific catalyst (K-PtSn@MFI) for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide broader context on PDH technology or its advantages over other propylene production methods.

To properly answer this question, additional information about propane direct dehydrogenation technology and its comparison to other propylene production methods would be needed. The document does not contain relevant information to address the global demand for propylene, feedstock availability, process efficiency, or product selectivity in a broader context.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给出的科学文献并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势，也没有将其与传统的丙烯生产方法进行比较。该文档主要集中于一种特定催化剂(K-PtSn@MFI)在丙烷脱氢反应中的开发和表征，但没有提供关于PDH技术或其相对于其他丙烯生产方法优势的更广泛背景。

要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的关于丙烷直接脱氢技术以及其与其他丙烯生产方法比较的信息。该文档不包含相关信息来更广泛地讨论全球丙烯需求、原料可用性、工艺效率或产品选择性。
