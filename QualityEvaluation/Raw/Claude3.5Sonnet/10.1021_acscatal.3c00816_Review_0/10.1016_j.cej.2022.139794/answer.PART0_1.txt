Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for direct, targeted production of propylene to meet increasing demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional oil-based feedstocks.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH are more eco-friendly compared to CrOx-based catalysts.

4. High selectivity potential: With proper catalyst design, PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity.

5. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion method, PDH potentially offers improved efficiency over multi-step processes.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and propylene selectivity under the high temperatures and harsh conditions required for the endothermic reaction. Ongoing research, such as the development of novel catalysts described in this paper, aims to address these challenges and further improve the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许直接、有针对性地生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的油基原料更容易获得。

3. 环境友好：PDH使用的铂基催化剂比铬氧化物基催化剂更环保。

4. 高选择性潜力：通过适当的催化剂设计，PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性。

5. 工艺效率：作为一种直接转化方法，PDH可能比多步骤工艺提供更高的效率。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在吸热反应所需的高温和苛刻条件下的催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性方面。正在进行的研究，如本文描述的新型催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些挑战并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和选择性。
