Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, allowing for targeted production to meet increasing demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH are more eco-friendly compared to CrOx-based catalysts.

4. High selectivity potential: While challenging, PDH has the potential for high propylene selectivity when optimized.

5. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH can be more efficient than cracking-based methods.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and selectivity under the high temperatures required for the endothermic reaction. Ongoing research, such as the development of novel catalysts described in this paper, aims to address these challenges and further improve the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，可以有针对性地满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，与传统的原料如石脑油相比，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 环境友好：PDH中使用的铂基催化剂比铬基催化剂更环保。

4. 高选择性潜力：虽然具有挑战性，但经过优化后，PDH有潜力实现高丙烯选择性。

5. 工艺效率：作为直接转化过程，PDH可能比裂解基础的方法更有效率。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在吸热反应所需的高温条件下的催化剂稳定性和选择性方面。正在进行的研究，如本文所述的新型催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些挑战，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和选择性。
