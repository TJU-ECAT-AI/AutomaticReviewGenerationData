[1] "Propylene is one of the most significant building blocks for the synthesis of polyethers, unsaturated resins, propene glycol, polyurethane and polyols"

[2] "Among the production processes of propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is considered to be a potential on-purpose method to meet the increasing demand for propene production."

[3] "The Pt-based catalysts with efficient CH activation ability are more eco-friendly than CrOx-based catalysts"

[4] "However, owing to an endothermic process, high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions create a grand challenge for propene selectivity and the stability of catalysts"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production to meet increasing demand, unlike traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha cracking.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH are more eco-friendly compared to CrOx-based catalysts.

4. High selectivity potential: While high temperatures pose challenges, advanced catalyst designs can achieve high propene selectivity.

5. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion method, PDH potentially offers better efficiency than multi-step processes.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges in terms of catalyst stability and propene selectivity due to the high temperatures required. Ongoing research focuses on developing catalysts that can maintain high activity, selectivity, and stability under these harsh conditions.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性地生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求，而传统方法则将丙烯作为副产品生产。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石脑油裂解，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 环境友好：PDH中使用的铂基催化剂比氧化铬基催化剂更加环保。

4. 高选择性潜力：虽然高温带来挑战，但先进的催化剂设计可以实现高丙烯选择性。

5. 过程效率：作为一种直接转化方法，PDH可能比多步骤过程提供更好的效率。

然而，由于所需的高温，PDH技术在催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性方面仍面临挑战。目前的研究重点是开发能在这些苛刻条件下保持高活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂。
