[1] "Propylene is one of the most significant building blocks for the synthesis of polyethers, unsaturated resins, propene glycol, polyurethane and polyols"

[2] "Among the production processes of propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is considered to be a potential on-purpose method to meet the increasing demand for propene production."

[3] "The Pt-based catalysts with efficient CH activation ability are more eco-friendly than CrOx-based catalysts"

[4] "However, owing to an endothermic process, high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions create a grand challenge for propene selectivity and the stability of catalysts"

PDH technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows direct and targeted production of propylene to meet increasing demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than traditional naphtha cracking.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based PDH catalysts are more eco-friendly compared to chromium oxide catalysts.

4. High selectivity potential: With proper catalyst design, PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity.

5. Process efficiency: As a direct dehydrogenation route, PDH is potentially more efficient than indirect methods.

However, PDH also faces challenges including the need for high temperatures, catalyst deactivation, and maintaining high selectivity under harsh conditions. Ongoing research aims to address these issues through improved catalyst and process designs.

PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许直接和有针对性地生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，比传统的石脑油裂解更容易获得。

3. 环境友好：基于铂的PDH催化剂比氧化铬催化剂更环保。

4. 高选择性潜力：通过适当的催化剂设计，PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性。

5. 工艺效率：作为直接脱氢路线，PDH可能比间接方法更有效。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战，包括需要高温、催化剂失活以及在苛刻条件下保持高选择性。正在进行的研究旨在通过改进的催化剂和工艺设计来解决这些问题。
