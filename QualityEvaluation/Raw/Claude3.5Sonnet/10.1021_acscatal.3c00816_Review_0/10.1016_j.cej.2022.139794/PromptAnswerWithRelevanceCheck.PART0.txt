[1] "Propylene is one of the most significant building blocks for the synthesis of polyethers, unsaturated resins, propene glycol, polyurethane and polyols"

[2] "Among the production processes of propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) using Pt- or Cr2O3-based materials is considered to be a potential on-purpose method to meet the increasing demand for propene production."

[3] "The Pt-based catalysts with efficient CH activation ability are more eco-friendly than CrOx-based catalysts"

[4] "However, owing to an endothermic process, high reaction temperatures and harsh conditions create a grand challenge for propene selectivity and the stability of catalysts"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production to meet increasing demand, unlike traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha cracking.

3. Environmental friendliness: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH are more eco-friendly compared to CrOx-based catalysts.

4. Potential for high selectivity: With proper catalyst design, PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, including:

1. High energy requirements: The process is endothermic and requires high reaction temperatures.

2. Catalyst stability: Harsh reaction conditions can lead to catalyst deactivation and reduced stability.

3. Selectivity-conversion trade-off: Achieving high propylene selectivity while maintaining high propane conversion remains a challenge.

To address these challenges, researchers are focusing on developing advanced catalysts that can improve selectivity, stability, and energy efficiency of the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性地生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求，不像传统方法将丙烯作为副产品生产。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石脑油裂解，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 环境友好：PDH中使用的铂基催化剂比氧化铬基催化剂更环保。

4. 高选择性潜力：通过适当的催化剂设计，PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战，包括：

1. 高能耗：该过程是吸热的，需要高反应温度。

2. 催化剂稳定性：苛刻的反应条件可能导致催化剂失活和稳定性降低。

3. 选择性-转化率权衡：在保持高丙烷转化率的同时实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。

为了解决这些挑战，研究人员正在致力于开发先进的催化剂，以提高PDH过程的选择性、稳定性和能源效率。
