[1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production. Yet, a continuously growing demand for propene drives intense exploration of the new production processes. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[2] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss"

[3] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature. This approach, however, suffers from the low olefin selectivity at industrially relevant alkane conversions due to successive propene oxidation to carbon oxides."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a targeted process that produces propylene as the primary product, unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking which yield a mix of products.

3. Higher propylene yields: PDH can potentially achieve higher propylene yields compared to conventional methods that are already optimized for propylene production.

4. Independence from refinery operations: As a standalone process, PDH is not tied to refinery economics like fluid catalytic cracking.

5. Ability to meet growing demand: PDH provides additional propylene production capacity to address the continuously growing global demand that conventional methods cannot satisfy.

However, PDH also faces some challenges:

1. High reaction temperatures leading to side reactions and coke formation.

2. Thermodynamic limitations on conversion per pass.

3. Catalyst deactivation issues.

Despite these challenges, PDH remains one of the most promising technologies for increasing propylene production due to its targeted approach and feedstock flexibility. Ongoing research aims to develop more efficient catalysts and process designs to further improve PDH performance.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法使用的石脑油或重质油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个以丙烯为主要产品的针对性工艺，不像蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化那样产生多种产品混合物。

3. 更高的丙烯产率：PDH有可能实现比已经优化的传统方法更高的丙烯产率。

4. 独立于炼油厂运营：作为一个独立的工艺，PDH不受炼油厂经济性的影响，如流化催化裂解。

5. 满足不断增长的需求的能力：PDH提供了额外的丙烯生产能力，以满足传统方法无法满足的持续增长的全球需求。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 高反应温度导致副反应和焦炭形成。

2. 单程转化率受热力学限制。

3. 催化剂失活问题。

尽管存在这些挑战，由于其针对性方法和原料灵活性，PDH仍然是增加丙烯产量最有前景的技术之一。正在进行的研究旨在开发更高效的催化剂和工艺设计，以进一步提高PDH的性能。
