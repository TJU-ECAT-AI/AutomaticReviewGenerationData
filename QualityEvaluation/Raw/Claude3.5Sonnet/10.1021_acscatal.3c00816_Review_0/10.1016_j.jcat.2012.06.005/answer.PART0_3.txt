[1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production."

[2] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[3] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. It directly addresses feedstock availability issues by using propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in conventional methods.

2. It offers better process efficiency by focusing specifically on propylene production, unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking which produce multiple products.

3. It has the potential for higher product selectivity compared to conventional methods, which are already optimized and cannot significantly increase propylene yields.

4. It provides an alternative route to meet the growing demand for propylene that cannot be met by existing production methods alone.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, including the need for high temperatures (above 800 K) due to thermodynamic constraints, which can lead to side reactions like cracking and coke formation, potentially reducing selectivity. Ongoing research aims to develop better catalysts and process conditions to address these challenges and further improve the efficiency and selectivity of PDH technology.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法的主要优势包括：

1. 它直接解决了原料可用性问题，使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法使用的石脑油或重质油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 它提供了更好的工艺效率，专注于丙烯生产，不像蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解那样产生多种产品。

3. 与已经优化且无法显著提高丙烯产量的传统方法相比，它具有更高的产品选择性潜力。

4. 它提供了一种替代路线，以满足现有生产方法无法单独满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，包括由于热力学限制而需要高温（800 K以上），这可能导致副反应如裂解和积碳的形成，潜在地降低选择性。正在进行的研究旨在开发更好的催化剂和工艺条件，以解决这些挑战并进一步提高PDH技术的效率和选择性。
