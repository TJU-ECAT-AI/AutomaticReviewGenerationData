[1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production."

[2] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[3] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha or heavier oil fractions used in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more targeted approach for propylene production compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a range of products.

3. Product selectivity: While PDH faces challenges with selectivity due to high temperatures, it still offers better control over product composition compared to the broader product slate from conventional methods.

4. Scalability: As a dedicated propylene production method, PDH can be more easily scaled to meet growing demand.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of high energy requirements and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Ongoing research, as discussed in the paper, aims to develop more stable and selective catalysts to address these issues.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法使用的石脑油或重质油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，PDH是一种更有针对性的丙烯生产方法，后者会产生一系列产品。

3. 产品选择性：尽管PDH由于高温面临选择性挑战，但与传统方法相比，它仍然能更好地控制产品组成。

4. 可扩展性：作为专门的丙烯生产方法，PDH可以更容易地扩大规模以满足不断增长的需求。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，提供物流优势。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在高能耗和由于积碳导致的催化剂失活方面。正如论文中讨论的，正在进行的研究旨在开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂来解决这些问题。
