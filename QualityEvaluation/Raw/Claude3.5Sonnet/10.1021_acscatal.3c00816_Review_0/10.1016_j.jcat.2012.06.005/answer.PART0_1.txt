[1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production."

[2] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[3] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It directly addresses the limitations of conventional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are already optimized and cannot significantly increase propylene production further.

2. PDH is a promising industrial alternative that can help meet the growing global demand for propylene.

3. It allows for selective production of propylene from propane feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavier oil fractions used in conventional methods.

4. PDH offers better process control and potentially higher propylene selectivity compared to non-selective cracking processes.

However, PDH also faces some challenges:

1. It requires high temperatures (above 800 K) due to thermodynamic constraints.

2. Side reactions like cracking and coke formation can occur at high temperatures, affecting selectivity.

3. Catalyst deactivation due to coking is a concern that needs to be addressed through catalyst design and regeneration strategies.

Overall, PDH technology provides a more direct and potentially more efficient route to propylene production, helping to address feedstock limitations and selectivity issues of conventional methods. Its ability to selectively produce propylene from widely available propane makes it a promising solution to meet growing propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它直接解决了传统生产方法如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解的局限性，这些方法已经优化到极限，无法显著提高丙烯产量。

2. PDH是一种有前景的工业替代方案，可以帮助满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。

3. 它允许从丙烷原料中选择性地生产丙烯，相比于传统方法使用的石脑油或重质油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

4. 与非选择性裂解过程相比，PDH提供了更好的过程控制和潜在的更高丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 由于热力学限制，它需要高温（800 K以上）。

2. 在高温下可能发生副反应，如裂解和焦炭形成，影响选择性。

3. 由于结焦导致的催化剂失活是一个需要通过催化剂设计和再生策略来解决的问题。

总的来说，PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了一条更直接、可能更高效的路径，有助于解决传统方法的原料限制和选择性问题。它能够从广泛可用的丙烷中选择性地生产丙烯，使其成为满足不断增长的丙烯需求的有前景的解决方案。
