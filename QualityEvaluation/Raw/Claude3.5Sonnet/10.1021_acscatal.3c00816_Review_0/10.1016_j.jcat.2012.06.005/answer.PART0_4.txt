[1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production."

[2] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[3] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. Addresses feedstock limitations: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in conventional methods.

2. Improved process efficiency: As a dedicated process for propylene production, PDH can be optimized specifically for this purpose, unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking which produce multiple products.

3. Higher product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional multi-product processes, although coke formation remains a challenge at high temperatures.

4. Flexibility: PDH provides an alternative route to propylene, diversifying production methods and reducing dependence on a single technology.

5. Potential for further optimization: As a relatively newer technology, PDH has room for improvements in catalysts and process conditions to further enhance efficiency and selectivity.

However, PDH also faces challenges such as high reaction temperatures leading to coke formation and catalyst deactivation, which need to be addressed for broader commercial adoption. Overall, PDH offers a promising complementary method to meet the growing propylene demand that cannot be fully satisfied by conventional production routes.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产方面具有以下关键优势，使其成为最有前景的方法：

1. 解决原料限制：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法使用的石脑油或重质油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 提高工艺效率：作为专门用于丙烯生产的工艺，PDH可以针对这一目的进行优化，不同于产生多种产品的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解。

3. 更高的产品选择性：与传统的多产品工艺相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性，尽管在高温下焦炭形成仍然是一个挑战。

4. 灵活性：PDH提供了一种替代性的丙烯生产路线，使生产方法多样化，减少对单一技术的依赖。

5. 进一步优化的潜力：作为一项相对较新的技术，PDH在催化剂和工艺条件方面还有改进的空间，以进一步提高效率和选择性。

然而，PDH也面临着一些挑战，如高反应温度导致焦炭形成和催化剂失活，这些问题需要解决以实现更广泛的商业应用。总的来说，PDH提供了一种有前景的互补方法，以满足传统生产路线无法完全满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。
