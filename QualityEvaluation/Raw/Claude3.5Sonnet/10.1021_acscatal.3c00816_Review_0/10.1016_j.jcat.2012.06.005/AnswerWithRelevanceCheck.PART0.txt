          [1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production."

[2] "Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[3] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss"

[4] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature. This approach, however, suffers from the low olefin selectivity at industrially relevant alkane conversions due to successive propene oxidation to carbon oxides."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha or heavier oil fractions used in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more targeted approach for propylene production compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a range of products.

3. Product selectivity: While PDH faces challenges with selectivity due to high temperatures, it still offers better control over product composition compared to the broader product slate from conventional methods.

4. Addressing growing demand: PDH provides an alternative route to meet the growing demand for propylene that cannot be met by existing production methods alone, which are already optimized and cannot significantly increase propylene yields.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages.

6. Potential for optimization: As a relatively newer technology, PDH has room for improvements in catalysts and process conditions to further enhance efficiency and selectivity.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. High temperatures: Commercial PDH requires temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints.

2. Side reactions: High temperatures can lead to propane/propene cracking and coke formation, affecting selectivity.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coke formation can lead to catalyst deactivation, requiring regeneration strategies.

Ongoing research aims to develop more stable and selective catalysts to address these issues and further improve PDH performance. Overall, PDH offers a promising complementary method to meet the growing propylene demand that cannot be fully satisfied by conventional production routes.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法的主要优势包括：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法使用的石脑油或重质油馏分，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，PDH是一种更有针对性的丙烯生产方法，后者会产生一系列产品。

3. 产品选择性：尽管PDH由于高温面临选择性挑战，但与传统方法相比，它仍然能更好地控制产品组成。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH提供了一种替代路线，以满足现有生产方法无法单独满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。传统方法已经优化到极限，无法显著提高丙烯产量。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，提供物流优势。

6. 优化潜力：作为一项相对较新的技术，PDH在催化剂和工艺条件方面还有改进的空间，以进一步提高效率和选择性。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战：

1. 高温：由于热力学限制，商业PDH需要800 K以上的温度。

2. 副反应：高温可能导致丙烷/丙烯裂解和焦炭形成，影响选择性。

3. 催化剂失活：焦炭形成可能导致催化剂失活，需要再生策略。

正在进行的研究旨在开发更稳定和选择性的催化剂，以解决这些问题并进一步提高PDH性能。总的来说，PDH提供了一种有前景的互补方法，以满足传统生产路线无法完全满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。
