[1] "Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production. Yet, a continuously growing demand for propene drives intense exploration of the new production processes. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives."

[2] "Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss"

[3] "Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature. This approach, however, suffers from the low olefin selectivity at industrially relevant alkane conversions due to successive propene oxidation to carbon oxides."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha or heavy oil fractions used in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a targeted process that produces propylene as the primary product, unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking which yield a mix of products.

3. Higher propylene yields: PDH can potentially achieve higher propylene yields compared to conventional methods that are already optimized for propylene production.

4. Independence from refinery operations: As a standalone process, PDH is not tied to refinery economics like fluid catalytic cracking.

5. Ability to meet growing demand: PDH provides additional propylene production capacity to address the continuously growing global demand that conventional methods cannot satisfy.

However, PDH also faces some challenges:

1. High reaction temperatures leading to side reactions and coke formation.

2. Thermodynamic limitations on conversion per pass.

3. Catalyst deactivation issues.

Despite these challenges, PDH remains one of the most promising technologies for increasing propylene production due to its targeted approach and feedstock flexibility. Ongoing research aims to develop more efficient catalysts and process designs to further improve PDH performance.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It directly addresses the limitations of conventional production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are already optimized and cannot significantly increase propylene production further.

2. PDH is a promising industrial alternative that can help meet the growing global demand for propylene.

3. It allows for selective production of propylene from propane feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha or heavier oil fractions used in conventional methods.

4. PDH offers better process control and potentially higher propylene selectivity compared to non-selective cracking processes.

However, PDH also faces some challenges:

1. It requires high temperatures (above 800 K) due to thermodynamic constraints.

2. Side reactions like cracking and coke formation can occur at high temperatures, affecting selectivity.

3. Catalyst deactivation due to coking is a concern that needs to be addressed through catalyst design and regeneration strategies.

Overall, PDH technology provides a more direct and potentially more efficient route to propylene production, helping to address feedstock limitations and selectivity issues of conventional methods. Its ability to selectively produce propylene from widely available propane makes it a promising solution to meet growing propylene demand.
