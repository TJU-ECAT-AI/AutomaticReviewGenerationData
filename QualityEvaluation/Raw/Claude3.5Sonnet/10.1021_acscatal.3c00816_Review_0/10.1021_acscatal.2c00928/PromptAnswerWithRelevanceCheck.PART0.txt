Unfortunately, this scientific literature does not contain any information to answer the question about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, its advantages, or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods. The document appears to be only a title and author list for a research article on silicalite-1 stabilizing Zn-hydride species for propane dehydrogenation. It does not provide any substantive content about PDH technology or propylene production.
