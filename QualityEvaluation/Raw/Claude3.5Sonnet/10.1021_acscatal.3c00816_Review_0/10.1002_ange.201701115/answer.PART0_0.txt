[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is now much more abundant due to vast shale gas deposits. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which can be more efficient than traditional methods that may involve multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene when using appropriate catalysts, addressing the challenge of product selectivity in conventional methods.

4. Flexibility: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, enabling producers to adjust output based on market demand.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly related to high reaction temperatures required for economically attractive yields. These high temperatures can lead to catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation, which need to be addressed for optimal performance.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面提供了几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷，由于大量页岩气储量的存在，丙烷现在更加丰富。这解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化过程，这可能比涉及多个步骤或复杂分离的传统方法更有效率。

3. 产品选择性：使用适当的催化剂时，PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，解决了传统方法中产品选择性的挑战。

4. 灵活性：PDH允许定向丙烯生产，使生产商能够根据市场需求调整产量。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是与获得经济吸引力产量所需的高反应温度有关。这些高温可能导致催化剂通过烧结和积碳而失活，需要解决这些问题以获得最佳性能。
