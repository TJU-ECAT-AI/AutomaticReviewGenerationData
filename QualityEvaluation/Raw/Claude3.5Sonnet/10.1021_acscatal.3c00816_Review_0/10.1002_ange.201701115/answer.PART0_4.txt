[1] "Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

[4] "To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored."

[5] "The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant light alkanes, particularly propane, from shale gas deposits. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: While PDH requires high reaction temperatures due to its endothermic nature, it can achieve economically attractive yields. This makes it a more efficient process compared to some conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: With proper catalyst design, PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene. The study demonstrates that PtSn catalysts on CeO2 supports can achieve high propylene selectivity.

4. Catalyst stability and regeneration: The use of CeO2 as a support addresses the challenge of catalyst deactivation. It facilitates the redispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens, making the catalyst more stable and easily regenerable.

5. Coke suppression: The redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which significantly reduces coke formation during the reaction. This addresses a major challenge in high-temperature hydrocarbon conversion processes.

These advantages make PDH a promising method for propylene production, addressing key challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
