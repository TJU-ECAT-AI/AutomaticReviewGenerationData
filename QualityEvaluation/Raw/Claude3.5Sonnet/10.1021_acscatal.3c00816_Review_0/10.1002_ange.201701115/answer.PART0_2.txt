[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is now more abundant due to vast shale gas deposits.

2. Process efficiency: While PDH requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields, it offers a direct route to propylene production, potentially improving overall process efficiency compared to conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology allows for more targeted production of propylene, potentially offering better selectivity compared to other processes that produce multiple products.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly related to high reaction temperatures causing catalyst deactivation through sintering and coke formation. The development of more stable and regenerable catalysts, as described in the literature, aims to address these issues and further improve the viability of PDH technology for propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH通过利用丙烷解决了原料可用性的挑战，由于大量页岩气储量的存在，丙烷现在更加丰富。

2. 工艺效率：虽然PDH需要高反应温度才能达到经济上有吸引力的产率，但它提供了一条直接生产丙烯的路线，与传统方法相比可能提高整体工艺效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术允许更有针对性地生产丙烯，与生产多种产品的其他工艺相比，可能提供更好的选择性。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是高反应温度导致催化剂通过烧结和积碳而失活。文献中描述的更稳定和可再生催化剂的开发旨在解决这些问题，并进一步提高PDH技术在丙烯生产中的可行性。
