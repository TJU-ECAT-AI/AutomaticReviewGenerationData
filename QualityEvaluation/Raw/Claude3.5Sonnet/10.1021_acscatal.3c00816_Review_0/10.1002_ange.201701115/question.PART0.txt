Thermally Stable and Regenerable PlatinumTin Clusters for Propane Dehydrogenation Prepared by Atom Trapping on Ceria
Abstract
Ceria (CeO2) supports are unique in their ability to trap ionic platinum (Pt), providing exceptional stability for isolated single atoms of Pt. The reactivity and stability of single-atom Pt species was explored for the industrially important light alkane dehydrogenation reaction. The single-atom Pt/CeO2 catalysts are stable during propane dehydrogenation, but are not selective for propylene. DFT calculations show strong adsorption of the olefin produced, leading to further unwanted reactions. In contrast, when tin (Sn) is added to CeO2, the single-atom Pt catalyst undergoes an activation phase where it transforms into PtSn clusters under reaction conditions. Formation of small PtSn clusters allows the catalyst to achieve high selectivity towards propylene because of facile desorption of the product. The CeO2-supported PtSn clusters are very stable, even during extended reaction at 680C. Coke formation is almost completely suppressed by adding water vapor to the feed. Furthermore, upon oxidation the PtSn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2, making PtSn/CeO2 a fully regenerable catalyst.
Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes,1 such as ethane and propane,2 which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits.3 The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields.4 High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering5 and coke formation.6 While carbon deposits can be effectively oxidized during regeneration in air, it is more difficult to achieve redispersion of Pt.7 In fact, heating Pt/Al2O3 under oxidizing conditions leads to sintering of Pt, forming large Pt particles.8 To achieve redispersion of Pt, it is necessary to add halogens (such as, Cl2, HCl, CCl4, or F2) so that the small particle size of Pt in the initial catalyst can be restored.9 Herein, we explore an alternative support, CeO2, that is unique in its ability to trap Pt atoms in ionic form.10 The CeO2 support facilitates redispersion, restoring the atomic dispersion of Pt without the need for corrosive halogens. Furthermore, the redox properties of CeO2 allow the use of water vapor, which almost completely eliminates the coke deposition traditionally seen during propane conversion at high reaction temperatures.
Synthesis of the catalyst takes advantage of the ability of CeO2 to trap Pt atoms, as explained in our previous work.11 This requires heating Pt/CeO2 to 800C for 10h in flowing air. The scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) image of Pt/CeO2 (1wt% Pt) shows atomically dispersed Pt species (Figure1b). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) images of the Pt4f region for the fresh and spent Pt/CeO2 are shown in Figure1a. The only Pt species in the as-prepared Pt/CeO2 catalyst are Pt2+ and Pt4+, consistent with the STEM image (as confirmed previously by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD)11). After 3cycles of propane dehydrogenation at an elevated reaction temperature of 680C, the XPS spectrum shows that a portion of the ionic Pt has transformed into metallic Pt. STEM images of the sample after reaction show that atomically dispersed Pt coexists with Pt nanoclusters and the nanoclusters have an average size of about 1.2nm (Figure1c; Supporting Information, FigureS1). The Pt/CeO2 catalyst is very reactive for propane conversion at 680C, showing 100% propane conversion (Table1). However, the products were CH4 and CO2, and no propylene was detected, indicating that the isolated Pt single atoms are highly efficient catalysts that only promote CC bond cleavage of the hydrocarbons with no observed selectivity towards dehydrogenation. Pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2 (3wt% Sn) were also tested for propane dehydrogenation under the same conditions (680C). No dehydrogenation and decomposition reactivity was found on pure CeO2 and Sn/CeO2. This observation is consistent with an earlier report in which Pt catalysts with a low loading (1000ppm) presented poor activity for propane dehydrogenation.12

To investigate the causes for the observed lack of selectivity of the single-atom Pt/CeO2 material towards propylene, we performed DFT calculations for Pt single atoms supported on CeO2 (see Supporting Information). Pt adsorbs strongly at surface Ce4+ vacancies; the adsorption structures of pertinent species are displayed in FiguresS2S4 and the corresponding adsorption energies are listed in TableS1 (Supporting Information). On single-atom Pt supported by CeO2, the product of the dehydrogenation (propylene) adsorbs strongly at the atomic Pt sites via di-σ bonds with Pt. The configurations for the initial, transition, and final states along the reaction path are shown in FigureS5 and the barriers and reaction energies are listed in TableS2. Both dehydrogenation steps at the single Pt atoms for the Pt/CeO2 catalyst are facile with relatively low activation energies. The strongly adsorbed propylene is expected to undergo further reactions, leading eventually to CC bond cleavage. Hence, despite facile dehydrogenation, the observed propylene selectivity is low.
It is known that PtSn alloys (that is, nanoparticles) are highly selective for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.13 Therefore, to modify the selectivity, we added Sn to the Pt single-atom catalyst. The PtSn/CeO2 catalyst contains 1wt% Pt and 3wt% Sn, with an atomic ratio of about Pt:Sn=1:5 (as confirmed by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA)). Co-impregnation and sequential impregnation yield similar results. The catalysts undergo calcination in flowing air at 800C to disperse Pt and Sn. In the as-prepared PtSn/CeO2 catalyst (Figure2b), we see atomically dispersed species as well as subnanometer clusters with an average diameter of 0.6nm (Figure2b; FigureS6). Because Sn and Ce have a similar atomic mass, HAADF (high-angle annular dark-field) STEM images cannot provide enough contrast to visualize atomically dispersed Sn on the CeO2 support, but it is easy to detect Pt by HAADF-STEM because of the high atomic number of Pt. We have used STEM-EDS mapping to determine the distribution of Pt and Sn on this PtSn/CeO2 sample. The subnanometer clusters in the as-prepared (calcined at 800C in air) catalyst show a Pt:Sn1:1 to 5:1, as determined by EDS analysis (FigureS7). The average composition of these subnanometer clusters is Pt:Sn3:1. Since the CeO2 can trap single atoms, we also analyzed regions of the support that do not contain any subnanometer clusters. Here we found excess Sn (Sn:Pt from 100:0 to 2.5:1; FiguresS7,S8). We infer that the as-prepared PtSn/CeO2 catalyst contains both Sn and Pt in an atomically dispersed form, with more Sn than Pt, while the subnanometer clusters contain more Pt than Sn, consistent with the overall composition of the catalyst.

The catalyst goes through an activation phase (self-assembly) where selectivity (based on hydrocarbons) improves and activity drops, but achieves stable performance after this initial phase.
The propane dehydrogenation reactivity of the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst as a function of time on stream at 680C is shown in Figure2d and the results are summarized in Table1. The as-prepared PtSn/CeO2 catalyst starts with a relatively high initial reactivity (ca. 45% conversion) but a low selectivity to propylene (ca. 78%). During the first 2h, the activity drops (to 40%) and the selectivity towards propylene improves (to 85%). The selectivity is based on the effluent composition of hydrocarbons detected by a flame ionization detector (FID). After this initial activation phase, the catalyst is remarkably stable during the 6h run (Figure2d) with approximately 39.5% propane conversion and about 84% propylene selectivity at the end of the 6h run (Table1). The catalyst was subjected to an oxidative regeneration step after 6h on stream, since similar treatments are used in industrial practice. This involved treating the sample in flowing air at 580C for 2h. The pattern of reactivity seen in the first cycle is reproduced in the second and third cycles. The PtSn/CeO2 catalyst was also tested in a second reactor setup for propane dehydrogenation at reaction temperatures of 550 and 680C to verify the stability and carbon balance, and the results show that in addition to the hydrocarbons, we also detect CO and CO2. These data confirm that the initial catalyst has low selectivity for propylene, which improves over the first 2h and the catalyst is stable over the remainder of the run (FigureS9, TableS3).
STEM images of the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst after propane dehydrogenation at 680C are shown in Figure2 and FiguresS10 and S11. We now observe well-defined nanoclusters with an average diameter of 1.1nm. The particle size distribution is shown in FigureS11d and EDS analysis shows a Pt:Sn ratio of about 1:3 on the small particles (FigureS11). These results show that the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst is very stable, once the initial activation phase is complete. To understand this initial activation of the catalyst, we can compare the as-prepared catalyst (after 800C calcination, Figure2b; FigureS7) with the catalyst after 2h on stream (FigureS10) and the end-of-run catalyst (Figure2c; FiguresS1c and S1d). The major difference is the presence of atomically dispersed Pt in the as-prepared catalyst, which is missing in the end-of-run catalyst. As already discussed in the context of the monometallic catalyst, the single Pt atoms are very active but only lead to CC bond cleavage. Another significant change during reaction is the formation of PtSn clusters having a diameter of approximately 1.1nm and a Pt:Sn atomic ratio of 1:3. As a comparison, on an alumina supported catalyst subjected to the same reaction conditions, the PtSn particles are much larger (ca. 8nm; FigureS12). We also studied the Pt and Sn species on the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst by XPS (Figure2a). The initial catalyst contains only ionic Pt, similar to the fresh Pt/CeO2. After dehydrogenation, the Pt4f XPS spectra of spent PtSn/CeO2 catalyst show the formation of metallic Pt as well as the existence of Pt2+. This is consistent with the STEM results, where nanoclusters (that is, metallic Pt) are formed on the spent catalyst after dehydrogenation (Figure2c; FigureS11). The Sn3d spectra are broad and correspond to oxidized Sn species in the as-prepared catalyst, while after reaction the Sn3d peak shifts to lower binding energy, which is consistent with the transformation of a portion of the oxidized Sn into metallic PtSn nanoparticles.
The coke content on the spent PtSn catalysts was investigated at the end of the first cycle by performing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in flowing air and elemental analysis using a CHN analyzer (TableS4). Both techniques gave similar carbon contents. The coke deposited on the sample is reported in Table1. All of these catalysts show very low coke content of <1wt% after a 6h run at 680C. This is due to the co-feeding of water vapor to the catalyst.14 When no water vapor was fed to the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, the coke content increased from 0.5 to 2.8wt% and the conversion dropped. The results confirm that the addition of water vapor can suppress the formation of coke during propane dehydrogenation at high temperature.15 The coke formed under the high temperature conditions was investigated by electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. As shown in FigureS13, coke layers were found to cover only the support surface for the spent PtSn/CeO2 catalyst. Raman spectra of the spent PtSn/CeO2 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts showed the presence of both D and G bands (FigureS14), indicating that the coke layers are composed of graphitic carbon.16 The existence of graphitic carbon on the spent PtSn/CeO2 catalyst was also confirmed by a wide-area Raman spectroscopy scan (labeled in yellow in FigureS14).
It is commonly accepted that carbon deposits can lead to lowered reactivity during dehydrogenation.17 These catalysts, after the initial activation phase during the first 2h of reaction, did not show any deactivation during the 6h run. However, we performed an oxidative treatment to contrast the regenerability of the Pt and Sn species on the CeO2 and alumina supports. On the Al2O3 support, the reactivity of PtSn decreased during reaction and the oxidative treatment was not able to restore reactivity (FigureS12). This suggests that the deactivation of the alumina-supported catalyst was caused by sintering, which is not reversed during oxidative treatment, rather than the small amount of coke, which is readily removed during oxidation at 580C.5b In contrast, the reactivity pattern of the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst was similar after each oxidative regeneration. The initial activity after regeneration was high. Over time, the reactivity dropped and the selectivity improved; during this period a phenomenon we term self-assembly took place. This reactivity pattern was reproducible over the 3cycles, as shown in Figure2d. The STEM images of the regenerated PtSn/CeO2 catalyst, after self-assembly (that is, after 2h run), and at the end of a 6h run, are shown in FigureS10. These results show that the PtSn clusters have formed during self-assembly and remain stable thereafter.
To gain insight into this self-assembly process, we carefully examined the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst after oxidative regeneration, which is the state of the catalyst where the reactivity is high but the selectivity is poor (Figure2d). The STEM images and STEM-EDS maps are shown in Figure3 and FigureS15. The high magnification STEM image in Figure3a shows that Pt is present as atomically dispersed, isolated species, similar to the as-prepared catalyst. The STEM-EDS maps confirm that Pt is well-dispersed, but Sn is present in the form of particles that are devoid of Pt (Figure3f; FigureS15). One such particle is indicated by an arrow in the inset of Figure3a. The lattice images index to SnO2 (Figure3a inset; FigureS16). Other evidence of crystalline SnO2 on the CeO2 is provided by Moir fringes, which result from the interference between the two crystalline phases present on top of each other. The EDS map in Figure3f clearly shows high concentrations of Sn, corresponding to the particles seen on the support.

The regenerated catalyst contains Pt single atoms dispersed on CeO2 (Figure4b) and SnO2 particles. After reaction PtSn clusters are seen (Figure4c) instead of atomically dispersed Pt. The composition of these clusters was analyzed by EDS and found to be Pt:Sn=1:3.

As explained in the DFT discussion (Supporting Information), single atoms of Pt on CeO2 are not selective for propane dehydrogenation because the strongly adsorbed propylene is amenable to further reactions. When Sn is added, DFT calculations suggest that it can bind strongly to CeO2. The Pt atoms can bind strongly with Sn embedded in CeO2. Our DFT results also indicate that the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst has a much lower adsorption energy for propylene product than that on the single-atom Pt/CeO2 catalyst. As a result, formed propylene desorbs easily, which prevents further reaction. This property is similar to that observed with bulk PtSn alloy surfaces, which have been discussed extensively in the literature.6b, 13c, 18 Adding Sn to Pt in the atomically dispersed catalyst improves selectivity, but lowers the rate of propane dehydrogenation because of a higher activation barrier (TableS2, FigureS17). Adding a second Pt atom to Sn causes it to bind strongly, suggesting that Sn helps to serve as a nucleation site for forming PtSn clusters. DFT results help to explain the evolution of the catalyst during reaction, where generated H2 causes transformation of ionic Pt into metallic Pt. The single atoms of Pt are mobile and interact with Sn to form bimetallic PtSn clusters, which grow to a size of about 1.1nm. The ability of mobile Pt to reduce the dispersed Sn species is similar to that seen previously where Pt was found to reduce PdO to form bimetallic PtPd particles.19
What is unique about the CeO2 support is that these PtSn clusters do not grow in size during reaction at steady state (Figure2d). In contrast, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst presents particle sizes about 8nm in diameter (FigureS12). The primary mechanism for sintering of the PtSn catalyst is Ostwald ripening at high temperatures. The CeO2 support slows the process of ripening since it is able to trap the Pt atoms. In a recent study, Moliner etal.20 showed that zeolite cages could trap Pt atoms during oxidative regeneration. However, during reduction, they observed the formation of large metallic Pt particles. The CeO2 support is unique because trapping sites allow the size of the PtSn clusters to remain small even when used at such high temperatures. We also investigated the CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) of the Pt/CeO2 and PtSn/CeO2 catalysts (FigureS18). The initial catalyst shows linearly adsorbed CO at a frequency that is consistent with the isolated single atoms seen in Figures1b and Figure2b. In the reduced catalyst, we see both linearly and bridge-bonded CO on both catalysts. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) curves of the two catalysts are consistent with previous literature.21 However, no significant differences were observed in the FTIR spectra of the two catalysts, suggesting that this technique may not be able to distinguish between these two catalysts.22
To further test the stability of the PtSn/CeO2 catalyst we treated it in CH4 at 800C. This caused a growth in particle size and a drop in activity, but the sizes of these particles are still smaller than those on the alumina support after reaction at 680C (TableS5, FigureS19).
To summarize, PtSn/CeO2 is a thermally stable, active and regenerable catalyst for light alkane dehydrogenation. The atom trapping sites on CeO2 help achieve complete redispersion of Pt atoms under mild oxidative regeneration conditions, without the need for chlorine containing molecules, providing a regenerable, thermally stable catalyst for light alkane activation. The redox properties of CeO2 allow water vapor to be used as the oxidant, suppressing coke formation during the dehydrogenation.
