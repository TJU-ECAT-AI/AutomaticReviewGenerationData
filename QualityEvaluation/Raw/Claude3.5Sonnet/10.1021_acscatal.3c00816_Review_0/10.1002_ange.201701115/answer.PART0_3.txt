[1] "Light olefins are important building blocks in the chemical industry. Growing demand for light olefins has led to an increased interest in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as ethane and propane, which are now much more abundant because of the vast amounts of shale gas deposits."

[2] "The production of light olefins by alkane dehydrogenation is practiced commercially, but because of its endothermicity, it requires high reaction temperatures to achieve economically attractive yields."

[3] "High reaction temperatures cause catalyst deactivation by sintering and coke formation."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas deposits, which have become abundant in recent years.

2. Process efficiency: While PDH requires high temperatures due to its endothermic nature, it can achieve economically attractive yields of propylene.

3. Product selectivity: PDH is a direct route to produce propylene from propane, potentially offering higher selectivity compared to other methods.

However, the technology also faces challenges, particularly catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke formation at high temperatures. The research presented in this literature aims to address these issues through the development of more stable and regenerable catalysts.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气中的丙烷，而页岩气在近年来变得丰富。

2. 工艺效率：尽管PDH由于其吸热性质需要高温，但它可以实现经济上具有吸引力的丙烯产量。

3. 产品选择性：PDH是从丙烷直接生产丙烯的路线，可能比其他方法提供更高的选择性。

然而，该技术也面临挑战，特别是在高温下催化剂失活，这是由于烧结和积碳形成。本文献中介绍的研究旨在通过开发更稳定和可再生的催化剂来解决这些问题。
