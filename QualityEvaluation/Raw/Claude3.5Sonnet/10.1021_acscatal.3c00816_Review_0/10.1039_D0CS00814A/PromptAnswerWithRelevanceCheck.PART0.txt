<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

[3] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[4] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

</quotes>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas condensates, which are now abundant and cheap due to hydraulic fracturing technology. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, proprietary method that produces only propylene, unlike conventional methods that produce mixed products. This results in higher efficiency and easier separation.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity for propylene production, avoiding the formation of unwanted byproducts that occur in traditional cracking processes.

4. Meeting growing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet increasing propylene demand due to fossil energy depletion, PDH provides a scalable alternative to bridge this supply gap.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built close to shale gas sources or in regions with high propylene demand, offering logistical advantages.

These advantages position PDH as a superior technology to address the limitations of conventional propylene production methods, especially in the context of growing global demand and changing feedstock availability.
