[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

[4] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Selectivity: PDH is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a mixture of products. This high selectivity allows for more efficient and targeted production of propylene.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made shale gas condensates, which contain large amounts of propane, available on a massive scale. This has made the feedstock for PDH cheaper and more plentiful.

3. Meeting growing demand: With propylene demand expected to grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035 and exceed production capacity, PDH technology is well-positioned to address this increasing demand.

4. Versatility: Propylene is a basic raw material for numerous industrial products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and more. PDH technology directly produces this versatile chemical building block.

5. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct of other processes, PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, potentially offering greater efficiency.

PDH addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods by providing a direct route to propylene, utilizing more readily available feedstocks, and offering high selectivity. This makes it a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene in a more efficient and targeted manner.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 选择性：PDH是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。这种高选择性允许更有效和有针对性地生产丙烯。

2. 原料可用性：水力压裂技术的发展使得含有大量丙烷的页岩气凝析油可以大规模获得。这使得PDH的原料变得更便宜和更充足。

3. 满足不断增长的需求：预计到2035年，丙烯需求将以平均每年2%到3%的速度增长，并超过生产能力，PDH技术很好地定位于解决这种不断增加的需求。

4. 多功能性：丙烯是众多工业产品的基本原料，包括聚丙烯、环氧丙烷、丙烯腈等。PDH技术直接生产这种多功能化学建筑块。

5. 过程效率：与传统方法将丙烯作为其他过程的副产品不同，PDH是专门为丙烯生产而设计的，可能提供更高的效率。

PDH通过提供直接生产丙烯的途径、利用更容易获得的原料和提供高选择性来解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。这使其成为以更高效和有针对性的方式满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的一个有前途的解决方案。
