[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

[3] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[4] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas condensates, which are now abundant and cheap due to hydraulic fracturing technology. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, proprietary method that produces only propylene, unlike conventional methods that produce mixed products. This results in higher efficiency and easier separation.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high selectivity for propylene production, avoiding the formation of unwanted byproducts that occur in traditional cracking processes.

4. Meeting growing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet increasing propylene demand due to fossil energy depletion, PDH provides a scalable alternative to bridge this supply gap.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built close to shale gas sources or in regions with high propylene demand, offering logistical advantages.

These advantages position PDH as a superior technology to address the limitations of conventional propylene production methods, especially in the context of growing global demand and changing feedstock availability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气凝析油中的丙烷，由于水力压裂技术的发展，这种原料现在变得丰富且便宜。这解决了传统方法面临的原料稀缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种直接的专有方法，只生产丙烯，不像传统方法那样生产混合产品。这导致更高的效率和更容易的分离。

3. 产品选择性：PDH为丙烯生产提供了高选择性，避免了在传统裂解过程中产生的不需要的副产品。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法因化石能源枯竭而难以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH提供了一种可扩展的替代方案来弥补这一供应缺口。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在靠近页岩气源或丙烯需求高的地区，提供物流优势。

这些优势使PDH成为一种优越的技术，能够解决传统丙烯生产方法的局限性，特别是在全球需求增长和原料供应变化的背景下。
