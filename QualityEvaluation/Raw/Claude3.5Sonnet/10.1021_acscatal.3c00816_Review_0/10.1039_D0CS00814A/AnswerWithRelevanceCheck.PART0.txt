          [1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

          [2] "Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

          [3] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

          [4] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

          [5] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

          1. Selectivity: PDH is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a mixture of products. This high selectivity allows for more efficient and targeted production of propylene, addressing the challenge of obtaining pure propylene faced by conventional methods.

          2. Feedstock availability: With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, large amounts of propane can be extracted from shale gas condensates, making the feedstock for PDH cheaper and more abundant. This addresses the challenge of limited feedstock availability in conventional methods and provides a solution to the scarcity of traditional fossil fuel sources.

          3. Meeting growing demand: Traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands due to rapid consumption of fossil energy. PDH technology offers a solution to address the growing demand for propylene, which is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035 and exceed production capacity.

          4. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking that produce multiple products, PDH focuses solely on propylene production, potentially improving overall process efficiency. As a direct dehydrogenation process, PDH is more efficient in converting propane to propylene compared to the multi-step processes involved in traditional methods.

          5. Versatility and adaptability: Propylene is a basic raw material for numerous industrial products. PDH's ability to produce pure propylene makes it ideal for supplying these diverse industries. Additionally, PDH plants can be built closer to shale gas sources or propylene consumers, offering greater flexibility in production and distribution.

          These advantages position PDH as a superior technology to address the limitations of conventional propylene production methods, especially in the context of growing global demand, changing feedstock availability, and the need for more efficient and selective production processes.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

          1. 选择性：PDH是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。这种高选择性允许更有效和有针对性地生产丙烯，解决了传统方法在获得纯丙烯方面面临的挑战。

          2. 原料可用性：随着水力压裂技术的发展，可以从页岩气凝析油中提取大量丙烷，使PDH的原料更便宜、更丰富。这解决了传统方法中原料供应有限的挑战，并为传统化石燃料来源稀缺提供了解决方案。

          3. 满足不断增长的需求：由于化石能源的快速消耗，传统的丙烯生产方法已无法满足不断增长的需求。PDH技术为满足丙烯这一关键工业原料的不断增长的需求提供了解决方案。预计到2035年，丙烯需求将以平均每年2%到3%的速度增长，并超过生产能力。

          4. 工艺效率：与生产多种产品的传统方法（如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解）不同，PDH专注于丙烯生产，可能提高整体工艺效率。作为直接脱氢过程，PDH在将丙烷转化为丙烯方面比传统方法涉及的多步骤过程更有效率。

          5. 多功能性和适应性：丙烯是众多工业产品的基本原料。PDH生产纯丙烯的能力使其成为供应这些多样化行业的理想选择。此外，PDH工厂可以建在更靠近页岩气源或丙烯消费者的地方，在生产和分配方面提供更大的灵活性。

          这些优势使PDH成为一种优越的技术，能够解决传统丙烯生产方法的局限性，特别是在全球需求增长、原料供应变化以及需要更高效和选择性生产工艺的背景下。
