[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

[3] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[4] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Selectivity: PDH is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product. This high selectivity addresses the challenge of obtaining pure propylene faced by conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, large amounts of propane can be extracted from shale gas condensates, making the feedstock for PDH cheaper and more abundant. This addresses the challenge of limited feedstock availability in conventional methods.

3. Process efficiency: Unlike conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking that produce multiple products, PDH focuses solely on propylene production, potentially improving overall process efficiency.

4. Meeting growing demand: Traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands due to rapid consumption of fossil energy. PDH technology offers a solution to address this growing demand for propylene, which is a crucial raw material for various industrial products.

5. Adaptability to changing feedstock landscape: As conventional fossil fuel sources become scarcer, PDH's ability to utilize propane from shale gas provides a more sustainable approach to propylene production.

These advantages position PDH as a promising technology to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods in light of growing global demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 选择性：PDH是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。这种高选择性解决了传统方法在获得纯丙烯方面面临的挑战。

2. 原料可用性：随着水力压裂技术的发展，可以从页岩气凝析油中提取大量丙烷，使PDH的原料更便宜、更丰富。这解决了传统方法中原料供应有限的挑战。

3. 工艺效率：与生产多种产品的传统方法（如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解）不同，PDH专注于丙烯生产，可能提高整体工艺效率。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：由于化石能源的快速消耗，传统的丙烯生产方法已无法满足不断增长的需求。PDH技术为满足丙烯这一关键工业原料的不断增长的需求提供了解决方案。

5. 适应变化的原料格局：随着传统化石燃料来源变得更加稀缺，PDH利用页岩气中的丙烷的能力为丙烯生产提供了一种更可持续的方法。

这些优势使PDH成为一种有前景的技术，能够在全球需求不断增长的背景下解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
