[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

[4] "The Dow Chemical Company released a forecast in 2016 that the demand for propylene will grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035, which is expected to exceed production capacity between 2016 and 2035."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Selective production: PDH is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a mixture of products. This high selectivity is crucial for meeting the growing demand for propylene specifically.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made shale gas condensates, which contain large amounts of propane, available on a massive scale. This has made the feedstock for PDH cheaper and more plentiful.

3. Meeting growing demand: With propylene demand expected to grow at an average annual rate of 2% to 3% by 2035 and exceed production capacity, PDH offers a direct way to increase propylene production to meet this demand.

4. Versatility: Propylene is a basic raw material for numerous industrial products, including polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and others. PDH's ability to produce pure propylene makes it ideal for supplying these diverse industries.

5. Addressing limitations of conventional methods: Traditional propylene production methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha are limited by the decreasing availability of fossil fuels. PDH provides an alternative that can utilize the abundant propane from shale gas.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods, making it a promising technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 选择性生产：PDH是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。这种高选择性对于满足不断增长的丙烯需求至关重要。

2. 原料可用性：水力压裂技术的发展使含有大量丙烷的页岩气凝析油可以大规模获得。这使得PDH的原料变得更便宜和更充足。

3. 满足不断增长的需求：预计到2035年，丙烯需求将以平均每年2%至3%的速度增长，并超过生产能力，PDH提供了一种直接增加丙烯生产以满足这一需求的方法。

4. 多用途性：丙烯是众多工业产品的基础原料，包括聚丙烯、环氧丙烷、丙烯腈等。PDH生产纯丙烯的能力使其成为供应这些多样化行业的理想选择。

5. 解决传统方法的局限性：传统的丙烯生产方法，如流化催化裂化和石脑油蒸汽裂解，受到化石燃料可用性减少的限制。PDH提供了一种可以利用页岩气中丰富丙烷的替代方法。

这些优势使PDH能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使其成为满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求的有前途的技术。
