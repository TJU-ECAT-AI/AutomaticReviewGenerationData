[1] "Propylene is the basic raw material for the production of acrolein, polypropylene, acetone, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other industrial products."

[2] "PDH technology is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods because it is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a hybrid product."

[3] "With the development of hydraulic fracturing technology, shale gas condensates which contain a large amount of propane can be extracted on a massive scale, making the feedstock cheaper and plentiful"

[4] "Conventional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking, and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, with the rapid consumption of fossil energy, traditional propylene production methods can no longer meet the increasing demands."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Selective production: PDH is a proprietary method that produces only propylene, not a mixture of products. This high selectivity is a significant advantage over conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of hydraulic fracturing technology has made shale gas condensates, which contain large amounts of propane, readily available and cheaper. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by traditional methods.

3. Meeting growing demand: Conventional propylene production processes, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, can no longer meet the increasing demand for propylene due to the rapid consumption of fossil energy. PDH technology helps bridge this gap.

4. Process efficiency: As a direct dehydrogenation process, PDH is more efficient in converting propane to propylene compared to the multi-step processes involved in traditional methods.

5. Adaptability to market changes: PDH plants can be built closer to shale gas sources or propylene consumers, offering greater flexibility in production and distribution.

These advantages allow PDH technology to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods, making it a promising solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 选择性生产：PDH是一种专有方法，只生产丙烯，而不是混合产品。这种高选择性是相对于传统方法的重要优势。

2. 原料可用性：水力压裂技术的发展使含有大量丙烷的页岩气凝析油变得容易获得且价格更便宜。这解决了传统方法面临的原料稀缺问题。

3. 满足不断增长的需求：由于化石能源的快速消耗，传统的丙烯生产工艺（如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解）已经无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。PDH技术有助于弥补这一差距。

4. 工艺效率：作为直接脱氢过程，PDH在将丙烷转化为丙烯方面比传统方法涉及的多步骤过程更有效率。

5. 适应市场变化：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近页岩气源或丙烯消费者的地方，在生产和分配方面提供更大的灵活性。

这些优势使PDH技术能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的有力解决方案。
