<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or its advantages in propylene production. The text appears to be a brief citation of a research article about Ga2O22+ stabilized by framework Al atoms in MFI zeolites, which is not directly related to the question asked. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot answer the question about the advantages of PDH technology or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods.
