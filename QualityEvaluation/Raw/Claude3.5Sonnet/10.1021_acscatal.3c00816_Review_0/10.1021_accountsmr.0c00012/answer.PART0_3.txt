[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

[2] "As an endothermic process, high operation temperatures and harsh conditions extensively limit the catalyst development."

[3] "PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."

[4] "Among propylene production processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), (57) a process of direct conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods compared with methanol-to-olefins, FischerTropsch-to-olefins, etc."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, allowing for targeted and efficient production to meet growing demand.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is readily available from natural gas processing and petroleum refining.

3. Process simplicity: PDH involves the direct conversion of propane to propylene, avoiding complex multi-step processes used in other methods.

4. Higher propylene yields: Compared to methods like methanol-to-olefins or Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins, PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be scaled and located closer to propylene consumers, reducing transportation costs.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The endothermic nature of the reaction requires high temperatures (above 500°C), leading to significant energy consumption.

2. Catalyst development: Harsh operating conditions limit catalyst stability and lifetime, necessitating ongoing research to improve catalyst performance.

3. Coking and sintering: High temperatures can lead to carbon deposition and catalyst particle sintering, reducing selectivity and catalyst longevity.

4. Thermodynamic limitations: The equilibrium conversion is limited at high temperatures, requiring innovative reactor designs or process modifications to overcome this constraint.

Despite these challenges, PDH remains a promising technology due to its ability to produce high-purity propylene efficiently, addressing the limitations of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock flexibility and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，允许有针对性和高效率的生产以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这种原料可以从天然气处理和石油精炼中readily获得。

3. 工艺简单：PDH涉及丙烷到丙烯的直接转化，避免了其他方法中使用的复杂多步骤过程。

4. 更高的丙烯产率：与甲醇制烯烃或费托制烯烃等方法相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以进行规模调整，并且可以更靠近丙烯消费者，从而降低运输成本。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：反应的吸热性质需要高温（超过500°C），导致显著的能源消耗。

2. 催化剂开发：苛刻的操作条件限制了催化剂的稳定性和寿命，需要持续研究以改进催化剂性能。

3. 结焦和烧结：高温可能导致碳沉积和催化剂颗粒烧结，降低选择性和催化剂寿命。

4. 热力学限制：在高温下平衡转化率受到限制，需要创新的反应器设计或工艺改进来克服这一约束。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH仍然是一项有前景的技术，因为它能够高效地生产高纯度丙烯，解决了传统生产方法在原料灵活性和产品选择性方面的限制。
