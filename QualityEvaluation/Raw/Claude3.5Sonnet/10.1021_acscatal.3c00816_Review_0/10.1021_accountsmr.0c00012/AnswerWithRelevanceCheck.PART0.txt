          [1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

[2] "As an endothermic process, high operation temperatures and harsh conditions extensively limit the catalyst development."

[3] "Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts have been applied in commercialized PDH processes on account of their excellent activity and propylene productivity."

[4] "Among propylene production processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), (57) a process of direct conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods compared with methanol-to-olefins, FischerTropsch-to-olefins, etc."

[5] "PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."

[6] "Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) as an alternative propylene production technologies can break through the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation of nonoxidative dehydrogenation."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, allowing for targeted and efficient production to meet growing demand.

2. Feedstock availability and flexibility: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available and potentially less expensive compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha or ethane.

3. Process efficiency: PDH involves the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering higher yields and efficiency compared to more complex multi-step processes like methanol-to-olefins or Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins.

4. Product selectivity: PDH technology allows for high selectivity towards propylene production, as it is designed specifically for this purpose.

5. Independence from petroleum refining: Unlike steam cracking, PDH is not tied to petroleum refining, allowing for more flexible production.

6. Potential for further improvements: Ongoing research in catalyst development (e.g., Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts) and process optimization promises to further enhance PDH efficiency and selectivity.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: As an endothermic process, it requires high temperatures (generally above 500°C), which can limit catalyst development and increase operational costs.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Issues like coking, sintering, and other side reactions can affect catalyst longevity and performance.

3. Thermodynamic limitations: The equilibrium conversion is limited at high temperatures, requiring innovative reactor designs or process modifications to overcome this constraint.

4. Cost considerations: Some effective catalysts, like Pt-based ones, are expensive, driving research into more cost-effective alternatives.

Despite these challenges, PDH remains a promising technology due to its ability to produce high-purity propylene efficiently, addressing the limitations of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock flexibility and product selectivity. Additionally, alternative technologies like chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) are being developed to overcome some of the limitations of traditional PDH processes.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，允许有针对性和高效率的生产以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料可用性和灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，与传统的原料如石脑油或乙烷相比，丙烷更容易获得且可能更便宜。

3. 工艺效率：PDH涉及丙烷到丙烯的直接转化，与更复杂的多步骤过程（如甲醇制烯烃或费托制烯烃）相比，可能提供更高的产率和效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH技术允许高选择性地生产丙烯，因为它专门为此目的而设计。

5. 独立于石油精炼：与蒸汽裂解不同，PDH不依赖于石油精炼，允许更灵活的生产。

6. 进一步改进的潜力：正在进行的催化剂开发（如基于Pt和CrOx的催化剂）和工艺优化研究有望进一步提高PDH的效率和选择性。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：作为一个吸热过程，它需要高温（通常高于500°C），这可能会限制催化剂的开发并增加运营成本。

2. 催化剂失活：结焦、烧结和其他副反应等问题可能影响催化剂的寿命和性能。

3. 热力学限制：在高温下平衡转化率受到限制，需要创新的反应器设计或工艺改进来克服这一约束。

4. 成本考虑：一些有效的催化剂，如基于铂的催化剂，价格昂贵，推动了对更具成本效益的替代品的研究。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH仍然是一项有前景的技术，因为它能够高效地生产高纯度丙烯，解决了传统生产方法在原料灵活性和产品选择性方面的限制。此外，正在开发化学链氧化脱氢（CL-ODH）等替代技术，以克服传统PDH工艺的一些局限性。
