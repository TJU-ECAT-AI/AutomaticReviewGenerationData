[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

[2] "As an endothermic process, high operation temperatures and harsh conditions extensively limit the catalyst development."

[3] "Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts have been applied in commercialized PDH processes on account of their excellent activity and propylene productivity."

[4] "Among propylene production processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), (57) a process of direct conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods compared with methanol-to-olefins, FischerTropsch-to-olefins, etc."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is abundant and relatively inexpensive compared to other feedstocks used in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process of propane to propylene, which can be more efficient than multi-step processes like methanol-to-olefins or Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology allows for high selectivity towards propylene production, as it is designed specifically for this purpose.

4. On-purpose production: PDH is an "on-purpose" technology, meaning it can be used to produce propylene independently of other refinery or petrochemical processes, allowing for more flexible and targeted production.

5. Potential for catalyst improvements: While current catalysts face challenges due to high temperatures and harsh conditions, ongoing research in catalyst development (e.g., Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts) shows promise for improving process efficiency and stability.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, such as the endothermic nature of the process requiring high temperatures and the need for further catalyst development to improve stability and longevity. Despite these challenges, the advantages of PDH in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity make it a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统方法使用的其他原料，丙烷更加丰富且相对便宜。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是丙烷直接转化为丙烯的过程，比甲醇制烯烃或费托制烯烃等多步骤工艺更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：PDH技术允许高选择性地生产丙烯，因为它专门为此目的而设计。

4. 定向生产：PDH是一种"定向"技术，意味着它可以独立于其他炼油或石化工艺生产丙烯，允许更灵活和有针对性的生产。

5. 催化剂改进潜力：虽然当前的催化剂因高温和苛刻条件面临挑战，但催化剂开发（如基于Pt和CrOx的催化剂）的持续研究显示出改善工艺效率和稳定性的前景。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，如过程的吸热性质需要高温，以及需要进一步开发催化剂以改善稳定性和寿命。尽管存在这些挑战，PDH在原料灵活性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的优势使其成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的有前景的解决方案。
