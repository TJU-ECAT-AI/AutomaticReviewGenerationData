[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

[2] "As an endothermic process, high operation temperatures and harsh conditions extensively limit the catalyst development."

[3] "Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts have been applied in commercialized PDH processes on account of their excellent activity and propylene productivity."

[4] "Comparatively, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly than CrOx-based catalysts. However, Pt suffers from deactivation of sintering and coking."

[5] "Meanwhile, the high cost of Pt-based catalysts attracts us to rationally design Pt nanostructures and develop alternatives, such as VOx-, GaOx-, ZrO2-based oxide catalysts."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, allowing for targeted and efficient production to meet growing demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks like naphtha or ethane.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher yields and efficiency compared to traditional methods.

4. Catalyst developments: Ongoing research in catalyst design, including Pt-based and oxide-based catalysts, is improving the performance and cost-effectiveness of PDH technology.

5. Environmental considerations: Some PDH catalysts, like Pt-based ones, are more environmentally friendly compared to alternatives.

However, PDH also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: As an endothermic process, it requires high temperatures, which can limit catalyst development and increase operational costs.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Issues like sintering and coking can affect catalyst longevity and performance.

3. Cost considerations: Some effective catalysts, like Pt-based ones, are expensive, driving research into more cost-effective alternatives.

Despite these challenges, the ability of PDH to directly produce propylene from readily available propane, coupled with ongoing improvements in catalyst technology, positions it as a promising solution to address the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，允许有针对性和高效率的生产以满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的原料如石脑油或乙烷，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，与传统方法相比可能提供更高的产率和效率。

4. 催化剂发展：包括基于铂和基于氧化物的催化剂在内的催化剂设计方面的持续研究，正在提高PDH技术的性能和成本效益。

5. 环境考虑：一些PDH催化剂，如基于铂的催化剂，比替代品更环保。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：作为一个吸热过程，它需要高温，这可能会限制催化剂的开发并增加运营成本。

2. 催化剂失活：烧结和结焦等问题可能影响催化剂的寿命和性能。

3. 成本考虑：一些有效的催化剂，如基于铂的催化剂，价格昂贵，推动了对更具成本效益的替代品的研究。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH能够从容易获得的丙烷直接生产丙烯，加上催化剂技术的不断改进，使其成为解决全球不断增长的丙烯需求的有前途的解决方案。
