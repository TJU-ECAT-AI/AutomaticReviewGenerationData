[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

[2] "As an endothermic process, high operation temperatures and harsh conditions extensively limit the catalyst development."

[3] "Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts have been applied in commercialized PDH processes on account of their excellent activity and propylene productivity."

[4] "Among propylene production processes, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), (57) a process of direct conversion of propane into propylene and hydrogen is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods compared with methanol-to-olefins, FischerTropsch-to-olefins, etc."

</quotes>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, which is abundant and relatively inexpensive compared to other feedstocks used in conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process of propane to propylene, which can be more efficient than multi-step processes like methanol-to-olefins or Fischer-Tropsch-to-olefins.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology allows for high selectivity towards propylene production, as it is designed specifically for this purpose.

4. On-purpose production: PDH is an "on-purpose" technology, meaning it can be used to produce propylene independently of other refinery or petrochemical processes, allowing for more flexible and targeted production.

5. Potential for catalyst improvements: While current catalysts face challenges due to high temperatures and harsh conditions, ongoing research in catalyst development (e.g., Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts) shows promise for improving process efficiency and stability.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, such as the endothermic nature of the process requiring high temperatures and the need for further catalyst development to improve stability and longevity. Despite these challenges, the advantages of PDH in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity make it a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene.
