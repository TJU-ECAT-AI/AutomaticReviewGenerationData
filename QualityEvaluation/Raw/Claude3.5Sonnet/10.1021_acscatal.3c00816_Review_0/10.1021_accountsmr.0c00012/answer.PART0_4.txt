[1] "Propylene serves as one of the most significant compounds in the chemical industry. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on purpose propylene production technology is developing."

[2] "As an endothermic process, high operation temperatures and harsh conditions extensively limit the catalyst development."

[3] "PDH requires operation at high temperatures (generally above 500 C), which restricts the C3H6 selectivity and catalyst structure stability on account of coking side reactions, particle sintering, and so forth."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the growing demand more directly than conventional methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional petroleum-based feedstocks.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH potentially offers higher efficiency compared to more complex multi-step processes.

4. Product selectivity: While high temperatures pose challenges, ongoing catalyst developments aim to improve propylene selectivity.

5. Independence from petroleum: PDH reduces reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks, addressing concerns about long-term availability and price volatility.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of high operating temperatures, catalyst stability, and coking issues. Ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient catalysts and reactor designs to overcome these limitations and further improve the process efficiency and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性地生产丙烯，比传统方法更直接地满足不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石油基原料更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为直接转化过程，PDH潜在地提供了比更复杂的多步骤过程更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：虽然高温带来挑战，但正在进行的催化剂开发旨在提高丙烯选择性。

5. 独立于石油：PDH减少了对石油基原料的依赖，解决了长期可用性和价格波动的担忧。

然而，PDH技术仍然面临挑战，特别是在高操作温度、催化剂稳定性和结焦问题方面。正在进行的研究集中在开发更高效的催化剂和反应器设计，以克服这些限制并进一步提高工艺效率和产品选择性。
