The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It provides an alternative production method to meet increasing market demand for propylene, which is used to make many important chemicals.

2. It allows for on-purpose propylene production, addressing feedstock availability issues faced by conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

3. It uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha cracking feedstocks.

4. It enables higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

5. The process can be more energy efficient than traditional cracking methods.

6. It gives producers more flexibility to adjust propylene output based on market conditions.

While the document does not explicitly compare PDH to conventional methods, these advantages can be inferred from the context provided about the growing interest in PDH technology for propylene production. The development of improved catalysts like PtSn on hierarchical zeolites further enhances the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它提供了一种替代生产方法，以满足不断增长的丙烯市场需求，丙烯被用于生产许多重要的化学品。

2. 它允许有目的地生产丙烯，解决了传统方法中将丙烯作为副产品生产时面临的原料供应问题。

3. 它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石脑油裂解原料更容易获得。

4. 与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，它能够实现更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 这个过程比传统的裂解方法更加节能。

6. 它使生产商能够根据市场条件更灵活地调整丙烯产量。

虽然文档没有明确比较PDH和传统方法，但从文中提供的背景可以推断出这些优势，即PDH技术在丙烯生产中受到越来越多的关注。诸如PtSn负载在层级结构沸石上等改进型催化剂的开发进一步提高了PDH过程的效率和选择性。
