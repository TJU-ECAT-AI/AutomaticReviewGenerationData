The literature does not directly address the specific advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in comparison to conventional production methods for propylene. However, it does provide some insights into the potential benefits of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane using novel catalysts.

The document mentions that catalytic dehydrogenation of abundant alkanes is an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, which has attracted significant attention recently. This suggests that PDH technology may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, as it utilizes abundant alkanes (such as propane) as raw materials.

The literature also highlights the need for exploring novel, non-toxic, and low-cost dehydrogenation catalysts to address the limitations of current Cr2O3-based and Pt-based catalysts. This indicates that PDH technology could potentially improve process efficiency and reduce costs through the development of more effective catalysts.

The study presents a Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, which demonstrates high propane conversion (40%) and good stability for up to 170 hours. This suggests that PDH technology, when coupled with advanced catalysts, can achieve high product selectivity and maintain efficiency over extended periods.

While the document does not explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods, it implies that this technology, combined with innovative catalysts, has the potential to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity for propylene production.

该文献没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术相对于传统丙烯生产方法的具体优势。然而，它确实提供了一些关于使用新型催化剂进行丙烷催化脱氢的潜在益处的见解。

文档提到，丰富烷烃的催化脱氢是生产高价值轻烯烃的有效途径，近来引起了广泛关注。这表明PDH技术在原料可用性方面可能具有优势，因为它利用丰富的烷烃（如丙烷）作为原材料。

文献还强调了探索新型、无毒和低成本脱氢催化剂的需求，以解决当前Cr2O3基和Pt基催化剂的局限性。这表明PDH技术可能通过开发更有效的催化剂来提高工艺效率并降低成本。

研究提出了一种用于丙烷脱氢的含Sn六方介孔二氧化硅（Sn-HMS）催化剂，该催化剂表现出高丙烷转化率（40%）和长达170小时的良好稳定性。这表明PDH技术与先进催化剂结合时，可以实现高产品选择性并在较长时间内保持效率。

虽然文档没有明确将PDH与传统生产方法进行比较，但它暗示这种技术结合创新催化剂有潜力解决丙烯生产中原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。
