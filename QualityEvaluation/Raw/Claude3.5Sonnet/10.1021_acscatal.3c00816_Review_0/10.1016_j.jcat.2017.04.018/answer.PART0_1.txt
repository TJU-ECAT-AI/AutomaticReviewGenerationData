[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of abundant alkanes, as an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, has attracted great attention recently."

[2] "Due to the detrimental effect of Cr2O3-based catalyst and high cost of Pt-based catalyst, the exploration of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost is still one of the urgent issues."

[3] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology and its advantages in the context of global propylene demand. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology:

1. Effective production of high-value light alkenes: PDH is described as an effective route to produce valuable light alkenes from abundant alkanes.

2. Use of abundant feedstock: The process utilizes propane, which is an abundant alkane.

3. Potential for improved catalysts: The research focuses on developing novel, non-toxic, and low-cost catalysts to address issues with current options like Cr2O3-based (detrimental effects) and Pt-based (high cost) catalysts.

4. High conversion rate: The Sn-HMS catalyst developed in this study shows a high propane conversion rate of 40%.

5. Good stability: The Sn-HMS catalyst demonstrates better dehydrogenation stability for up to 170 hours, even after multiple regenerations.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods or discuss global propylene demand, it suggests that PDH technology has the potential to address challenges in feedstock availability (using abundant propane), process efficiency (high conversion rate), and catalyst performance (improved stability and lower cost).

虽然文献并未直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术及其在全球丙烯需求背景下优势的所有方面，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出PDH技术的一些优点：

1. 高效生产高价值轻烯烃：PDH被描述为从丰富的烷烃生产有价值轻烯烃的有效途径。

2. 使用丰富的原料：该过程利用丙烷，这是一种丰富的烷烃。

3. 改进催化剂的潜力：研究专注于开发新型、无毒和低成本的催化剂，以解决当前选择如Cr2O3基（有害影响）和Pt基（高成本）催化剂的问题。

4. 高转化率：本研究开发的Sn-HMS催化剂显示出40%的高丙烷转化率。

5. 良好的稳定性：Sn-HMS催化剂展示出长达170小时的更好的脱氢稳定性，即使在多次再生后仍然如此。

虽然文档没有明确比较PDH与传统生产方法，或讨论全球丙烯需求，但它表明PDH技术有潜力解决原料可用性（使用丰富的丙烷）、过程效率（高转化率）和催化剂性能（提高稳定性和降低成本）等方面的挑战。
