[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of abundant alkanes, as an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, has attracted great attention recently."

[2] "Due to the detrimental effect of Cr2O3-based catalyst and high cost of Pt-based catalyst, the exploration of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost is still one of the urgent issues."

[3] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in the context of global propylene demand. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is described as "abundant" in the text. This suggests that PDH addresses the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Process efficiency: The Sn-HMS catalyst developed for propane dehydrogenation shows a high propane conversion of 40% and good stability for up to 170 hours. This indicates that PDH technology can be efficient and stable.

3. Product selectivity: While not explicitly stated, the focus on developing catalysts for propane dehydrogenation suggests that this method offers good selectivity for propylene production.

4. Cost-effectiveness: The text mentions the need for a "novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost," implying that PDH technology using catalysts like Sn-HMS could be more cost-effective than conventional methods using expensive Pt-based catalysts.

5. Environmental considerations: The development of non-toxic catalysts like Sn-HMS addresses environmental concerns associated with conventional Cr2O3-based catalysts.

While the text doesn't directly compare PDH to other propylene production methods, it suggests that PDH technology, particularly with improved catalysts, can address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and potentially product selectivity, while also considering cost and environmental factors.

虽然文献并未直接回答有关丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在全球丙烯需求背景下的优势的所有方面，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出PDH技术的一些优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，文中描述为"丰富"。这表明PDH解决了原料可用性的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：为丙烷脱氢开发的Sn-HMS催化剂显示出40%的高丙烷转化率，并在长达170小时内保持良好的稳定性。这表明PDH技术可以高效且稳定。

3. 产品选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但对开发丙烷脱氢催化剂的关注表明，这种方法可能为丙烯生产提供良好的选择性。

4. 成本效益：文中提到需要"新型无毒、低成本的脱氢催化剂"，这暗示使用Sn-HMS等催化剂的PDH技术可能比使用昂贵的铂基催化剂的传统方法更具成本效益。

5. 环境考虑：开发Sn-HMS等无毒催化剂解决了与传统Cr2O3基催化剂相关的环境问题。

虽然文本没有直接将PDH与其他丙烯生产方法进行比较，但它表明PDH技术，特别是在改进的催化剂的帮助下，可以解决原料可用性、工艺效率，可能还有产品选择性方面的挑战，同时也考虑了成本和环境因素。
