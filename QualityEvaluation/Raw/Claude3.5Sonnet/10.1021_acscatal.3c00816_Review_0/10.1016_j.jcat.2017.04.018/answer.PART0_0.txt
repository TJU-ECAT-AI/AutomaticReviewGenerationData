[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of abundant alkanes, as an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, has attracted great attention recently."

[2] "Due to the detrimental effect of Cr2O3-based catalyst and high cost of Pt-based catalyst, the exploration of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost is still one of the urgent issues."

[3] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

The literature does not directly address the specific advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in the context of global propylene demand. However, it does provide some insights into the potential benefits of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.

Catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes, including propane, is described as an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, which has attracted significant attention. This suggests that PDH technology could be promising for propylene production.

The research focuses on developing a novel catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, addressing issues with existing catalysts. The Sn-HMS catalyst demonstrated high propane conversion (40%) and good stability for up to 170 hours, even after multiple regenerations. This indicates that PDH technology, with appropriate catalysts, can offer high efficiency and good selectivity.

The study also mentions the need for non-toxic and low-cost catalysts, suggesting that PDH technology could potentially address economic and environmental concerns in propylene production.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how PDH technology compares to conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability or how it addresses challenges faced by these methods. More comprehensive research would be needed to fully answer the question.

该文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在全球丙烯需求背景下的具体优势。然而，它确实提供了一些关于丙烷催化脱氢潜在好处的见解。

文中将烷烃（包括丙烷）的催化脱氢描述为生产高价值轻烯烃的有效途径，这一点已引起了广泛关注。这表明PDH技术可能是丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法。

研究重点是开发一种新型丙烷脱氢催化剂，以解决现有催化剂的问题。Sn-HMS催化剂展示了高丙烷转化率（40%）和良好的稳定性，可持续使用长达170小时，即使经过多次再生后仍能保持性能。这表明PDH技术在使用适当催化剂的情况下，可以提供高效率和良好的选择性。

研究还提到了对无毒和低成本催化剂的需求，这表明PDH技术可能有助于解决丙烯生产中的经济和环境问题。

然而，该文献并未提供PDH技术与传统生产方法在原料可用性方面的具体比较，也没有说明它如何解决这些方法面临的挑战。要全面回答这个问题，需要进行更为全面的研究。
