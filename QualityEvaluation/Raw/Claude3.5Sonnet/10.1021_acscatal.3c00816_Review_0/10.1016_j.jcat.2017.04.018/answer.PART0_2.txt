[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of abundant alkanes, as an effective route to produce high-valued light alkenes, has attracted great attention recently."

[2] "Due to the detrimental effect of Cr2O3-based catalyst and high cost of Pt-based catalyst, the exploration of a novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost is still one of the urgent issues."

[3] "Sn-containing hexagonal mesoporous silica (Sn-HMS) has been synthesized and evaluated for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[4] "Compared with Sn/SiO2 samples prepared by conventional impregnation method, Sn-HMS catalyst exhibits inspiringly higher propane conversion (40%) and better dehydrogenation stability up to 170 h, even after three oxidative regenerations."

The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology:

1. Feedstock availability: The text mentions "abundant alkanes" as a source for producing light alkenes, suggesting that propane, an alkane, is readily available as a feedstock for PDH.

2. Process efficiency: The Sn-HMS catalyst described shows a high propane conversion rate of 40% and good stability for up to 170 hours, indicating an efficient process.

3. Product selectivity: While not explicitly stated, the focus on developing catalysts for dehydrogenation implies that PDH offers good selectivity for propylene production.

4. Cost-effectiveness: The research aims to develop a "novel non-toxic dehydrogenation catalyst with low cost," addressing the issue of expensive Pt-based catalysts currently used in industry.

5. Environmental considerations: The pursuit of non-toxic catalysts suggests that PDH technology can be more environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods using Cr2O3-based catalysts.

While the text doesn't directly compare PDH to other propylene production methods, it highlights the advantages of using catalytic dehydrogenation for producing high-value light alkenes, which includes propylene.

虽然文献并未直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产中的优势的所有方面，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出PDH技术的一些优势：

1. 原料可用性：文中提到"丰富的烷烃"作为生产轻烯烃的来源，表明丙烷作为烷烃，是PDH的现成原料。

2. 工艺效率：所描述的Sn-HMS催化剂显示出40%的高丙烷转化率，并且在长达170小时内保持良好的稳定性，表明这是一个高效的过程。

3. 产品选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但对开发脱氢催化剂的关注暗示PDH提供了良好的丙烯生产选择性。

4. 成本效益：研究旨在开发"新型无毒低成本脱氢催化剂"，解决了目前工业上使用昂贵的铂基催化剂的问题。

5. 环境考虑：对无毒催化剂的追求表明，与使用Cr2O3基催化剂的传统方法相比，PDH技术可能更加环保。

虽然文本没有直接将PDH与其他丙烯生产方法进行比较，但它强调了使用催化脱氢生产高价值轻烯烃（包括丙烯）的优势。
