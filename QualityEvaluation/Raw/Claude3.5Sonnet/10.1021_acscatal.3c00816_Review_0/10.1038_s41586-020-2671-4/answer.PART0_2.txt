[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production"

[2] "This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution."

[3] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s"

[4] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane as feedstock, which has become more abundant due to the shale gas revolution. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which can be more efficient compared to other multi-step processes.

3. Product selectivity: While the document mentions challenges with selectivity due to coke deposition, it also describes efforts to improve catalysts to enhance selectivity. The development of new catalysts, such as the PtREE intermetallic compounds described in the paper, aims to address this issue.

4. Growing importance: PDH is described as "one of the most important petrochemical processes," indicating its significance in meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

5. Established technology: The industrial use of PDH for nearly three decades suggests that it is a proven technology with room for further improvements.

However, the document also highlights ongoing challenges, particularly related to catalyst deactivation and coke formation, which researchers are actively working to overcome through the development of new catalyst materials and supports.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气革命，丙烷变得更加丰富。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化过程，与其他多步骤过程相比可能更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：虽然文档提到由于积碳沉积导致选择性方面的挑战，但它也描述了改进催化剂以提高选择性的努力。开发新型催化剂，如文中描述的PtREE金属间化合物，旨在解决这个问题。

4. 重要性增长：PDH被描述为"最重要的石油化工过程之一"，表明其在满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求方面的重要性。

5. 成熟技术：PDH在工业上使用近三十年，表明它是一项经过验证的技术，并有进一步改进的空间。

然而，文档也强调了持续存在的挑战，特别是与催化剂失活和积碳形成相关的问题，研究人员正在通过开发新的催化剂材料和载体积极努力克服这些问题。
