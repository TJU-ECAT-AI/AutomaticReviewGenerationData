<quotes>

[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most important petrochemical processes, used for a large portion of the worldwide propylene production"

[2] "This process is currently attracting interest in the area of heterogeneous catalysis owing to a sudden increase in propane supply from the shale gas revolution."

[3] "The industrial PDH process has been using PtSn bimetallic catalysts supported on porous alumina for nearly three decades, since its discovery in the early 1990s"

[4] "The Pt metal alone exhibits high initial catalytic activity, but rapidly deactivates as a result of coke deposition on the Pt surface. The coke deposition also causes an undesirable loss of the catalytic selectivity to propylene."

</quotes>

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane as feedstock, which has become increasingly abundant due to the shale gas revolution. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process for converting propane to propylene, which can be more efficient compared to more complex multi-step conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: While the document mentions challenges with selectivity due to coke deposition, ongoing research into improved catalysts (such as the PtREE intermetallic compounds described) aims to enhance selectivity to propylene.

4. Dedicated propylene production: Unlike some conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct, PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, allowing for better control and optimization of the process.

5. Adaptability to market demands: As a on-purpose propylene production method, PDH can help balance supply and demand fluctuations in the propylene market more effectively than conventional methods.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to all conventional methods, it highlights the importance and ongoing development of PDH technology in addressing the growing global demand for propylene.
