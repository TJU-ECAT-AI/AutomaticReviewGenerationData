Ultrasmall Metal Nanoparticles Confined within Crystalline Nanoporous Materials: A Fascinating Class of Nanocatalysts
Abstract
Crystalline nanoporous materials with uniform porous structures, such as zeolites and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs), have proven to be ideal supports to encapsulate ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (MNPs) inside their void nanospaces to generate high-efficiency nanocatalysts. The nanopore-encaged metal catalysts exhibit superior catalytic performance as well as high stability and catalytic shape selectivity endowed by the nanoporous matrix. In addition, the synergistic effect of confined MNPs and nanoporous frameworks with active sites can further promote the catalytic activities of the composite catalysts. Herein, recent progress in nanopore-encaged metal nanocatalysts is reviewed, with a special focus on advances in synthetic strategies for ultrasmall MNPs (<5 nm), clusters, and even single atoms confined within zeolites and MOFs for various heterogeneous catalytic reactions. In addition, some advanced characterization methods to elucidate the atomic-scale structures of the nanocatalysts are presented, and the current limitations of and future opportunities for these fantastic nanocatalysts are also highlighted and discussed. The aim is to provide some guidance for the rational synthesis of nanopore-encaged metal catalysts and to inspire their further applications to meet the emerging demands in catalytic fields.
1 Introduction
In recent decades, metal nanoparticles (MNPs) have drawn increasing attention as an important class of nanocatalysts because of their superior activities in heterogeneous catalytic reactions in which the size of the MNPs is a significant factor in determining their performance.1 Decreasing the particle size of MNPs can greatly increase the exposed active sites; in particular, sub-nanometric metallic clusters and even single metal atom catalysts have demonstrated their excellent ability to achieve high catalytic activity and selectivity.2 However, the poor stability and severe aggregation in catalytic processes remain major problems for MNPs with small particle sizes due to their substantially increased surface free energy. To overcome the aforementioned problems, MNPs can be immobilized onto solid supports.3 Thus far, various supports, including graphene, metal oxides, polymers, and nanoporous materials have been used to anchor the MNPs. However, doping the MNPs onto the surface of the supports may not supply satisfactory stability due to direct exposure of metals under harsh reaction conditions. Among these supports, nanoporous materials, such as zeolites, mesoporous silica, and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) with high surface areas and well-defined nanopores/cavities, have proven to be a class of ideal hosts to confine ultrasmall MNPs in their nanopores to protect against sintering.4 Notably, crystalline nanoporous materials, such as zeolites with ordered micropores (<2 nm) and MOFs constructed from metal sites coordinated with functional organic linkers, are currently the most popular nanoporous supports.[4, 5] These crystalline nanoporous supports can act as powerful hosts, encapsulating the MNPs inside the inner void nanospaces and protecting their further size increase as well as facilitating the unique catalytic shape selectivities.6 The resultant nanopore-encaged metal catalysts are widely used as highly efficient nanocatalysts in many industrial applications, including olefin polymerization, olefin dehydrogenation, and diesel oxidation.[4, 7] In recent years, these nanocatalysts have also been used in many new catalytic fields, such as chemical energy storage involving the hydrogen generated from formic acid, ammonia borane or hydrazine, the production of biomass-derived fuels and chemicals, as well as new energy generated from fuel processing.8 Moreover, taking advantage of the synergistic effect between confined small MNPs and nanoporous frameworks with active sites can realize significant improvements in catalytic performance9 and can afford efficient cascade catalytic processes.10
The fabrication of MNPs within crystalline nanoporous supports with efficient methods is of critical for their catalytic performance. Impregnation and ion-exchange methods are conventionally used to synthesize supported metal catalysts, but usually result in non-uniformity and large particles on the crystal surfaces. To avoid these shortcomings and fabricate ultrasmall MNPs with uniform distributions, many facile synthetic strategies have recently been developed for the confinement preparation of MNPs within crystalline nanoporous materials. These strategies include a ligand-stabilized method during in situ synthesis,[6, 11] a buckling method during a swellingpillaring process,12 a chemisorption method,13 a photoreduction method,14 and a double solvent method.[4, 15] The literature contains several excellent reviews regarding zeolite/MOF-immobilized metal catalysts; these reviews focus on the introduction of novel catalytic processes, the synergism for enhanced catalysis, and the booming energy/environment-related applications.[4, 8] In view of the growing and significant advancements in nanopore-encaged metal catalysts and the increasing and wide applications of these materials in various catalytic processes, in the present progress report, we mainly focus on presenting the state-of-the-art strategies for the fabrication of ultrasmall MNPs (<5 nm), clusters, and even single atoms confined within zeolites and MOFs; the advantages and disadvantages of different methods are also discussed. Scheme 1 summarizes the main synthetic methods used to fabricate ultrasmall MNPs within crystalline nanoporous materials and their advantages in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Some catalytic applications of these catalysts, including hydrogenation reduction, CO oxidation, shape-selective redox and dehydrogenation reaction, as well as related advanced characterization methods to elucidate the atomic-scale structure of the nanocatalysts, are also introduced. In the last section of this progress report, some current limitations and future prospects regarding challenges and opportunities for this subject are outlined.

2 Metal Clusters Confined in Zeolites
Zeolites are a class of crystalline inorganic materials with 3D framework structures formed by TO4 (T = Si, Al, P, etc.) tetrahedra connected in diverse ways.16 Zeolites, which possess orderly distributed micropores (<2 nm) and tunable acidic/alkali/redox sites, are widely used in the industrial catalytic reactions and the separation of small gas molecules. Significantly, compared with other crystalline nanoporous materials, zeolites exhibit superior thermal and chemical stability even under harsh reaction conditions. Thus far, zeolites have proven to be excellent supports for the confinement synthesis of metal species against aggregation.[4, 17] In summarizing latest literature, we identified three major synthetic strategies for supporting ultrasmall MNPs onto/into zeolites: a) postencapsulation methods, b) in situ encapsulation methods, and c) nanobox-encaged methods.
2.1 Postencapsulation Methods
Zeolites are typically synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in the presence of metal cations or organic amines as templates.18 After removing the organic templates by calcination at high temperature, the uniform channels or/and cages can be vacated. These void spaces can function as hosts to accommodate the introduced metal cations. Postencapsulation methods such as ion-exchange, impregnation, and the adsorption/decomposition of organometallic compounds are the common methods to introduce metal cations into the zeolite matrix. We introduce these methods in detail in the following subsections.
2.1.1 Ion-Exchange Method
Traditional aluminosilicate zeolite frameworks possess negative charges, which can be balanced by alkali and alkaline-earth metal cations, such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+, located in the channels of the zeolites. In contrast to the skeleton atoms, these charge-balancing cations can move freely and be exchanged with other metal cations such as transition metal cations in solutions. After treatment of zeolites in different atmospheres, metal oxides, metal sulfides, and metal atoms can form in/on the zeolite crystals. In general, the conventional exchange process usually requires repeated exchange steps to achieve the desired metal loading contents. To incorporate more ions inside the zeolite crystals, before the next exchange, the zeolites should be washed with water until the filtrate contains no metal ions. The pH value of the solutions is also a critical factor for the exchange process. During the exchange process, careful adjustment of the pH value is necessary to avoid the precipitation of metal hydroxides.
Recently, Samor and co-workers synthesized a series of ultrasmall silver clusters with four Ag atoms encapsulated in FAU-type and LTA-type zeolites via an ion-exchange method.19 The authors systematically investigated the effect of space confinement on Ag clusters encapsulated within zeolites, as well as the electronic and optical properties of the obtained samples. By finely tuning of the mobilities of metal cations and utilizing the zeolite supports, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the (Ag+0.5K+11.5)[Al12Si12O48] (FAU) sample reached nearly 100%, exceeding all previously reported values for luminescent Ag clusters.
In contrast to Ag+ ions that are stable in aqueous solution and are easily exchanged into zeolite channels, other noble-metal cations, such as Pt2+ and Pd2+, are usually not stable even in neutral solutions; precipitates are therefore easily generated during the ion-exchange process. Thus, direct encapsulation of these cations in a zeolite by ion exchange is not easily achieved. To solve such problem, a novel ligand-protected exchange method was developed. With the protection of ammonia, cationic complexes Pt(NH3)42+, Pd(NH3)42+, and Ir[(NH3)5Cl]2+ were stabilized in solutions, ensuring that these metal species could encapsulated into zeolites during the ion-exchange process.20 This approach led to several ultrasmall Pt clusters being successfully encaged within zeolites, including MFI, LTL, BEA and FAU.[20, 21] Notably, when [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution was used as the exchange precursor, atomically dispersed Pt was also successfully embedded in KLTL zeolite.[21] Utilizing high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the authors confirmed that most of the isolated Pt(NH3)42+ cations were located at the edge of the 12 rings in zeolites and that only a few Pt(NH3)42+ cations were situated at the small rings between the 12 rings (Figure 1AD). After the loaded zeolite was calcined in 10% O2/He at 633 K, although some Pt atoms migrated along the channels, leading to more Pt atoms being present in the largest pores, the individually dispersed Pt atoms were maintained throughout the zeolite crystals (Figure 1E). Moreover, the atomically dispersed Pt catalyst showed the good catalytic performance for CO oxidation and remained stable after the reaction.

2.1.2 Impregnation Method
The success of ion-exchange method strongly depends on the ion-exchange capacity of the zeolite hosts. Thus, ion exchange of zeolites with a neutral framework, such as silicalite and aluminophosphate zeolites, is infeasible. For these neutral zeolite supports, the impregnation method is widely used to introduce metal precursors into the zeolite matrix. Specifically, the incipient wetness method, that is, mixing the dehydrated zeolite with an equal volume of metal-containing solution and introducing the solution to the pore volume of a zeolite, is the most popular impregnation method. Ideally, the metal precursors can be filled into the pores homogeneously through the zeolite crystals and the metal clusters can form within the zeolites after a reduction procedure. However, some gas molecules inevitably remain inside the zeolite frameworks, and the metal precursor solution cannot easily fill the whole micropore volume of the zeolites. Thus, superfluous metal species are usually loaded on the outside of the zeolites and further aggregate during the reduction and reaction processes. Pretreatment of the zeolite hosts under vacuum to empty the channel is an efficient strategy for avoiding large surface-bound MNPs. The incipient wetness method under a static vacuum resulted in well-dispersed metal nanoparticles in FAU and LTL zeolites with large 12-ring channels.22 Generally, the loading amounts of metal in zeolites are limited by the pore volume of the zeolite frameworks and the solubility of the metal precursors. An increase of the metal loading in zeolites, especially for zeolites with pore windows smaller than 12 rings, usually leads to the formation of bulky metal particles on the outer surface of the zeolites.23 In many cases, to ensuring sufficient catalytic activity in practical applications requires high metal loading contents. Thus, increasing metal contents within the zeolites under the premise of maintaining high dispersions of MNPs is highly desirable. Introducing larger secondary pores into microporous zeolites to generate larger and more accessible void nanospaces has proven to be an efficient method for encapsulating small metal clusters with high loadings within zeolite matrices.24 In addition, the introduction of additional mesopores could not only maintain MNPs against sintering and leaching under harsh conditions but also decrease the diffusion limitation and increase the catalytic activity and selectivity of products over such catalysts.25 Recently, a new type of self-pillared mesoporous zeolites with nanosheet layers (2 nm) has been synthesized by the Ryoo and Tsapatsis groups.26 Compared with conventional ZSM-5 nanosized zeolites, the self-pillared nanosheet-like zeolites could effectively control the sizes of Pt clusters (1.0 nm) due to the remarkably increased external surface areas.27 However, the metal clusters located in the intercrystal mesopores may be directly exposed to substrate molecules, resulting in loss of the size selectivity of the zeolite micropores.28 Fabricating intracrystalline mesopores inside the zeolite crystals could be a good approach to maintaining micropore-selective catalysis. Kegns et al. used a recrystallized silicalite-1 (MFI) with intracrystal mesopores to encapsulate Au NPs via the incipient wetness impregnation method.[20] During the impregnation procedure, the HAuCl4 solution easily filled the intracrystal mesopores. The Au nanoparticles (23 nm) with metal loading of 1 wt% were finally embedded within the zeolites after reduction. For comparison, larger Au NPs (36 nm) with the same metal loading were located only on the surface of conventional microporous silicalite-1 crystals.
Post-treatment of zeolites with alkaline or fluoride etchant can create intracrystal mesopores; however, the etching process is usually accompanied by the formation of open pores connected to the surface.29 To fill the open mesoporous voids, Ding and co-workers developed a two-step dry gel conversion (DGC) method by assisting the base-treatment to synthesize Pt/alk-ZSM-5 catalysts and then coating the aforementioned catalysts with silica shells (Figure 1F).[28, 30] Pt@MFI catalysts with different metal loadings from 0.8 to 1.2 wt% were prepared via the two-step DGC method, and HRTEM images showed that the Pt clusters with uniform sizes of 3 nm were distributed entirely inside the zeolite crystallites after calcination in air at 550 C. Significantly, compared with the conventional Pt/ZSM-5, the resultant catalysts exhibited not only high thermal stability but also excellent size-selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 2,3-dimethylnitrobenzene. Very recently, Xiao and co-workers developed a novel fish-in-hole strategy to position Pd NPs inside the mesopores of zeolite crystals.31 The authors found that using Pd(OAc)2 as a precursor was the synthetic key because the metal precursor could be adsorbed and enriched in the mesopores of the zeolite crystals; the Pd NPs with a diameter of 3.7 nm and a loading amount of 0.6 wt% were subsequently formed in the traps of zeolite Y through self-reduction. Significantly, the migration and aggregation from neighboring Pd NPs were greatly hindered due to trapping in the mesopores of zeolites, leading to excellent stability under both harsh thermal treatments and high-temperature CO oxidation.
2.1.3 Adsorption/Decomposition of Organometallic Compounds
Compared with the synthesis of zeolite-supported noble metals, the encapsulation of small transition-metal clusters inside the zeolites is still difficult to be achieved because the transition-metal clusters possess lower redox potential and higher surface free energy than noble-metal clusters, leading to easy and severe aggregations during the reduction process. In terms of the aforementioned considerations, zero-valent organometallic compounds, such as Fe(CO)532 and Co2(CO)8,33 without requiring a reduction step, were selected as metal precursors to prepare zeolite-encaged non-noble-metal catalysts.[7, 13, 34] This synthetic method is also a good approach to fabricating the atomically dispersed noble metals supported on zeolites. Weber et al. successfully introduced [Rh(CO)2(acac)] or [Ir(CO)2(acac)] as a precursor into a NaY zeolite by mixing a pentanes solution of the metal precursors with the zeolite.[13] Metal carbonyl clusters ([Rh6(CO)16], [Ir4(CO)12] or [Ir6(CO)16]) were obtained after a carbonylation treatment at a predetermined temperature under a CO atmosphere. When the [Rh6(CO)16]/NaY catalyst was treated with H2 at 200 C, the carbonyl ligands were partially removed, and small metal clusters with almost the same framework nuclearity (Rh6) were generated inside the zeolites. However, when the [Rh6(CO)16]/NaY catalyst was treated at a higher temperature (250 C), the Rh clusters consisted of 1520 atoms, with a few CO ligands formed. Similar results were achieved in the H2 treatment of [Ir6(CO)16]/NaY catalysts. The resultant catalysts showed high stability in the propylene hydrogenation reaction, with no obvious changes in cluster size or framework structure during the catalytic process. Similarly, complexes of other metals, such as Ir(C2H4)2(acac), Ru(C2H4)2(acac)2 and Au(CH3)2(acac), can also be incorporated into HY zeolite by this adsorption method.
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a universal strategy that can be used to chemisorb a reactive mononuclear metal complex precursor from the gas or liquid phase onto a zeolite support.35 Typically, in the CVD method, volatile metal precursors and dehydrated zeolites are placed into two vials, which are subsequently sealed and kept under vacuum. The vapors of metal precursors are gradually generated with increasing temperature (without exceeding the decomposition temperature of the metal precursors) and can be absorbed within the zeolite channels. Zeolite-encapsulated metal clusters are finally obtained after the organic ligands are removed by thermal decomposition. Hong et al. encapsulated Pt clusters into various acidic aluminosilicate zeolites and neutral aluminophosphates via adsorption/decomposition combined with CVD methods in which platinum acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) was used as a precursor.36 The Pt(acac)2 was first dissolved in acetone, followed by addition of the dehydrated zeolite. Hydrogen chemisorption showed high H/Pt ratios, which indicated that the Pt clusters were well dispersed.
These postencapsulation methods have been widely used for synthesizing transition metals encaged in zeolite, but still have some limitations and shortcomings. When the complex cations and organometallic compounds are larger than the pore sizes, these methods are infeasible because these larger compounds cannot enter the zeolite matrices. For example, Pt(NH3)42+ cations could not be exchanged within CaA,37 SOD or GIS[6] zeolites. On the other hand, the synthesis of metal species encapsulated in zeolites is also limited by the exchangeable alkali metal cations, the pore volumes, and the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the zeolite hosts. Encapsulating metal clusters in these zeolites via postencapsulation methods remains a challenge.
2.2 In Situ Encapsulation Methods
In contrast to postsynthetic methods, the in situ encapsulation method is not restricted by the pore size of zeolites because the encapsulating procedure of metal species is synchronized with the crystallization of the zeolites. However, during the crystallization process of zeolites under hydrothermal conditions, most metal cations easily precipitate as bulk hydroxides in the alkaline synthetic gels, resulting in the formation of large particles on the surface of the zeolite crystals or/and even the separation of metal species and zeolite supports. Moreover, the metal clusters also tend to aggregate severely in the precursors of zeolites because of their high surface energy. Thus, developing more protective approaches to restricting the severe aggregation or fast precipitation is essential for encapsulating ultrasmall metal clusters in the zeolite framework during the in situ synthetic process. Based on the different protective approaches, the in situ encapsulation methods can be classified as a) ligand-stabilized methods or b) precursor-stabilized methods.
2.2.1 Ligand-Stabilized Methods
2.2.1.1 Amine-Based Ligands
: Amine-based ligands, such as ammonia and ethylenediamine, are common ligands used to stabilize metal cations for the in situ synthesis of zeolite-supported metals because these metalamine complexes exhibit excellent aqueous solubility and superior stability in the high-pH synthesis system.[6, 38] Recently, by adding metalamine complexes, Iglesia and co-workers successfully encapsulated various kinds of metal clusters (Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh) with metal loadings of 0.1 wt% inside the aluminosilicate SOD zeolite with a small pore size of 0.28 nm, which could not be entered by most metal precursors (Figure 2A).[6] They also encaged metals in GIS (0.45 nm × 0.31 nm) zeolite using a similar method. The encapsulation of metal clusters was further confirmed by the catalytic performance toward the hydrogenation of ethane in the presence of thiophene poisons that could not enter these zeolite pores. Due to the free contact of the thiophene, the impregnated Pt/SiO2 catalyst lost almost all activity for ethane hydrogenation, whereas the Pt@GIS maintained 85% of the initial reaction rate (Figure 2B). A similar procedure was recently applied to embed a series of metal clusters (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Re, and Ag) with an average size of 1.11.9 nm into LTA zeolites, and the metal loadings were ranged from 0.35 to 1.4 wt%. The obtained metal@LTA catalysts exhibited good shape selectivities in the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanols and the hydrogenation of alkenes.39

However, a similar method was unsuccessful for the direct confinement synthesis of small metal clusters in ANA[6] and MFI[38] zeolites. This is because the synthesis of these zeolites usually requires relatively high crystallizing temperatures, which are prone to cause the rapid decomposition of metal complex precursors and lead to the formation of large MPs. To solve such problem, a novel interzeolite transformation strategy was proposed by Iglesia and co-workers. They first positioned metal clusters (Pt and Ru) within GIS zeolites at milder conditions and then converted this GIS zeolite to ANA zeolite. During the interzeolite transformation process, the metal clusters could be occluded within the new zeolite frameworks. Similarly, the encapsulation of Pt, Ru, and Rh clusters inside MFI with a metal loading of 1.0 wt% was realized, by transforming ion-exchanged metal-containing zeolites (BEA and FAU) with larger pore sizes (Figure 2C). Metal clusters with an average diameter of 1.7 nm were observed by high-resolution TEM (Figure 2D,E).
The ligand-stabilized method has been widely used with different aluminosilicate zeolites; however, in situ encapsulation of ultrasmall metal clusters within neutral silica zeolites has also been reported. Under the direct hydrothermal condition, Yu and co-workers synthesized sub-nanometric monometallic Pd and hybrid bimetallic Pd-M(OH)2 (M = Co, Ni) clusters encaged within silicalite-1 zeolites.[11, 40] Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) were used as the template, and the metal complexes M(NH2CH2CH2NH2)22+ (M = Pd, Co, Ni) were encapsulated in zeolite channels as the zeolites were crystallized under a hydrothermal synthesis conditions at 443 K. After calcination in air and reduction under a H2 atmosphere, the sub-nanomertic metal clusters were finally formed inside the zeolite channels (Figure 2F). Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) results showed that the coordination numbers of PdPd metallic bonds were only 2.33.1, suggesting ultrasmall metal cluster sizes. Interestingly, the empty and intact straight channels along the [010] direction were observed in Cs-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images, which indicated that the sub-nanometric metal clusters were positioned in the intersectional void spaces between the straight and sinusoidal channels of the MFI structure (Figure 2G,H). Because of the substantially reduced metal cluster sizes and bimetallic synergistic effect, the Pd-cluster-containing zeolite catalysts exhibited superior activities toward formic acid decomposition. Notably, the 0.8Pd0.2Ni(OH)2@S-1 catalyst (Pd/Ni = 8/2) with metal loadings of 0.64 wt% gave an excellent initial TOF value as high as 5803 h1 at 60 C, which is a more than 14-fold enhancement compared with the TOF value of a commercial Pd/C catalyst.40 Moreover, the confinement effect of the zeolite could also enhance the catalytic and thermal stability. Excellent shape-selective catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and 3-nitrotoluene was achieved because almost all of the metal clusters were encaged inside the zeolite crystals.
2.2.1.2 Mercapto-Based Ligands
: Some metal ions, such as the Au3+ cation, are not easily stabilized by amine ligands, even at low temperature; however, when stabilized by mercaptosilane ligands, the Au3+ cation can form stable complexes that remain stable even under alkaline hydrothermal conditions.41 Mercaptosilane is a powerful ligand to stabilize metal ions and prepare ultrasmall metal clusters within zeolites. Sulfhydryl can coordinate with metal ions, thus avoiding precipitation or severe aggregation; while the alkoxysilane group in the mercaptosilane ligand can hydrolyze in alkaline media to form covalent SiOSi and/or SiOAl bonds along with the nucleation of zeolites, which are beneficial for the encapsulation of metal clusters inside zeolites. Various noble-metal clusters (Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, and Ag) have been successfully encaged in zeolite crystals via mercaptosilane-assisted hydrothermal methods.[11, 28, 41, 42] Iglesia and co-workers successfully encaged sub 2 nm Pt clusters into LTA zeolites with a metal loading of 1.1 wt% by using inorganic alkalines as templates and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane as ligands (Figure 3A).[28] The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and EXAFS results revealed that the Pt(II)-mercaptosilane complexes were encapsulated within the zeolite during the crystallization process and that the Pt clusters with 1.0  0.2 nm diameters could be formed after sequential O2/H2 treatments (Figure 3B,C). Metal clusters 1.3 nm in diameter were also observed in TEM images (Figure 3D); these clusters were much smaller than their Pt/SiO2 counterparts synthesized by the conventional impregnation method.

A similar procedure was also applied for the encapsulation of Pt species in highly siliceous chabazite.[11] The authors encapsulated Pt clusters of 1.4 nm in situ within high-silica CHA zeolite nanocrystals by using N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantammonium (TMAda) as the template and Pt-mercapto complexes as Pt precursors. The Pt loading amount was calculated as 0.8 wt% measured by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. These obtained ultrasmall Pt clusters exhibited extremely high thermal and hydrothermal stability and the particle size remained almost unchanged even at 650 C in H2 and steam. Notably, when the Pt@CHA catalyst was calcined under an O2 atmosphere, the Pt clusters could be further dissociated into isolated single Pt atoms, which were stable under calcination at 650 C. Interestingly, the Pt clusters could be regenerated after reduction in H2, showing a reversible transformation cycle of Pt clusters into single atoms (Figure 4A). The EXAFS results provided the detailed information regarding the structure of the metal species and the reversible process. PtS bonds with a bond length of 2.32 Å were detected in the fresh catalyst, confirming that the Ptthiol complexes were stable during the synthesis process. After calcination in O2, PtO bonds at 2.01 Å were formed, and PtPt bonds disappeared, demonstrating that calcined material consisted of isolated PtO3 units inside zeolites. Subsequent reduction at 400 C induced the formation of PtPt bonds, proving that Pt metal clusters formed in Pt@CHA. Alternating calcination and reduction led to the fragmentation/formation of metal clusters (Figure 4B), as further confirmed by STEM observations (Figure 4C).

2.2.2 Precursor-Stabilization Methods
Apart from stabilizing metal ions with organic ligands, utilizing amorphous silica precursors as stabilizers to anchor metal clusters is also an efficient approach to the in situ synthesis of metal-encapsulated zeolite materials.[6, 9, 43] In this synthesis system, the presynthesized metal clusters were first embedded in a SiO2 matrix as precursors for the zeolite crystallization. The silica-encaged metal cluster precursor was sequentially subjected to synthetic gel for the zeolite crystallization under hydrothermal conditions. With the consumption and crystallization of the silica into zeolites, the interior metal clusters were encaged simultaneously into the zeolite crystals. Using this precursor-stabilized method, Laursen et al. embedded small Au nanoparticles (12 nm) within silicalite-1 crystals (Figure 5A).[43] 3D TEM tomography clearly revealed that significant amounts of Au clusters were located inside the zeolite crystals. However, Au clusters aggregated on the outer surface due to the aggregation and mobility of the metal clusters in the solvent system during the zeolite crystallization (Figure 5B,C). In addition, according to calcination experiments followed by both ex situ and in situ TEM observations, the Au NPs embedded within the zeolite crystals were much more stable toward sintering than the Au NPs located on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. To overcome the aforementioned inability of MNPs completely pack inside the zeolites, researchers developed the solvent-free method[6, 9, 43] and modified the Kirkendall growth method[43] to decrease the amount of solvent used in the zeolite crystallization process. Xiao and co-workers reported a facile strategy for the preparation of metal@S-1 catalyst from the solvent-free crystallization of a metal@SiO2 precursor using TPAOH as a template.[6] In contrast to traditional hydrothermal crystallization, the Pd@SiO2 and TPAOH were ground in the solid phase rather than dispersed in a solvent. The resulting solid precursors were crystallized in an autoclave at 180 C for 3 days, and the Pd@S-1 catalyst was finally obtained (Figure 5D). The ICP analysis gave the Pd content of 0.34 wt%. Tomogram-section TEM images showed that the Pd nanoparticles (6.9 nm) were encapsulated within the S-1 zeolite crystals as a coreshell structure (Figure 5E). In later works, the authors encapsulated smaller Pd clusters of 1.5 nm within beta zeolite by using the Pd/beta seeds rather than Pd/SiO2 precursors (Figure 5F).[43] The beta zeolite possesses 12-ring micropores 0.67 nm in diameter, which can constrain nitroaromatic compounds interacting with the metal NPs at the zeolitemetal interface. The 4-nitrochlorobenzene was aligned in parallel within the zeolite channels and adsorbed onto the metal surface in the Pd@beta catalyst, which allowed only the nitro group to interact with the Pd NPs instead of the chloro groups. The Pd@beta catalyst exhibited high selectivity toward the catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrochlorobenzene and 4-chloroaniline as the sole product. In contrast, the Pd sites in Pd/C and Pd/beta catalysts obtained by impregnating method could interact with both the chloro and nitro groups of 4-nitrochlorobenzene, leading to the low selectivity. This strategy has been expanded to other nitroaromatic compounds, such as 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, as displayed in Figure 5G. Very recently, Yang et al. reported a novel method for encaging Pt clusters in MFI crystals by using a dry gel conversion method and introducing Pt-immobilized Schiff-SiO2 as the Si source.44 Schiff bases with abundant nitrogen-containing groups exhibited strong coordinating ability for anchoring metal species. According to the HAADF-STEM images, most of the Pt clusters were estimated to be 0.41.2 nm in diameter and were located in the defective voids or micropores of the MFI zeolites. The ICP analysis gave the Pt loading of the Pt@MFI catalyst of about 0.2 wt%. The Pt@MFI catalysts exhibited excellent thermal stability, and these Pt clusters grew to 2.8 nm after calcination at 800 C. Notably, the uniform pore structure of the zeolite endowed the Pt@zeolite catalyst with excellent shape selectivity for the hydrogenation of nitrotoluene and the oxidation dehydrogenation of alkanols with different substrate sizes.

In addition to the amorphous SiO2, 2D crystalline zeolites can also serve as precursors to anchor metal clusters. Recently, Corma and co-workers reported a novel method to encapsulate Pt atoms and clusters into a siliceous MCM-22 (MWW) zeolite framework during 2D zeolite transformation into a 3D structure.[12] Typically, premade sub-nanometric Pt clusters were first located in a layered 2D MWW-type precursor that was expanded by the surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. After subsequent pyrolysis and calcination in air, condensation of the layered zeolite precursor occurred, and sub-nanometric Pt species were entrapped in the hemi-cages (cups) and cages of the 3D MCM-22 zeolites. The Pt loading of Pt@MCM-22 catalyst analyzed by the ICP measurement was 0.11 wt%. The Pt clusters of 0.20.7 nm were observed by high-resolution electron microscopy. EXAFS analyses showed a PtPt coordination number of 4.7, indicating an average Pt-cluster size of less than 1 nm. The sub-nanometric Pt catalyst could distinguish between reactants of different sizes, which confirmed that the Pt clusters were located inside the micropores of the MCM-22. Although the Pt atoms could be mobile at high temperatures, the Pt@MCM-22 catalyst showed exceptional thermal stability against agglomeration compared with that of Pt/MCM-22-imp obtained by the impregnation method. Similarly, very recently, Zhao et al. encapsulated Pd NPs inside FER zeolite with a metal loading of 1.4 wt% via a layer reassembly process.[12] Pd precursors were located between swelling FER layers in RUB-36 with the assistance of cetyltrimethylammonium cations as a surfactant and a subsequent ion-exchange process at ambient temperature. After calcination at high temperatures, the Pd@FER could be observed with ultrasmall and uniform Pd NPs (1.4 nm) during the topotactic transformation from layered zeolite precursors to 3D zeolites. The as-prepared Pd@FER catalyst also exhibited excellent shape selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.
2.3 Zeolite-Shell-Encaged Methods
Hollow structured materials consisting of zeolite shells have received considerable interest in the past few years because the reduced thickness of the microporous walls partially overcomes diffusion.[4, 45] In recent decades, different types of hollow zeolites, such as MFI, LTA, SOD, and CHA, have been successfully prepared by various methods.46 Encaging metal clusters within the hollow cavities of the zeolite shells has recently been proved to be a successful method for synthesizing shape-selective catalysts with high activity. Two approaches to fabricating hollow-shell-encaged metal NP catalysts can be summarized as follows: a) the formation of zeolite shells by nanocrystals also known as zeolite microcapsule, through bottom-up methods and b) the synthesis of single-zeolite nanobox with an intracrystalline cavity synthesized with top-down methods (Figure 6A).

2.3.1 Zeolite-Microcapsule-Encaged Method
Most synthesis methods for zeolite microcapsule materials started with zeolite shells where an amorphous silica or polymer core is used as hard templates.[45, 46] Typically, zeolite seeds are first coated onto the oppositely charged mesoporous silica cores and are subsequently crystallized via the vapor-phase transport (VPT) method.[46] The amorphous silica cores can serve as a raw material for the crystallization and transformation into the zeolite polycrystalline shells. When metal nanoparticles are deposited into the amorphous silica spheres before crystallization, a yolkshell structure of MNPs encaged in zeolite microcapsules is finally obtained (Figure 6B). TEM images confirmed that the small PdO nanoparticles (3 nm) and Ag nanoparticles (1580 nm) were located in the cavity (Figure 6C). However, sometimes the zeolite shells were relatively thick and the MNPs sizes were large and non-uniform, which would restrict diffusion of the reactant and lead to unsatisfactory reaction activity. Moreover, accumulated mesopores between zeolite crystals are often generated in the shells, which makes polycrystalline zeolite shells highly fragile, resulting in the inferior shape selectivity of the catalytic reactions. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient methods to reduce the zeolite shell thickness, improve the stability of the hollow structures and further decrease the MNPs' sizes in the hollow zeolites.
2.3.2 Single-Zeolite Nanobox-Encaged Method
More recently, a new synthetic approach has been developed to prepare hollow zeolite microcapsules via a dissolution and recrystallization procedures for single crystals. Such strategy was first realized with MFI structured hollow materials. ZSM-5 nanoboxes with the a shell thickness of less than 25 nm could be obtained by selective dissolution of the center of the crystals by alkaline treatments using NaOH solution,47 or a recrystallization process in the TPAOH solution.48 Tuel and co-workers carried out systematic studies utilizing this method. The authors synthesized series of noble-metal clusters encaged in MFI zeolite nanoboxes by applying the recrystallization method to metal-impregnated silicalite-1.[6, 49] The metal particle sizes could be controlled by the loading amounts. For instance, the size of Au nanoparticles increased from 2.9 to 7.7 nm when the loadings increased from 0.08 to 1.2 wt%. A similar method was also adapted for the encapsulation of non-noble-metal clusters50 and hybrid metal clusters[50, 51] within the MFI zeolites. During the hydrothermal process, the cores of the zeolite crystals with more defects could be preferentially dissolved as raw materials, these resolved silica species could recrystallize on the outer surface of zeolites under hydrothermal treatment. The metal clusters were finally retained within the zeolite cavities due to sizes than the micropores of zeolites. (Figure 6D,E). Notably, the obtained hollow-metal-encaged zeolite catalysts exhibited excellent shape-selective performance in oxidation and reduction reactions over different substrates with various molecular sizes and configurations, and the micropores of the zeolite shells could block the entrance of toxic molecules to avoid poisoning of the metallic active sites. The single-zeolite nanobox-encaged method also has some limitations. The MNP size confined within the hollow zeolite shells closely depends on the loading amount, and high metal loading usually leads to low dispersion and low reaction activity because the clusters can easily aggregate into larger particles during the Ostwald ripening process. Researchers have found that, when the starting aluminasilicate zeolites were treated under mild alkaline conditions, such as Na2CO3 solution, the obtained hollow structures contained more aluminum than the original bulk zeolites because the Na2CO3 solution preferentially dissolved the silicon. Moreover, this desilication process could be easily controlled and the wall thickness could be also adjusted by modulating the concentrations of the Na2CO3 solutions because the dissolved species were not involved in recrystallization.[46] Without the additional hydrothermal treatment, the aggregation of the metal clusters was avoided. For instance, Pt2+/ZSM-5 synthesized by impregnation method was used as the precursor, and after Na2CO3 treatment, Pt clusters with a particle size of 2.7 nm were embedded in the zeolite's crack-free shells. In contrast, the Pt@hollow S-1 synthesized with the recrystallization method possessed larger sizes of MNPs (11.7 nm).52 Notably, the resultant Pt/ZSM-5 nanoshell catalyst showed four-fold enhanced hydrogenation rates compared with those obtained over the Pt@hollow S-1 catalysts, as well as improved thermal stability. Subsequently, many other zeolites with nanobox morphology, such as LTA,53 SOD,[53] and CHA,[46] have also been prepared.
3 Metal Clusters Confined in MetalOrganic Frameworks
MOFs, another class of crystalline nanoporous materials assembled by organic linkers and inorganic vertices (metal ions or clusters) through covalent coordination linkages, were first defined in the late 1990s by Yaghi et al.54 In general, MOFs possess extremely high porosities (usually >90% free volume), enormous internal surface areas (even greater than 10 000 m2 g1), as well as tunable pore sizes and unsaturated metal centers.55 These prominent features render MOF materials promising for various applications, including gas storage and separation, proton conductivity, catalysis, sensing and drug delivery.[4, 8, 54, 56] Moreover, given the unique host matrices of MOFs, the incorporation of NPs into the nanosized void spaces of MOFs to generate supported the hybrid NPs catalysts has attracted increasing attention.[4, 8, 57] Similar to zeolites, many MOFs possess small nanopores (<3 nm) and good chemical stability; they can also serve as an ideal vessel for confining ultrafine MNPs and for applications in shape-selective reactions. However, the structures of MOFs are like jars; they possess larger inner void spaces but small pore openings. The narrow door usually hinders metal clusters from entering the internal room of MOFs, leading to many metal clusters being located on their outer surface, which causes severe aggregation during reduction and catalysis processes. Thus, controllable encapsulation of metal clusters inside MOFs instead of being exposed on the outer surface of MOFs is a critical point for high-performance MOF-supported metal catalysts. In recent years, various effective synthetic methods have been developed for encapsulating metal clusters within MOFs.[4] Reviewing the literature on the preparation of metal clusters reveals two major approaches: a) postsynthesized method and b) in situ encapsulation methods.
3.1 Postsynthesis Method
Inspired by the synthesis of zeolite-supported MNPs, the impregnation method is the most simple and facile approach for fabricating metal-cluster-supported MOFs. General, the metal precursors (metal ions and metal complexes) are first infiltrated into the MOF frameworks, followed by reduction to form metal clusters within the matrix. However, in most works, the traditional wetness impregnation method was used, which resulted in metal precursors being adsorbed onto the outer surface of MOFs instead of into the MOFs' large void spaces. The metal species are prone to severe aggregation, forming large MNPs located outside the MOF matrix and resulting in poor catalytic performance. On the other hand, the reduction is a necessary process for the formation of zero-valent MNPs. In general, the metal precursors can be reduced by pure or mixed H2 gas or reacted with a reducing agent, such as borohydride compounds and ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) in solution. The reduction conditions, such as the reduction times, reduction temperatures, and the concentrations of reducing agents, can strongly influence the MNP sizes.[4] Compared with zeolites, the MOFs exhibit poor thermal stability; the framework structures easily collapse under high temperatures under a reducing atmosphere, whereas, the chemical stability of MOFs is relatively good, especially in acidic and alkali solutions. Thus, the chemical reduction method is the most commonly used approach for the synthesis of zero-valent MNPs encaged in MOFs. However, the drastic redox reactions between metal ions and reduction agents easily form bulky metal particles due to aggregation in the solutions. Thus, the reduction conditions should be controlled carefully if small MNPs are expected. With the objective of improving impregnation and reduction procedures, researchers have proposed some novel postsynthesis methods in recent years.
3.1.1 Double-Solvent Method
To make the most of metal species encaged inside the MOFs during the process of wetness impregnation, investigators developed a novel double-solvent method (DSM) using a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvents (e.g., water and hexane).[4, 8, 15, 58] This DSM can efficiently incorporate the metal precursors into the pores of MOFs. The essence of this method is to exploit the difference in wettability of the solvents on the MOFs. Typically, the hydrophilic MOF crystals are first dispersed into the hydrophobic solvents. Subsequently, a certain amount of aqueous solution containing metal precursors (the volume of metal solution is smaller than the MOF inner volume) is dropwise added under vigorous stirring. Because of the immiscibility of water and hexane, the metal precursors will form stable droplets in the hexane, which can be absorbed into the MOF hydrophilic channels via the capillary force. After the reduction procedure, small metal clusters are finally encapsulated within the MOF matrix presumably without large particles deposited on the external surface.
Xu and co-workers used DSM to encapsulate metal clusters in MOF inner pores for the first time.[15] When an aqueous H2PtCl6 solution and hydrophobic n-hexane were used, the metal precursors were absorbed into the hydrophilic MIL-101 channels. The ultrafine Pt clusters with 1.8 nm in diameter and loading of 2 wt% were formed in the MOF framework by reduction with a NaBH4 solution. Interestingly, with this DSM, no obvious large MNPs were observed on the outside surface of the MIL-101 supports. Using a similar synthetic methodology, the authors immobilized a series of monometallic and bimetallic NPs within the MIL-101 pores. Figure 7A shows a schematic of the immobilization of AuNi clusters by MIL-101 matrix (AuNi@MIL-101) using DSM.58 When the non-noble-metal Ni was introduced, the bimetallic AuNi@MIL-101 catalyst exhibited much higher catalytic activity for the AB hydrolysis reaction than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Moreover, the authors also found that the concentration of the NaBH4 solution affected the size of the metallic clusters. When a NaBH4 solution with a high concentration (0.6 m) was adopted, uniform AuNi clusters with a small size (1.8 nm) were generated in the MOF matrix, without any large particles forming on the outer surface (Figure 7B). In contrast, the lower-concentration NaBH4 solutions could result in some agglomeration of larger MNPs on the external surfaces of MOFs. AuNi MNPs with diameters of 2.05.0 nm were obtained after reduction with a lower concentration of NaBH4 solution (0.4 m) (Figure 7C). When 0.2 m NaBH4 solution was used, the particle sizes of the AuNi MNPs were further enlarged to 5.0 nm (Figure 7D). The authors proposed that the reducing agents with low concentrations in the MOF pores could not reduce all of the metal precursors quickly, leading to the segmental migration and aggregation of metal species onto the MOF surfaces. Such concentration-controlled reduction (CCR) strategy combined with DSM was subsequently used in the preparation of ultrafine PdAg alloy NPs (1.5 nm) within the MIL-101. ICP analysis gave a metal loading of 1.0 wt%, and the resultant catalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic activity and selectivity in cascade reactions.[9]

3.1.2 MOF Self-Reduction Method
In addition to innovations in synthetic methods, some novel reduction methods for preparing metal clusters have been exploited in the field of MOFs. Suh and co-workers reported a novel reduction method to synthesize MOF-supported metal catalysts by using redox-active MOFs as both the support and the reducing agent. In this process, the metal precursors could be reduced to small clusters during impregnation without requiring a further reduction procedure.59 The MOF was synthesized with Ni(II) square-planar macrocyclic complexes as metal centers and Na2bqdc (bqdc = 4,4-biphenyldicarboxylate) as the organic ligand.[59] When the Ag(I) ions were immersed in the MOF frameworks, they would be easily reduced to Ag(0) clusters with the simultaneous oxidation of Ni(II) to Ni(III). According to the design of the synthesis, the redox reaction stoichiometry of the Ag+ immersed in the MOFs pores and the Ni2+ in the framework was 1:1, which made the loading contents exactly controllable. However, based on the corresponding TEM images, the average size (3 nm) of the Ag clusters was larger than the MOF pore, which may indicate that the framework was partially broken during the reduction process. Soon after, the same group reported the successful encapsulation of Au and Pd clusters within MOF frameworks using similar methods. In addition to a redox-active metal center, redox-active organic ligands were also used to assist in generating uniform metal clusters in the MOF matrix.[59] The authors selected 4,4,4-nitrilotrisbenzoate (ntb3) as the organic ligand coordinated with Zn2+ cations to synthesize the redox-active MOF ([Zn3(ntb)2(EtOH)2]·4H2O). Because the ntb3 ligands could be oxidized to amine radicals, Pd clusters 3.0 nm in diameter were formed inside the MOF during the impregnation procedure with the Pd(NO3)2 solution. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum further proved that the MOF framework possessed positive charges due to the presence of nitrogen radicals, after the redox reactions.
Photochemical reduction is also a novel and alternative method for the controllable synthesis of metal clusters in the MOF framework. Recently, Ameloot et al. proposed a novel reduction method using MOF-5 single crystals as photoactive matrix for the generation of metallic microstructures.[14] Under UV irradiation, the Ag+ ions in the solution were reduced to form Ag clusters in MOF-5 ([ZnO(bdc)3]n, bdc = benzene-1,4-dicarboxylate) by using MOF-5 as a semiconductor. However, in comparison, when the MIL-53 (Al) was used as the support, no Ag clusters were produced under similar irradiation conditions due to the lack of photo-reduction activity of MIL-53 (Al). In addition, Ti-MIL-125 (Ti8O8(OH)4(bdc)6) was also an active MOF support for the photo-reduction synthesis of metal clusters.[14] Because of the reducing ability of Ti3+ generated from optically induced electron trapping at Ti4+ sites, noble-metal clusters were directly formed under light irradiation without adding any additional reducing agent.
3.1.3 Chemical Vapor Deposition Method
In addition to the solution impregnation method, the gas-phase CVD method utilizing volatile organometallic compounds as precursors has been proved to be a promising route using MOFs as hosts.60 In this method, the vapors of volatile metal precursors are absorbed onto the MOF matrix in a Schlenk tube under vacuum. These metal precursors are then reduced to form small clusters after thermal treatment or H2 reduction. Fischer and co-workers synthesized metal clusters embedded in MOF-5 using the CVD method.[60] In this work, [(η5-C5H5)Pd(η3-C3H5)], [(η5-C5H5)Cu(PMe3)] and [(CH3)Au(PMe3)] compounds were used as the volatile organometallic precursors, and small Pd (1.4 nm) and Cu (34 nm) clusters were fabricated inside the MOF matrix after reduction under H2. However, the encapsulation of Au clusters within MOF-5 was unsuccessful, and large Au NPs (50 nm) were formed on the surface, when [(CH3)Au(PMe3)] was used as the organometallic precursor. This was because Au NPs possessed poor dispersity and high mobility, which could migrate along the open MOF-5 frameworks. Subsequently, using a similar method, other investigators used MOF-5 as supports to encapsulate other metal precursors, including [Ru(cod)(cot)] (cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene, cot = 1,3,5-cyclo-octatriene),[60] [Pt(η5-C5H5)(CH3)3],[60] [Zn(C2H5)2]2[60] and [Fe(η6-toluene)(η4-C4H6)],[60] and produced the corresponding MOF-based monometallic and bimetallic catalysts.
Because MOF-5 is extremely unstable when exposed to moisture or even a trace of water, the use of these MOF-5-based metal catalysts in practical applications is limited. To avoid the shortcomings of the water instability of MOFs materials, a typical water-stable MOFs, such as MIL-101,61 ZIF-8,62 and Uio-66 ([Zr6O4(OH)4(bdc)6]),63 can be used as hosts to confine MNPs. Hermannsdrfer and Kempe synthesized Pd@MIL-101 using the volatile complex [(η5-C5H5)Pd(η3-C3H5)] as a precursors.[61] With this method, the loading of metal NPs was greater than 50 wt% and the MNP sizes were controlled by altering the reaction conditions, especially the temperature. When ZIF-8 and Ir(COD)(MeCp) (MeCp = methylcyclopentadienyl) were used as the support and metal precursor, well-dispersed Ir clusters (3.3  1.7 nm) were stabilized within ZIF-8 matrix.[62] The loading amount of Ir was 1.5 wt%, measured by ICP analysis. The resultant Ir@ZIF-8 catalyst showed high catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of phenylacetylene under mild conditions. More importantly, because of the confinement effect of the ZIF-8 matrix, the Ir@ZIF-8 catalyst was highly stable against metal leaching and sintering throughout the catalytic reactions.
3.1.4 Solid Grinding Method
In addition to the CVD method, the solid grinding method is also an alternative procedure for introducing volatile organometallic precursors into MOFs with no need for vacuum conditions. During grinding at room temperature, the volatile organometallic precursor is sublimated, and the generated vapor readily infiltrates the cavities of the MOF frameworks, resulting in uniform deposition of precursors. The ultrafine metal clusters are finally embedded in the MOF matrix via a reduction process of metal precursors under a H2 atmosphere at a mild temperature (Figure 7E).64
Haruta and co-workers reported the synthesis of several supported Au-cluster catalysts using various MOFs as supports, including MOF-5, HKUST-1 (Cu3(btc)2, btc = benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate), CPL-1 ([Cu2(pzdc)2(pyz)]n, pzdc = pyrazine-2,3-dicarboxylate, pyz = pyrazine), CPL-2 ([Cu2(pzdc)2(bpy)]n, byz = 4,4-bipyridine) and Al-MIL-53 ([Al(OH)(bdc)]n).64 The volatile Au-containing complex dimethyl Au(III) acetylacetonate, with a vapor pressure of 1.1 Pa at room temperature, was selected as the metal precursor. After the solid grinding and subsequent H2 reduction, uniform Au clusters with small sizes (2.2  0.3 and 1.5  0.7 nm) were encapsulated in CPL-2 and Al-MIL-53, respectively (Figure 7F,H). The Au clusters supported on CPL-2, which were fabricated by the CVD method, possessed slightly larger and non-uniform sizes (3.0  1.9 nm) (Figure 7G). In addition, the Au@ZIF-8 and Au@Cd-MOF (Cd2(L)(H2O)·0.5H2O, L = 4,4-(hexafluoroisopropylidence)diphthalate) catalysts were also synthesized with similar methods.65 A series of Au@ZIF-8 catalysts with different Au contents and small sizes were prepared and exhibited excellent activity for the CO catalytic oxidation. Notably, much smaller Au clusters were encaged within a Cd-MOF supports, which were not even observed by HRTEM. The EXAFS data confirmed the presence of Au clusters with an average atom number of 2.5. The hydrophobic channels with -CF3 groups were responsible for the formation of such small Au clusters in the Cd-MOF. Unfortunately, until now, only dimethyl Au(III) acetylacetonate was reported to serve as a volatile precursor in the solid grinding method, which limited its applications. Perhaps, along with the discovery of new feasible volatile precursors in the future, this synthesis method can be expected to lead to the fabrication of more MOF-encaged metal catalysts with small particle sizes and various metal species.
3.2 In Situ Encapsulation Methods
In situ encapsulation during crystallization is another alternative and promising strategy to synthesize MNP-containing MOFs. In this synthesis system, metal species are added to the MOF synthetic gels, and metal clusters are then encapsulated in the MOF matrix during the crystallization. However, in most cases, the metal clusters may suffer from severe agglomeration without any protection during the MOF crystallization process. Moreover, the phase separation of the MOF matrix and metal NPs is also a common and intractable problem for the in situ encapsulation method. Therefore, metal-stabilizing agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are typically needed, which can not only serve as a binder for anchoring metal clusters into MOFs, but can also prevent the separation of MNPs and MOFs. In general, two approaches are used currently: the encapsulation of preformed metal clusters method and the one-pot encapsulation method.
3.2.1 Encapsulation of Preformed Metal Clusters Method
In this synthesis system, small metal clusters protected by stabilizing agents are first synthesized and then introduced into synthetic gels containing MOF building blocks.66 Ideally, the metal clusters serve as nuclei for the formation of MOFs, and metal clusters@MOF composites are finally generated. With this method, the metal clusters can be encapsulated in MOF shells rather than in the cavities of the MOF structure, which can restrict the breakage of the MOF frameworks. Moreover, the size, composition and configuration of encapsulated metal clusters can also be controlled according to practical needs. With this method, coreshell structured metal clusters@MOF catalysts can be synthesized for various types of MOFs, such as ZIF-8,67 UiO-6668 and MIL-101.[6]
Lu et al. reported an effective encapsulation method to incorporate MNPs with various sizes and compositions within ZIF-8 crystals using PVP as a protective agent.[67] Typically, the preformed MNP sols were first mixed with an aqueous solution of PVP, and the PVP-stabilized MNPs were then transferred into the MOF synthetic solution. Because of the surface functionalization with PVP, the size and shape of the MNPs could be easily controlled in the polar solvents during MOF syntheses. Moreover, the spatial distribution of encaged MNPs inside ZIF-8 crystals could also be controlled by adjusting the addition order of PVP-stabilized nanoparticles during the MOF synthesis (Figure 8A). Small Pt clusters with a uniform size of 2.5 nm were encapsulated within ZIF-8 crystals. The Pt loading was calculated as 3.5 wt% by ICP analysis. The resultant Pt@ZIF-8 catalysts exhibited excellent shape-selective catalytic performance for the hydrogenation of n-hexene versus cis-cyclooctene. In contrast, Pt nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes showed indiscriminate catalysis of alkene hydrogenation. Such synthetic strategy could also be extended to the synthesis of other PVP-capped nanomaterials confined within MOFs, such as metal oxides, metal hydroxides and quantum dots.

In addition to PVP, many other surfactants, including 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA),[66] mercaptoacetic acid (MAA),[66] cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB),[66] and polydopamine (PDA),68 have also been deemed excellent binders for stabilizing small MNPs. However, in many cases, the binders are difficult to completely remove and may block some void spaces of MOFs, thereby decreasing the catalytic activity due to limited accessibility of the active sites. Recently, Wang et al. reported a surfactant-free method for the incorporation of Pt NPs within ZIF-8.[67] In the synthesis process, the 2-methyl imidazole played a critical role, acting as both the stabilizer of the NPs and the conjunction linker of ZIF-8. Without an additional reduction procedure or removal of the surfactant, small Pt NPs with a diameter of 2.0 nm were encapsulated within the frameworks of ZIF-8. ICP analysis of the obtained Pt@ZIF-8 gave a Pt loading of 0.74 wt%. The Pt@ZIF-8 catalyst exhibited enhanced catalytic activity, especially shape selectivity in alkene hydrogenation compared with that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the decreased dimensions of the Pt NPs and to the large surface area and nanoporous structure of the ZIF-8.
In addition to using surfactants to stabilize the MNPs, MNPs have also been protected by loading the metal clusters onto polystyrene (PS) and SiO2 spheres, which serve as a core within the MOFs during the crystallization process.[67, 69] With the removal of the cores, the MNPs were located inside the MOF shells. Wang et al. reported a route to prepare surfactant-free Pd NPs in hollow ZIF-8 nanospheres by using PS as a sacrificial template.[67] First, the Pd NPs were supported on PS spheres via an in situ reduction with Sn (II) ions. The ZIF-8 crystals were then grown on the surface of the PS spheres to form a coreshell PS/Pd@ZIF-8. Pd@ZIF-8 hollow nanospheres were finally obtained upon removal of the PS cores with DMF. Through this route, all the Pd nanoparticles were encapsulated within the ZIF-8 hollow nanospheres, which exhibited superior size-selective catalytic properties for the hydrogenation of olefins in the liquid phase. In addition to PS and SiO2 spheres, Cu2O nanoparticles are also frequently used as sacrificial templates for the generation of yolkshell MNPs@MOF catalysts. Huo and co-workers developed a general synthetic strategy for the fabrication of yolkshell nanocrystal@ZIF-8 nanostructures with a Cu2O layer as a sacrificial template.70 Typically, presynthesized Pd nanoparticles were coated onto the surface of Cu2O to form Pd@Cu2O materials. Subsequently, the Pd@Cu2O was mixed with the ZIF-8 precursors in methanol. Interestingly, on the one hand, the Cu2O nanoparticles could assist in the formation of the ZIF-8 shell; on the other hand, the Cu2O nanoparticles could be simultaneously etched by the protons (H+) generated during the formation of ZIF-8. A solution of 3% NH4OH in methanol was used to remove the trace amount of residual Cu2O in the final step. Through this strategy, the size and morphology of the Pd NPs could be well preserved during the coating of the ZIF-8 shell, and the Pd@ZIF-8 yolkshell catalyst showed size selectivity in ethylene hydrogenation versus cyclooctene hydrogenation.
Recently, MOF has been used as the core to synthesize three-layered MOF@MNPs@MOF catalysts. Zhao et al. developed a stepwise assembly strategy to fabricate a series of stable sandwich-like structures of MOF@MNPs@MOFs composites (Figure 8B).[6] The sandwich-like structures contained a layer of Pt NPs with a diameter of 2.8 nm encapsulated between double-layered MIL-101, MOF-525, UiO-66, UiO-67 and MOF-74 with different shell thicknesses. Among these catalysts, MIL-101(Cr)@Pt@MIL-101(Fe) with an ultrathin shell of 2.9 nm exhibited excellent selectivity (95.6%) and conversion (99.8%) for selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde.
3.2.2 One-Step Encapsulation Method
In addition to the abovementioned multistep encapsulation method, the one-step encapsulation method is also an alternative approach to encaging MNPs within MOF crystals. In comparison, the one-step encapsulation method is more simple and straightforward; however, it usually requires specific functional groups in the organic linkers to stabilize the metal precursors.
Tang and co-workers reported a one-step synthesis strategy for the synthesis of coreshell Au@MOF-5 using HAuCl4 as the metal precursor.71 In contrast to the conventional encapsulation method, in which NPs are added, the HAuCl4 solution was directly mixed with the MOF-5 precursor. The generation rates of Au NPs and MOF-5 were effectively controlled through modification of the reaction conditions. The researchers found that the HAuCl4 was first reduced to Au NPs by DMF within a very short time at 140C. Subsequently, MOF-5 was formed gradually and spontaneously grew on the surface of the Au NPs. After the DMF and PVP stabilizer were removed, the uniform coreshell Au@MOF-5 composites with unique surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity toward CO2 were produced. With a similar one-step synthesis, Ke et al. reported bimetallic AgPd NPs confined within MIL-100(Fe) crystals.72 The AgNO3 and Pd(NO3)2 were selected as the metal precursors and were added into MOF synthetic solutions containing PVP and DMF. After the reduction of the metal precursor by DMF and subsequent MOF crystallization at 140 C, the AgPd@Fe-MIL-100(Fe) catalyst was synthesized. The coreshell AgPd@MIL-100(Fe) catalyst showed enhanced catalytic activity over bare AgPd NPs for the dehydrogenation of formic acid in aqueous solution.
In some cases, PVP cannot always prevent the aggregation of MNPs during the one-step synthesis process. Chen et al. developed a novel synthesis strategy to encapsulate Pd NPs inside the cavities of MOFs by using a ligand design prior to the MOF assembly method (Figure 8C).73 The 2,2-bipyride-5,5-dicarboxylic acid was chosen as the ligands to immobilize Pd2+ cation, because the 2,2-bipyride moieties provide anchor sites and their length matches well with that of the bridging ligand, UiO-67 (biphenyldicarboxylic acid). The Pd content of the Pd@UiO-67 catalyst was calculated as 1.0 wt% by ICP analysis, and TEM images revealed a uniform distribution of Pd nanoparticles with a diameter of 3.0 nm. The resultant Pd@UiO-67 catalyst exhibited excellent shape selectivity in olefin hydrogenation reactions, as well as high catalytic activity in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols and the reduction of nitrobenzene.
4 Advanced Structure Characterization Method
A key goal of metal catalyst characterizations is to elucidate the particle size and composition as well as the structure of the nanocatalysts. Some conventional characterization methods, such as HRTEM, hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), have been used to characterize the metal species supported on the nanoporous materials. Meanwhile, the characterizations of the nanoporous supports are essential for a better understanding of the composite catalysts. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and N2/Ar adsorption measurements were frequently used for the phase identification and porosity analysis of the nanoporous supports. Besides the aforementioned measurements, the characterizations for the intrinsic acidity or basicity of nanoporous supports that significantly affect the catalytic properties of metal catalysts with nanoporous supports are also of great importance. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurement by using small basic/acid gas molecules, such as NH3 and CO2, as probe molecules, is a frequently used and powerful method to characterize the acidic/basic strength and concentration. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of sensitive probe molecules (e.g., pyridine and deuterated acetonitrile) is employed to identify the type (such as Lewis or Brnsted acid site) and concentration of acidic sites of nanoporous supports. These measurements can provide some essential information regarding the nanocatalysts, but there remain challenges in the characterizations of the ultrasmall metal NPs encapsulated within crystalline nanoporous materials, because the nanoparticles usually consist of a few atoms and are embedded inside the solid matrices. On the other hand, conventional characterization technologies can rarely provide information on the interaction between MNPs and crystalline nanoporous supports, which can substantially affect the catalytic performance. Hence, powerful characterization techniques are always required for both the crystalline nanoporous materials and encapsulated the metal clusters. Recently, the identification of the composite structures of metal nanoparticles inside nanoporous matrices has become more convenient with the development of incisive physical methods, including novel electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and probed infrared spectroscopy. The combined characterization results obtained by these methods enable researchers to understand composite materials more comprehensively.
4.1 Cs-Corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
TEM is undoubtedly an indispensable tool for materials characterization and provides a great variety of information such as lattice constants, atomic variations in the crystal structure or details of the compositional and chemical environment. However, traditional TEM is less effective than scanning transmission electron microscopy in detecting heavy metal atoms in supports consisting of light elements, such as aluminosilicate zeolites. The images generated using the high-angle scattered electrons in STEM are incoherent, giving a contrast that is strongly dependent on the atomic number Z of the observed atom. With the assistance of aberration correction, the Cs-corrected STEM method now can provide direct imaging and local structural information of individual metal atoms within crystalline nanoporous materials. However, the highly energetic electron beam can cause temporary or permanent damage on the zeolite and MOF frameworks, which limits the imaging of the structure under typical conditions. Careful control of the electron beam current as well as reductions of the accelerating voltage and the exposure time are usually required to obtain high-resolution imaging of MOF structures.
A low-dose imaging technique, originally developed for biological applications, was used in the STEM to minimize the effect of the electron beam on the zeolite structure.74 With this technique, Ortalan et al. successfully determined the locations of individual Ir atoms within the pores of zeolite HY.[74] In addition, the formation of Ir4 and Ir6 clusters was observed after the mononuclear Ir supported catalyst was treated in flowing hydrogen. However, the images recorded using low-dose techniques are noisy and require extensive image processing to provide useful structural information. In contrast, the high-dose images, which were recorded quickly, did not share the limitations of low-dose images and enable allow the characterization of metal nanoclusters in a nanoporous material, without any image processing or simulations. Aydin et al. reported the first example of high-dose imaging of an Ir/NaY catalyst synthesized with an Ir(CO)2(acac) precursor.75 The Cs-corrected STEM images show 17% of the supercages of zeolite NaY are occupied by decarbonylated nanoclusters well approximated as Ir6, which was confirmed by EXAFS spectra. Notably, the aforementioned statements are based on images determined in the first 5 s of exposure of the catalyst to the electron beam; further exposure would cause the destruction of the zeolite framework, leading to a diminished image quality and aggregation of the Ir clusters.
The aberration-corrected STEM technique has been successfully adopted to identify ultrasmall metal clusters and even single atoms in MOF hosts.76 Jiang and co-workers reported the synthesis of abundant Pt single atoms within a stable aluminum-based porphyrinic MOF, formulated as (AlOH)2H2TCPP (H2TCPP = 4,4,4,4-(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetryl)tetrabenzoate), denoted as Al-TCPP.[76] No observable particles were found in the TEM images, due to the resolution limit of the transmission electron microscope. Strikingly, aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images clearly showed single Pt atoms with ultrasmall sizes between 0.1 and 0.2 nm immobilized in the Al-TCPP host. However, the MOF structure was immediately destroyed by the electron beam, thus the locations of metal atoms in the MOF framework were not successfully determined. To solve this problem, many researchers have tried to degrade the MOF structure during TEM imaging, with a different technique, such as Cryo-TEM and a direct-detection electron-counting camera. To date, several studies have reported TEM imaging of some typical MOF materials, including MIL-101, MOF-5, UiO-66, and ZIF-8.77 Recently, Han and co-workers successfully acquired TEM images with direct-detection electron-counting cameras by using low electron doses to retain the ZIF-8 structural integrity.[77] The obtained image involves structural information transferred up to 2.1 Å, enabling the resolution of individual atomic columns of Zn and organic linkers in the framework. The development of advanced instrumental techniques will help researchers to attain location information of metal atoms within the MOF framework.
4.2 X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy
Although TEM images can provide direct imaging of highly dispersed supported metals, they provide only limited information based on the specific local area. XAS, which can acquire more overall structural information, is also essential in characterizing supported metal catalysts. XANES analysis can provide electronic structures of metal species with high sensitivity.[11] Importantly, EXAFS spectroscopy could also determine the nanoparticle size and coordination environment of ultrasmall metal clusters encapsulated in nanoporous materials.[11, 40] In addition, the EXAFS measurements are also a powerful method to confirm the chemical composition of small multimetallic clusters. Otto et al. characterized the bimetallic clusters in Au50Pd50@NaLTA and Pd65Pt35@NaLTA catalysts using EXAFS analyses.[41] The EXAFS results indicated that Au absorbers were coordinated with both Au and Pd atoms, with AuAu and AuPd coordination numbers (NAuAu, NAuPd) of 6  1 and 3.2  0.8, respectively, and NPdPd and NPdAu coordination number of 3.1  0.7 and 5  1, respectively. Such similar numbers of homoatomic and heteroatomic bonds were consistent across all clusters, indicating the absence of segregated metal phases, and the essentially uniform distributions of each metal atom within each cluster. The absence of metalmetal shells in the EXAFS spectra is also strong evidence for the mononuclear of the metal species, which has been commonly used as a complement to atomic-resolution TEM images.[2, 76]
In addition to the aforementioned techniques, high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detection (HERFD) XANES measurements are emerging as a sensitive technique for characterizing the structural and electronic properties of metal species. The in situ HERFD technique is readily applied to demonstrate the signatures of ethylene and CO ligands on Ir centers isolated on zeolite HY78 and coke formation on the Pt/Al2O3 during the dehydrogenation of propane.79 The HERFD-XANES technique is expected to find broader applications in the analyses of catalyst structure and catalytic mechanisms in the future.
4.3 Probed Infrared Spectroscopy
Infrared spectroscopy is a valuable, readily applied technique for the determination of the nuclearity of supported metal species with an adsorbed probe molecule. CO is an appealing probe molecule, not only because CO is a reactant in CO oxidation, but also because νCO spectra provide detailed information about the structure, coordination, and oxidation states of the metal species. Mihaylov et al. characterized the state of Au in Au/NaY using IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO as a probe molecule.80 IR spectra of CO at room temperature showed an intense band at 2147 cm1, which was assigned to Auδ+CO species. The result indicated predominantly zero-valent Au nanoclusters, and Auδ+ sites represent Au+ ions located on the surfaces of metal clusters. The spectra also indicate a small number of Au3+ sites (2207 and 2183 cm1) in Au/NaY.
Terminal metal carbonyl bands characterize both mono- and multinuclear metal species; however, bridging carbonyl bands are mostly limited to samples with neighboring metal centers.81 Therefore, this technique offers a fast and valuable characterization method to directly identify single atoms from nanoparticles, when bridging carbonyl ligands that indicate neighboring metal centers are absent.[76, 82] For example, Jiang and co-workers characterized the abundant Pt single atoms supported in the MOF host (Al-TCPP) with IR spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule.[76] The IR spectra showed only a peak centered at 2090 cm1, without bands in the range 20802030 and 19201950 cm1, indicating the uniform structure of the single Pt atom.
5 Perspective and Conclusion
In the past decade, various synthetic methods for encapsulating ultrasmall MNPs in crystalline nanoporous materials have been developed. These obtained materials as high-performance heterogeneous catalyst materials are widely used in various heterogeneous catalytic reactions. However, despite the great progress achieved in this field, exploring more novel and facile approaches to precisely control the sizes and distributions of the MNPs anchored in crystalline nanoporous materials is highly desirable. In recent years, single-atom catalysts with isolated atomic dispersion of metal species have attracted great attention in heterogeneous catalysis due to the substantially enhanced utilization of metal atoms. Single atoms have been successfully anchored to metal oxides, metal surfaces, and even to MOFs and derived carbon materials. However, the synthesis of single-atom catalysts is still rarely achieved using zeolites as supports. In view of the superior stability of zeolites among the crystalline nanoporous materials, especially under harsh conditions, developing new methods for the preparation of single-atom-supported zeolites is highly meaningful and challenging. In addition, considering the great advantages of both single-atom and hybrid multimetallic catalysts, the fabrication of individual hybrid atoms supported nanoporous catalysts seems more attractive, and the excellent performance is also expected from these catalysts with more accessible multicomponent active sites. On the other hand, the metal loadings of the catalysts are also a critical factor and concern for achieving excellent catalytic performance and practical applications. In many cases, the highly dispersed metal clusters located on/in the supports depend on extremely low metal contents (usually less than 1%). When the metal loading increases, the severe aggregation of metal species will occur. The generation of ultrasmall metal supported on crystalline nanoporous materials with both a high metal loading and uniform dispersion remains a challenge in future studies.
Recent studies have mainly focused on the synthesis of ultrasmall noble MNPs such as Au, Pt, Pd, Ru, and Rh immobilized on crystalline nanoporous materials. In contrast, reports about ultrasmall non-noble MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous materials are rare because the non-noble MNPs are more active, easily aggregate, and grow larger under the reaction and reduction conditions. However, compared with noble metals, the non-noble metals, especially first-row transition metals (Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni), are not only less expensive, but also exhibit excellent catalytic activities in various industrial reactions, such as the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides, ammonia synthesis, and FischerTropsch synthesis. Thus, it is also a challenge to exploit more methods for the synthesis of non-noble-metal-based catalysts supported on crystalline nanoporous materials. Recently, a series of metals supported on hierarchically porous catalysts have been synthesized via bottom-up and top-down methods. These catalysts can take advantage of both the shape selectivity of micropores and transport efficiency of the mesoporous materials. Most importantly, the mesopores in the hierarchical supports can act as nanospaces to accommodate small MNPs, greatly restraining the free migration of metal species and, consequently, preventing severe sintering at high temperatures. In the future, this synthetic strategy may be a promising route for the designed synthesis of small MNPs with controllable particle size through adjustment of the hierarchical structures.
In addition, taking advantage of the synergistic effect between MNPs and crystalline nanoporous supports to significantly enhance catalytic performance is a very important and attractive issue for MNPs supported by nanoporous catalysts. In many previous works, the crystalline nanoporous materials have served as supports for the stabilization of MNPs by utilization of their permanent porosity and tunable pore sizes. Excellent shape-selective performances have been achieved with these MNPs supported on nanoporous catalysts in some catalytic reactions. However, using the shape-selective feature of nanoporous supports is insufficient. Further developing and exploiting additional properties of nanoporous supports, such as the acidity, alkalinity and redox potential of zeolites, and even the photoelectric properties of MOFs, combined with anchored MNPs, to realize excellent synergetic effects and tandem catalysis is highly significant, fascinating, and challenging. Notably, the novel synergetic effects between MNPs and crystalline nanoporous supports may also bring new catalytic processes for old reactions and even brand-new catalytic reactions.
Finally, advances in materials science can never be separated from the constant innovation and progress in characterization methods. Advanced characterization technologies along with computational simulations and predictions based on DFT calculation will play an increasingly important role in scientific research in the future because they can provide more atomic-scale evidence of catalyst structures and catalytic reaction mechanisms, as well as interface effect and electron transfer among different metal species and supports. Atomic-resolution electron microscopy techniques, such as Cs-corrected STEM and HAADF-STEM, have become essential and important tools to characterize the size distributions and locations of ultrasmall metallic species inside crystalline nanoporous supports. However, crystalline nanoporous materials are typically unstable in the electron beam and are easily damaged, often before images can be obtained. Further improvements in STEM are expected to lead to the acquisition of high-quality electron microscope images that providing more structural details, even details of metalsupport interactions without destroying the catalyst. High-energy-resolution XAFS is also emerging as a sensitive technique for the future for characterization of the detailed coordination environment of atoms, which can provide more structural information beneficial for the modeling of theoretical calculations. Moreover, in situ characterization technique, such as IR, EXAFS, and HRTEM, will continue to be very important and powerful methods for studying catalytic reaction processes and mechanisms. These characterization methods can help us to capture more useful reaction intermediates and provide reactive information that can lead to a better understanding of the essence of reactions at the molecular or atomic level.
Thus far, ultrasmall NMPs supported on crystalline nanoporous catalysts have played increasing important roles in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. To meet the emerging demands for various practical applications, more novel and facile synthesis strategies are highly desirable to precisely fabricate the metal clusters and single atom in the crystalline nanoporous supports. In the field of materials synthesis, the constant innovation of synthetic concepts and methods is always an inexhaustible source of sustained progress. Moreover, in the future, interdisciplinary integration, which may provide new perspectives for exploiting more important and valuable industrial reactions using MNPs supported on nanoporous catalysts, should be considered. We hope that this progress report will shed some light on the synthesis of ultrasmall MNPs supported on crystalline nanoporous catalysts. Because of the ceaseless efforts of researchers toward the current challenges, we firmly believe that ultrasmall NMPs supported on nanoporous catalyst must have an extremely bright future.
