[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[3] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability, which makes the process not only complex but also expensive."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production to address supply shortfalls from conventional cracking methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the oil-based feedstocks used in conventional crackers.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH can potentially offer higher efficiency compared to cracking methods that produce multiple products.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is more selective towards propylene production compared to cracking processes.

However, PDH also faces challenges, including:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Coking leads to catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration.

2. Complexity and cost: The need for catalyst regeneration adds complexity and cost to the process.

3. Selectivity issues: Cracking reactions can still occur, affecting product selectivity.

While PDH technology shows promise in addressing feedstock availability and potentially improving process efficiency and selectivity, ongoing research aims to overcome the challenges associated with catalyst stability and process economics.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许针对性地生产丙烯，以解决传统裂解方法的供应短缺问题。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统裂解装置使用的基于石油的原料更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH可能比生产多种产品的裂解方法提供更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：与裂解工艺相比，PDH对丙烯生产的选择性更高。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战，包括：

1. 催化剂失活：结焦导致催化剂失活，需要频繁再生。

2. 复杂性和成本：催化剂再生的需求增加了工艺的复杂性和成本。

3. 选择性问题：裂解反应仍可能发生，影响产品选择性。

虽然PDH技术在解决原料可用性方面显示出希望，并有可能提高工艺效率和选择性，但持续的研究旨在克服与催化剂稳定性和工艺经济性相关的挑战。
