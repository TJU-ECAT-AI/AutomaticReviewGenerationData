[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[3] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is promising for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. It directly addresses the propylene supply shortfall from conventional crackers like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

2. It is an on-purpose technology specifically designed to produce propylene, unlike conventional methods that produce it as a byproduct.

3. It allows for better control of product selectivity compared to cracking processes.

4. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than the naphtha or ethane used in steam cracking.

5. It can potentially offer better process efficiency as a dedicated propylene production method.

However, PDH still faces challenges related to catalyst coking and stability that need to be addressed to improve its commercial viability. Overall, PDH provides a more targeted and flexible approach to meet growing propylene demand compared to conventional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术之所以成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法，主要有以下几个关键优势：

1. 它直接解决了传统裂解装置（如流化催化裂化FCC）丙烯供应短缺的问题。

2. 它是一种专门设计用于生产丙烯的定向技术，不同于将丙烯作为副产品的传统方法。

3. 与裂解工艺相比，它能更好地控制产品选择性。

4. 它使用丙烷作为原料，比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油或乙烷更容易获得。

5. 作为一种专门的丙烯生产方法，它可能提供更好的工艺效率。

然而，PDH仍然面临着与催化剂结焦和稳定性相关的挑战，需要解决这些问题以提高其商业可行性。总的来说，与传统生产方法相比，PDH提供了一种更有针对性和灵活性的方法来满足不断增长的丙烯需求。
