<quotes>

[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[3] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively. Thus, the deactivated catalyst must frequently be regenerated without losing dehydrogenation activity, selectivity to propylene and catalyst stability, which makes the process not only complex but also expensive."

</quotes>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production to address supply shortfalls from conventional cracking methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the oil-based feedstocks used in conventional crackers.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH can potentially offer higher efficiency compared to cracking methods that produce multiple products.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is more selective towards propylene production compared to cracking processes.

However, PDH also faces challenges, including:

1. Catalyst deactivation: Coking leads to catalyst deactivation, requiring frequent regeneration.

2. Complexity and cost: The need for catalyst regeneration adds complexity and cost to the process.

3. Selectivity issues: Cracking reactions can still occur, affecting product selectivity.

While PDH technology shows promise in addressing feedstock availability and potentially improving process efficiency and selectivity, ongoing research aims to overcome the challenges associated with catalyst stability and process economics.
