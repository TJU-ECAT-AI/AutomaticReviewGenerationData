[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[3] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. It directly addresses the shortfall in propylene supply from conventional production methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

2. It is an on-purpose technology specifically designed to produce propylene, allowing for better control over production volumes.

3. It can utilize propane feedstock, which is increasingly available due to the shale gas boom in some regions.

4. It offers potentially higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional cracking processes.

5. It allows for more flexibility in production capacity and can be scaled according to market demand.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges related to catalyst coking and stability, which can impact product selectivity and process efficiency. Ongoing research aims to develop improved catalysts and process designs to address these issues and further enhance the advantages of PDH technology for propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术已成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法，具有以下几个主要优势：

1. 它直接解决了传统生产方法（如流化催化裂化FCC）丙烯供应不足的问题。

2. 它是一种专门设计用于生产丙烯的定向技术，可以更好地控制生产量。

3. 它可以利用丙烷原料，而在某些地区，由于页岩气热潮，丙烷的供应量越来越大。

4. 与传统的裂解工艺相比，它可能提供更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 它在生产能力方面提供了更大的灵活性，可以根据市场需求进行规模调整。

然而，PDH技术仍面临着与催化剂结焦和稳定性相关的挑战，这可能影响产品选择性和工艺效率。正在进行的研究旨在开发改进的催化剂和工艺设计，以解决这些问题，并进一步增强PDH技术在丙烯生产方面的优势。
