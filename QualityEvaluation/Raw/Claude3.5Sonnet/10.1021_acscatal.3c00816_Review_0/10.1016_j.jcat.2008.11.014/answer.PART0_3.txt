[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[3] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the propylene supply shortfall from conventional cracking methods.

2. It is an on-purpose technology specifically designed for propylene production.

3. It can utilize propane feedstock, which may be more readily available than other feedstocks.

4. It has the potential for higher propylene selectivity compared to cracking processes.

However, PDH also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst coking and stability. The technology requires careful catalyst design and operating conditions to maximize efficiency and selectivity while minimizing deactivation. Overall, PDH provides a more targeted and potentially more efficient route to propylene production compared to conventional methods, making it promising for meeting growing propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 它直接解决了传统裂解方法丙烯供应短缺的问题。

2. 它是专门为丙烯生产设计的定向技术。

3. 它可以利用可能比其他原料更容易获得的丙烷原料。

4. 与裂解工艺相比，它有可能获得更高的丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH也面临挑战，特别是在催化剂结焦和稳定性方面。该技术需要精心设计催化剂和操作条件，以最大限度地提高效率和选择性，同时最小化失活。总的来说，与传统方法相比，PDH提供了一种更有针对性和潜在更高效的丙烯生产路线，使其在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面具有前景。
