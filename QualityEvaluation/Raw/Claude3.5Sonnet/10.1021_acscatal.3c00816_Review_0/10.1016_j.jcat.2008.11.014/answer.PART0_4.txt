[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) is one of the on-purpose propylene production technologies that has received much attention in the recent past due to it's potential to make-up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers (e.g., FCC)"

[2] "Propylene is an important building block in a myriad of (petro)chemical applications, for instance in the production of polypropylene"

[3] "Typically, the CrOxAl2O3 catalyst system is used for industrial processes, for example in the Catofin process (ABB Lummus) that runs at cyclic operation (reaction and regeneration) at 850 K"

[4] "However, major challenges associated with this catalytic system are cracking and coking which influence the product selectivity and catalyst stability, respectively."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production to address supply shortfalls from conventional crackers like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha or ethane used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to propylene compared to cracking processes that produce multiple products.

4. Higher selectivity: While challenges remain, PDH can potentially offer higher propylene selectivity compared to cracking processes.

5. Scalability: PDH units can be built at various scales to meet specific market demands.

6. Independence from refinery operations: Unlike FCC, PDH is not tied to refinery operations, allowing for more flexible production.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and coking issues. Ongoing research aims to improve catalyst performance and process efficiency to further enhance the advantages of PDH technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性地生产丙烯，以解决来自传统裂解装置（如流化催化裂化FCC）的供应短缺。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解使用的石脑油或乙烷，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：与产生多种产品的裂解工艺相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。

4. 更高的选择性：尽管仍面临挑战，但PDH potentially可以提供比裂解工艺更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 可扩展性：PDH装置可以按不同规模建造，以满足特定的市场需求。

6. 独立于炼油厂操作：与FCC不同，PDH不依赖于炼油厂的操作，允许更灵活的生产。

然而，PDH技术仍面临挑战，特别是在催化剂稳定性和结焦问题方面。持续的研究旨在改进催化剂性能和提高工艺效率，以进一步增强PDH技术在满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求方面的优势。
