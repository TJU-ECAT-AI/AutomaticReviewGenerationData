[1] "Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas"

[2] "PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion"

[3] "However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Utilization of abundant propane feedstock from shale gas exploration, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. High propane conversion rates achieved through high-temperature reactions (>550°C), improving process efficiency.

3. Direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering better product selectivity compared to conventional methods.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in maintaining high propylene selectivity due to undesired side reactions at high temperatures. The development of catalysts that can improve selectivity while maintaining high conversion rates is crucial for addressing these challenges and making PDH the most promising method for propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 利用页岩气勘探产生的丰富丙烷原料，解决了原料供应的挑战。

2. 通过高温反应(>550°C)实现高丙烷转化率，提高了工艺效率。

3. 直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与传统方法相比可能提供更好的产品选择性。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在高温下由于不期望的副反应而难以保持高丙烯选择性。开发能够在保持高转化率的同时提高选择性的催化剂对于解决这些挑战并使PDH成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法至关重要。
