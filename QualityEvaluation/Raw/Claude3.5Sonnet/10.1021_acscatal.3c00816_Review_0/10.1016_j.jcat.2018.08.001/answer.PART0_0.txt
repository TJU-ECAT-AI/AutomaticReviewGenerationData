[1] "Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas"

[2] "PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion"

[3] "However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of PDH to conventional propylene production methods or discuss its key advantages in detail. However, it does mention some aspects of PDH:

1. PDH has gained renewed interest due to increased propane availability from shale gas exploration, suggesting an advantage in feedstock availability.

2. PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene at high temperatures (>550°C).

3. The process faces challenges with selectivity, as high temperatures also promote unwanted side reactions like cracking and coking.

The document does not provide sufficient information to fully address the advantages of PDH in terms of process efficiency or how it comprehensively compares to conventional methods. More context would be needed to fully answer the question as posed.

文献没有全面比较PDH与传统丙烯生产方法,也没有详细讨论其主要优势。但是,它确实提到了PDH的一些方面:

1. 由于页岩气勘探使得丙烷供应增加,PDH重新引起了人们的关注,这表明它在原料供应方面具有优势。

2. PDH允许在高温(>550°C)下直接将丙烷转化为丙烯。

3. 该过程在选择性方面面临挑战,因为高温也会促进不需要的副反应,如裂解和结焦。

该文档没有提供足够的信息来全面解决PDH在工艺效率方面的优势,或者它如何全面地与传统方法进行比较。需要更多的背景信息才能完整回答所提出的问题。
