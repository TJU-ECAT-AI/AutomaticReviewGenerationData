[1] "Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas"

[2] "PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion"

[3] "However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity"

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the available information, PDH has drawn renewed attention due to increasing propane supply from shale gas exploration, which addresses the challenge of feedstock availability. The process requires high temperatures (>550°C) for high propane conversion, indicating its potential for high efficiency. However, the high temperature also leads to undesired side reactions, which can result in low propylene selectivity. This suggests that while PDH offers advantages in terms of feedstock availability and potentially high conversion rates, it still faces challenges in terms of product selectivity that need to be addressed for it to be considered the most promising method for propylene production.

文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术相比传统生产方法的关键优势的问题。然而，根据可用信息，由于页岩气勘探带来的丙烷供应增加，PDH技术引起了renewed关注，这解决了原料可用性的挑战。该过程需要高温(>550°C)以实现高丙烷转化率，表明其具有高效率的潜力。但是，高温也会导致不期望的副反应，从而可能导致丙烯选择性低。这表明，虽然PDH在原料可用性和潜在的高转化率方面具有优势，但在产品选择性方面仍面临需要解决的挑战，才能被认为是最有前景的丙烯生产方法。
