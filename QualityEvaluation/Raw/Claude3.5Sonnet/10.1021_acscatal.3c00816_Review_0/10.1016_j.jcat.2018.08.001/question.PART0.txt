Effect of group IB metals on the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over anti-sintering Pt/MgAl2O4
Highlights
•
Pt/MgAl2O4 is thermally stable during propane dehydrogenation and coke combustion.
•
Cu and Ag promote the catalytic activity of Pt/MgAl2O4 for propane dehydrogenation.
•
Cu and Ag diluted Pt surface atoms with enriched electron are more active.
•
Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 integrates high activity and stability by forming stable Pt-Cu alloy.
Abstract
Anti-sintering platinum-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is promising to avoid corrosive oxychlorination re-dispersion of sintered Pt during coke combustion. Herein, we report an anti-sintering Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst and optimizations on its activity for PDH with group IB metals (Cu, Ag and Au). Using a suite of characterizations including BET, H2 chemisorption, XRD, STEM, CO-DRIFTs, XANES, XPS, TG/DTA, TPO, C3H6-TPD and TPSR of C3H6 with H2, we reveal that Cu and Ag dilute the surface Pt atoms and donate electron to Pt while the case for Pt-Au is inverse. As a result, significant enhancements in propane conversion and propylene selectivity were obtained on the Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 and Pt-Ag/MgAl2O4 catalysts. The Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 exhibited excellent C3H6 yield and regeneration stability, presumably due to the formation of intermetallic compounds and little phase segregation during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration runs.

1. Introduction
Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
. PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion
[4]
. However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity
[3]
. Supported platinum based catalysts are highly active for PDH while susceptible to deactivation by coke deposition
[5]
. Frequent regenerations of deactivated catalyst by coke combustion are required in practice during which irreversible sintering of highly dispersed Pt species occurs under the high-temperature and oxidizing conditions
[6]
,
[7]
. Oxychlorination is usually adopted to re-disperse the sintered Pt particles while which causes severe equipment corrosion
[8]
. Thus, anti-sintering Pt based catalyst that is stable during cyclic coke combustion and no need of oxychlorination regeneration is highly desired as coke deposition seems thermodynamically inevitable under PDH operation conditions
[5]
.
Extensive efforts on optimizing support materials and modulating electronic property of Pt have been performed to improve the catalysts stability and propylene selectivity. Based on the discovery that coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ centers are anchoring sites for Pt
[9]
, Shi et al.
[10]
prepared raft-like Pt-Sn clusters over pentacoordinate Al3+ ions rich Al2O3 nanosheet that exhibits much better durability than conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst under relatively low propane partial pressure. By introducing Pt during the synthesis of γ-Al2O3 via sol-gel chemistry, Im et al.
[7]
constructed partially entrapped Pt@γ-Al2O3 structure which has improved regeneration stability in twenty consecutive regeneration cycles. Confining Pt in the channels of Na-[Fe]ZSM5 zeolite built selective and stable catalyst for dehydrogenation of diluted propane
[11]
. Doping Al2O3 with Mg or Zn and forming MgAl2O4 or ZnAl2O4 spinel enhances the capability of stabilizing Pt during PDH reactions,
[12]
,
[13]
presumably because the formation of epitaxial lattice matched metal-oxide interfacial structure at (111) between Pt and spinel
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
. Sn is a typical additive that can increase Pt dispersion by forming Pt-Sn alloy
[17]
and can also serve as nucleation sites to redisperse sintered Pt during regeneration process
[6]
. Some oxides like CeO2 and PdO are able to trap volatile PtO2 at high temperatures, benefiting the stabilization and regeneration of Pt
[18]
,
[19]
. In addition to serving as structural stabilizers, the additives, such as Sn
[6]
,
[20]
, Ga
[2]
,
[21]
and Zn
[22]
,
[23]
, also modulate the electronic properties of Pt to improve the propylene selectivity when they are in metallic state and forming alloy with Pt
[24]
,
[25]
. Group IB metals (Cu, Ag and Au) which have much stronger metallic character are also candidates as modulators
[26]
. Han et al.
[27]
presented that Cu can well interact with Pt and improve the propylene selectivity of Pt/Al2O3 by weakening the adsorption of propylene on Pt. Different electronic modulating effects of group IB metals have been demonstrated on Pd which indeed adjusted the adsorption strength of ethylene
[28]
,
[29]
. With our recent advance in improving the stabilization efficiency of Pt over MgAl2O4,
[14]
,
[15]
further modulating the electronic property of anti-sintering Pt/MgAl2O4 would be promising for constructing highly durable and selective PDH catalysts.
In this work, we report the preparation of highly stable and active PDH catalysts by integrating the stabilization capability of MgAl2O4 and the electronic modulation effect of group IB metals on Pt. We demonstrated that the Pt/MgAl2O4 catalyst indeed exhibited excellent regeneration stability during cyclic dehydrogenation-regeneration operations albeit the propylene selectivity was inferior. With addition of Cu, Ag and Au, the stable yields of propylene are all improved with the propylene selectivity in an order of Pt-Cu>Pt-Ag>Pt>Pt-Au. Meanwhile, the regeneration stability is further enhanced after group IB metals modification, especially for Pt-Cu/MgAl2O4 sample. We further provide insight on the influence of group IB metals on the catalyst structure and catalytic behaviour by using a suite of characterization techniques.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
MgAl2O4 support was prepared by hydrolysis of aluminum isopropoxide with magnesium nitrate hexahydrate in ethanol as previously reported
[14]
. γ-Al2O3 (>99.5%) was purchased from Shandong Aluminum Industry. Incipient wetness impregnation method was adopted for the catalyst preparation. 3.0g of MgAl2O4 or γ-Al2O3 was impregnated in aqueous H2PtCl66H2O (>99.99%, Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd) solution containing Pt of 0.030g under room temperature for 24h. Impregnated samples were dried at 60C overnight and then calcined in ambient air at 500C for 5h with a heating rate of 5 oC·min1. Pt/MgAl2O4 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were obtained after reduction of the calcined samples in flowing H2 at 600C for 2h.
2.1.2. Synthesis of M/MgAl2O4 (M=Cu, Ag and Au) and Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts
M/MgAl2O4 (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts with 1wt% were also prepared for comparison via the same procedures to preparing Pt/MgAl2O4. The precursors are Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (>99.5%, Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd), AgNO3 (>99.8%, Tianjin Tiangan Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd) and HAuCl4·4H2O (>99.99%, Tianjin Fengchuan Chemical Reagent Technologies Co., Ltd), respectively. Incipient wetness co-impregnation method was applied for the synthesizing Pt-M/MgAl2O4 (M=Cu, Ag and Au) catalysts by using H2PtCl6·6H2O/Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (>99.99%, Alfa Aesar)/AgNO3 and H2PtCl6·6H2O/HAuCl4·4H2O as corresponding precursors. The nominal weight loadings of Pt and M were both 1.0wt% and the real contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Similar impregnation and thermal treatment procedures to preparing Pt/MgAl2O4 were conducted to synthesize Pt-M/MgAl2O4 catalysts.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Surface areas were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 using N2 adsorption isotherms and BET analysis method. All of the samples were degassed under vacuum at 300C for 5h before the adsorption measurements.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a PANalytical PW3040/60 X Pert PRO diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15432nm), operating at 40kV and 40mA.
The actual contents of the metals in these samples were determined by using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) on an IRIS intrepid II XSP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation).
High resolution TEM analysis was performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F operated at 200keV with a specified point-to-point resolution of 0.19nm and a lattice resolution of 0.10nm. This instrument is equipped with a high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) detector and the resolution is 0.2nm. TEM specimens were prepared by depositing a suspension of the powdered sample on a lacey carbon-coated copper or nickel (for cupper containing samples) grid. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was performed by an Oxford Instruments ISIS/INCA energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system with an Oxford Pentafet Ultrathin Window (UTW) Detector in HAADF-STEM mode.
Pt dispersions were measured by pulse adsorption of H2 on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 automated characterization system at 50C. Approximately 50mg of the sample was loaded in a U-shaped quartz tube and heated to 600C for 30min under pure H2 of 30mL·min1, and then switched to pure Ar of 30mL·min1 for 1h before cooled to 50C. H2 pulse (10vol% H2/Ar) was introduced by switching the six-way valve. Pt dispersions were estimated by assuming the adsorption stoichiometry of H2 to Pt to be 0.5.
IR spectra were collected in a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) mode using a Bruker EQUINOX 55 spectrometer, equipped with an MCT detector and operated at a resolution of 4cm1 for 64 scans. Before each experiment, the sample (40mg) was reduced in situ in pure H2 at 500C in a DRIFTs cell (HC-500, Pike technologies). Then under flowing He, the temperature was cooled to 30C and hold for 60min. After that, a background spectrum was recorded for the sample, which was then subtracted automatically from the subsequent spectra. The corresponding gas for CO adsorption (10vol% CO/He) was introduced into the reaction cell consequently and the spectrum was recorded as a function of time until saturation. He was then switched on to purge the gaseous CO. All the total flow rates involved were 20mL·min1.
X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pt L3-edge was collected at the beamline 14W of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) in China. The output beam was selected by Si(111) monochromator. Energy calibration was undertaken by using Pt foil. The spectra were recorded at room temperature under the fluorescence mode with a solid-state detector. Prior to the experiments, the samples were reduced at 600C for 2h. After it was cooled to room temperature, the reactor was evacuated and transferred to the glove box without exposure to air. Then, all of the samples were sealed in Kapton films in the glove box. The Athena software package was used for the data analysis.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected using a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250 spectrometer with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6eV) and an applied power of 150W. C1s (binding energy 284.6eV) was used as the reference.
Thermal gravity (TG) analysis was performed on a TGA Q600 (TA Instruments). Approximately 15mg of sample was placed in an alumina crucible and heated at a rate of 10C·min1 in air atmosphere (flow rate: 100mL·min1) up to 850C.
Raman spectra of the spent catalysts were collected on a LabRAM HR 800 Raman spectrometer with a 532cm1 Ar-ion laser beam. Data acquisition was conducted with exposure time of 10s and 5 accumulations.
Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of adsorbed C3H6 with H2 experiments were performed on Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 apparatus equipped with on-line mass spectroscopy (Cirrus II, MKS). Typically, 100mg catalyst was pretreated under H2 at 600C for 1h and then purged with He for 1h. C3H6 adsorption was conducted by flowing C3H6 (99.99vol%, 20mL·min1) through the catalyst bed at 50C for 0.5h. After purging with He for 0.5h, 10vol% H2/He was introduced and the temperature was elevated to 800C at a rate of 10 oC·min1. The signals of H2 (m/z=2), C3H6 (m/z=42), C3H8 (m/z=44), C2H4 (m/z=28), C2H6 (m/z=30) and CH4 (m/z=16) were monitored during experiments.
C3H6 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis was performed on HIDEN ANALYTICAL CATLAB (CATLAB-A7, Hiden Analytical) at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 100mg catalyst was pretreated under H2 at 600C for 1h and then purged with He for 1h before cooling to 50C. C3H6 (99.99vol%, 20mL·min1) was then introduced on the catalysts at 50C for 0.5h and purged with He for 0.5h. C3H6 TPD analysis was performed under He with temperature rate of 10 oC·min1 and the signals of H2 (m/z=2), C3H6 (m/z=42), C3H8 (m/z=44), C2H4 (m/z=28) and C2H6 (m/z=30) were collected.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were carried out on Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 apparatus equipped with on-line mass spectroscopy (Cirrus II, MKS). The spent catalysts were pretreated at 150C for 1h in He to remove adsorbed moisture. After cooling down to 50C, the samples were then heated from 50C to 850C in 2vol% O2/He at a rate of 10 oC·min1. The signals of O2 (m/z=32), CO2 (m/z=44), CO (m/z=28) and H2O (m/z=18) were collected.
