[1] "Production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has drawn renewed attention with increasing propane supply from vast exploration of shale gas"

[2] "PDH is a highly endothermic reaction so that high reaction temperature (>550C) is essential for high propane conversion"

[3] "However, high temperature also favors undesired reactions, such as cracking, hydro-cracking and coking which result in low propylene selectivity"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It utilizes the increasing supply of propane from shale gas exploration, addressing feedstock availability challenges.

2. It allows for high propane conversion due to the high reaction temperatures used.

3. It is a direct, one-step process for converting propane to propylene, which can improve process efficiency compared to more complex multi-step methods.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges in terms of product selectivity, as the high temperatures required can lead to undesired side reactions like cracking and coking. The literature does not provide direct comparisons to conventional production methods, so further advantages in efficiency or selectivity cannot be definitively stated based on the given information.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它利用了页岩气勘探带来的丙烷供应增加，解决了原料供应的挑战。

2. 由于采用高反应温度，它可以实现高丙烷转化率。

3. 它是将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的一步法，与更复杂的多步法相比，可以提高工艺效率。

然而，PDH技术在产品选择性方面也面临挑战，因为所需的高温可能导致裂解和结焦等不良副反应。文献中没有提供与传统生产方法的直接比较，因此无法根据给定信息明确说明在效率或选择性方面的进一步优势。
