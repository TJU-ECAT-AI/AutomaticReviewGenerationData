[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block in petrochemical industry, which could be used for the synthesis of various chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile etc"

[2] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[3] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High propylene selectivity: PDH provides higher propylene selectivity compared to conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Feedstock availability: With the development of shale gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies, propane has become more abundant and cheaper, making it an ideal feedstock for PDH.

3. Energy efficiency: PDH addresses the high energy consumption issues associated with conventional production methods like FCC and steam cracking.

4. Meeting growing demand: Unlike conventional methods, PDH has the potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene.

5. Versatility: Propylene produced through PDH can be used in the synthesis of various valuable chemicals, including polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology offers a more efficient, selective, and economically viable solution for propylene production compared to conventional methods.
