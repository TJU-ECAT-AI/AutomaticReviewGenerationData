[1] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[2] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High propylene selectivity: PDH can produce propylene with much higher selectivity compared to conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of shale gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies has made propane, the raw material for PDH, more abundant and cheaper.

3. Lower energy consumption: Unlike FCC and steam cracking, which suffer from high energy consumption, PDH is likely to be more energy-efficient.

4. Meeting increasing demand: Conventional methods are struggling to meet the growing global demand for propylene, while PDH has the potential to address this shortfall.

5. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to the multi-step processes involved in FCC and steam cracking.

These advantages allow PDH to specifically address the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing more readily available feedstock, improving process efficiency, and significantly enhancing product selectivity, all while potentially reducing energy consumption and meeting the increasing global demand for propylene.
