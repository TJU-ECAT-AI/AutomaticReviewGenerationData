[1] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[2] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High propylene selectivity: PDH can produce propylene with much higher selectivity compared to conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of shale gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies has made propane, the raw material for PDH, more abundant and cheaper.

3. Lower energy consumption: Unlike FCC and steam cracking, which suffer from high energy consumption, PDH is likely to be more energy-efficient.

4. Meeting increasing demand: Conventional methods are struggling to meet the growing global demand for propylene, while PDH has the potential to address this shortfall.

5. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to the multi-step processes involved in FCC and steam cracking.

These advantages allow PDH to specifically address the challenges of conventional production methods by utilizing more readily available feedstock, improving process efficiency, and significantly enhancing product selectivity, all while potentially reducing energy consumption and meeting the increasing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 高丙烯选择性：与传统的流化催化裂化（FCC）和石脑油蒸汽裂解相比，PDH可以生产选择性更高的丙烯。

2. 原料可用性：页岩气和天然气水合物提取技术的发展使得PDH的原料丙烷变得更加丰富和便宜。

3. 较低的能耗：与能耗高的FCC和蒸汽裂解不同，PDH可能更加节能。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：传统方法难以满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，而PDH有潜力解决这一短缺问题。

5. 过程效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，与FCC和蒸汽裂解涉及的多步骤过程相比，可能提供更高的效率。

这些优势使PDH能够具体解决传统生产方法的挑战，通过利用更容易获得的原料，提高过程效率，显著提高产品选择性，同时可能减少能源消耗并满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求。
