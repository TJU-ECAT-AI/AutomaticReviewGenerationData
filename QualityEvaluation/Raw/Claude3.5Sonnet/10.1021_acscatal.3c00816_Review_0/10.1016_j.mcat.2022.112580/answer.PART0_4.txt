[1] "Propylene is a vital and basic building block in petrochemical industry, which could be used for the synthesis of various chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile etc"

[2] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[3] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High propylene selectivity: PDH can produce propylene with much higher selectivity compared to conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking.

2. Feedstock availability: With the development of shale gas and natural gas hydrate extraction technologies, propane has become more abundant and cheaper, making PDH more economically viable.

3. Energy efficiency: Conventional methods like FCC and steam cracking suffer from high energy consumption, while PDH is generally more energy-efficient.

4. Meeting growing demand: Traditional production methods are unable to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, whereas PDH offers a dedicated route to produce propylene in larger quantities.

5. Flexibility: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, giving producers more control over output based on market demands.

These advantages directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability (utilizing abundant propane), process efficiency (lower energy consumption), and product selectivity (higher propylene yield).

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 高丙烯选择性：与流化催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比，PDH可以生产出选择性更高的丙烯。

2. 原料可用性：随着页岩气和天然气水合物开采技术的发展，丙烷变得更加丰富且价格更低，使PDH在经济上更加可行。

3. 能源效率：FCC和蒸汽裂解等传统方法能耗高，而PDH通常更加节能。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：传统生产方法无法满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，而PDH提供了一种专门的路线来大量生产丙烯。

5. 灵活性：PDH允许按需生产丙烯，使生产商能够根据市场需求更好地控制产量。

这些优势直接解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性（利用丰富的丙烷）、工艺效率（较低的能耗）和产品选择性（更高的丙烯产率）方面面临的挑战。
