[1] "Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene."

[2] "In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High propylene selectivity: PDH can produce propylene with much higher selectivity compared to conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of shale gas and natural gas hydrate extraction has made propane more abundant and cheaper, providing a readily available feedstock for PDH.

3. Lower energy consumption: Unlike FCC and steam cracking, which suffer from high energy consumption, PDH is a more energy-efficient process.

4. Meeting increasing demand: Conventional methods cannot meet the growing global demand for propylene, while PDH has the potential to address this challenge.

5. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to the complex processes involved in FCC and steam cracking.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a promising solution for meeting the increasing global demand for propylene.
