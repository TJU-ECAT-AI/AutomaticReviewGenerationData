<quotes>

[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

PDH technology is becoming increasingly promising for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: The growing reserves of propane from shale gas deposits provide an abundant and cost-effective feedstock for PDH.

2. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to traditional methods.

3. Addressing catalyst challenges: While current commercial PDH processes use Cr or Pt-based catalysts, which have limitations due to toxicity and cost, there is active research into developing new, more sustainable catalysts.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production method.

5. Process efficiency: Operating at high temperatures (above 500°C), PDH processes can achieve significant propane conversion rates.

However, the literature also highlights the need for further improvements in PDH technology, particularly in developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts to overcome the limitations of current commercial processes.
