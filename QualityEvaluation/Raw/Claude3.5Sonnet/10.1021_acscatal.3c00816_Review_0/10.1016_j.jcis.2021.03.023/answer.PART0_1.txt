[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile"

[2] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[3] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

PDH technology is emerging as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is increasingly abundant due to shale gas production. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to more complex traditional routes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, particularly with advanced catalysts, allowing for more targeted production of the desired product.

4. Market demand: PDH helps meet the growing global demand for propylene, which is used in various important products.

5. Alternative to existing processes: PDH provides an alternative to current commercial processes that use toxic or expensive catalysts (Cr, Pt), addressing environmental and economic concerns.

However, challenges remain in developing efficient and stable catalysts for PDH that can operate at high temperatures while maintaining selectivity and conversion rates.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术作为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，而丙烷由于页岩气生产而日益丰富。这解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷转化为丙烯的直接、单步工艺，与更复杂的传统路线相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，特别是使用先进催化剂时，可以更有针对性地生产所需产品。

4. 市场需求：PDH有助于满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求，丙烯用于多种重要产品的生产。

5. 现有工艺的替代方案：PDH为目前使用有毒或昂贵催化剂（Cr、Pt）的商业工艺提供了替代方案，解决了环境和经济方面的担忧。

然而，在开发能够在高温下运行并保持选择性和转化率的高效、稳定的PDH催化剂方面仍然存在挑战。
