[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

PDH technology is becoming increasingly promising for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: The growing reserves of propane from shale gas deposits provide an abundant and cost-effective feedstock for PDH.

2. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to traditional methods.

3. Addressing catalyst challenges: While current commercial PDH processes use Cr or Pt-based catalysts, which have drawbacks such as toxicity and high cost, there is ongoing research to develop new, more sustainable catalysts.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology can help meet the increasing global demand for propylene, which is vital for producing various products.

5. Potential for improved selectivity: Research into new catalysts and processes aims to enhance propylene selectivity in PDH reactions.

However, the literature does not provide specific information on how PDH addresses process efficiency and product selectivity challenges compared to conventional methods. More research would be needed to fully answer those aspects of the question.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因以下几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：页岩气开采带来的丙烷储量增加，为PDH提供了丰富且具有成本效益的原料。

2. 直接生产：PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与传统方法相比可能提供更高的效率。

3. 解决催化剂挑战：虽然目前商业PDH过程使用铬或铂基催化剂，这些催化剂存在毒性和高成本等缺点，但正在进行开发新的、更可持续催化剂的研究。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术可以帮助满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求，丙烯对生产各种产品至关重要。

5. 提高选择性的潜力：对新催化剂和工艺的研究旨在提高PDH反应中的丙烯选择性。

然而，该文献并未提供PDH如何解决传统方法在工艺效率和产品选择性方面挑战的具体信息。需要进行更多研究才能全面回答这些方面的问题。
