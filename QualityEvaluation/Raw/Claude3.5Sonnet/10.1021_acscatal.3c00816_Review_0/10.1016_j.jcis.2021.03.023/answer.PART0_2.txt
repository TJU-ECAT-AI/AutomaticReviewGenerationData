[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

PDH technology is becoming increasingly attractive for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: The growing reserves of propane from shale gas deposits provide an abundant and cost-effective feedstock for PDH.

2. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to conventional methods that may involve multiple steps.

3. Catalyst development: While current commercial processes use Cr or Pt-based catalysts, there is ongoing research to develop new, more sustainable catalysts to address the toxicity and cost issues.

4. Selectivity potential: PDH has the potential for high propylene selectivity, especially with the development of new catalysts and processes.

5. Process flexibility: PDH can be operated independently of petroleum refining, allowing for more flexible production based on market demands.

However, the document also highlights challenges that need to be addressed, such as the need for high operating temperatures and the development of more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly catalysts to replace the current Cr and Pt-based systems.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产中变得越来越具有吸引力，主要有以下几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：页岩气开采带来的丙烷储备增加，为PDH提供了丰富且具有成本效益的原料。

2. 直接生产：PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与可能涉及多个步骤的传统方法相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 催化剂开发：虽然当前商业化过程使用Cr或Pt基催化剂，但正在进行研究开发新的、更可持续的催化剂，以解决毒性和成本问题。

4. 选择性潜力：特别是随着新催化剂和工艺的开发，PDH具有高丙烯选择性的潜力。

5. 工艺灵活性：PDH可以独立于石油炼制运行，允许根据市场需求进行更灵活的生产。

然而，文献也强调了需要解决的挑战，如需要高运行温度，以及开发更高效、更具成本效益和更环保的催化剂来替代当前的Cr和Pt基系统。
