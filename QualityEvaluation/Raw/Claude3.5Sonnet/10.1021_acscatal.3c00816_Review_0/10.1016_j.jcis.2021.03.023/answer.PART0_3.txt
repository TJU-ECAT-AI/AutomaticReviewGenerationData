[1] "Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile"

[2] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[3] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is increasingly abundant due to shale gas reserves. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to indirect methods of propylene production.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity for propylene, as demonstrated by the research on new catalysts aimed at improving selectivity.

4. Market demand: PDH helps meet the growing global demand for propylene, which is used in various important products.

5. Overcoming limitations of current methods: PDH technology aims to address issues with conventional catalysts, such as the toxicity of chromium and the high cost of platinum, by developing new, more sustainable catalysts.

However, the literature also indicates ongoing challenges, such as the need for high operating temperatures and the development of more effective catalysts, which researchers are actively working to address.
