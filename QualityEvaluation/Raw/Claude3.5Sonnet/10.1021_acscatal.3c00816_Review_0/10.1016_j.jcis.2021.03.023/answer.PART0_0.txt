[1] "The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH)"

[2] "Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst"

[3] "However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent."

PDH technology is becoming increasingly promising for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: The growing reserves of propane from shale gas deposits provide an abundant and cost-effective feedstock for PDH.

2. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to traditional methods.

3. Addressing catalyst challenges: While current commercial PDH processes use Cr or Pt-based catalysts, which have limitations due to toxicity and cost, there is active research into developing new, more sustainable catalysts.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production method.

5. Process efficiency: Operating at high temperatures (above 500°C), PDH processes can achieve significant propane conversion rates.

However, the literature also highlights the need for further improvements in PDH technology, particularly in developing more efficient and cost-effective catalysts to overcome the limitations of current commercial processes.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法，主要有以下几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：页岩气开采带来的丙烷储量增加，为PDH提供了丰富且具有成本效益的原料。

2. 直接生产：PDH允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，与传统方法相比可能提供更高的效率。

3. 解决催化剂挑战：虽然目前商业PDH过程使用的是Cr或Pt基催化剂，但由于毒性和成本的限制，正在积极研究开发新的、更可持续的催化剂。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术通过提供专门的生产方法直接满足了全球不断增长的丙烯需求。

5. 工艺效率：在高温（500°C以上）下操作，PDH工艺可以实现显著的丙烷转化率。

然而，文献也强调了PDH技术需要进一步改进，特别是在开发更高效、更具成本效益的催化剂方面，以克服当前商业工艺的局限性。
