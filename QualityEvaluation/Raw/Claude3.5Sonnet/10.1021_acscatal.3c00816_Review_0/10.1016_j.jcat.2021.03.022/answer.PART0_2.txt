[1] "Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile"

[2] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."

[3] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes"

[4] "So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes."

[5] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant propane as feedstock, addressing the limitations of traditional naphtha cracking methods in meeting growing global demand.

2. Process efficiency: PDH provides a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional cracking processes.

3. Product selectivity: The use of supported Pt catalysts in PDH allows for selective C-H activation while minimizing unfavorable C-C cracking, leading to higher propylene selectivity.

4. Economic viability: PDH offers a solution to produce high-value olefins from cheaper alkane feedstocks, addressing concerns related to oil price fluctuations and the growth of shale gas production.

5. Scalability: Large-scale PDH units have already been implemented worldwide, demonstrating its viability as a major propylene production method.

These advantages make PDH technology well-suited to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods, particularly in terms of meeting the increasing global demand for propylene and its downstream products.
