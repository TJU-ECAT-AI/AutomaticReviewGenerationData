[1] "Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile"

[2] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."

[3] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes"

[4] "So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes."

[5] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has become a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap alkanes (propane) as feedstock, which addresses the challenges of fluctuating oil prices and increased shale gas production.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient method compared to traditional naphtha cracking, which produces propylene as a by-product.

3. Product selectivity: Supported Pt catalysts used in PDH are highly selective for C-H activation while minimizing unwanted C-C cracking, leading to improved propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology helps meet the continually increasing global demand for propylene, which traditional methods struggle to satisfy.

5. Versatility: PDH provides an additional major production route for propylene, complementing conventional cracking processes and diversifying the production landscape.

These advantages make PDH technology a valuable solution to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势成为丙烯生产的一种有前途的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用便宜的烷烃（丙烷）作为原料，解决了油价波动和页岩气产量增加带来的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与传统的石脑油裂解相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的方法，后者将丙烯作为副产品生产。

3. 产品选择性：PDH中使用的负载型Pt催化剂对C-H活化具有高选择性，同时最大限度地减少不需要的C-C裂解，从而提高丙烯选择性。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术有助于满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，而传统方法难以满足这一需求。

5. 多样性：PDH提供了丙烯生产的另一个主要途径，补充了传统裂解工艺，使生产格局多样化。

这些优势使PDH技术成为解决传统生产方法所面临的挑战的有价值的解决方案，特别是在原料灵活性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面。
