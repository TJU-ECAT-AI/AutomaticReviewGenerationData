[1] "Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile"

[2] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."

[3] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes"

[4] "So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes."

[5] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap alkanes (propane) as feedstock, which addresses the challenges of fluctuating oil prices and the growth of shale gas production. This makes the process more economically viable and less dependent on traditional oil-based feedstocks.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to traditional naphtha cracking. It allows for better control of the production process and can be optimized specifically for propylene yield.

3. Product selectivity: The use of supported Pt catalysts in PDH processes provides high selectivity towards propylene. Pt is active for C-H activation but less active for unfavorable C-C cracking, resulting in higher propylene yields and fewer unwanted by-products.

4. Meeting growing demand: Traditional propylene production methods, such as naphtha cracking, cannot meet the continuously increasing global demand for propylene and its downstream products. PDH technology offers a scalable solution to bridge this supply gap.

5. Versatility: PDH units can be integrated into existing petrochemical complexes or built as standalone facilities, providing flexibility in terms of production capacity and location.

These advantages make PDH technology a viable and attractive option for addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods, particularly in terms of meeting the growing global demand for propylene while utilizing more readily available and cost-effective feedstocks.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用便宜的烷烃（丙烷）作为原料，这解决了油价波动和页岩气生产增长带来的挑战。这使得该工艺在经济上更加可行，并减少了对传统石油基原料的依赖。

2. 工艺效率：与传统的石脑油裂解相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。它允许更好地控制生产过程，并可以专门针对丙烯产量进行优化。

3. 产品选择性：在PDH工艺中使用负载型Pt催化剂可提供高度的丙烯选择性。Pt对C-H活化有活性，但对不利的C-C裂解活性较低，从而获得更高的丙烯产率和更少的副产品。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：传统的丙烯生产方法，如石脑油裂解，无法满足持续增长的全球丙烯及其下游产品需求。PDH技术提供了一种可扩展的解决方案来弥补这一供应缺口。

5. 多功能性：PDH装置可以集成到现有的石化综合体中，也可以作为独立设施建设，在产能和选址方面提供了灵活性。

这些优势使PDH技术成为解决传统生产方法所面临挑战的可行且有吸引力的选择，特别是在满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求的同时，利用更容易获得和更具成本效益的原料方面。
