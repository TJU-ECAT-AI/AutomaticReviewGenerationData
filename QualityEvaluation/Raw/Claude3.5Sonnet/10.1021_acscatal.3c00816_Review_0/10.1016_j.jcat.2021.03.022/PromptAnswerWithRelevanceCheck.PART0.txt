<quotes>

[1] "Propylene, with an annual assumption of 79 million metric tons, has found wide applications for the production of polypropylene, propane oxides (acetone, propylene oxide and acrylic acid, etc.) and acrylonitrile"

[2] "Traditionally, propylene is produced as a by-product of naphtha cracking, which cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for the downstream products of propylene."

[3] "Moreover, due to the fluctuation of oil price and the growth of shale gas production, there has always been a concern on producing high value-added olefin from dehydrogenation of cheap alkanes"

[4] "So far, a number of large-scale propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene units have been put into production worldwide, which has become another major way to produce propylene besides conventional cracking processes."

[5] "Supported Pt catalysts are often used for the PDH process because Pt is active for C-H activation whereas much less active for unfavorable C-C cracking"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant propane as feedstock, addressing the limitations of traditional naphtha cracking which cannot meet growing global demand.

2. Process efficiency: PDH offers a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional cracking processes.

3. Product selectivity: Supported Pt catalysts used in PDH are highly selective for C-H activation while minimizing unwanted C-C cracking, leading to improved propylene yields.

4. Economic viability: PDH allows for the production of high-value olefins from cheaper alkane feedstocks, making it attractive in the face of oil price fluctuations and increased shale gas production.

5. Scalability: Large-scale PDH units have already been implemented worldwide, demonstrating the technology's viability for industrial-scale propylene production.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology offers a more flexible, efficient, and economically viable alternative to conventional propylene production methods, positioning it as a key solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

[5] "However, the dehydrogenation of propane is a strong endothermic reaction with small chemical equilibrium constant, and thus requires high reaction temperatures"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available and cheaper than naphtha used in conventional cracking processes. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity and price fluctuations.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to naphtha cracking, where propylene is only a by-product. This allows for better control over production and potentially higher yields.

3. Product selectivity: The use of supported Pt catalysts in PDH processes provides high selectivity towards propylene formation. Pt is active for C-H activation but less active for unfavorable C-C cracking, resulting in improved product selectivity compared to conventional methods.

4. Meeting growing demand: Traditional production methods like naphtha cracking cannot meet the continually increasing global demands for propylene and its downstream products. PDH technology helps bridge this supply gap.

5. Versatility: PDH units can be scaled up for large-scale production, making it a viable option for industrial applications.

However, it's worth noting that PDH technology also faces challenges, such as the need for high reaction temperatures due to the endothermic nature of the reaction and small chemical equilibrium constant. This can lead to issues like coking and catalyst deactivation, which researchers are working to address through improved catalyst designs and process optimizations.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，比传统裂解工艺中使用的石脑油更容易获得且更便宜。这解决了原料稀缺和价格波动的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与石脑油裂解相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线，石脑油裂解中丙烯只是副产品。这允许更好地控制生产并可能获得更高的产率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH工艺中使用的负载型Pt催化剂提供了较高的丙烯形成选择性。Pt对C-H活化活性高，但对不利的C-C裂解活性低，从而与传统方法相比提高了产品选择性。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：传统的生产方法如石脑油裂解无法满足丙烯及其下游产品持续增长的全球需求。PDH技术有助于弥补这一供应缺口。

5. 多功能性：PDH装置可以扩大规模进行大规模生产，使其成为工业应用的可行选择。

然而，值得注意的是，PDH技术也面临一些挑战，例如由于反应的吸热性质和小的化学平衡常数，需要高反应温度。这可能导致结焦和催化剂失活等问题，研究人员正在通过改进催化剂设计和工艺优化来解决这些问题。
