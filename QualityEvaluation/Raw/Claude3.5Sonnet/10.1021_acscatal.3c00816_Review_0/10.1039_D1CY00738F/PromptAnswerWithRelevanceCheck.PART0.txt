<questions>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, what are the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production, and how does it specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or how it compares to conventional propylene production methods. The study focuses on comparing catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, specifically Pt clusters enclosed in zeolites versus on the exterior surface. It does not discuss the broader context of propylene production technologies or market demands.

To properly answer this question would require additional information about PDH technology, conventional propylene production methods, and current market challenges that are not provided in the given literature. The document is focused on a specific catalyst comparison rather than an overview of propylene production technologies.

这篇文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势,也没有将其与传统的丙烯生产方法进行比较。这项研究主要关注比较丙烷脱氢的催化剂,特别是封装在沸石中的铂簇与外表面的铂簇。它并未讨论丙烯生产技术或市场需求的更广泛背景。

要正确回答这个问题,需要有关PDH技术、传统丙烯生产方法以及当前市场挑战的额外信息,而这些信息在给定的文献中并未提供。该文档主要集中在特定的催化剂比较上,而不是丙烯生产技术的概述。

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or how it compares to conventional propylene production methods. The study focuses on comparing two specific catalysts (Pt@NaX and Pt/NaX) for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss PDH technology more broadly or its advantages over other production methods. To answer this question would require information beyond what is provided in the given text.

The literature provided does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional propylene production methods. The text focuses on comparing catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, specifically Pt clusters enclosed in zeolites versus those on the exterior surface. It does not discuss broader aspects of PDH technology or its advantages over other propylene production methods.

To properly answer this question would require information on:
1. The growing global demand for propylene
2. Conventional propylene production methods and their limitations
3. Specific advantages of PDH technology in terms of feedstock, efficiency, and selectivity
4. How PDH addresses challenges faced by other methods

This information is not present in the given scientific literature, which is narrowly focused on catalyst comparisons for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

提供的文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势，也没有将其与传统的丙烯生产方法进行比较。文本主要集中于比较丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂，特别是封闭在沸石中的铂簇与外表面上的铂簇。它没有讨论PDH技术的更广泛方面或其相对于其他丙烯生产方法的优势。

要正确回答这个问题，需要以下信息：
1. 全球丙烯需求的增长
2. 传统丙烯生产方法及其局限性
3. PDH技术在原料、效率和选择性方面的具体优势
4. PDH如何解决其他方法面临的挑战

这些信息在给定的科学文献中并不存在，该文献仅狭义地关注于丙烷脱氢反应的催化剂比较。
