[1] "To characterize the catalytic properties of Pt sites propane dehydrogenation was chosen."

[2] "At the stationary conditions (5 h of experiment), the sample with HTT-modified support had a higher propylene selectivity at similar conversion values."

[3] "The calculation of catalytic activity (Table 7) showed that platinum in the sample with HTT-modified support has a higher specific activity in the reaction of propylene formation."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or how it compares to conventional production methods. The text only mentions propane dehydrogenation as a test reaction to characterize platinum catalysts, showing that hydrothermal treatment of the alumina support led to higher propylene selectivity and specific activity. The document does not provide information on global propylene demand, feedstock availability, process efficiency, or how PDH addresses challenges of conventional methods.

该文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势,也没有与传统生产方法进行比较。文中仅提到将丙烷脱氢作为表征铂催化剂的测试反应,结果显示经水热处理的氧化铝载体可提高丙烯选择性和比活性。文档没有提供关于全球丙烯需求、原料可用性、工艺效率的信息,也没有说明PDH如何解决传统方法面临的挑战。
