[1] "Results of catalytic testing of the (1) 0.5% Pt/γ-Al2O3 and (2) 0.5% Pt/γ-Al2O3 (HTT of support at 200 C for 3 h followed by heat treatment at 550 C for 3 h) samples in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation in a fixed-bed flow reactor at 550 C"

[2] "At the stationary conditions (5 h of experiment), the sample with HTT-modified support had a higher propylene selectivity at similar conversion values."

[3] "The calculation of catalytic activity showed that platinum in the sample with HTT-modified support has a higher specific activity in the reaction of propylene formation."

The document does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or how it compares to conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The literature focuses on the effects of hydrothermal treatment (HTT) on alumina-supported platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, rather than discussing PDH technology in a broader context.

However, the study does provide some insights that could be relevant to PDH technology:

1. The research demonstrates that modifying the catalyst support through hydrothermal treatment can improve propylene selectivity in propane dehydrogenation reactions.

2. The HTT-modified catalyst showed higher specific activity in propylene formation compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. These improvements in catalyst performance could potentially contribute to addressing challenges in process efficiency and product selectivity for propylene production via PDH.

While these findings are valuable for optimizing PDH catalysts, they do not provide a comprehensive overview of the advantages of PDH technology or its ability to address challenges faced by conventional production methods. To fully answer the question, additional information about PDH technology and its comparison to other propylene production methods would be needed.

该文档并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势，或者它如何在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面与传统生产方法相比较。这篇文献主要关注水热处理(HTT)对氧化铝负载铂催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的影响，而不是从更广泛的角度讨论PDH技术。

然而，这项研究确实提供了一些可能与PDH技术相关的见解：

1. 研究表明，通过水热处理修饰催化剂载体可以提高丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯的选择性。

2. 经HTT修饰的催化剂在丙烯生成方面表现出更高的特定活性，相比未经修饰的催化剂。

3. 这些催化剂性能的改进可能有助于解决PDH工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战。

虽然这些发现对于优化PDH催化剂很有价值，但它们并未提供PDH技术优势的全面概述，也未说明其如何解决传统生产方法面临的挑战。要全面回答这个问题，还需要有关PDH技术及其与其他丙烯生产方法比较的额外信息。
