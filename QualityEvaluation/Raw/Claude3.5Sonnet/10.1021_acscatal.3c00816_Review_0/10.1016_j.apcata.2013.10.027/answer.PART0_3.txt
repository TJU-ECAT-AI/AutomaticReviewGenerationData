[1] "In the present research, to characterize the catalytic properties of Pt sites propane dehydrogenation was chosen."

[2] "At the stationary conditions (5 h of experiment), the sample with HTT-modified support had a higher propylene selectivity at similar conversion values."

[3] "It was shown that in the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation there is increase in the propylene selectivity over 10 wt% at similar propane conversion."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or how it compares to conventional production methods. The document only mentions propane dehydrogenation as a model reaction to test catalyst properties, showing that certain modifications can improve propylene selectivity. It does not provide information on PDH's advantages in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, or how it addresses challenges faced by other production methods.

该文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势,也未比较其与传统生产方法的差异。文档仅提到将丙烷脱氢作为测试催化剂性能的模型反应,表明某些改进可以提高丙烯选择性。它没有提供关于PDH在原料可用性、工艺效率方面的优势,或者它如何解决其他生产方法面临的挑战等信息。
