[1] "In the present research, to characterize the catalytic properties of Pt sites propane dehydrogenation was chosen."

[2] "At the stationary conditions (5 h of experiment), the sample with HTT-modified support had a higher propylene selectivity at similar conversion values."

[3] "The calculation of catalytic activity (Table 7) showed that platinum in the sample with HTT-modified support has a higher specific activity in the reaction of propylene formation."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or how it compares to conventional production methods. The document focuses on a study of platinum catalysts on alumina supports for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the broader context of PDH technology in propylene production. The text mentions that hydrothermal treatment (HTT) of the support led to higher propylene selectivity and specific activity in propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide information on feedstock availability, overall process efficiency, or how PDH addresses challenges faced by other production methods.

这篇文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势,或它如何与传统生产方法相比较。该文档主要关注铂催化剂在氧化铝载体上用于丙烷脱氢的研究,但没有讨论PDH技术在丙烯生产中的更广泛背景。文中提到,载体的水热处理(HTT)导致丙烷脱氢反应中丙烯选择性和特定活性更高,但没有提供关于原料可用性、整体过程效率,或PDH如何解决其他生产方法面临的挑战等信息。
