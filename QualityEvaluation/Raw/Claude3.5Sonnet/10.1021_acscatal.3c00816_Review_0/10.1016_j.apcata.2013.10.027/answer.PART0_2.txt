[1] "Results of catalytic testing of the (1) 0.5% Pt/γ-Al2O3 and (2) 0.5% Pt/γ-Al2O3 (HTT of support at 200 C for 3 h followed by heat treatment at 550 C for 3 h) samples in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation in a fixed-bed flow reactor at 550 C"

[2] "At the stationary conditions (5 h of experiment), the sample with HTT-modified support had a higher propylene selectivity at similar conversion values."

[3] "The calculation of catalytic activity (Table 7) showed that platinum in the sample with HTT-modified support has a higher specific activity in the reaction of propylene formation."

The document does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production or how it compares to conventional methods. The paper focuses on the effects of hydrothermal treatment of alumina supports on platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, rather than discussing the broader context of PDH technology. 

However, the results presented do suggest some potential benefits of optimized PDH catalysts:

1. Improved selectivity: The study shows that hydrothermal treatment of the catalyst support led to higher propylene selectivity at similar propane conversion levels.

2. Higher specific activity: The modified catalysts demonstrated higher specific activity in propylene formation.

These improvements in catalyst performance could potentially contribute to addressing challenges in process efficiency and product selectivity for propylene production via PDH. However, the paper does not provide information on how PDH compares to other propylene production methods or discuss feedstock availability issues.

该文档并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产中的优势，也没有比较它与传统方法的区别。这篇论文主要关注了氧化铝载体的水热处理对丙烷脱氢用铂催化剂的影响，而不是讨论PDH技术的更广泛背景。

然而，文中呈现的结果确实暗示了优化PDH催化剂的一些潜在好处：

1. 提高选择性：研究表明，催化剂载体的水热处理在相似的丙烷转化率下导致了更高的丙烯选择性。

2. 更高的比活性：改性后的催化剂在丙烯形成反应中表现出更高的比活性。

这些催化剂性能的改进可能有助于解决PDH丙烯生产过程中的效率和产品选择性挑战。然而，该论文并未提供PDH与其他丙烯生产方法的比较信息，也没有讨论原料可用性问题。
