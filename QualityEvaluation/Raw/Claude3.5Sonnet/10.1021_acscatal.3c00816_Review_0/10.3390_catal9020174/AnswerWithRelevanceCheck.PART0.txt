          [1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."

[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."

[4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity. Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH is described as the most economical route for propylene production among alternative technologies.

2. Process simplicity: It is referred to as the "shortest route" for propylene production, suggesting a more straightforward process compared to other methods.

3. Commercial viability: PDH technology is already commercially available and has been developed into licensed processes by major companies.

4. Feedstock flexibility: As an on-purpose technology, PDH addresses the challenge of petroleum resource depletion by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which can be sourced from natural gas or other alternatives.

5. Targeted production: Unlike conventional methods where propylene is obtained as a byproduct, PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, potentially offering better control over output.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C).

2. Equilibrium limitations: The reaction is equilibrium-limited, which can affect overall efficiency.

3. Side reactions: The high temperatures facilitate unwanted side reactions, particularly thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation.

4. Selectivity issues: These side reactions can result in low propylene selectivity.

5. Catalyst deactivation: Rapid deactivation of catalysts is a significant challenge in PDH processes.

Despite these challenges, PDH technology's advantages in terms of economic efficiency, process simplicity, and feedstock flexibility make it a promising solution to address the growing global demand for propylene, especially in the face of depleting petroleum resources and the limitations of conventional production methods.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 经济效率：PDH被描述为替代技术中最经济的丙烯生产路线。

2. 工艺简单：它被称为丙烯生产的"最短路线"，表明与其他方法相比，工艺更加直接。

3. 商业可行性：PDH技术已经商业化，并已被主要公司开发成为许可工艺。

4. 原料灵活性：作为一种定向技术，PDH通过利用丙烷作为原料来解决石油资源枯竭的挑战，而丙烷可以从天然气或其他替代品中获得。

5. 目标生产：与传统方法中丙烯作为副产品获得不同，PDH是专门为丙烯生产而设计的，可能提供更好的产出控制。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：该过程是高度吸热的，需要高温（550°C以上）。

2. 平衡限制：反应受平衡限制，可能影响整体效率。

3. 副反应：高温会促进不需要的副反应，特别是热/催化裂解和焦炭形成。

4. 选择性问题：这些副反应可能导致丙烯选择性低。

5. 催化剂失活：催化剂的快速失活是PDH过程中的一个重大挑战。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH技术在经济效率、工艺简单性和原料灵活性方面的优势使其成为解决全球日益增长的丙烯需求的有前景的解决方案，特别是在面对石油资源枯竭和传统生产方法局限性的情况下。
