[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."

[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."

[4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity. Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH is described as the most economical route for propylene production among the alternative technologies.

2. Process simplicity: It is referred to as the "shortest route" for propylene production, suggesting a more straightforward process compared to other methods.

3. Commercial viability: PDH technology is already commercially available and has been developed into licensed processes by major companies.

4. Feedstock flexibility: As an on-purpose technology, PDH addresses the challenge of petroleum resource depletion by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which can be derived from various sources including natural gas processing.

5. Direct production: Unlike conventional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct, PDH directly targets propylene production, potentially offering better control over output.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C).

2. Side reactions: The high temperatures can lead to unwanted side reactions like thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation.

3. Selectivity and catalyst deactivation: These side reactions can result in low propylene selectivity and rapid catalyst deactivation.

Despite these challenges, PDH technology's advantages in terms of economic efficiency, process simplicity, and feedstock flexibility make it a promising solution to address the growing global demand for propylene, especially in the context of depleting petroleum resources and the limitations of conventional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 经济效率：PDH被描述为替代技术中最经济的丙烯生产路线。

2. 工艺简单：它被称为丙烯生产的"最短路线"，表明与其他方法相比，这是一个更直接的过程。

3. 商业可行性：PDH技术已经商业化，并已被主要公司开发成为许可工艺。

4. 原料灵活性：作为一种定向技术，PDH通过利用丙烷作为原料来解决石油资源枯竭的挑战，而丙烷可以从包括天然气处理在内的各种来源获得。

5. 直接生产：与将丙烯作为副产品生产的传统方法不同，PDH直接针对丙烯生产，可能提供更好的产出控制。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗需求：该过程高度吸热，需要高温（550°C以上）。

2. 副反应：高温可能导致不需要的副反应，如热/催化裂解和焦炭形成。

3. 选择性和催化剂失活：这些副反应可能导致丙烯选择性低和催化剂快速失活。

尽管存在这些挑战，但PDH技术在经济效率、工艺简单性和原料灵活性方面的优势使其成为解决全球不断增长的丙烯需求的有前途的解决方案，特别是在石油资源枯竭和传统生产方法局限性的背景下。
