[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."

[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."

[4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity. Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH is described as the most economical route for propylene production among the alternative technologies.

2. Process simplicity: It is characterized as the "shortest route" for propylene production, implying a more straightforward and potentially less complex process compared to other methods.

3. Commercial viability: PDH technology is already commercially available and has been developed into licensed processes by major companies, indicating its readiness for industrial-scale implementation.

4. Feedstock flexibility: As an on-purpose technology, PDH addresses the challenge of petroleum resource depletion by utilizing propane as a feedstock, which can be sourced from various origins including natural gas processing.

5. Targeted production: Unlike traditional methods where propylene is a byproduct, PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, potentially offering better control over output.

However, PDH also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C), which can impact energy efficiency.

2. Side reactions: The high temperatures facilitate unwanted side reactions like thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation.

3. Selectivity and catalyst deactivation: These side reactions can lead to low propylene selectivity and rapid catalyst deactivation, which are key areas for improvement in PDH technology.

Despite these challenges, PDH's advantages in economic efficiency, process simplicity, and feedstock flexibility make it a promising solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene, especially in the context of depleting petroleum resources and the limitations of conventional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 经济效率：PDH被描述为在替代技术中最经济的丙烯生产路线。

2. 工艺简单性：它被称为丙烯生产的"最短路线"，意味着与其他方法相比，工艺更直接、可能更简单。

3. 商业可行性：PDH技术已经商业化，并已被主要公司开发成许可工艺，表明其已准备好进行工业规模的实施。

4. 原料灵活性：作为一种定向技术，PDH通过利用丙烷作为原料来解决石油资源枯竭的挑战，而丙烷可以从包括天然气处理在内的各种来源获得。

5. 定向生产：与丙烯作为副产品的传统方法不同，PDH专门设计用于丙烯生产，可能提供更好的产出控制。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：该过程是高度吸热的，需要高温（550°C以上），这可能影响能源效率。

2. 副反应：高温会促进不希望的副反应，如热/催化裂解和焦炭形成。

3. 选择性和催化剂失活：这些副反应可能导致丙烯选择性低和催化剂快速失活，这是PDH技术需要改进的关键领域。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH在经济效率、工艺简单性和原料灵活性方面的优势使其成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的有前景的解决方案，特别是在石油资源枯竭和传统生产方法限制的背景下。
