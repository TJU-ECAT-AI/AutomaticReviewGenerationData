[1] "Propylene is one of the most important petrochemical building blocks for the production of a diverse range of products, from solvents to plastics and other valuable intermediates, for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."

[2] "Because of an increasing demand of propylene and the depletion of petroleum resources, on-purposed propylene production technologies from alternative substrates, such as methanol-to-olefin (MTO), [3,4] metathesis of ethylene and butylene [5] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [6] have been intensively developed."

[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation is the most economical and shortest route for propylene production and is commercially available, developed by several licensing processes including the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus, reference [7] and the Oleflex process from Universal Oil Products (or Honeywell UOP) [8]."

[4] "Because this reaction is a highly endothermic process and equilibrium-limited reaction, the relatively high temperature (above 550 C) is usually required for promoting the catalytic activity. Thus, this behavior facilitates several side-reactions, in particular, thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation, resulting in the low propylene selectivity and the rapid deactivation of catalysts [9]."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH is described as the most economical route for propylene production among the alternative technologies.

2. Process simplicity: It is referred to as the "shortest route" for propylene production, suggesting a more streamlined process compared to other methods.

3. Commercial viability: PDH technology is already commercially available and has been developed into licensed processes by major companies.

4. Feedstock flexibility: As petroleum resources are depleting, PDH offers an alternative substrate (propane) for propylene production, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

5. On-purpose production: PDH is an on-purpose technology, allowing for more targeted and potentially efficient propylene production compared to traditional byproduct-based methods.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The process is highly endothermic and requires high temperatures (above 550°C).

2. Equilibrium limitations: The reaction is equilibrium-limited, which can affect overall efficiency.

3. Side reactions: The high temperatures facilitate unwanted side reactions like thermal/catalytic cracking and coke formation.

4. Selectivity and catalyst deactivation: These side reactions can lead to low propylene selectivity and rapid catalyst deactivation.

Despite these challenges, the advantages of PDH make it a promising technology for addressing the growing global demand for propylene, especially in the context of depleting petroleum resources and the need for more flexible, targeted production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产最有前途的方法：

1. 经济效益：PDH被描述为替代技术中最经济的丙烯生产路线。

2. 工艺简单：它被称为丙烯生产的"最短路线"，表明与其他方法相比，工艺更加简化。

3. 商业可行性：PDH技术已经商业化，并已被主要公司开发成为许可工艺。

4. 原料灵活性：随着石油资源的枯竭，PDH提供了丙烯生产的替代原料（丙烷），解决了原料可用性的挑战。

5. 定向生产：PDH是一种定向技术，与传统的副产品基础方法相比，可以实现更有针对性和潜在更高效的丙烯生产。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：该过程高度吸热，需要高温（550°C以上）。

2. 平衡限制：反应受平衡限制，可能影响整体效率。

3. 副反应：高温会促进不需要的副反应，如热/催化裂解和积碳形成。

4. 选择性和催化剂失活：这些副反应可能导致丙烯选择性低和催化剂快速失活。

尽管存在这些挑战，PDH的优势使其成为一种有前途的技术，可以应对不断增长的全球丙烯需求，特别是在石油资源日益枯竭和需要更灵活、更有针对性的生产方法的背景下。
