<quotes>

[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene"

[2] "Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics"

[3] "To resolve this issue, our own group developed the SUZ-4-supported catalyst PtSnNa/SUZ-4, which afforded a 20% propylene yield. Although propylene can be obtained in similar 18%23% yields by increasing the Sn loading when using a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, our catalyst has the advantage of being more robust and undergoing very little deactivation due to carbon deposition."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the available information, we can infer some advantages:

1. PDH addresses the growing global demand for propylene, which is described as "rapidly growing".

2. The process uses supported Pt-Sn catalysts, which offer high activities and are environmentally friendly.

3. The newly developed PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst shows improved performance, with a 20% propylene yield and better robustness compared to other catalysts.

4. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst undergoes very little deactivation due to carbon deposition, which likely improves the efficiency and longevity of the process.

However, the document does not provide specific information on how PDH compares to conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, overall process efficiency, or product selectivity beyond the mentioned propylene yield.
