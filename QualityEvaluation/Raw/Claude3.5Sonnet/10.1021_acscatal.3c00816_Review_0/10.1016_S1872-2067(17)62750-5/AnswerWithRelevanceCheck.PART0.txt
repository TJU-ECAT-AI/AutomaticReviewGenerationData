          [1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene"

[2] "Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics"

[3] "However, Al2O3-supported Pt-Sn catalysts are deficient in terms of poor stability and lack of durability during recovery"

[4] "Thus, the development of novel supports to improve the stability of these catalysts is not only highly desirable but also timely."

[5] "ZSM-5-supported catalysts have attracted significant attention in this regard"

[6] "PtSnNa/SUZ-4 was found to exhibit higher activity and improved stability compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5 during propane dehydrogenation."

[7] "To resolve this issue, our own group developed the SUZ-4-supported catalyst PtSnNa/SUZ-4, which afforded a 20% propylene yield. Although propylene can be obtained in similar 18%23% yields by increasing the Sn loading when using a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, our catalyst has the advantage of being more robust and undergoing very little deactivation due to carbon deposition."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Meeting growing demand: PDH directly addresses the rapidly increasing global demand for propylene, making it one of the most important petrochemical processes.

2. High activity and environmental friendliness: Supported Pt-Sn catalysts used in PDH offer high catalytic activity while being environmentally friendly.

3. Improved catalyst performance: Newer catalysts like PtSnNa/SUZ-4 show higher activity and improved stability compared to conventional catalysts, with a 20% propylene yield.

4. Enhanced stability and durability: PDH technology aims to overcome limitations of traditional Al2O3-supported catalysts, which suffer from poor stability and lack of durability. The development of novel supports like ZSM-5 and SUZ-4 zeolites offers advantages over conventional supports.

5. Reduced deactivation: Some newer catalysts, such as PtSnNa/SUZ-4, undergo very little deactivation due to carbon deposition, improving process efficiency and longevity.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, it implies that PDH technology addresses these challenges through the use of propane as a direct feedstock, the development of more efficient and stable catalysts, and improved overall process performance.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH直接应对全球快速增长的丙烯需求，使其成为最重要的石化工艺之一。

2. 高活性和环境友好性：PDH使用的负载型Pt-Sn催化剂具有高催化活性，同时环境友好。

3. 改进的催化剂性能：新型催化剂如PtSnNa/SUZ-4与传统催化剂相比表现出更高的活性和改善的稳定性，丙烯产率达到20%。

4. 提高稳定性和耐久性：PDH技术旨在克服传统Al2O3负载催化剂稳定性差和耐久性不足的限制。开发新型载体如ZSM-5和SUZ-4沸石比传统载体具有优势。

5. 降低失活：一些新型催化剂，如PtSnNa/SUZ-4，几乎不会因碳沉积而失活，从而提高过程效率和寿命。

虽然文档没有明确将PDH与传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面进行比较，但它暗示PDH技术通过使用丙烷作为直接原料、开发更高效和稳定的催化剂以及改善整体工艺性能来解决这些挑战。
