[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene"

[2] "Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics"

[3] "However, Al2O3-supported Pt-Sn catalysts are deficient in terms of poor stability and lack of durability during recovery"

[4] "Thus, the development of novel supports to improve the stability of these catalysts is not only highly desirable but also timely."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Meeting growing demand: PDH directly addresses the rapidly increasing global demand for propylene.

2. High activity and environmental friendliness: Supported Pt-Sn catalysts used in PDH offer high catalytic activity while being environmentally friendly.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH allows for the use of propane as a feedstock, which can be advantageous compared to conventional methods relying on other feedstocks.

4. Improved selectivity: PDH technology, especially with advanced catalysts, can offer better propylene selectivity compared to some conventional methods.

5. Process efficiency: While not explicitly stated, the focus on developing more stable catalysts suggests that PDH technology aims to improve overall process efficiency.

However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of catalyst stability and durability. The development of novel catalyst supports, such as zeolites like SUZ-4, aims to address these issues and further improve the PDH process efficiency and longevity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH直接应对全球快速增长的丙烯需求。

2. 高活性和环境友好性：PDH使用的负载型Pt-Sn催化剂具有高催化活性，同时环境友好。

3. 原料灵活性：PDH允许使用丙烷作为原料，这与依赖其他原料的传统方法相比可能具有优势。

4. 提高选择性：PDH技术，特别是使用先进催化剂时，可以提供比某些传统方法更好的丙烯选择性。

5. 过程效率：虽然没有明确说明，但对开发更稳定催化剂的关注表明PDH技术旨在提高整体过程效率。

然而，挑战仍然存在，特别是在催化剂稳定性和耐久性方面。开发新型催化剂载体（如SUZ-4等沸石）旨在解决这些问题，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和寿命。
