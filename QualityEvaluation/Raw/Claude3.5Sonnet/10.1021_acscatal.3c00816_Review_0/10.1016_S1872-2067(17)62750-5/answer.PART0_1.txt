The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It addresses the rapidly growing demand for propylene, making it one of the most important petrochemical processes.

2. It utilizes supported Pt-Sn catalysts, which offer high activities and are environmentally friendly.

3. Newer catalysts like PtSnNa/SUZ-4 show higher activity and improved stability compared to conventional catalysts.

4. It overcomes limitations of traditional Al2O3-supported catalysts, which suffer from poor stability and lack of durability.

5. It utilizes zeolite supports like ZSM-5 and SUZ-4, which offer advantages over conventional supports.

While the document doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional production methods, it implies that PDH technology addresses challenges in feedstock availability by using propane as a direct feedstock. The high activities of supported catalysts suggest improved process efficiency. The development of more stable and durable catalysts like PtSnNa/SUZ-4 indicates efforts to enhance product selectivity and overall process performance.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 它满足了快速增长的丙烯需求，使其成为最重要的石化工艺之一。

2. 它使用负载型Pt-Sn催化剂，具有高活性和环境友好的特点。

3. 新型催化剂如PtSnNa/SUZ-4与传统催化剂相比表现出更高的活性和改善的稳定性。

4. 它克服了传统Al2O3负载催化剂稳定性差和耐久性不足的限制。

5. 它利用了ZSM-5和SUZ-4等沸石载体，这些载体比传统载体具有优势。

虽然文档没有明确将PDH与传统生产方法进行比较，但它暗示PDH技术通过直接使用丙烷作为原料来解决原料可用性的挑战。负载型催化剂的高活性表明工艺效率得到了提高。开发更稳定和耐用的催化剂（如PtSnNa/SUZ-4）表明在努力提高产品选择性和整体工艺性能。
