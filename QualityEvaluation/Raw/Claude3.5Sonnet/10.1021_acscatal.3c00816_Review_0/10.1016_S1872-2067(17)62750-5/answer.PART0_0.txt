[1] "Among these applications, propane dehydrogenation is considered to be one of the most important petrochemical processes because of the rapidly growing demand for propylene"

[2] "Supported Pt-Sn catalysts have been widely used because of their high activities and environmentally friendly characteristics"

[3] "To resolve this issue, our own group developed the SUZ-4-supported catalyst PtSnNa/SUZ-4, which afforded a 20% propylene yield. Although propylene can be obtained in similar 18%23% yields by increasing the Sn loading when using a PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, our catalyst has the advantage of being more robust and undergoing very little deactivation due to carbon deposition."

The literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the available information, we can infer some advantages:

1. PDH addresses the growing global demand for propylene, which is described as "rapidly growing".

2. The process uses supported Pt-Sn catalysts, which offer high activities and are environmentally friendly.

3. The newly developed PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst shows improved performance, with a 20% propylene yield and better robustness compared to other catalysts.

4. The PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst undergoes very little deactivation due to carbon deposition, which likely improves the efficiency and longevity of the process.

However, the document does not provide specific information on how PDH compares to conventional methods in terms of feedstock availability, overall process efficiency, or product selectivity beyond the mentioned propylene yield.

该文献没有提供全面的信息来完整回答关于丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术相对于传统生产方法的主要优势的问题。但是，根据可用信息，我们可以推断出一些优势：

1. PDH满足了全球对丙烯日益增长的需求，这种需求被描述为"快速增长"。

2. 该过程使用负载型Pt-Sn催化剂，具有高活性和环境友好的特点。

3. 新开发的PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂显示出更好的性能，丙烯产率达到20%，与其他催化剂相比具有更好的稳定性。

4. PtSnNa/SUZ-4催化剂几乎不会因碳沉积而失活，这可能会提高过程的效率和寿命。

然而，该文档没有提供PDH与传统方法在原料可用性、整体过程效率或产品选择性方面的具体比较信息，除了提到的丙烯产率之外。
