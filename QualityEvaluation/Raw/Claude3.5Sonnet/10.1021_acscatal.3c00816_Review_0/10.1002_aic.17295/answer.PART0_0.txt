[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels."

[2] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."

[3] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes because of their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is increasingly available from shale gas, a clean energy source. This addresses the challenge of feedstock supply faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an "on-purpose" production method, meaning it is specifically designed to produce propylene. This allows for better control and optimization of the process compared to traditional methods where propylene is often a byproduct.

3. Product selectivity: PDH using Pt-based catalysts offers superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds while maintaining low activity for C-C cleavage. This results in high selectivity towards propylene production.

4. Economic viability: The growing demand for propylene, coupled with the increasing availability of propane, makes PDH an economically attractive option.

5. Flexibility: As a dedicated process, PDH can be scaled and adjusted more easily to meet market demands compared to conventional methods tied to other petrochemical processes.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, making it a promising technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，这种原料越来越多地来自页岩气，一种清洁能源源。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种"定向"生产方法，意味着它是专门设计用来生产丙烯的。与传统方法相比，这种方法可以更好地控制和优化工艺，而在传统方法中丙烯往往是副产品。

3. 产品选择性：使用基于Pt的催化剂的PDH能够优秀地活化烷基C-H键，同时保持对C-C键裂解的低活性。这导致了高丙烯生产选择性。

4. 经济可行性：丙烯需求的增长，加上丙烷可用性的提高，使PDH成为一个经济上有吸引力的选择。

5. 灵活性：作为一个专门的过程，与其他石油化工过程相关的传统方法相比，PDH可以更容易地扩大规模和调整以满足市场需求。

这些优势使PDH能够解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使其成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的一项有前途的技术。
