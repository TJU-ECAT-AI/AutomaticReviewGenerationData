[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels."

[2] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."

[3] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes because of their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the increasing supply of propane from shale gas, providing a stable and abundant feedstock source.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an on-purpose production method, allowing for more efficient and targeted propylene production compared to traditional methods.

3. Product selectivity: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes offer superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds while maintaining low activity for C-C cleavage, resulting in high propylene selectivity.

4. Flexibility: As a dedicated process, PDH can be scaled and adjusted to meet specific propylene demand, offering more flexibility than conventional production methods.

5. Reduced dependence on other processes: PDH provides a direct route to propylene, reducing reliance on byproducts from other petrochemical processes.

These advantages address challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more direct, efficient, and selective route to propylene production, while capitalizing on the increasing availability of propane feedstock from shale gas resources.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气的不断增加的丙烷供应，提供稳定和丰富的原料来源。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种定向生产方法，与传统方法相比，可以更高效和有针对性地生产丙烯。

3. 产品选择性：PDH工艺中使用的铂基催化剂对烷基C-H键的活化能力优越，同时保持对C-C键裂解的低活性，从而实现高丙烯选择性。

4. 灵活性：作为一种专门的工艺，PDH可以根据特定的丙烯需求进行规模调整，比传统生产方法提供更大的灵活性。

5. 减少对其他工艺的依赖：PDH提供了一条直接生产丙烯的路径，减少了对其他石化工艺副产品的依赖。

这些优势通过提供更直接、高效和选择性的丙烯生产路径，同时利用页岩气资源中不断增加的丙烷原料供应，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。
