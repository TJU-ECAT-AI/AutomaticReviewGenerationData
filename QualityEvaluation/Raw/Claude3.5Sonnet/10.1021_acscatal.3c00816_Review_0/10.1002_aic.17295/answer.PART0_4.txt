[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels."

[2] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."

[3] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes because of their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the increasing availability of propane from shale gas, providing a stable and clean energy source.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an on-purpose production method, allowing for more controlled and efficient propylene production compared to conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes offer superior activation of paraffinic C-H bonds while maintaining low activity for C-C cleavage, resulting in high propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology directly addresses the worldwide increasing demand for propylene, which is a crucial feedstock for various chemicals and fuels in the global economy.

5. Flexibility: As an on-purpose production method, PDH can be more easily scaled and adjusted to meet market demands compared to traditional byproduct-based propylene production methods.

These advantages allow PDH to address challenges faced by conventional production methods, such as limited feedstock options, lower efficiency, and variable product yields, making it a promising solution for the growing propylene demand.
