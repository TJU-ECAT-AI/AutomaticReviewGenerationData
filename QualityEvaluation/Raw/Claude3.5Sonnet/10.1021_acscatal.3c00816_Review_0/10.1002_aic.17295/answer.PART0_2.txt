[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels."

[2] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."

[3] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes because of their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the increasing supply of propane from shale gas, providing a readily available and clean energy source.

2. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, on-demand production of propylene, addressing the growing global demand more efficiently than conventional methods.

3. Process efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is more straightforward and potentially more efficient than complex cracking processes.

4. Product selectivity: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes offer superior activation of C-H bonds while minimizing C-C cleavage, leading to high propylene selectivity.

5. Flexibility: PDH can be implemented as a standalone process, providing greater flexibility in propylene production compared to byproduct streams from other processes.

6. Reduced dependence on naphtha: PDH reduces reliance on naphtha cracking, which is sensitive to oil prices and facing feedstock competition from lighter crudes and shale oil.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly promising in addressing the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面提供了几个关键优势：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气的日益增加的丙烷供应，提供了一种现成可用的清洁能源源。

2. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性的、按需生产丙烯，比传统方法更有效地满足不断增长的全球需求。

3. 工艺效率：丙烷直接转化为丙烯的过程比复杂的裂解过程更直接，可能更高效。

4. 产品选择性：PDH过程中使用的基于铂的催化剂在活化C-H键方面表现出色，同时最大程度地减少C-C键断裂，从而导致高丙烯选择性。

5. 灵活性：PDH可以作为独立过程实施，与其他工艺的副产品流相比，在丙烯生产方面提供了更大的灵活性。

6. 减少对石脑油的依赖：PDH减少了对石脑油裂解的依赖，后者对油价敏感，并面临来自轻质原油和页岩油的原料竞争。

这些优势使PDH技术在解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性挑战方面特别有前景。
