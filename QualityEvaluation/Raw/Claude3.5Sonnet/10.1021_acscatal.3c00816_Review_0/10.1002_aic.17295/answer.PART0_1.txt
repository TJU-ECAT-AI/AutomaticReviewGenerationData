[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels."

[2] "The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation."

[3] "High reaction temperature (500700C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level."

[4] "Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes because of their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH takes advantage of the increasing availability of propane from clean energy sources like shale gas. This addresses the challenge of feedstock supply faced by conventional production methods.

2. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, on-purpose production of propylene, which helps meet the growing global demand more efficiently than traditional byproduct-based methods.

3. Process efficiency: PDH uses Pt-based catalysts that are highly effective at activating paraffinic C-H bonds while having low activity for C-C cleavage. This leads to efficient conversion of propane to propylene.

4. Product selectivity: The use of specialized catalysts in PDH enables high selectivity towards propylene production, minimizing unwanted byproducts.

5. Flexibility: PDH can operate at high temperatures (500-700°C) to achieve reasonable conversion levels, allowing for process optimization based on market demands.

While the technology does face some challenges, such as the need for high reaction temperatures and potential catalyst deactivation, ongoing research and development in catalyst design and process engineering continue to improve the overall efficiency and attractiveness of PDH as a primary method for propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用了来自页岩气等清洁能源的丙烷供应量增加的优势。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料供应挑战。

2. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性的、定向生产丙烯，这比传统的副产品基生产方法更有效地满足不断增长的全球需求。

3. 工艺效率：PDH使用的铂基催化剂在活化烷基C-H键方面非常有效，同时对C-C键的裂解活性较低。这导致了丙烷到丙烯的高效转化。

4. 产品选择性：PDH中使用的专门催化剂能够实现对丙烯生产的高选择性，最大限度地减少了不需要的副产品。

5. 灵活性：PDH可以在高温（500-700°C）下运行以达到合理的转化水平，允许根据市场需求优化工艺。

虽然该技术确实面临一些挑战，如需要高反应温度和潜在的催化剂失活，但在催化剂设计和工艺工程方面的持续研究和开发继续提高PDH作为丙烯生产主要方法的整体效率和吸引力。
