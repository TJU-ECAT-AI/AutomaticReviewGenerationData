[1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products. The propylene market demand reached the average annual growth rate of 56%."

[2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes. Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."

[3] "It is the era of highly selective catalysts for olefins production in the petrochemical industries. Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include:

1. Feedstock availability: Propane is cheap and easily available as a byproduct of various petrochemical processes. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional production methods.

2. Cost-effectiveness: PDH technology does not require large investments, as existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted. This makes it an economically attractive option compared to building new, dedicated propylene production plants.

3. Process efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is a more straightforward and efficient process compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce propylene as a byproduct.

4. Product selectivity: The development of highly selective catalysts, such as PtSn/SAPO-34, has significantly improved the selectivity of propylene production in PDH processes. This addresses the challenge of low propylene yields in conventional methods.

5. Market demand: With the propylene market demand growing at an average annual rate of 5-6%, PDH technology offers a scalable and dedicated solution to meet this increasing demand.

6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to end-users, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology positions itself as a promising method to meet the growing global demand for propylene while offering advantages in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为最具前景的丙烯生产方法的主要优势包括：

1. 原料可用性：丙烷作为各种石化过程的副产品，价格便宜且容易获得。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料稀缺问题。

2. 成本效益：PDH技术不需要大量投资，因为现有的生产设施可以以较低的成本进行改造。与建造新的专用丙烯生产厂相比，这是一个经济上有吸引力的选择。

3. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解等传统方法相比，丙烷直接转化为丙烯是一个更直接、更高效的过程，传统方法中丙烯只是副产品。

4. 产品选择性：高选择性催化剂（如PtSn/SAPO-34）的开发显著提高了PDH过程中丙烯生产的选择性。这解决了传统方法中丙烯产率低的问题。

5. 市场需求：随着丙烯市场需求以平均每年5-6%的速度增长，PDH技术提供了一种可扩展的专门解决方案来满足这种不断增长的需求。

6. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近终端用户的地方，降低运输成本，提高供应链效率。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术在满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的同时，在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面提供了优势，从而成为一种有前景的方法。
