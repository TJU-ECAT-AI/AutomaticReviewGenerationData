[1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products. The propylene market demand reached the average annual growth rate of 56%."

[2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes. Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."

[3] "It is the era of highly selective catalysts for olefins production in the petrochemical industries. Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: Propane is cheap and readily available as a byproduct of various petrochemical processes. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional production methods.

2. Cost-effectiveness: PDH technology does not require significant capital investment, as existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted. This makes it an economically attractive option for producers.

3. Process efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is a more straightforward and efficient process compared to traditional methods that involve multiple steps or complex feedstocks.

4. Product selectivity: The development of highly selective catalysts, such as PtSn/SAPO-34, has significantly improved the selectivity of propylene production in PDH processes. This addresses the challenge of achieving high product purity and reducing unwanted byproducts.

5. Market demand: With the propylene market demand growing at an average annual rate of 5-6%, PDH technology offers a scalable solution to meet this increasing demand.

6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be designed to produce propylene as the primary product, allowing for better control over production volumes and market responsiveness compared to traditional methods where propylene is often a byproduct.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.
