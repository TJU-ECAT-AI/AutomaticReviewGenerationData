[1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products. The propylene market demand reached the average annual growth rate of 56%."

[2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes. Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."

[3] "It is the era of highly selective catalysts for olefins production in the petrochemical industries. Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production are:

1. Feedstock availability: Propane is cheap and readily available as a byproduct of various petrochemical processes.

2. Cost-effectiveness: PDH technology does not require large investments, as existing facilities can be retrofitted inexpensively.

3. Process efficiency: The use of highly selective catalysts like PtSn/SAPO-34 improves the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

4. Product selectivity: New catalysts enable higher propylene selectivity, addressing the challenge of unwanted byproducts in conventional methods.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology helps address the increasing global demand for propylene, which has been growing at an annual rate of 5-6%.

These advantages make PDH technology a promising method for propylene production, as it addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
