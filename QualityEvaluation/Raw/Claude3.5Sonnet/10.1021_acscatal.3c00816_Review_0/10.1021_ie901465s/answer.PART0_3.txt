[1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products. The propylene market demand reached the average annual growth rate of 56%."

[2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes. Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."

[3] "It is the era of highly selective catalysts for olefins production in the petrochemical industries. Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Feedstock availability: Propane is cheap and readily available as a byproduct of various petrochemical processes. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional methods.

2. Cost-effectiveness: PDH technology does not require large investments, as existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted. This makes it an economically attractive option compared to building new facilities for conventional methods.

3. Process efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is a more straightforward and efficient process compared to traditional methods that involve multiple steps or complex separations.

4. Product selectivity: Recent developments in catalyst technology, particularly the highly selective PtSn/SAPO-34 catalyst, have significantly improved the selectivity of PDH processes. This addresses the challenge of low propylene yields in conventional methods.

5. Market responsiveness: With propylene demand growing at an annual rate of 5-6%, PDH technology allows for more flexible and targeted propylene production to meet this increasing demand.

These advantages make PDH technology a promising method for propylene production, as it effectively addresses the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
