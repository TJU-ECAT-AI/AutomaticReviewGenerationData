[1] "Light olefins are indispensable raw materials for numerous products. The propylene market demand reached the average annual growth rate of 56%."

[2] "However, propane and/or butane is cheap and easily available, as produced by the number of petrochemical processes. Moreover, direct propane dehydrogenation technology does not require a large investment because existing production facilities can be inexpensively retrofitted."

[3] "It is the era of highly selective catalysts for olefins production in the petrochemical industries. Recently, a highly selective catalyst PtSn/SAPO-34 gives a new technological trend in light olefins production via direct dehydrogenation route."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Feedstock availability: Propane is cheap and easily available as a byproduct of various petrochemical processes.

2. Low investment cost: PDH technology can be implemented by retrofitting existing production facilities, reducing the need for large capital investments.

3. Process efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is a more straightforward and potentially more efficient process compared to conventional methods.

4. Product selectivity: The development of highly selective catalysts like PtSn/SAPO-34 has significantly improved the selectivity towards propylene production.

5. Addressing growing demand: With propylene demand growing at 5-6% annually, PDH technology offers a scalable solution to meet this increasing market need.

6. Independence from traditional feedstocks: PDH reduces reliance on conventional propylene production methods that may be constrained by feedstock availability or market fluctuations.

These advantages make PDH technology a promising method for propylene production, addressing challenges in feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
