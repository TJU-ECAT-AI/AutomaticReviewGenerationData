[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers"

[2] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance, causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes"

[3] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene"

[4] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Efficiency: PDH is considered the most efficient process among emerging methods for meeting the large demand for propylene.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha crackers, especially with the increased production of ethane from natural gas and shale gas.

3. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the imbalance created by the shift towards ethane cracking for ethylene production.

4. Selectivity: While not explicitly stated, PDH typically offers higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional cracking methods.

5. Flexibility: PDH provides a dedicated route for propylene production, allowing producers to adjust output based on market demand.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly the need for high-temperature operations (773 K or higher) to overcome thermodynamic limitations. This aspect requires careful consideration in terms of energy efficiency and catalyst stability.

Overall, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability and production flexibility faced by conventional methods, while offering a more efficient and selective route to meet the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因具有几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 效率：在新兴方法中，PDH被认为是满足大量丙烯需求的最高效过程。

2. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石脑油裂解，丙烷更容易获得，特别是随着天然气和页岩气中乙烷产量的增加。

3. 定向生产：PDH允许针对性地生产丙烯，解决了由于转向乙烷裂解生产乙烯而造成的不平衡。

4. 选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但PDH通常比传统裂解方法提供更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 灵活性：PDH为丙烯生产提供了一条专门的路线，允许生产商根据市场需求调整产量。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是需要高温操作（773 K或更高）以克服热力学限制。这一方面需要在能源效率和催化剂稳定性方面进行仔细考虑。

总的来说，PDH技术解决了传统方法在原料可用性和生产灵活性方面面临的挑战，同时提供了一条更高效、更有选择性的路线来满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。
