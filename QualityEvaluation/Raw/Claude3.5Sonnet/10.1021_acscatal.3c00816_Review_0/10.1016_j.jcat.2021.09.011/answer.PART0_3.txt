[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers"

[2] "However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas"

[3] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance, causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes"

[4] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene"

[5] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are:

1. Efficiency: PDH is described as the most efficient process among emerging methods for propylene production.

2. Capacity to meet demand: It is capable of meeting the large demand for propylene.

3. Feedstock availability: PDH addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by using propane, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha feedstock.

4. Process specificity: Unlike naphtha cracking which produces both ethylene and propylene, PDH is an on-purpose method specifically for propylene production.

5. Adaptability to market changes: PDH helps balance the propylene supply disrupted by increased ethane cracking for ethylene production.

However, it's important to note that PDH also faces challenges, particularly the requirement for high-temperature operations (773 K or higher) to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss product selectivity for PDH, the fact that it's an on-purpose method for propylene production suggests it likely offers improved selectivity compared to traditional multi-product processes like naphtha cracking.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法的主要优势包括：

1. 效率：PDH被描述为新兴丙烯生产方法中最高效的工艺。

2. 满足需求的能力：它能够满足大量的丙烯需求。

3. 原料可用性：PDH通过使用丙烷解决了原料可用性的挑战，相比传统的石脑油原料，丙烷更容易获得。

4. 工艺特异性：与同时生产乙烯和丙烯的石脑油裂解不同，PDH是专门用于丙烯生产的定向方法。

5. 适应市场变化：PDH有助于平衡因乙烷裂解增加导致的丙烯供应失衡。

然而，需要注意的是，PDH也面临挑战，特别是需要高温操作（773 K或更高）以克服热力学限制。

虽然文档没有明确讨论PDH的产品选择性，但作为一种定向的丙烯生产方法，它可能比传统的多产品工艺（如石脑油裂解）提供更好的选择性。
