[1] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene"

[2] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit"

[3] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers"

[4] "However, a new and less expensive source of ethylene recently became available in increasing amounts from ethane cracking in natural gas and shale gas"

[5] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance, causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are:

1. Efficiency: PDH is considered the most efficient process to meet the large demand for propylene.

2. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the imbalance created by increased ethylene availability from ethane cracking.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane from various sources, including natural gas and shale gas, providing an alternative to traditional naphtha cracking.

4. High selectivity: While not explicitly stated, PDH typically offers high propylene selectivity compared to other processes.

5. Scalability: PDH can be implemented on a large scale to meet growing propylene demand.

PDH addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods in the following ways:

1. Feedstock availability: It utilizes propane, which is more readily available due to increased natural gas and shale gas production.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is more efficient for propylene production compared to traditional naphtha cracking or other emerging methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH focuses specifically on propylene production, allowing for better control of the product slate compared to less selective processes like naphtha cracking.

However, it's worth noting that PDH does face challenges, particularly the need for high-temperature operations to overcome thermodynamic limitations.
