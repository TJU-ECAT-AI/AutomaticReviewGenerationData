[1] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene"

[2] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit"

[3] "Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process"

[4] "On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d), but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Efficiency: PDH is considered the most efficient process to meet the large demand for propylene. This addresses the challenge of process efficiency faced by conventional production methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a direct feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha cracking feedstocks. This helps address the issue of feedstock availability.

3. On-purpose production: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, helping to address the imbalance created by the increased availability of ethylene from ethane cracking.

4. High selectivity: While not explicitly stated, PDH generally offers high selectivity to propylene compared to other processes.

However, PDH also faces some challenges:

1. High temperature requirements: The process needs to operate at high temperatures (773 K or higher) to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Current catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 suffer from rapid deactivation and require frequent regeneration.

3. Environmental and safety concerns: Some catalyst regeneration processes involve toxic and corrosive materials.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research in catalyst development, as discussed in the literature, aims to improve PDH technology and address these issues, further cementing its position as a promising method for propylene production.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 效率：PDH被认为是满足大量丙烯需求的最有效过程。这解决了传统生产方法面临的工艺效率挑战。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石脑油裂解原料更容易获得。这有助于解决原料可用性的问题。

3. 定向生产：PDH允许专门生产丙烯，有助于解决由乙烷裂解产生更多乙烯而造成的不平衡。

4. 高选择性：虽然没有明确说明，但PDH通常比其他工艺对丙烯的选择性更高。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 高温要求：该工艺需要在高温（773 K或更高）下运行以克服热力学限制。

2. 催化剂失活：当前的催化剂如CrOx/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3会快速失活，需要频繁再生。

3. 环境和安全问题：一些催化剂再生过程涉及有毒和腐蚀性材料。

尽管存在这些挑战，但如文献中讨论的那样，正在进行的催化剂开发研究旨在改进PDH技术并解决这些问题，进一步巩固其作为有前景的丙烯生产方法的地位。
