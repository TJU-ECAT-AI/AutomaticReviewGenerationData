[1] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene"

[2] "A major problem of the PDH process, however, is that the reaction requires high-temperature operations, at 773 K or higher, to increase the thermodynamic equilibrium limit"

[3] "Typically, the PDH process employs a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst supported on porous alumina (PtSn/Al2O3) or chromium oxide-supported alumina (CrOx/Al2O3), but both suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition"

[4] "Of the two typical catalysts, CrOx/Al2O3 has disadvantages of chromium toxicity and rapid deactivation (approximately in 15 min), which can be overcome by catalyst regeneration by a simple air-burning process"

[5] "On the other hand, the employed PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst requires frequent regeneration (typically, every 5 d), but the regeneration involves a high-temperature treatment with a toxic and corrosive gas mixture containing O2 and HCl"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production are:

1. Efficiency: PDH is considered the most efficient process to meet the large demand for propylene.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH directly uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha cracking methods.

3. Process selectivity: PDH is a targeted process for propylene production, unlike naphtha cracking which produces multiple products.

However, PDH also faces some challenges:

1. High temperature requirements: The process needs to operate at 773 K or higher to achieve favorable thermodynamic equilibrium.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Both commonly used catalysts (PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3) suffer from rapid deactivation due to coke deposition.

3. Regeneration issues: While catalyst regeneration is possible, it involves either frequent cycles (every 5 days for PtSn/Al2O3) or the use of toxic materials (for CrOx/Al2O3).

Despite these challenges, ongoing research into new catalysts and process improvements continues to make PDH an attractive option for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法的主要优势包括：

1. 效率：PDH被认为是满足大量丙烯需求的最有效过程。

2. 原料可用性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统的石脑油裂解方法，丙烷更容易获得。

3. 工艺选择性：PDH是一个针对丙烯生产的定向过程，不像石脑油裂解会产生多种产品。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 高温要求：该过程需要在773 K或更高温度下运行，以达到有利的热力学平衡。

2. 催化剂失活：两种常用的催化剂(PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3)都因焦炭沉积而快速失活。

3. 再生问题：虽然催化剂再生是可能的，但它涉及频繁的循环(PtSn/Al2O3每5天一次)或使用有毒材料(对于CrOx/Al2O3)。

尽管存在这些挑战，但对新型催化剂和工艺改进的持续研究仍然使PDH成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的一个有吸引力的选择。

[1] "Until recent years, the industrial demand for ethylene and propylene was satisfied with a balance by large-scale production from naphtha crackers"

[2] "This broke the previous ethylene-propylene production balance, causing a need to find proper on-purpose methods for propylene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), olefin metathesis, and methanol-to-olefin processes"

[3] "Among the emerging methods, the PDH process has garnered interest as the most efficient process that can meet the large demand for propylene"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Efficiency: PDH is considered the most efficient process among emerging methods for meeting the large demand for propylene.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha crackers, especially with the increased production of ethane from natural gas and shale gas.

3. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the imbalance created by the shift towards ethane cracking for ethylene production.

4. Selectivity: While not explicitly stated, PDH typically offers higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional cracking methods.

5. Flexibility: PDH provides a dedicated route for propylene production, allowing producers to adjust output based on market demand.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly the need for high-temperature operations (773 K or higher) to overcome thermodynamic limitations. This aspect requires careful consideration in terms of energy efficiency and catalyst stability.

Overall, PDH technology addresses the challenges of feedstock availability and production flexibility faced by conventional methods, while offering a more efficient and selective route to meet the growing global demand for propylene.
