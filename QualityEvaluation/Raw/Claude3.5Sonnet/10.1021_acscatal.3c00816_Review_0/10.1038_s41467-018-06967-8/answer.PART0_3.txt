[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "Herein, we describe an approach to breaking the scaling relationship for propane dehydrogenation, an industrially important reaction, by assembling single atom alloys (SAAs), to achieve simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Breaking the scaling relationship: PDH using single atom alloys (SAAs) can simultaneously enhance propylene selectivity and propane conversion, overcoming the trade-off between activity and selectivity faced by conventional catalysts.

2. High selectivity: SAA catalysts, particularly Pt/Cu SAA, can achieve high propylene selectivity (up to 90%) while maintaining good conversion rates.

3. Excellent stability: Pt/Cu SAA catalysts demonstrate exceptional stability, operating for over 120 hours at high temperatures (520°C) under atmospheric pressure.

4. Improved efficiency: By breaking the scaling relationship, PDH technology addresses the challenge of side reactions that typically reduce selectivity in conventional methods.

5. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as a feedstock, which is increasingly available due to the shale gas boom, addressing feedstock availability issues.

6. Process simplification: Direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a simpler process compared to conventional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

These advantages make PDH technology a promising method for propylene production, addressing challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 打破尺度关系：使用单原子合金（SAAs）的PDH可以同时提高丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率，克服了传统催化剂在活性和选择性之间的权衡。

2. 高选择性：SAA催化剂，特别是Pt/Cu SAA，可以在保持良好转化率的同时实现高丙烯选择性（高达90%）。

3. 优异的稳定性：Pt/Cu SAA催化剂表现出卓越的稳定性，在大气压下高温（520°C）运行超过120小时。

4. 提高效率：通过打破尺度关系，PDH技术解决了传统方法中通常会降低选择性的副反应问题。

5. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气繁荣，丙烷供应日益充足，解决了原料可用性问题。

6. 过程简化：与传统方法（如蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解）相比，丙烷直接脱氢制丙烯是一个更简单的过程。

这些优势使PDH技术成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法，解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
