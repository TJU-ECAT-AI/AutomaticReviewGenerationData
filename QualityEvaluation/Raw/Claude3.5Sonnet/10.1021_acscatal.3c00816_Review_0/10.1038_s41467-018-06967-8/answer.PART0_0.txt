[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "Considering the specific case of propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the key industrial reaction for the production of propylene is normally catalyzed by PtM alloys such as PtSn5, PtZn6, PtGa7, PtIn8, PtGe9, and PtCu10."

[3] "Our previous DFT calculations indicate that the catalytic properties of these PtM alloys are indeed restricted by the scaling relationship, which normally results in the promoted selectivity to propylene accompanied with the suppressed intrinsic activity for dehydrogenation of propane11."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional production methods. However, it does discuss some challenges in catalytic PDH processes:

1. There is a trade-off between catalytic activity and selectivity for propylene production using noble metal alloy catalysts. Increasing activity often leads to more side reactions and lower selectivity.

2. Conventional PtM alloy catalysts for PDH face limitations due to scaling relationships between adsorption energies. This results in a situation where improved propylene selectivity comes at the cost of reduced intrinsic activity for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The research focuses on developing new catalysts that can break this scaling relationship to achieve both high activity and selectivity simultaneously, which appears to be a key challenge in improving PDH technology.

While the text doesn't explicitly state the advantages of PDH, the focus on improving catalysts for this process suggests it is considered a promising method for propylene production that researchers are actively working to optimize.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的优势，也没有将其与传统生产方法进行比较。但是，它确实讨论了催化PDH过程中的一些挑战：

1. 在使用贵金属合金催化剂进行丙烯生产时，存在催化活性和选择性之间的权衡。提高活性往往会导致更多的副反应和更低的选择性。

2. 用于PDH的传统PtM合金催化剂由于吸附能之间的标度关系而面临限制。这导致了一种情况，即提高丙烯选择性的代价是降低丙烷脱氢的本征活性。

3. 研究重点是开发能够打破这种标度关系的新型催化剂，以同时实现高活性和高选择性，这似乎是改进PDH技术的一个关键挑战。

虽然文本没有明确说明PDH的优势，但对改进这一过程的催化剂的关注表明，它被认为是一种有前景的丙烯生产方法，研究人员正在积极努力优化这一技术。
