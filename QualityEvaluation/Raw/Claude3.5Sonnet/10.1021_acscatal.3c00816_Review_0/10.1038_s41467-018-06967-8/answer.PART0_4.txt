[1] "Noble-metal alloys are widely used as heterogeneous catalysts. However, due to the existence of scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces, the enhancement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by side reactions leading to a reduction in selectivity for the target product."

[2] "Herein, we describe an approach to breaking the scaling relationship for propane dehydrogenation, an industrially important reaction, by assembling single atom alloys (SAAs), to achieve simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion."

[3] "Unlike previous reported SAA applications at low temperatures (<400C), Pt/Cu SAA shows excellent stability of more than 120h of operation under atmospheric pressure at 520C."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production, as described in the literature, include:

1. Improved selectivity and conversion: The use of single atom alloys (SAAs) breaks the scaling relationship in propane dehydrogenation, allowing for simultaneous enhancement of propylene selectivity and propane conversion. This addresses the challenge of reduced selectivity often seen with increased catalytic activity in conventional methods.

2. High stability at high temperatures: The Pt/Cu SAA catalyst demonstrates excellent stability for over 120 hours of operation at 520°C under atmospheric pressure. This is a significant improvement over previous SAA applications that were limited to lower temperatures.

3. Overcoming limitations of traditional noble-metal alloy catalysts: The SAA approach helps overcome the trade-off between catalytic activity and selectivity typically seen in noble-metal alloy catalysts due to scaling properties of adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss feedstock availability or process efficiency compared to conventional methods, the improvements in selectivity, conversion, and catalyst stability at high temperatures suggest that PDH technology using SAA catalysts could offer significant advantages in terms of process efficiency and product yield.

根据文献描述，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 提高选择性和转化率：使用单原子合金（SAAs）打破了丙烷脱氢反应中的标度关系，实现了丙烯选择性和丙烷转化率的同时提高。这解决了传统方法中催化活性增加常常导致选择性降低的问题。

2. 高温下的高稳定性：Pt/Cu SAA催化剂在520°C、常压下可稳定运行120多小时。这比之前仅限于低温应用的SAA有了显著改进。

3. 克服传统贵金属合金催化剂的局限性：SAA方法有助于克服由于过渡金属表面吸附能的标度特性而在贵金属合金催化剂中通常存在的催化活性和选择性之间的权衡。

虽然文档没有明确讨论与传统方法相比的原料可用性或工艺效率，但在选择性、转化率和催化剂高温稳定性方面的改进表明，使用SAA催化剂的PDH技术在工艺效率和产品收率方面可能提供显著优势。
