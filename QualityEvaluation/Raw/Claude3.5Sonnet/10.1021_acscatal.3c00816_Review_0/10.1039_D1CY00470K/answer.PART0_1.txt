[1] "Propylene is not only the most important raw material for polymers but is also used as a feedstock for producing a great number of chemicals. Its market demand has greatly increased in the past few years globally."

[2] "Steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional methods of propylene production, but their productivity cannot satisfy the increasing market demand."

[3] "On the other hand, ample shale gas reserves are being continuously explored around the globe, which provides cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane."

[4] "Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which could directly produce propylene from propane, has attracted great interest in the chemical industry."

[5] "However, fast deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the active metal and coke deposition is the main problem in this process, and it is challenging for researchers because the DHP has to be carried out at high temperature (>520 C) and the catalyst must be worked in a reductive and carbonaceous gas flow."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to increasing shale gas reserves globally. This addresses the feedstock limitations of traditional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to multi-step traditional methods.

3. Product selectivity: As a direct conversion process, PDH has the potential for higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology can help satisfy the rapidly increasing global demand for propylene, which traditional methods are struggling to meet.

5. Utilization of cheap raw materials: The abundance of shale gas provides a cheap source of propane for PDH, potentially improving process economics.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coking and sintering at high operating temperatures. Ongoing research aims to develop more stable and efficient catalysts to overcome these limitations.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，由于全球页岩气储量的增加，丙烷变得abundantly可用。这解决了传统方法的原料限制问题。

2. 过程效率：PDH是一个直接的单步过程，将丙烷转化为丙烯，与多步骤的传统方法相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：作为直接转化过程，PDH与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，具有更高的丙烯选择性潜力。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术可以帮助满足全球快速增长的丙烯需求，而传统方法难以满足这一需求。

5. 利用廉价原材料：页岩气的丰富为PDH提供了廉价的丙烷来源，可能改善过程经济性。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在高温操作条件下，催化剂由于结焦和烧结而失活。正在进行的研究旨在开发更稳定和高效的催化剂来克服这些限制。
