<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is not only the most important raw material for polymers but is also used as a feedstock for producing a great number of chemicals. Its market demand has greatly increased in the past few years globally."

[2] "Steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional methods of propylene production, but their productivity cannot satisfy the increasing market demand."

[3] "On the other hand, ample shale gas reserves are being continuously explored around the globe, which provides cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane."

[4] "Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which could directly produce propylene from propane, has attracted great interest in the chemical industry."

[5] "However, fast deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the active metal and coke deposition is the main problem in this process, and it is challenging for researchers because the DHP has to be carried out at high temperature (>520 C) and the catalyst must be worked in a reductive and carbonaceous gas flow."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to increasing shale gas exploration globally. This addresses the feedstock limitations of traditional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering a more efficient route compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: As a targeted dehydrogenation process, PDH can potentially achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to less selective cracking processes.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH provides an additional production route to help meet the rapidly increasing global demand for propylene, which traditional methods alone cannot satisfy.

5. Utilization of cheaper feedstock: The ability to use propane from shale gas reserves offers a cost advantage in terms of raw material.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coking and sintering under the high-temperature reaction conditions. Ongoing research focuses on developing more stable and efficient catalysts to address these issues and further improve the process.
