[1] "Propylene is not only the most important raw material for polymers but is also used as a feedstock for producing a great number of chemicals. Its market demand has greatly increased in the past few years globally."

[2] "Steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional methods of propylene production, but their productivity cannot satisfy the increasing market demand."

[3] "On the other hand, ample shale gas reserves are being continuously explored around the globe, which provides cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane."

[4] "Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which could directly produce propylene from propane, has attracted great interest in the chemical industry."

[5] "However, fast deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the active metal and coke deposition is the main problem in this process, and it is challenging for researchers because the DHP has to be carried out at high temperature (>520 C) and the catalyst must be worked in a reductive and carbonaceous gas flow."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available from shale gas reserves being explored globally. This provides a cheap and plentiful feedstock source.

2. Process efficiency: PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, making it a more efficient process compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: The direct conversion process of PDH potentially offers higher selectivity towards propylene compared to traditional methods that produce a mix of products.

4. Meeting growing demand: Traditional production methods cannot satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. PDH technology has the potential to bridge this supply gap.

5. Economic viability: With abundant and cheap propane feedstock, PDH can be more economically viable compared to naphtha or heavy oil-based processes.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to sintering and coke deposition at high operating temperatures. Ongoing research is focused on developing more stable and efficient catalysts to address these issues and further improve the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，而丙烷在全球正在勘探的页岩气储量中大量存在。这提供了廉价且丰富的原料来源。

2. 工艺效率：与传统的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，PDH允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，使其成为更高效的工艺。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH的直接转化过程可能提供更高的丙烯选择性，传统方法通常生产多种混合产品。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：传统生产方法无法满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求。PDH技术有潜力弥补这一供应缺口。

5. 经济可行性：由于丙烷原料丰富且廉价，与基于石脑油或重油的工艺相比，PDH可能更具经济可行性。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在高温操作条件下由于烧结和积炭导致的催化剂失活问题。当前的研究正致力于开发更稳定、更高效的催化剂，以解决这些问题并进一步改进PDH工艺。
