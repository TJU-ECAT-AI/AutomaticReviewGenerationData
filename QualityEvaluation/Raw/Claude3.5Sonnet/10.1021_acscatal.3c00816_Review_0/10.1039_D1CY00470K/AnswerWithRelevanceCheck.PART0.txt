          [1] "Propylene is not only the most important raw material for polymers but is also used as a feedstock for producing a great number of chemicals. Its market demand has greatly increased in the past few years globally."

[2] "Steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional methods of propylene production, but their productivity cannot satisfy the increasing market demand."

[3] "On the other hand, ample shale gas reserves are being continuously explored around the globe, which provides cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane."

[4] "Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which could directly produce propylene from propane, has attracted great interest in the chemical industry."

[5] "However, fast deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the active metal and coke deposition is the main problem in this process, and it is challenging for researchers because the DHP has to be carried out at high temperature (>520 C) and the catalyst must be worked in a reductive and carbonaceous gas flow."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundantly available due to increasing shale gas exploration globally. This addresses the feedstock limitations of traditional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially offering a more efficient route compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: As a targeted dehydrogenation process, PDH can potentially achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to less selective cracking processes.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology helps address the increasing global demand for propylene, which traditional production methods struggle to satisfy.

5. Utilization of cheaper feedstock: The abundance of propane from shale gas makes it a relatively inexpensive feedstock compared to naphtha or heavy oil used in traditional methods.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coking and sintering under the high-temperature reaction conditions. Ongoing research focuses on developing more stable and efficient catalysts to address these issues and further improve the process.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，由于全球页岩气勘探的增加，丙烷丰富可得。这解决了传统方法的原料限制问题。

2. 工艺效率：PDH允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，与传统的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，可能提供更高效的路线。

3. 产品选择性：作为一种定向脱氢工艺，PDH可能实现比较低选择性的裂解工艺更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术有助于满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，而传统生产方法难以满足这一需求。

5. 利用更便宜的原料：页岩气中丙烷的丰富性使其成为相对便宜的原料，相比于传统方法使用的石脑油或重油。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在高温反应条件下催化剂因结焦和烧结而失活的问题。正在进行的研究重点是开发更稳定和高效的催化剂，以解决这些问题并进一步改进该工艺。
