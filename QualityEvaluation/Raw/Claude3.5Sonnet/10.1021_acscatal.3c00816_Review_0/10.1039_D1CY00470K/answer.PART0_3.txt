[1] "Propylene is not only the most important raw material for polymers but is also used as a feedstock for producing a great number of chemicals. Its market demand has greatly increased in the past few years globally."

[2] "Steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil are the traditional methods of propylene production, but their productivity cannot satisfy the increasing market demand."

[3] "On the other hand, ample shale gas reserves are being continuously explored around the globe, which provides cheap and abundant alkanes, including propane."

[4] "Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), which could directly produce propylene from propane, has attracted great interest in the chemical industry."

[5] "However, fast deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the active metal and coke deposition is the main problem in this process, and it is challenging for researchers because the DHP has to be carried out at high temperature (>520 C) and the catalyst must be worked in a reductive and carbonaceous gas flow."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant and cheap propane from shale gas reserves, addressing the feedstock limitations of traditional methods.

2. Direct production: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, potentially improving process efficiency compared to traditional multi-step processes.

3. Targeted production: Unlike steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, which produce a mix of products, PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, potentially improving selectivity.

4. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology has the potential to satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene, which traditional methods are struggling to meet.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to high operating temperatures and coke deposition. Ongoing research is focused on developing more stable and efficient catalysts to address these issues and further improve the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用来自页岩气储备的丰富且廉价的丙烷，解决了传统方法的原料限制。

2. 直接生产：PDH允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，与传统的多步骤过程相比，可能提高过程效率。

3. 定向生产：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解不同，后者生产混合产品，PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，可能提高选择性。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术有潜力满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，而传统方法正在努力满足这一需求。

然而，PDH技术仍然面临挑战，特别是在催化剂失活方面，这是由于高操作温度和积碳沉积造成的。正在进行的研究集中在开发更稳定和高效的催化剂，以解决这些问题并进一步改进PDH过程。
