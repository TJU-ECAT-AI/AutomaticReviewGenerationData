[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy and is crucial to the production of various valuable chemicals, commodities, and fuels."

[2] "Giving the scarcity of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming popular and is regarded as a promising way to meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene across the globe."

[3] "The PDH reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, so high reaction temperature (>500C) is essential to achieve a high propane conversion."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH addresses the challenge of fossil fuel scarcity by utilizing propane, which is abundantly available due to the discovery of shale gas. This ensures a stable and accessible feedstock supply.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which allows for better control and potentially higher efficiency compared to conventional methods that may involve multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: PDH technology can achieve high propylene selectivity, especially with advanced catalysts. This addresses the challenge of improving product yield and reducing unwanted by-products.

4. Flexibility: As a dedicated process for propylene production, PDH can be scaled and optimized to meet specific market demands, offering greater flexibility than conventional methods tied to other petrochemical processes.

5. Economic viability: With the increasing availability of propane from shale gas, PDH becomes more economically attractive, potentially offering cost advantages over traditional propylene production methods.

6. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene by providing a targeted production method that can be implemented in various regions with access to propane feedstock.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to overcome the limitations of conventional propylene production methods and meet the growing global demand for this crucial chemical feedstock.
