[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy and is crucial to the production of various valuable chemicals, commodities, and fuels."

[2] "Giving the scarcity of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming popular and is regarded as a promising way to meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene across the globe."

[3] "Supported Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial PDH processes. Despite high initial propylene yields, Pt-based catalysts often encounter problems in the term of fast deactivation and poor propylene selectivity."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity by utilizing propane, which is abundant due to the discovery of shale gas. This reduces reliance on traditional fossil fuel sources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to conventional methods. It allows for on-purpose propylene production, which can be adjusted based on market demand.

3. Product selectivity: While conventional Pt-based catalysts used in PDH processes face challenges with propylene selectivity, advancements in catalyst design (as described in the rest of the paper) have led to significantly improved selectivity.

4. Economic viability: With the increasing availability of propane from shale gas, PDH becomes more economically attractive compared to other propylene production methods.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to end-users, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

6. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology provides a scalable solution to meet the ever-increasing global demand for propylene, which is crucial for various industries.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology positions itself as a highly promising method for sustainable and efficient propylene production in the face of growing global demand.
