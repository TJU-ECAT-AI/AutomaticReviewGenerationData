[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."

[2] "Giving the scarcity of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming popular and is regarded as a promising way to meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene across the globe."

[3] "The PDH reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, so high reaction temperature (>500C) is essential to achieve a high propane conversion."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize propane from shale gas, addressing the scarcity of fossil fuels and providing a new feedstock source.

2. Direct production: PDH directly converts propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to conventional methods that may involve multiple steps.

3. High selectivity potential: While current Pt-based catalysts face challenges, the technology has the potential for high propylene selectivity with improved catalysts.

4. Flexibility: PDH can be operated at various scales, potentially allowing for more localized production near propane sources or propylene consumers.

5. Thermodynamic control: The ability to control reaction conditions, particularly high temperatures, allows for optimization of propane conversion.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges in catalyst stability and selectivity, which are being addressed through ongoing research and development of improved catalysts.
