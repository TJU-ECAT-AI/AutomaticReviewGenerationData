[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, but the widely used Pt-based catalysts usually suffer from short-term stability and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity."

[2] "Giving the scarcity of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming popular and is regarded as a promising way to meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene across the globe."

[3] "The PDH reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, so high reaction temperature (>500C) is essential to achieve a high propane conversion."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly addresses the challenge of feedstock availability by utilizing propane, which is abundant due to the discovery of shale gas. This helps meet the increasing global demand for propylene despite the scarcity of traditional fossil fuel resources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which can be more efficient compared to conventional methods that may involve multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: While conventional Pt-based catalysts suffer from unsatisfactory propylene selectivity, ongoing research in PDH catalysts (as demonstrated in this study) is improving selectivity, potentially leading to higher yields of the desired propylene product.

4. Adaptability to market demands: As a dedicated process for propylene production, PDH allows producers to adjust their output more flexibly in response to market demands, compared to propylene as a by-product of other processes.

5. High conversion rates: The ability to operate at high temperatures (>500°C) allows PDH to achieve high propane conversion rates, overcoming thermodynamic limitations.

However, challenges such as catalyst stability and selectivity are being addressed through ongoing research, as evidenced by the development of new catalysts described in this study. These improvements are making PDH an increasingly attractive option for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接解决了原料可用性的挑战，利用了由于页岩气的发现而变得丰富的丙烷。这有助于满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求，尽管传统化石燃料资源稀缺。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化过程，与可能涉及多个步骤或复杂分离的传统方法相比，可能更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：虽然传统的铂基催化剂存在丙烯选择性不理想的问题，但PDH催化剂的持续研究（如本研究所示）正在提高选择性，有可能提高所需丙烯产品的产率。

4. 适应市场需求：作为专门的丙烯生产工艺，与其他工艺中丙烯作为副产品相比，PDH允许生产商更灵活地根据市场需求调整产量。

5. 高转化率：能够在高温（>500°C）下操作允许PDH实现高丙烷转化率，克服热力学限制。

然而，诸如催化剂稳定性和选择性等挑战正通过持续的研究得到解决，如本研究中描述的新催化剂的开发所证明的那样。这些改进正使PDH成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的越来越具有吸引力的选择。
