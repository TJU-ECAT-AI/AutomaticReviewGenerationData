[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand"

[2] "However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the strong demand for propylene specifically.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to propylene compared to steam cracking, which produces a mix of products.

4. High selectivity: As demonstrated by the PtZn-Beta catalyst, PDH can achieve very high propylene selectivity (>90%).

5. Stability: The PtZn-Beta catalyst showed stable conversion for at least 63 hours, indicating good process stability.

6. No hydrogen requirement: Unlike some other processes, PDH does not require an additional hydrogen supply, which reduces process complexity and cost.

7. Thermodynamic efficiency: The PtZn-Beta catalyst achieved conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium, indicating high process efficiency.

These advantages address the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more targeted, efficient, and flexible approach to propylene production, which is crucial in meeting the growing global demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许针对性地生产丙烯，直接满足对丙烯的强劲需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解所用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：与产生多种产品的蒸汽裂解相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。

4. 高选择性：如PtZn-Beta催化剂所示，PDH可以实现非常高的丙烯选择性（>90%）。

5. 稳定性：PtZn-Beta催化剂显示出至少63小时的稳定转化，表明良好的工艺稳定性。

6. 无需氢气：与其他一些工艺不同，PDH不需要额外的氢气供应，这降低了工艺复杂性和成本。

7. 热力学效率：PtZn-Beta催化剂实现了接近热力学平衡的转化，表明工艺效率高。

这些优势通过提供更有针对性、更高效和更灵活的丙烯生产方法解决了传统方法的挑战，这对满足不断增长的全球需求至关重要。
