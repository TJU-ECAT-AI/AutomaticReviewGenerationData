[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand"

[2] "However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

[3] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, addressing the strong demand for propylene specifically.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to propylene compared to steam cracking, which produces a mix of products.

4. High selectivity: As demonstrated by the PtZn-Beta catalyst, PDH can achieve very high propylene selectivity (>90%).

5. Stability: The PtZn-Beta catalyst showed stable conversion for at least 63 hours, indicating good process stability.

6. No hydrogen requirement: Unlike some other processes, PDH does not require an additional hydrogen supply, which reduces process complexity and cost.

7. Thermodynamic efficiency: The PtZn-Beta catalyst achieved conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium, indicating high process efficiency.

These advantages address the challenges of conventional methods by offering a more targeted, efficient, and flexible approach to propylene production, which is crucial in meeting the growing global demand.

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It addresses the strong demand for propylene as an on-purpose manufacturing technology.

2. It does not require an additional hydrogen supply facility, making the process less complex and costly compared to some other methods.

3. PDH catalysts can show very low deactivation rates even without added hydrogen, demonstrating good stability and efficiency.

4. As a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, it offers high product selectivity.

5. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than the naphtha used in steam cracking.

These advantages make PDH technology well-suited to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods like steam cracking. The ability to produce propylene on-purpose with high selectivity from widely available propane feedstock gives PDH an edge in meeting growing propylene demand.

[2] "However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

[3] "Despite the attractive performance in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic behavior of the bimetallic PtZn system supported on zeolites with other structure types than zeolite L has rarely been reported"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other propylene production methods. However, it does highlight some key advantages of PDH technology:

1. PDH is an "on-purpose" propylene manufacturing technology, meaning it can produce propylene directly and selectively. This addresses the growing demand for propylene more effectively than traditional methods like steam cracking.

2. PDH does not require an additional hydrogen supply, which reduces costs and process complexity compared to some other catalytic dehydrogenation processes.

3. PDH using bimetallic PtZn catalysts on zeolites shows attractive performance in light alkane dehydrogenation, suggesting good efficiency and selectivity.

While not explicitly stated, these advantages likely make PDH more flexible in terms of feedstock (using propane directly) and more efficient in producing propylene selectively compared to less targeted methods like steam cracking. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons of feedstock availability or overall process efficiency between PDH and other methods.

该文献并未全面比较丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)与其他丙烯生产方法。但它确实强调了PDH技术的一些关键优势：

1. PDH是一种"定向"丙烯生产技术，意味着它可以直接和选择性地生产丙烯。与蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比，这更有效地满足了日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. PDH不需要额外的氢气供应，这降低了成本并减少了工艺复杂性，相比于某些其他催化脱氢工艺而言。

3. 使用双金属PtZn催化剂的沸石PDH在轻烷烃脱氢方面表现出色，表明其具有良好的效率和选择性。

虽然没有明确说明，但这些优势可能使PDH在原料方面更加灵活（直接使用丙烷），并且在选择性生产丙烯方面比蒸汽裂解等不太定向的方法更有效率。然而，该文献并未直接比较PDH与其他方法在原料可用性或整体工艺效率方面的差异。
