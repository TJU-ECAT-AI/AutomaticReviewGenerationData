[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand"

[2] "In these bimetallic catalysts, the addition of the second, more electropositive metal to platinum leads to increased activity, improved product selectivity and catalyst lifetime"

[3] "However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

[4] "Despite the attractive performance in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic behavior of the bimetallic PtZn system supported on zeolites with other structure types than zeolite L has rarely been reported"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene manufacturing, addressing the strong demand for propylene specifically.

2. Improved catalytic performance: The use of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtZn, leads to increased activity, improved product selectivity, and longer catalyst lifetime compared to conventional methods.

3. Process simplification: Unlike some other processes, PDH does not require an additional hydrogen supply facility, which reduces costs and complexity.

4. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

5. Higher selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking, which produces a mixture of products.

6. Energy efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is potentially more energy-efficient than steam cracking.

These advantages address the challenges of conventional production methods by offering a more targeted, efficient, and flexible approach to propylene production, which is crucial in meeting the growing global demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性地生产丙烯，直接应对丙烯的强劲需求。

2. 改进的催化性能：使用双金属催化剂（如PtZn）可以提高活性，改善产品选择性，延长催化剂寿命，相比传统方法具有优势。

3. 工艺简化：与其他一些工艺不同，PDH不需要额外的氢气供应设施，这降低了成本和复杂性。

4. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解使用的石脑油更易获得。

5. 更高的选择性：与生产混合产品的蒸汽裂解相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

6. 能源效率：丙烷直接转化为丙烯的过程潜在地比蒸汽裂解更加节能。

这些优势通过提供更有针对性、更高效和更灵活的丙烯生产方法，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，这对于满足不断增长的全球需求至关重要。
