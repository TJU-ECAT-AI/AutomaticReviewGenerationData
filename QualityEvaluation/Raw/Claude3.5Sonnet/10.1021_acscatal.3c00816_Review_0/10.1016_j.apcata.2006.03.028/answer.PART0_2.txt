[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand"

[2] "However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

[3] "Despite the attractive performance in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic behavior of the bimetallic PtZn system supported on zeolites with other structure types than zeolite L has rarely been reported"

The literature does not provide a comprehensive comparison of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to other propylene production methods. However, it does highlight some key advantages of PDH technology:

1. PDH is an "on-purpose" propylene manufacturing technology, meaning it can produce propylene directly and selectively. This addresses the growing demand for propylene more effectively than traditional methods like steam cracking.

2. PDH does not require an additional hydrogen supply, which reduces costs and process complexity compared to some other catalytic dehydrogenation processes.

3. PDH using bimetallic PtZn catalysts on zeolites shows attractive performance in light alkane dehydrogenation, suggesting good efficiency and selectivity.

While not explicitly stated, these advantages likely make PDH more flexible in terms of feedstock (using propane directly) and more efficient in producing propylene selectively compared to less targeted methods like steam cracking. However, the literature does not provide direct comparisons of feedstock availability or overall process efficiency between PDH and other methods.

该文献并未全面比较丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)与其他丙烯生产方法。但它确实强调了PDH技术的一些关键优势：

1. PDH是一种"定向"丙烯生产技术，意味着它可以直接和选择性地生产丙烯。与蒸汽裂解等传统方法相比，这更有效地满足了日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. PDH不需要额外的氢气供应，这降低了成本并减少了工艺复杂性，相比于某些其他催化脱氢工艺而言。

3. 使用双金属PtZn催化剂的沸石PDH在轻烷烃脱氢方面表现出色，表明其具有良好的效率和选择性。

虽然没有明确说明，但这些优势可能使PDH在原料方面更加灵活（直接使用丙烷），并且在选择性生产丙烯方面比蒸汽裂解等不太定向的方法更有效率。然而，该文献并未直接比较PDH与其他方法在原料可用性或整体工艺效率方面的差异。
