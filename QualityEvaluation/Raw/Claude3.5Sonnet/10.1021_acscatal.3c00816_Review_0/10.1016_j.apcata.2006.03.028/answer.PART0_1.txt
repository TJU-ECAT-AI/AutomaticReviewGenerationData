[1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand"

[2] "However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

[3] "Moreover, this catalyst showed a very low deactivation rate (0.4% conversion loss per day from Xi-Bu = 41% at 3.5 h on-stream) in the absence of hydrogen."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. It addresses the strong demand for propylene as an on-purpose manufacturing technology.

2. It does not require an additional hydrogen supply facility, making the process less complex and costly compared to some other methods.

3. PDH catalysts can show very low deactivation rates even without added hydrogen, demonstrating good stability and efficiency.

4. As a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, it offers high product selectivity.

5. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than the naphtha used in steam cracking.

These advantages make PDH technology well-suited to address challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods like steam cracking. The ability to produce propylene on-purpose with high selectivity from widely available propane feedstock gives PDH an edge in meeting growing propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产方面的主要优势包括：

1. 作为一种定向生产技术，它解决了对丙烯的强劲需求。

2. 它不需要额外的氢气供应设施，与其他一些方法相比，使过程变得不那么复杂和昂贵。

3. PDH催化剂即使在没有添加氢气的情况下也能表现出很低的失活率，表现出良好的稳定性和效率。

4. 作为从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化过程，它提供了高产品选择性。

5. 它使用丙烷作为原料，比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油更容易获得。

这些优势使PDH技术非常适合解决传统丙烯生产方法（如蒸汽裂解）在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。能够从广泛可用的丙烷原料定向生产高选择性丙烯的能力，使PDH在满足不断增长的丙烯需求方面具有优势。
