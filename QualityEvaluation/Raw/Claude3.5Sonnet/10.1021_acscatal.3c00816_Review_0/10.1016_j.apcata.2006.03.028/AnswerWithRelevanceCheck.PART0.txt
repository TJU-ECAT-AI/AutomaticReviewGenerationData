          [1] "As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand"

[2] "In these bimetallic catalysts, the addition of the second, more electropositive metal to platinum leads to increased activity, improved product selectivity and catalyst lifetime"

[3] "However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex."

[4] "Despite the attractive performance in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic behavior of the bimetallic PtZn system supported on zeolites with other structure types than zeolite L has rarely been reported"

[5] "Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr  29%, T = 555 C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%."

[6] "Moreover, this catalyst showed a very low deactivation rate (0.4% conversion loss per day from Xi-Bu = 41% at 3.5 h on-stream) in the absence of hydrogen."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene manufacturing, addressing the strong demand for propylene specifically.

2. Improved catalytic performance: The use of bimetallic catalysts, such as PtZn, leads to increased activity, improved product selectivity, and longer catalyst lifetime compared to conventional methods.

3. Process simplification: Unlike some other processes, PDH does not require an additional hydrogen supply facility, which reduces costs and complexity.

4. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

5. Higher selectivity: PDH can achieve very high propylene selectivity (>90% in some cases) compared to steam cracking, which produces a mixture of products.

6. Stability and efficiency: PDH catalysts can show stable conversion close to thermodynamic equilibrium for extended periods (e.g., at least 63 hours) and very low deactivation rates (e.g., 0.4% conversion loss per day).

7. Energy efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is potentially more energy-efficient than steam cracking, as it operates at lower temperatures.

8. Potential for further improvement: Ongoing research on various catalyst supports and compositions suggests room for further optimization and performance enhancement in PDH technology.

These advantages collectively address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods, making PDH a promising technology for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许针对性地生产丙烯，直接满足对丙烯的强劲需求。

2. 改进的催化性能：使用双金属催化剂（如PtZn）可以提高活性，改善产品选择性，延长催化剂寿命，相比传统方法具有优势。

3. 工艺简化：与其他一些工艺不同，PDH不需要额外的氢气供应设施，这降低了成本和复杂性。

4. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解使用的石脑油更易获得。

5. 更高的选择性：PDH可以实现非常高的丙烯选择性（在某些情况下>90%），而蒸汽裂解会生产混合产品。

6. 稳定性和效率：PDH催化剂可以在较长时间内（例如至少63小时）保持接近热力学平衡的稳定转化，并且具有很低的失活率（例如每天0.4%的转化损失）。

7. 能源效率：丙烷直接转化为丙烯的过程潜在地比蒸汽裂解更加节能，因为它在较低的温度下操作。

8. 进一步改进的潜力：对各种催化剂载体和组成的持续研究表明，PDH技术在优化和性能提升方面还有进一步的空间。

这些优势共同解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使PDH成为满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求的一项有前景的技术。
