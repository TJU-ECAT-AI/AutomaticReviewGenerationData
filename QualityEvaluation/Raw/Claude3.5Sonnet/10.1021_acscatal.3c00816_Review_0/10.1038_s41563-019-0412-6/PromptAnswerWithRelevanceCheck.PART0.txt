Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<questions>

In light of the growing global demand for propylene, what are the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production, and how does it specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity?

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The provided literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional production methods for propylene. The text focuses on the development of specific catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, particularly subnanometric platinum and platinum-tin clusters encapsulated in MFI zeolites. It does not discuss global demand for propylene, feedstock availability, process efficiency, or product selectivity in a broader context.

To properly answer this question, additional information about propane dehydrogenation technology and its comparison to other propylene production methods would be needed.

提供的文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势，也没有将其与传统的丙烯生产方法进行比较。该文本主要集中在特定催化剂的开发上，特别是封装在MFI沸石中的亚纳米铂和铂锡簇，用于丙烷脱氢反应。它没有在更广泛的背景下讨论全球丙烯需求、原料可用性、工艺效率或产品选择性。

要正确回答这个问题，需要额外的信息来介绍丙烷脱氢技术及其与其他丙烯生产方法的比较。

The document does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or how it compares to conventional propylene production methods. The text focuses on describing a novel catalyst synthesis method for propane dehydrogenation, but does not discuss the broader context of PDH technology or its advantages over other propylene production methods. To properly answer this question would require information not present in the given literature.
