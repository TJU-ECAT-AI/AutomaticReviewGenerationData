[1] "As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid etc. At present, the effective routes for producing propene mainly contain steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha"

[2] "Since the traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention"

[3] "Dehydrogenation of low-cost hydrocarbons to corresponding value-added olefins makes this route more economic dominance"

[4] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes low-cost propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in traditional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process for converting propane to propylene, potentially offering higher efficiency compared to multi-step processes like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene, as it is designed specifically for this conversion, unlike other processes that produce a range of products.

4. Economic advantage: The use of low-cost hydrocarbons as feedstock provides an economic advantage over traditional methods.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering greater flexibility in production locations.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, including the need for high temperatures and low pressures to achieve considerable propylene yields, as well as potential catalyst deactivation issues. Ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient catalysts and process conditions to address these challenges.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用低成本的丙烷作为原料，与传统生产方法使用的石脑油相比，丙烷更容易获得。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷直接转化为丙烯的一步法工艺，与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解等多步骤工艺相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，因为它专门设计用于这种转化，不像其他工艺会产生一系列产品。

4. 经济优势：使用低成本的碳氢化合物作为原料，相比传统方法具有经济优势。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，在生产地点上提供更大的灵活性。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战，包括需要高温和低压条件来实现可观的丙烯产率，以及潜在的催化剂失活问题。目前的研究重点是开发更高效的催化剂和工艺条件来解决这些挑战。
