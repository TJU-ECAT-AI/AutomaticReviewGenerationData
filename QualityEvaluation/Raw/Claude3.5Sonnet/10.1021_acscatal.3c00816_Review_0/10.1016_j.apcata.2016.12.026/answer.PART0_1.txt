[1] "Propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention"

[2] "Dehydrogenation of low-cost hydrocarbons to corresponding value-added olefins makes this route more economic dominance"

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield"

[4] "Unfortunately, these demanding conditions facilitate side reactions such as cracking and coke deposition, resulting in the deactivation of catalysts."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH uses low-cost propane as feedstock to produce higher-value propylene, providing economic advantages over conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: Propane is readily available, addressing challenges of feedstock scarcity faced by traditional production methods.

3. Process flexibility: PDH allows for targeted propylene production, unlike traditional methods where propylene is a byproduct.

4. Higher product selectivity: With proper catalysts and reaction conditions, PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity.

5. Potential for process optimization: Ongoing research in catalyst development and reactor design aims to improve efficiency and reduce side reactions.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, including the need for high temperatures, catalyst deactivation due to coking, and side reactions. Ongoing research focuses on developing better catalysts and optimizing reaction conditions to address these issues and further improve the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.
