[1] "As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid etc."

[2] "Since the traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention"

[3] "Dehydrogenation of low-cost hydrocarbons to corresponding value-added olefins makes this route more economic dominance"

[4] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH converts low-cost propane into higher-value propylene, providing economic advantages over traditional methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It addresses feedstock availability challenges by utilizing propane, which is more readily available than the feedstocks used in conventional methods.

3. Process selectivity: PDH is a direct conversion process, potentially offering higher selectivity to propylene compared to less selective cracking processes.

4. Tailored production: As a dedicated propylene production method, PDH allows producers to adjust output based on market demand more easily than integrated processes.

5. Improved yield: By optimizing reaction conditions (high temperature, low pressure), PDH can achieve considerable propylene yields, addressing efficiency concerns.

However, the technology also faces challenges, including the need for high temperatures, catalyst deactivation issues, and the equilibrium-limited nature of the reaction. Ongoing research aims to overcome these limitations and further improve the process efficiency and selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 经济效率：PDH将低成本的丙烷转化为高附加值的丙烯，比传统方法具有经济优势。

2. 原料灵活性：它通过利用丙烷解决了原料可用性的挑战，丙烷比传统方法使用的原料更容易获得。

3. 工艺选择性：PDH是一个直接转化过程，与选择性较低的裂解过程相比，可能提供更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 定制化生产：作为一种专门的丙烯生产方法，PDH允许生产商比集成工艺更容易根据市场需求调整产量。

5. 提高产率：通过优化反应条件（高温，低压），PDH可以实现相当可观的丙烯产率，解决了效率问题。

然而，该技术也面临挑战，包括需要高温、催化剂失活问题以及反应的平衡限制性质。正在进行的研究旨在克服这些限制，并进一步提高工艺效率和选择性。
