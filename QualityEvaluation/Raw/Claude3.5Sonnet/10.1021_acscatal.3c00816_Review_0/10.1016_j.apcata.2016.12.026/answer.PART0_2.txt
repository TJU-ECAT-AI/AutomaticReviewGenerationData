[1] "As a kind of important industry material, propene has been widely implemented in industrial processes for the production of polypropene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid etc."

[2] "Since the traditional production modes are unable to satisfy the increasing requirement for propene, propane dehydrogenation as one of the most promising approach has gained much attention"

[3] "Dehydrogenation of low-cost hydrocarbons to corresponding value-added olefins makes this route more economic dominance"

[4] "Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction, meaning higher temperature and lower pressure conditions are needed to accomplish a considerable propene yield"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. It addresses feedstock availability challenges by utilizing low-cost propane as a raw material, which is more readily available than traditional feedstocks.

2. PDH offers improved process efficiency by directly converting propane to propylene in a single step, unlike conventional multi-step processes.

3. It provides higher product selectivity, potentially yielding propylene with greater purity compared to traditional methods.

4. PDH can be operated at lower pressures, which is advantageous for achieving higher propylene yields due to the reaction's equilibrium limitations.

5. The technology allows for more flexible and targeted propylene production, helping to meet the increasing demand that traditional methods struggle to satisfy.

However, PDH also faces challenges such as the need for high reaction temperatures and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, which researchers are actively working to address through catalyst and process improvements.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 它通过利用低成本的丙烷作为原料来解决原料可用性的挑战，比传统原料更容易获得。

2. PDH通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯的单一步骤，提供了改进的工艺效率，不同于传统的多步骤工艺。

3. 它提供了更高的产品选择性，与传统方法相比，可能产生纯度更高的丙烯。

4. PDH可以在较低的压力下操作，这对于由于反应的平衡限制而获得更高的丙烯产率是有利的。

5. 该技术允许更灵活和有针对性的丙烯生产，有助于满足传统方法难以满足的不断增长的需求。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战，如需要高反应温度和由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活，研究人员正在通过催化剂和工艺改进积极解决这些问题。
