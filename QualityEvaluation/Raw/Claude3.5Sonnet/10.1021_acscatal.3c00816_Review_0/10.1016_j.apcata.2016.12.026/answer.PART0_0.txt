Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes low-cost propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional feedstocks used in steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene, as it involves fewer steps compared to traditional methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers higher selectivity towards propylene production, potentially resulting in higher yields and purity of the desired product.

4. Economic advantages: The use of low-cost propane feedstock and the more direct production route contribute to the economic dominance of PDH technology.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built on a smaller scale and closer to end-users, providing more flexibility in production and distribution.

6. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology helps address the increasing global demand for propylene that traditional production methods are struggling to meet.

These advantages make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, while also meeting the growing global demand for propylene.
