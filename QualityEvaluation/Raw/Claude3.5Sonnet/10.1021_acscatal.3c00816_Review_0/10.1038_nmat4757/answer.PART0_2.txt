[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a fixed-bed reactor. A cylindrical quartz tube was loaded with 1.10g of Pt@MCM-22 catalyst material (in the case of Pt/MCM-22-imp, the amount of catalyst was 0.60g). Catalyst was diluted with SiC to keep the total volume of solid constant (3cm3)."

[2] "Before the reaction, the sample was reduced by H2 at 550C. The reaction was run at 550C with a flow of 30mlmin1 of propane and 3mlmin1 of N2 for 15min, followed by a regeneration step at 550C with a flow of air for 30min."

[3] "Conversion of C3H8 was kept below 10% to calculate the initial reaction rate."

The literature provided does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional production methods for propylene. The text only describes an experimental setup for propane dehydrogenation using a specific catalyst (Pt@MCM-22) and does not discuss the broader context of propylene production or PDH technology's advantages.

To properly answer this question, additional information would be needed on global propylene demand, feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity for both PDH and conventional production methods. The current text focuses solely on a specific experimental procedure and does not provide the necessary context to evaluate PDH technology's advantages in addressing challenges faced by conventional production methods.

提供的文献并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术的优势，也没有将其与传统丙烯生产方法进行比较。文本仅描述了使用特定催化剂(Pt@MCM-22)进行丙烷脱氢的实验设置，没有讨论丙烯生产的更广泛背景或PDH技术的优势。

为了正确回答这个问题，需要额外的信息，包括全球丙烯需求、原料可用性、工艺效率以及PDH和传统生产方法的产品选择性。当前文本仅集中于特定的实验程序，没有提供必要的背景来评估PDH技术在解决传统生产方法面临的挑战方面的优势。
