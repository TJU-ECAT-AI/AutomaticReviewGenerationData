[1] "To test the catalytic properties and to acquire more information on the location of Pt species in the Pt@MCM-22 sample, we have chosen hydrogenation of alkenes with different molecular sizes as probe reactions."

[2] "Taking into account the higher stability of Pt@MCM-22, we also decided to test its catalytic activity for dehydrogenation of propane. Indeed, dehydrogenation of short alkane molecules is of great interest to activate alkanes, and catalytic processes require frequent reaction–regeneration cycles at high temperature"

[3] "As can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 24, Pt@MCM-22 exhibits higher activity than Pt/MCM-22-imp at 550°C. Moreover, after five reaction–regeneration cycles at 550°C during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, Pt@MCM-22 sample retains 90% of its initial activity while Pt/MCM-22-imp has lost more than 40% of its initial activity."

The literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production or compare it to conventional production methods. The text focuses on the development and characterization of a novel Pt@MCM-22 catalyst, which shows promise for propane dehydrogenation.

However, we can infer some potential advantages of PDH technology based on the information provided:

1. High-temperature stability: The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst demonstrates excellent thermal stability, maintaining its activity even after multiple high-temperature cycles. This suggests that PDH technology using such catalysts could operate efficiently at high temperatures, which is typically required for propane dehydrogenation.

2. Regeneration capability: The catalyst can undergo multiple reaction-regeneration cycles while retaining most of its activity. This indicates that PDH processes using this type of catalyst could be more sustainable and cost-effective in the long term.

3. Improved catalyst performance: The Pt@MCM-22 catalyst shows higher activity and better stability compared to conventionally prepared catalysts (Pt/MCM-22-imp) for propane dehydrogenation. This suggests that PDH technology using advanced catalysts could potentially offer higher efficiency and longer catalyst lifetimes than conventional methods.

4. Direct conversion: PDH allows for the direct conversion of propane to propylene, which could potentially offer advantages in terms of process simplicity and selectivity compared to other production methods.

While these points suggest some potential advantages of PDH technology, it's important to note that the document does not provide a comprehensive comparison with conventional production methods or discuss feedstock availability and overall process efficiency. More specific research on PDH technology would be needed to fully address the question.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产中的优势，也没有将其与传统生产方法进行比较。文章主要关注于一种新型Pt@MCM-22催化剂的开发和表征，该催化剂在丙烷脱氢方面显示出了良好的前景。

然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断PDH技术的一些潜在优势：

1. 高温稳定性：Pt@MCM-22催化剂表现出优异的热稳定性，即使经过多次高温循环后仍能保持其活性。这表明使用此类催化剂的PDH技术可以在高温下高效运行，而高温通常是丙烷脱氢所需的。

2. 再生能力：该催化剂可以经历多次反应-再生循环，同时保持大部分活性。这表明使用这种类型催化剂的PDH过程从长远来看可能更具可持续性和成本效益。

3. 改进的催化剂性能：与传统制备的催化剂(Pt/MCM-22-imp)相比，Pt@MCM-22催化剂在丙烷脱氢方面表现出更高的活性和更好的稳定性。这表明使用先进催化剂的PDH技术可能比传统方法提供更高的效率和更长的催化剂寿命。

4. 直接转化：PDH允许丙烷直接转化为丙烯，这在工艺简单性和选择性方面可能比其他生产方法具有优势。

虽然这些点暗示了PDH技术的一些潜在优势，但需要注意的是，该文档并未提供与传统生产方法的全面比较，也没有讨论原料可用性和整体工艺效率。要全面回答这个问题，还需要对PDH技术进行更具体的研究。
