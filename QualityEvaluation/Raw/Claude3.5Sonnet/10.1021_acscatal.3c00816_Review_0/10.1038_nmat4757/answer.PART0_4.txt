[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a fixed-bed reactor. A cylindrical quartz tube was loaded with 1.10g of Pt@MCM-22 catalyst material (in the case of Pt/MCM-22-imp, the amount of catalyst was 0.60g)."

[2] "Before the reaction, the sample was reduced by H2 at 550C. The reaction was run at 550C with a flow of 30mlmin1 of propane and 3mlmin1 of N2 for 15min, followed by a regeneration step at 550C with a flow of air for 30min."

[3] "Conversion of C3H8 was kept below 10% to calculate the initial reaction rate."

The provided literature does not directly address the advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology or compare it to conventional production methods for propylene. The text only describes an experimental setup for propane dehydrogenation using a specific catalyst (Pt@MCM-22). It does not discuss global demand for propylene, feedstock availability, process efficiency, or product selectivity in a broader context. Therefore, the question cannot be fully answered based on the given information.

However, we can infer that the described experimental setup for propane dehydrogenation represents a potential method for propylene production. The use of a fixed-bed reactor with a specialized catalyst (Pt@MCM-22) and cyclic operation (reaction followed by regeneration) suggests that this approach may offer some advantages in terms of process efficiency or catalyst longevity. The controlled conversion rate (below 10%) might indicate an attempt to optimize selectivity or product yield, but without more context, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about its advantages over other production methods.

提供的文献并没有直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术的优势，也没有将其与传统的丙烯生产方法进行比较。文本仅描述了使用特定催化剂（Pt@MCM-22）进行丙烷脱氢的实验设置。它没有在更广泛的背景下讨论丙烯的全球需求、原料可用性、工艺效率或产品选择性。因此，基于给定的信息无法全面回答这个问题。

然而，我们可以推断，所描述的丙烷脱氢实验设置代表了一种潜在的丙烯生产方法。使用固定床反应器和专门的催化剂（Pt@MCM-22），以及循环操作（反应后再生）表明，这种方法可能在工艺效率或催化剂寿命方面提供一些优势。受控的转化率（低于10%）可能表明试图优化选择性或产品产量，但没有更多背景信息，我们无法得出关于其相对于其他生产方法优势的明确结论。
