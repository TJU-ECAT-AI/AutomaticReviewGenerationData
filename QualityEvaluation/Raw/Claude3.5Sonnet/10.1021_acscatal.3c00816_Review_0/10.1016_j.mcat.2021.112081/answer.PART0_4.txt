[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."

[3] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources"

[4] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Single feed and single product: PDH uses only propane as feedstock and produces primarily propylene, allowing for a simpler and more focused production process.

2. Wide availability of raw materials: The exploitation of unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas has provided abundant and cheap light alkane sources, including propane.

3. Low cost: PDH technology is cost-effective compared to traditional production methods.

4. Addresses feedstock limitations: Traditional propylene production as a by-product of naphtha and coal cracking can no longer meet the expanding market demand. PDH directly addresses this challenge by providing a dedicated propylene production method.

5. Improved process efficiency: By focusing on a single reaction pathway, PDH can potentially offer better efficiency compared to complex cracking processes.

6. Better product selectivity: The single-product nature of PDH allows for higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods that produce multiple products.

These advantages make PDH technology well-suited to address the growing global demand for propylene, overcoming the limitations of conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 单一原料和单一产品：PDH仅使用丙烷作为原料，主要生产丙烯，实现了更简单和更集中的生产过程。

2. 原材料来源广泛：非常规天然气如页岩气的开发提供了丰富且廉价的轻烷烃资源，包括丙烷。

3. 成本低：与传统生产方法相比，PDH技术具有成本效益。

4. 解决原料限制：传统的石脑油和煤炭裂解副产品丙烯生产已无法满足不断扩大的市场需求。PDH直接解决了这一挑战，提供了专门的丙烯生产方法。

5. 提高工艺效率：通过专注于单一反应路径，PDH可能比复杂的裂解工艺提供更好的效率。

6. 更好的产品选择性：PDH的单一产品性质允许比传统多产品生产方法具有更高的丙烯选择性。

这些优势使PDH技术非常适合解决不断增长的全球丙烯需求，克服了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的局限性。
