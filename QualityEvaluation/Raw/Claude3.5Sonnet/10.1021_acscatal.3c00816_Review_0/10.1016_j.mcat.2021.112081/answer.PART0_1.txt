[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."

[3] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost"

[4] "The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Single feed and product: PDH uses only propane as feedstock and produces propylene as the main product, simplifying the process.

2. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the abundant and cheap light alkane sources from unconventional natural gas like shale gas.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient compared to traditional cracking methods.

4. Cost-effectiveness: The wide availability of raw materials and simplified process make PDH a low-cost option.

5. Meeting demand: PDH helps address the expanding market demand for propylene that traditional by-product methods cannot satisfy.

6. Selectivity: The single-product nature of PDH allows for high propylene selectivity.

However, PDH still faces challenges in improving coke resistance and preventing sintering of active sites due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Overall, PDH technology offers a more targeted, efficient, and economical approach to propylene production compared to conventional methods, making it well-suited to address the growing global demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 单一原料和产品：PDH只使用丙烷作为原料，主要生产丙烯，简化了生产过程。

2. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用非常规天然气（如页岩气）中丰富且廉价的轻烷烃资源。

3. 工艺效率：作为直接转化过程，PDH比传统的裂解方法更有效率。

4. 成本效益：原材料的广泛可用性和简化的工艺使PDH成为一个低成本选择。

5. 满足需求：PDH有助于满足传统副产品方法无法满足的不断扩大的丙烯市场需求。

6. 选择性：PDH的单一产品性质允许高丙烯选择性。

然而，由于反应的吸热性质，PDH仍面临着提高抗积碳性和防止活性位点烧结的挑战。总的来说，与传统方法相比，PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了一种更有针对性、更高效和更经济的方法，使其非常适合解决不断增长的全球需求。
