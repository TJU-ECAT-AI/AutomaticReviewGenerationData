[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."

[3] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources"

[4] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has become the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Single feedstock and product: PDH uses only propane as input and produces propylene as the main product, simplifying the process. 

2. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize abundant and cheap light alkane sources like shale gas, addressing feedstock constraints of conventional methods.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient than cracking methods that produce propylene as a by-product.

4. Cost-effectiveness: The simple process and cheap feedstock make PDH a low-cost production route.

5. Selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity compared to cracking processes.

6. Meeting demand: PDH helps address the expanded market demand for propylene that traditional production methods cannot satisfy.

These advantages make PDH technology highly effective and competitive for large-scale propylene production to meet growing global demand.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术已成为丙烯生产最有前景的方法,原因在于它具有几个关键优势:

1. 单一原料和产品:PDH仅使用丙烷作为输入,并以丙烯为主要产品,简化了生产过程。

2. 原料可用性:PDH可以利用丰富且廉价的轻烷烃资源,如页岩气,解决了传统方法的原料限制问题。

3. 工艺效率:作为直接转化工艺,PDH比生产丙烯作为副产品的裂解方法更有效率。

4. 成本效益:简单的工艺和廉价的原料使PDH成为一种低成本的生产路线。

5. 选择性:与裂解工艺相比,PDH可以实现较高的丙烯选择性。

6. 满足需求:PDH有助于满足传统生产方法无法满足的不断扩大的丙烯市场需求。

这些优势使PDH技术成为满足全球不断增长的需求的高效且具有竞争力的大规模丙烯生产技术。
