[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."

[3] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources"

[4] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Single feedstock and product: PDH uses only propane as input and produces propylene as the main product, simplifying the process.

2. Abundant and cheap raw materials: The exploitation of unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas has made propane widely available at low costs.

3. Cost-effectiveness: PDH is a low-cost process compared to traditional methods.

4. Meeting growing demand: Unlike traditional by-product methods from naphtha and coal cracking, PDH can meet the expanding market demand for propylene.

5. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers higher efficiency than conventional multi-step methods.

6. Improved selectivity: The single-product nature of PDH allows for better control and higher selectivity towards propylene.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)已成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，主要由于以下几个关键优势：

1. 单一原料和产品：PDH仅使用丙烷作为输入，并以丙烯为主要产品，简化了生产过程。

2. 原料丰富且廉价：非常规天然气如页岩气的开发使丙烷变得广泛可得且成本低廉。

3. 成本效益高：与传统方法相比，PDH是一个低成本的过程。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：与传统的石脑油和煤炭裂解副产品方法不同，PDH可以满足不断扩大的丙烯市场需求。

5. 过程效率高：作为一种直接转化过程，PDH比传统的多步骤方法提供了更高的效率。

6. 选择性提高：PDH的单一产品性质允许更好的控制和更高的丙烯选择性。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
