          [1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."

[3] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources"

[4] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost"

[5] "The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Single feedstock and product: PDH uses only propane as input and produces propylene as the main product, simplifying the process.

2. Abundant and cheap raw materials: The exploitation of unconventional natural gas sources like shale gas has made propane widely available at low costs.

3. Wide availability of feedstock: Propane is available from various sources.

4. Cost-effectiveness: The simple process and cheap feedstock make PDH a low-cost production route.

5. Meeting growing demand: Unlike traditional by-product methods from naphtha and coal cracking, PDH can meet the expanding market demand for propylene.

6. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers higher efficiency than conventional multi-step methods.

7. Improved selectivity: The single-product nature of PDH allows for better control and higher selectivity towards propylene.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods. However, PDH still faces challenges in improving coke resistance and preventing sintering of active sites due to the endothermic nature of the reaction.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其多项关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 单一原料和产品：PDH仅使用丙烷作为输入，主要产品为丙烯，简化了生产过程。

2. 原料丰富且价格低廉：非常规天然气（如页岩气）的开发提供了丰富且价格低廉的轻烃资源，包括丙烷。

3. 原料来源广泛：丙烷可从多种来源获得。

4. 成本效益：简单的工艺和廉价的原料使PDH成为一种低成本的生产路线。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：与传统的石脑油和煤炭裂解副产品方法不同，PDH可以满足不断扩大的丙烯市场需求。

6. 工艺效率高：作为一种直接转化工艺，PDH比传统多步骤方法提供了更高的效率。

7. 产品选择性高：PDH的单一产品特性使其能够实现更好的控制和对丙烯的高选择性。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。然而，由于反应的吸热性质，PDH仍面临着提高抗积碳性和防止活性位点烧结的挑战。
