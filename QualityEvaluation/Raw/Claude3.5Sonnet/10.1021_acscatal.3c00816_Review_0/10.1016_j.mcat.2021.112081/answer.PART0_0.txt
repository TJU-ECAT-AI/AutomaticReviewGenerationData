[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."

[3] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources"

[4] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Single feedstock and product: PDH uses only propane as input and produces propylene as the main product, simplifying the process.

2. Abundant and cheap raw materials: The exploitation of unconventional natural gas like shale gas has provided plentiful and inexpensive light alkane sources, including propane.

3. Wide availability of feedstock: Propane is widely available from various sources.

4. Low cost: The PDH process is cost-effective compared to traditional methods.

5. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH can meet the expanded market demand for propylene that traditional by-product production from naphtha and coal cracking can no longer satisfy.

6. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers improved efficiency compared to traditional multi-step methods.

7. Product selectivity: The single-product nature of PDH allows for high selectivity towards propylene.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其多项关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 单一原料和产品：PDH仅使用丙烷作为输入，主要产品为丙烯，简化了生产过程。

2. 原料丰富且价格低廉：非常规天然气（如页岩气）的开发提供了丰富且价格低廉的轻烃资源，包括丙烷。

3. 原料来源广泛：丙烷可从多种来源获得。

4. 成本低：与传统方法相比，PDH工艺具有成本效益。

5. 解决供需缺口：PDH可以满足传统石脑油和煤裂解副产品生产方式无法满足的不断扩大的丙烯市场需求。

6. 工艺效率高：作为一种直接转化工艺，PDH比传统多步骤方法提供了更高的效率。

7. 产品选择性高：PDH的单一产品特性使其能够实现对丙烯的高选择性。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
