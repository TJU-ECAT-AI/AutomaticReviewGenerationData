<quotes>

[1] "Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates"

[2] "Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal, which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore."

[3] "On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources"

[4] "The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Single feedstock and product: PDH uses only propane as input and produces propylene as the main product, simplifying the process.

2. Abundant and cheap raw materials: The exploitation of unconventional natural gas like shale gas has provided plentiful and inexpensive light alkane sources, including propane.

3. Wide availability of feedstock: Propane is widely available from various sources.

4. Low cost: The PDH process is cost-effective compared to traditional methods.

5. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH can meet the expanded market demand for propylene that traditional by-product production from naphtha and coal cracking can no longer satisfy.

6. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers improved efficiency compared to traditional multi-step methods.

7. Product selectivity: The single-product nature of PDH allows for high selectivity towards propylene.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.
