[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[3] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Economic viability: PDH is more economical compared to traditional methods.

2. Environmental friendliness: It generates less CO2 emissions than thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha.

3. Energy efficiency: PDH requires less energy input than conventional methods.

4. Feedstock flexibility: It uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than crude oil-derived naphtha.

5. High selectivity: Alumina-supported Pt catalysts used in PDH have superior ability to activate C-H bonds while maintaining low activity in C-C bond cleavage, leading to high propylene selectivity.

However, the technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and Pt sintering. Addressing these issues is crucial for improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 经济可行性：与传统方法相比，PDH更加经济。

2. 环境友好：与石脑油的热裂解或催化裂解相比，产生的二氧化碳排放量更少。

3. 能源效率：PDH所需的能量投入比传统方法少。

4. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，比原油衍生的石脑油更容易获得。

5. 高选择性：PDH中使用的铝氧化物负载铂催化剂具有优越的C-H键活化能力，同时保持C-C键裂解活性低，从而导致丙烯选择性高。

然而，该技术仍面临挑战，特别是在催化剂因积碳沉积和铂烧结而失活方面。解决这些问题对提高PDH过程的整体效率和可持续性至关重要。
