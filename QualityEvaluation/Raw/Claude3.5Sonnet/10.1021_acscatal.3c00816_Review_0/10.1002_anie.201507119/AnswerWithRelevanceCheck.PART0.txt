          [1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

          [2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

          [3] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."

          [4] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

          1. Economic viability: PDH is more economical compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha.

          2. Environmental friendliness: It generates fewer CO2 emissions and requires less energy than conventional processes.

          3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than crude oil-derived naphtha, addressing challenges related to feedstock availability.

          4. Process efficiency: The use of alumina-supported Pt catalysts enables efficient activation of C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage, enhancing overall process efficiency.

          5. High product selectivity: PDH technology can achieve high selectivity for propylene production, with some catalysts achieving >99% selectivity.

          6. Reduced side reactions: The low activity in C-C bond cleavage of the alumina-supported Pt catalyst minimizes unwanted side reactions.

          These advantages directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and Pt sintering. Ongoing research, such as the development of improved catalysts with superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties, aims to address these issues and further enhance the efficiency and stability of the PDH process.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

          1. 经济可行性：与传统的石脑油热裂解或催化裂解相比，PDH更具经济性。

          2. 环境友好：与传统工艺相比，它产生的二氧化碳排放量更少，所需能源也更少。

          3. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，比原油衍生的石脑油更容易获得，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

          4. 工艺效率：使用氧化铝负载的铂催化剂能够高效活化C-H键，同时最大限度地减少C-C键断裂，提高了整体工艺效率。

          5. 高产品选择性：PDH技术可以实现高选择性的丙烯生产，某些催化剂可达到>99%的选择性。

          6. 减少副反应：氧化铝负载的铂催化剂在C-C键断裂方面的低活性最大限度地减少了不必要的副反应。

          这些优势直接解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。然而，PDH技术仍面临挑战，特别是在催化剂因积碳沉积和铂烧结而失活方面。正在进行的研究，如开发具有优越抗结焦和抗烧结性能的改进催化剂，旨在解决这些问题，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和稳定性。
