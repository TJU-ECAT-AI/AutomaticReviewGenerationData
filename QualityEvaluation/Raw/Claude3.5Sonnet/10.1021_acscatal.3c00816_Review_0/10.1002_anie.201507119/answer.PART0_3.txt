[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[3] "When used in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, this catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity for propylene formation with >99% selectivity, and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic efficiency: PDH is more economical compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha.

2. Environmental friendliness: PDH generates fewer CO2 emissions and requires less energy compared to conventional methods.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than crude-oil-derived naphtha.

4. High selectivity: The described catalyst achieves >99% selectivity for propylene formation, addressing the challenge of product selectivity.

5. Process efficiency: The catalyst shows excellent specific activity and superior anti-coking and anti-sintering properties, enhancing overall process efficiency.

6. Reduced side reactions: The low activity in C-C bond cleavage of the alumina-supported Pt catalyst minimizes unwanted side reactions.

These advantages directly address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making PDH technology a highly promising solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.
