[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[3] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic viability: PDH is more economical compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha.

2. Environmental friendliness: It generates fewer CO2 emissions and requires less energy than conventional processes.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than crude oil-derived naphtha.

4. Process efficiency: The use of alumina-supported Pt catalysts in PDH allows for efficient activation of paraffinic C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage.

5. Product selectivity: PDH technology can achieve high selectivity for propylene production.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and Pt sintering. Ongoing research, such as the development of improved catalysts like the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst described in this study, aims to address these issues and further enhance the efficiency and stability of the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 经济可行性：与传统的石脑油热裂解或催化裂解方法相比，PDH更具经济性。

2. 环境友好：与传统工艺相比，它产生的二氧化碳排放量更少，所需能源也更少。

3. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比于从原油衍生的石脑油，丙烷更容易获得。

4. 工艺效率：在PDH中使用氧化铝负载的铂催化剂，可以高效活化烷基C-H键，同时最大限度地减少C-C键断裂。

5. 产品选择性：PDH技术可以实现高选择性的丙烯生产。

然而，PDH技术仍面临挑战，特别是在催化剂失活方面，主要由于焦炭沉积和铂烧结。正在进行的研究，如本研究中描述的改进的PtSn/Al2O3片状催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些问题，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和稳定性。
