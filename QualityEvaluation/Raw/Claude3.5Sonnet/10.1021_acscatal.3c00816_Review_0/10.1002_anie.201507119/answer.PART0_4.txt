[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[3] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Economic viability: PDH is more economical compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha.

2. Environmental friendliness: It generates fewer CO2 emissions and requires less energy than conventional processes.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, addressing challenges related to feedstock availability faced by naphtha-based methods.

4. Process efficiency: The use of alumina-supported Pt catalysts enables efficient activation of C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage.

5. Product selectivity: PDH technology can achieve high propylene selectivity, addressing the selectivity challenges of conventional methods.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and Pt sintering. Ongoing research aims to overcome these issues and further improve the efficiency and stability of PDH processes.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在丙烯生产方面具有几个关键优势：

1. 经济可行性：与传统的石脑油热裂解或催化裂解方法相比，PDH更经济。

2. 环境友好：与传统工艺相比，PDH产生的二氧化碳排放更少，所需能源也更少。

3. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，解决了基于石脑油方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

4. 工艺效率：使用氧化铝负载的铂催化剂能够有效活化C-H键，同时最大限度地减少C-C键断裂。

5. 产品选择性：PDH技术可以实现高丙烯选择性，解决了传统方法的选择性挑战。

然而，PDH技术仍面临挑战，特别是由于积碳沉积和铂烧结导致的催化剂失活。正在进行的研究旨在克服这些问题，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和稳定性。
