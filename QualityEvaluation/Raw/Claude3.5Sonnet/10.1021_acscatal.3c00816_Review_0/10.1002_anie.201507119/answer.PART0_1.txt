[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[3] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic viability: PDH is more economical compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha.

2. Environmental friendliness: It generates fewer CO2 emissions and requires less energy than conventional processes.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH directly uses propane as feedstock, addressing challenges related to feedstock availability faced by naphtha-based methods.

4. Process efficiency: The use of alumina-supported Pt catalysts enables efficient activation of C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage.

5. Product selectivity: PDH technology can achieve high selectivity for propylene production.

However, the technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and Pt sintering. Ongoing research, such as the development of the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst described in this study, aims to address these issues and further improve the efficiency and stability of PDH processes.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 经济可行性：与传统的石脑油热裂解或催化裂解相比，PDH更具经济性。

2. 环境友好：与传统工艺相比，它产生的二氧化碳排放量更少，所需能源也更少。

3. 原料灵活性：PDH直接使用丙烷作为原料，解决了基于石脑油方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

4. 工艺效率：使用氧化铝负载的铂催化剂能够高效活化C-H键，同时最大限度地减少C-C键断裂。

5. 产品选择性：PDH技术可以实现高选择性的丙烯生产。

然而，该技术仍面临挑战，特别是在催化剂因积碳和铂烧结而失活方面。正在进行的研究，如本研究中描述的PtSn/Al2O3片状催化剂的开发，旨在解决这些问题，并进一步提高PDH过程的效率和稳定性。
