<quotes>

[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) to propylene represents an economical and environmentally friendly route compared to the traditional thermal or catalytic cracking of crude-oil-derived naphtha, which requires large amounts of energy and generates enormous CO2 emissions."

[2] "An alumina-supported Pt catalyst is a vital component of the DHP process owing to its superior ability to activate paraffinic CH bonds and its low activity in CC bond cleavage."

[3] "Nevertheless, the fast deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition or Pt sintering is still a major problem."

</quotes>

The propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Economic viability: PDH is more economical compared to traditional methods like thermal or catalytic cracking of naphtha.

2. Environmental friendliness: It generates fewer CO2 emissions and requires less energy than conventional processes.

3. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than crude oil-derived naphtha.

4. Process efficiency: The use of alumina-supported Pt catalysts in PDH allows for efficient activation of paraffinic C-H bonds while minimizing C-C bond cleavage.

5. Product selectivity: PDH technology can achieve high selectivity for propylene production.

However, PDH technology still faces challenges, particularly in terms of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and Pt sintering. Ongoing research, such as the development of improved catalysts like the PtSn/Al2O3 sheet catalyst described in this study, aims to address these issues and further enhance the efficiency and stability of the PDH process.
