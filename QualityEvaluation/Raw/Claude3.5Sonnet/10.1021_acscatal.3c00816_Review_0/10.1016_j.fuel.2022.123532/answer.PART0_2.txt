[1] "In recent years, propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their prominent economic performance."

[2] "However, the high cost of Pt- based catalysts and the unavoidable toxicity of CrOx-based catalysts are not enough to satisfy its evolving demand."

[3] "Accordingly, there is a growing desire for cheap and environment-friendly catalysts."

The literature does not directly address the specific advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. However, it does mention that propane dehydrogenation technologies have been rapidly applied and developed due to their economic performance. The text also highlights challenges with current catalysts, noting the high cost of Pt-based catalysts and the toxicity of CrOx-based catalysts. This has led to a growing demand for cheaper and more environmentally friendly catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. While these points suggest some advantages of PDH technology, the literature does not provide comprehensive information to fully answer the question about its specific benefits over conventional production methods.

文献并未直接讨论丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面相对于传统生产方法的具体优势。但是，它确实提到由于经济性能优异，丙烷脱氢技术已经得到快速应用和发展。文本还强调了当前催化剂面临的挑战，指出了基于铂的催化剂成本高昂，以及基于铬氧化物的催化剂具有不可避免的毒性。这导致了对更便宜、更环保的丙烷脱氢催化剂的需求不断增长。虽然这些点暗示了PDH技术的一些优势，但文献并未提供全面的信息来完整回答关于它相对于传统生产方法的具体优势的问题。
