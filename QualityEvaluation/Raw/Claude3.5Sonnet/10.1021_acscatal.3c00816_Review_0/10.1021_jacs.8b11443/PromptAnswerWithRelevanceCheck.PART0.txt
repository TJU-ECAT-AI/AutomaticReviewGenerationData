<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain information to answer the question about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology and its advantages for propylene production. The document appears to be a title and author list for a scientific article about propane dehydrogenation and cracking over a specific catalyst, but does not provide details about the broader context of PDH technology or its advantages compared to conventional production methods. Without more comprehensive information from the full text of the article or additional sources, it is not possible to address the specific points raised in the question regarding feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity for propylene production using PDH technology.
