[1] "With the increasing demand for propylene, besides conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, alternative production routes with high efficiency and low cost are highly expected"

[2] "Recently, driven by the development of exploring technology for shale gas, on-purpose non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) has caught much attention"

[3] "Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. High efficiency and low cost compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. Utilization of abundant propane feedstock from shale gas, addressing feedstock availability issues.

3. Higher selectivity to propylene, especially when using vanadium-based catalysts which are highly active and selective.

4. Good regeneration ability of catalysts, improving process efficiency.

5. On-purpose production of propylene to meet increasing demand, rather than as a byproduct.

PDH technology specifically addresses challenges of conventional methods by providing a more efficient, selective, and cost-effective route to produce propylene using readily available propane feedstock. It allows for dedicated propylene production to meet growing demand, while offering advantages in catalyst performance and process design.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解方法相比，具有较高的效率和较低的成本。

2. 利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷原料，解决了原料供应问题。

3. 对丙烯的选择性更高，特别是使用活性高、选择性好的钒基催化剂时。

4. 催化剂具有良好的再生能力，提高了工艺效率。

5. 有针对性地生产丙烯以满足日益增长的需求，而不是作为副产品。

PDH技术通过提供更高效、更有选择性和更具成本效益的路线来生产丙烯，并使用现成的丙烷原料，从而专门解决了传统方法面临的挑战。它允许专门生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求，同时在催化剂性能和工艺设计方面提供优势。
