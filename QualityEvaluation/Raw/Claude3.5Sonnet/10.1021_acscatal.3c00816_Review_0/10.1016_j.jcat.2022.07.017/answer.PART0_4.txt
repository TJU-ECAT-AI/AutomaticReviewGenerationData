Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. High efficiency and low cost: PDH is an alternative production route that offers higher efficiency and lower costs compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, on-purpose production of propylene, addressing the increasing demand more directly than conventional methods.

3. Utilization of shale gas: The development of PDH technology has been driven by advancements in shale gas exploration, allowing for better utilization of this feedstock.

4. Improved catalysts: Vanadium-based catalysts used in PDH show high activity and selectivity towards propylene, as well as good regeneration ability. This addresses challenges in product selectivity faced by conventional methods.

5. Feedstock availability: By using propane as a feedstock, PDH takes advantage of the increased availability of light hydrocarbons from shale gas production.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, PDH technology likely also offers advantages in terms of process simplicity and reduced energy consumption compared to traditional steam cracking methods, further contributing to its promise as a propylene production method.
