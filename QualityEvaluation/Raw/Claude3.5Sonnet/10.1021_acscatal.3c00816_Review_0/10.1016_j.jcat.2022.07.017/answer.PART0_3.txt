[1] "Propylene serves as a key basic feedstock for the production of various chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, etc. With the increasing demand for propylene, besides conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, alternative production routes with high efficiency and low cost are highly expected"

[2] "Recently, driven by the development of exploring technology for shale gas, on-purpose non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) has caught much attention"

[3] "Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability"

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it promising for propylene production include:

1. High efficiency and low cost compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

2. On-purpose production of propylene, allowing better control over output.

3. Utilization of propane from shale gas as feedstock, addressing feedstock availability challenges.

4. High selectivity to propylene, especially with vanadium-based catalysts.

5. Good regeneration ability of catalysts, improving process efficiency.

PDH specifically addresses challenges of conventional methods by offering a dedicated propylene production route with better feedstock flexibility (using propane), improved efficiency through catalyst innovations, and enhanced selectivity to the desired propylene product. This helps meet growing propylene demand more economically and sustainably than traditional cracking processes.
