          [1] "With the increasing demand for propylene, besides conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, alternative production routes with high efficiency and low cost are highly expected"

          [2] "Recently, driven by the development of exploring technology for shale gas, on-purpose non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) has caught much attention"

          [3] "Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability"

          [4] "Propylene serves as a key basic feedstock for the production of various chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, etc."

          The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production include:

          1. High efficiency and low cost compared to conventional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.
          
          2. On-purpose production of propylene, allowing better control over output to meet increasing demand.
          
          3. Utilization of abundant propane feedstock from shale gas, addressing feedstock availability issues.
          
          4. Higher selectivity to propylene, especially when using vanadium-based catalysts which are highly active and selective.
          
          5. Good regeneration ability of catalysts, improving process efficiency and sustainability.
          
          6. Flexibility in production, providing a dedicated route for propylene rather than as a byproduct.

          PDH technology specifically addresses challenges of conventional methods by providing a more efficient, selective, and cost-effective route to produce propylene using readily available propane feedstock. It allows for targeted propylene production to meet growing demand, while offering advantages in catalyst performance and process design. This helps meet the increasing global demand for propylene more economically and sustainably than traditional cracking processes.

          丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术成为丙烯生产最有前景方法的主要优势包括：

          1. 与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解相比，效率高、成本低。

          2. 定向生产丙烯，可以更好地控制产量，满足不断增长的需求。

          3. 利用页岩气中丰富的丙烷原料，解决了原料供应问题。

          4. 对丙烯的选择性更高，特别是使用活性高、选择性好的钒基催化剂时。

          5. 催化剂具有良好的再生能力，提高了工艺效率和可持续性。

          6. 生产灵活性高，提供专门的丙烯生产路线，而不是作为副产品。

          PDH技术通过提供更高效、更有选择性和更具成本效益的路线来生产丙烯，并使用现成的丙烷原料，从而专门解决了传统方法面临的挑战。它允许有针对性地生产丙烯以满足不断增长的需求，同时在催化剂性能和工艺设计方面提供优势。这有助于比传统的裂解工艺更经济、更可持续地满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求。
