[1] "Propylene serves as a key basic feedstock for the production of various chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, etc. With the increasing demand for propylene, besides conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, alternative production routes with high efficiency and low cost are highly expected"

[2] "Recently, driven by the development of exploring technology for shale gas, on-purpose non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) has caught much attention"

[3] "Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability"

Based on the information provided, propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. High efficiency: PDH is described as an "on-purpose" technology, suggesting it is specifically designed for propylene production, which likely leads to higher efficiency compared to conventional methods.

2. Low cost: The text mentions that PDH is an alternative production route with "low cost," addressing economic challenges faced by conventional methods.

3. Selectivity: Vanadium-based catalysts used in PDH are noted to be highly selective to propylene, which is crucial for maximizing desired product yield.

4. Feedstock availability: PDH's development is linked to shale gas exploration, indicating it can utilize abundant propane resources from natural gas, addressing feedstock availability issues.

5. Regeneration ability: The catalysts used in PDH, particularly vanadium-based ones, show good regeneration ability, which can contribute to longer catalyst life and reduced operational costs.

6. Addressing increasing demand: PDH is presented as a solution to meet the growing global demand for propylene, which conventional methods may struggle to satisfy.

While the text doesn't explicitly compare PDH to conventional methods in all aspects, it implies that PDH addresses challenges in feedstock availability (through use of propane from shale gas), process efficiency (as an on-purpose technology), and product selectivity (with highly selective catalysts).

根据提供的信息，丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 高效率：PDH被描述为一种"定向"技术，表明它是专门为丙烯生产设计的，这可能会导致比传统方法更高的效率。

2. 低成本：文中提到PDH是一种"低成本"的替代生产路线，解决了传统方法面临的经济挑战。

3. 选择性：PDH中使用的钒基催化剂被指出对丙烯具有高选择性，这对于最大化目标产品产率至关重要。

4. 原料可用性：PDH的发展与页岩气勘探技术联系在一起，表明它可以利用天然气中丰富的丙烷资源，解决了原料可用性问题。

5. 再生能力：PDH中使用的催化剂，特别是钒基催化剂，显示出良好的再生能力，这可以延长催化剂寿命并降低运营成本。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH被提出作为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的解决方案，而传统方法可能难以满足这一需求。

虽然文本并未在所有方面明确比较PDH和传统方法，但它暗示PDH解决了原料可用性（通过使用页岩气中的丙烷）、工艺效率（作为一种定向技术）和产品选择性（使用高选择性催化剂）方面的挑战。
