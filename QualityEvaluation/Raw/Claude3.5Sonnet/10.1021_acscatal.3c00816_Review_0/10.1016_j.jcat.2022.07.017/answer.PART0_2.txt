[1] "Propylene serves as a key basic feedstock for the production of various chemicals such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, etc. With the increasing demand for propylene, besides conventional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, alternative production routes with high efficiency and low cost are highly expected"

[2] "Recently, driven by the development of exploring technology for shale gas, on-purpose non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) has caught much attention"

[3] "Compared with Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, vanadium-based catalysts are found to be highly active and selective to propylene with good regeneration ability"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundant due to the shale gas boom. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is an on-purpose technology specifically designed for propylene production, offering higher efficiency compared to traditional methods like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene, especially when using advanced catalysts like vanadium-based ones, which are highly active and selective.

4. Cost-effectiveness: As an alternative route, PDH aims to provide propylene production with high efficiency and low cost.

5. Regeneration ability: Vanadium-based catalysts used in PDH show good regeneration ability, enhancing the overall process sustainability.

6. Flexibility: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, providing more flexibility in meeting the increasing demand compared to conventional methods where propylene is a co-product.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly attractive in addressing the growing global demand for propylene while overcoming limitations of traditional production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷，由于页岩气革命，丙烷供应充足。这解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的定向技术，与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化等传统方法相比，效率更高。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，特别是在使用先进的催化剂如钒基催化剂时，这些催化剂具有高活性和选择性。

4. 成本效益：作为一种替代路线，PDH旨在提供高效率和低成本的丙烯生产。

5. 再生能力：PDH中使用的钒基催化剂显示出良好的再生能力，提高了整个过程的可持续性。

6. 灵活性：PDH允许专门生产丙烯，与传统方法相比，在满足日益增长的需求方面提供了更大的灵活性，因为在传统方法中丙烯只是一种副产品。

这些优势使PDH技术在满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的同时，克服了传统生产方法的局限性，因此特别具有吸引力。
