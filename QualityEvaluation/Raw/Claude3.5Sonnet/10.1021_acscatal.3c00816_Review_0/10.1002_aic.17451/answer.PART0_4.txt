[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

[2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as feedstock, which is relatively abundant compared to the dwindling fossil fuel resources used in conventional methods like naphtha steam cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, focusing specifically on propylene production rather than generating multiple products simultaneously.

3. Product selectivity: The PDH process produces fewer by-products compared to conventional methods, allowing for higher propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting growing demands: As conventional methods struggle to keep up with increasing propylene demand, PDH offers a dedicated solution to bridge this gap.

5. Sustainability: By utilizing propane, which is often a by-product of other processes, PDH can potentially make more efficient use of existing resources.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by offering a more targeted, efficient, and potentially more sustainable approach to propylene production in the face of growing global demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解所使用的日益减少的化石燃料资源，丙烷相对更加丰富。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，专注于丙烯生产，而不是同时产生多种产品。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH过程产生的副产品较少，允许更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法难以跟上不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH提供了一个专门的解决方案来弥补这一差距。

5. 可持续性：通过利用丙烷（通常是其他过程的副产品），PDH可能更有效地利用现有资源。

这些优势解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战，在面对不断增长的全球需求时，提供了一种更有针对性、更高效、可能更可持续的丙烯生产方法。
