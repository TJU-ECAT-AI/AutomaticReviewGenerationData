<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

[2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Abundant feedstock: PDH utilizes propane, which is relatively abundant compared to the feedstocks used in conventional methods.

2. Fewer by-products: PDH produces fewer by-products compared to traditional propylene production methods like naphtha steam cracking.

3. Addresses growing demand: PDH helps meet the increasing global demand for propylene, which conventional methods struggle to satisfy.

4. Specific chemical production: PDH directly produces propylene, an important building block for various chemicals like propylene oxide and acrylonitrile.

5. Overcomes limitations of conventional methods: PDH addresses the challenges faced by traditional processes like naphtha steam cracking, which are becoming insufficient due to fossil energy consumption.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, PDH likely offers improved process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods, given its direct conversion of propane to propylene and fewer by-products.

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane as feedstock, which is relatively abundant compared to the diminishing fossil fuel resources used in conventional methods like naphtha steam cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, producing propylene from propane in a single step. This can lead to improved efficiency compared to multi-step conventional processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer by-products compared to conventional methods, allowing for higher propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting growing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet increasing propylene demand, PDH offers a solution to bridge this supply gap.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, potentially reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing a more readily available feedstock, offering a more efficient and selective process, and providing a scalable solution to meet growing propylene demand.
