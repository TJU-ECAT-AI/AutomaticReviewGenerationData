[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

[2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as feedstock, which is relatively abundant compared to the diminishing fossil fuel resources used in conventional methods like naphtha steam cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, which can be more efficient than traditional multi-step processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer by-products compared to conventional methods, leading to higher propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting growing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet increasing propylene demand, PDH offers a scalable solution to bridge the supply gap.

5. Sustainability: By using propane, a by-product of natural gas processing and oil refining, PDH helps in better resource utilization.

These advantages collectively address the challenges of feedstock scarcity, inefficiency, and low selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods, positioning PDH as a promising technology for the future of propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解所使用的日益减少的化石燃料资源，丙烷相对丰富。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，可能比传统的多步骤工艺更加高效。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH产生的副产品较少，从而导致更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法难以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH提供了一个可扩展的解决方案来弥补供应缺口。

5. 可持续性：通过使用天然气处理和石油精炼的副产品丙烷，PDH有助于更好地利用资源。

这些优势共同解决了传统丙烯生产方法面临的原料稀缺、效率低下和选择性低的挑战，使PDH成为未来丙烯生产的一项有前景的技术。
