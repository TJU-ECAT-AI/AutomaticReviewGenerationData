[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

[2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is relatively abundant compared to the diminishing fossil fuel resources used in conventional methods like naphtha steam cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, allowing for more efficient propylene production compared to traditional methods that involve multiple steps or complex separations.

3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer by-products compared to conventional methods, resulting in higher propylene selectivity and purity.

4. Meeting growing demands: As conventional production methods struggle to keep up with increasing propylene demand, PDH offers a scalable solution to bridge the supply gap.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by providing a more sustainable, efficient, and selective route to propylene production, helping to meet the growing global demand for this important chemical building block.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解所使用的日益减少的化石燃料资源，丙烷相对丰富。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，与涉及多个步骤或复杂分离的传统方法相比，允许更高效的丙烯生产。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH产生的副产品更少，从而提高了丙烯的选择性和纯度。

4. 满足增长需求：随着传统生产方法难以跟上不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH提供了一个可扩展的解决方案来弥补供应缺口。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，减少运输成本并提高供应链效率。

这些优势通过提供一种更可持续、高效和选择性的丙烯生产路线来解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，有助于满足这一重要化学基础原料不断增长的全球需求。
