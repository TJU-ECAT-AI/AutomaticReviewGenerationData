[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

[2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH uses propane as feedstock, which is relatively abundant compared to the diminishing fossil fuel resources used in conventional methods like naphtha steam cracking.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, producing propylene from propane in a single step. This can lead to improved efficiency compared to multi-step conventional processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH produces fewer by-products compared to conventional methods, allowing for higher propylene selectivity.

4. Meeting growing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet increasing propylene demand, PDH offers a solution to bridge this supply gap.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, potentially reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by utilizing a more readily available feedstock, offering a more efficient and selective process, and providing a scalable solution to meet growing propylene demand.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统方法如石脑油蒸汽裂解所使用的日益减少的化石燃料资源，丙烷相对丰富。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一个直接转化过程，在单一步骤中从丙烷生产丙烯。这可以带来比多步骤传统工艺更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH产生的副产品更少，允许更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法难以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH提供了一个解决这一供应缺口的方案。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，潜在地减少运输成本并提高供应链效率。

这些优势通过利用更容易获得的原料、提供更高效和选择性的工艺，以及提供可扩展的解决方案来满足不断增长的丙烯需求，从而解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战。
