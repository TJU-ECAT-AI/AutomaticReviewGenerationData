[1] "Propylene is one of the most important building blocks for producing a wide variety of chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and so on. With the consumption of fossil energy, the conventional propylene production process such as naphtha steam cracking can no longer meet the growing demands."

[2] "The direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene is thus attracting much attention due to the relatively abundant feedstock and less by-products."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Abundant feedstock: PDH utilizes propane, which is relatively abundant compared to the feedstocks used in conventional methods.

2. Fewer by-products: PDH produces fewer by-products compared to traditional propylene production methods like naphtha steam cracking.

3. Addresses growing demand: PDH helps meet the increasing global demand for propylene, which conventional methods struggle to satisfy.

4. Specific chemical production: PDH directly produces propylene, an important building block for various chemicals like propylene oxide and acrylonitrile.

5. Overcomes limitations of conventional methods: PDH addresses the challenges faced by traditional processes like naphtha steam cracking, which are becoming insufficient due to fossil energy consumption.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, PDH likely offers improved process efficiency and product selectivity compared to conventional methods, given its direct conversion of propane to propylene and fewer by-products.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 原料丰富：PDH利用相对丰富的丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法使用的原料更加充足。

2. 副产品更少：与传统的丙烯生产方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解）相比，PDH产生的副产品更少。

3. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH有助于满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，这是传统方法难以应对的挑战。

4. 特定化学品生产：PDH直接生产丙烯，丙烯是许多重要化学品（如环氧丙烷和丙烯腈）的关键原料。

5. 克服传统方法的局限性：PDH解决了传统工艺（如石脑油蒸汽裂解）面临的挑战，这些传统方法由于化石能源消耗而变得不足以满足需求。

虽然在给定的文本中没有明确说明，但考虑到PDH可以直接将丙烷转化为丙烯且副产品较少，它可能在工艺效率和产品选择性方面比传统方法有所提高。
