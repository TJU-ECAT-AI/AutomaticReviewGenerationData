The given literature does not provide any information to answer the question about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology and its advantages for propylene production. The text appears to be incomplete and only contains a title and author information for an article about Ga+-Chabazite Zeolite as a catalyst for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. Without access to the full article content, it is not possible to address the specific points raised in the question regarding PDH technology's benefits, challenges faced by conventional production methods, feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity.
