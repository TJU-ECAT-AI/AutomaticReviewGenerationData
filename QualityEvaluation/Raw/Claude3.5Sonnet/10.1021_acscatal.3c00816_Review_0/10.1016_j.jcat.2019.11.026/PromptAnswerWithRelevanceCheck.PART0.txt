[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein"

[2] "The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[3] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the large reserves of propane from shale gas deposits, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Growing demand: PDH directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production method.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is designed specifically to produce propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity than conventional methods.

5. Alternatives to existing catalysts: PDH technology allows for the development of new catalysts to overcome limitations of current commercial catalysts, such as the high cost of Pt-based catalysts and toxicity issues with Cr-based catalysts.

While the literature doesn't explicitly compare PDH to all conventional production methods, it suggests that PDH can address challenges in feedstock availability and product selectivity while offering opportunities to improve process efficiency through catalyst development.
