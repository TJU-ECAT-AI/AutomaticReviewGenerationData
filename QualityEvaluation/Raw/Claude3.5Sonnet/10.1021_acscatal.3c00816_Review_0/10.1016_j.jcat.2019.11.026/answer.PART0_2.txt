[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein"

[2] "The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[3] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the large reserves of propane from shale gas deposits, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to indirect methods of propylene production.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene, which is crucial given the increasing global demand for this key commodity chemical.

4. Economic benefits: PDH provides an alternative to expensive platinum-based catalysts used in conventional processes like Oleflex.

5. Environmental considerations: PDH with alternative catalysts can address the toxicity issues associated with chromium-based catalysts used in processes like Catofin.

However, the development of cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts remains a challenge for further improving PDH technology. The research on cobalt-based catalysts presented in this paper aims to address these limitations of current commercial PDH processes.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气储量中的大量丙烷，解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：作为一种直接转化工艺，PDH与间接丙烯生产方法相比可能具有更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，这对于满足这种关键大宗化学品日益增长的全球需求至关重要。

4. 经济效益：PDH为传统工艺（如Oleflex）中使用的昂贵铂基催化剂提供了一种替代方案。

5. 环境考虑：采用替代催化剂的PDH可以解决与Catofin等工艺中使用的铬基催化剂相关的毒性问题。

然而，开发经济高效和环境友好的催化剂仍然是进一步改进PDH技术的一个挑战。本文介绍的钴基催化剂研究旨在解决当前商业PDH工艺的这些局限性。
