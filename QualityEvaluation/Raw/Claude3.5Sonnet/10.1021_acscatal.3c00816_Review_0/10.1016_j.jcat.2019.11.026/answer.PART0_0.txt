[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein"

[2] "The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[3] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize the large reserves of propane from shale gas deposits, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability.

2. Growing demand: PDH directly addresses the increasing global demand for propylene by providing a dedicated production method.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is designed specifically to produce propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity than conventional methods.

5. Alternatives to existing catalysts: PDH technology allows for the development of new catalysts to overcome limitations of current commercial catalysts, such as the high cost of Pt-based catalysts and toxicity issues with Cr-based catalysts.

While the literature doesn't explicitly compare PDH to all conventional production methods, it suggests that PDH can address challenges in feedstock availability and product selectivity while offering opportunities to improve process efficiency through catalyst development.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用页岩气中大量的丙烷储备，解决了原料可用性的挑战。

2. 需求增长：PDH直接满足了全球日益增长的丙烯需求，提供了一种专门的生产方法。

3. 过程效率：作为一种直接转化过程，PDH与传统的将丙烯作为副产品生产的方法相比，可能提供更高的效率。

4. 产品选择性：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，可能比传统方法提供更高的选择性。

5. 现有催化剂的替代品：PDH技术允许开发新的催化剂，以克服当前商业催化剂的局限性，如基于Pt催化剂的高成本和基于Cr催化剂的毒性问题。

虽然文献没有明确将PDH与所有传统生产方法进行比较，但它表明PDH可以解决原料可用性和产品选择性方面的挑战，同时通过催化剂开发提供改善工艺效率的机会。
