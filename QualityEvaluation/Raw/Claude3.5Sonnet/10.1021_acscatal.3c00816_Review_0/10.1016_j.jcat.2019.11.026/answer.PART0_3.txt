[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein"

[2] "The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[3] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes the abundant propane reserves from shale gas deposits, addressing the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers potentially higher efficiency compared to traditional multi-step processes for propylene production.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity towards propylene, which is crucial given the increasing demand for this specific product.

4. Economic viability: While current commercial PDH processes use expensive Pt-based or toxic Cr-based catalysts, ongoing research (as discussed in this paper) aims to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, potentially improving the economic viability of the process.

5. Flexibility: PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, providing flexibility to adjust production based on market demands.

These advantages make PDH particularly attractive in addressing the growing global demand for propylene, especially in regions with access to shale gas resources. However, challenges remain in catalyst development to overcome the limitations of current commercial catalysts and further improve the process efficiency and sustainability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用页岩气储量中丰富的丙烷，解决了传统方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH相比传统的多步骤丙烯生产工艺可能提供更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，这对于满足日益增长的特定产品需求至关重要。

4. 经济可行性：虽然目前商业PDH工艺使用昂贵的铂基或有毒的铬基催化剂，但正在进行的研究（如本文所讨论的）旨在开发更具成本效益和环境友好的催化剂，有望提高该工艺的经济可行性。

5. 灵活性：PDH允许定向生产丙烯，提供了根据市场需求调整生产的灵活性。

这些优势使PDH在满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求方面特别具有吸引力，尤其是在能够获得页岩气资源的地区。然而，在催化剂开发方面仍然存在挑战，需要克服当前商业催化剂的局限性，并进一步提高工艺效率和可持续性。
