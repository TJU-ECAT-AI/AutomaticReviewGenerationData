[1] "Propylene is a key commodity chemical for the manufacture of a wide variety of products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acetone, acrylonitrile and acrolein"

[2] "The increasing global demand of propylene and a large reserve of propane in shale-gas deposits are drawing interests in employing catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene."

[3] "The commercial PDH processes are based on two kinds of primary technologies, the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst and the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst"

[4] "However, the high price of Pt metal and the serious toxicity issue of Cr catalyst greatly restrict the further development of the PDH process."

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which is abundant in shale gas reserves. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient than traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct of other processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity for propylene, allowing for more targeted production compared to conventional methods.

4. Growing demand: PDH helps meet the increasing global demand for propylene, which is used in manufacturing various important products.

5. Alternative to existing catalysts: PDH technology offers the potential to develop more cost-effective and environmentally friendly catalysts, addressing the issues of high costs associated with Pt-based catalysts and toxicity concerns with Cr-based catalysts used in current commercial processes.

These advantages position PDH as a promising solution to address challenges in propylene production, including feedstock limitations, process inefficiencies, and environmental concerns associated with conventional methods.
