[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 1 bar and 600 C."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Addressing propylene shortfall: PDH directly addresses the growing demand for propylene that cannot be met by traditional steam cracking methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Process selectivity: PDH is a more selective process for propylene production compared to steam cracking, which produces multiple products.

4. Independence from ethylene production: Unlike steam cracking, PDH allows propylene production to be decoupled from ethylene production, addressing the faster growth in propylene demand.

5. Mild operating conditions: PDH can be performed at relatively mild conditions (e.g. 1 bar pressure), potentially offering energy efficiency benefits.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, PDH technology likely offers improved process efficiency and better control over product selectivity compared to conventional methods, making it a promising solution for meeting the growing global propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 解决丙烯短缺：PDH直接解决了传统蒸汽裂解方法无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解使用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 工艺选择性：与产生多种产品的蒸汽裂解相比，PDH对丙烯生产的选择性更高。

4. 独立于乙烯生产：与蒸汽裂解不同，PDH允许丙烯生产与乙烯生产解耦，解决了丙烯需求增长更快的问题。

5. 温和的操作条件：PDH可以在相对温和的条件下进行（例如1巴压力），可能提供能源效率方面的优势。

虽然在给定的文本中没有明确说明，但与传统方法相比，PDH技术可能提供了改进的工艺效率和更好的产品选择性控制，使其成为满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求的一个有前景的解决方案。
