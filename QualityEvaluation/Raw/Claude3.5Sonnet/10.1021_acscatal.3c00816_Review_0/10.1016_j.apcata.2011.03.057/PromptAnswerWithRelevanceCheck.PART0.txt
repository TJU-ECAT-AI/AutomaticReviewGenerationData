[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered promising for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene that outpaces ethylene demand.

2. It helps overcome the shortfall in propylene supply from traditional steam cracking methods.

3. It allows for dedicated propylene production, unlike steam cracking which produces multiple products.

4. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in steam cracking.

5. PDH offers potentially higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking.

6. It provides more flexibility in adjusting propylene output based on market demands.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, PDH technology likely offers improved process efficiency compared to conventional methods, as it is a more direct route to propylene. However, the document does not provide specific details on efficiency comparisons or quantitative data on selectivity advantages.
