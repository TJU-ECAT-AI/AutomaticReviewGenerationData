[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor at 1 bar and 600 C."

[3] "The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity to olefins."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it promising for propylene production:

1. Addresses supply shortfall: PDH directly addresses the growing demand for propylene that cannot be met by traditional steam cracking methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to steam cracking, which produces multiple products.

4. Improved selectivity: The use of catalysts like PtSn improves selectivity towards propylene.

5. Tailored production: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, unlike steam cracking which co-produces ethylene.

6. Mild operating conditions: The process can be carried out at relatively low pressure (1 bar), making it less energy-intensive than some alternatives.

7. Catalyst innovations: Ongoing research into catalysts like PtSn/ZnAl2O4 is improving stability and reducing coke formation, addressing key challenges in the PDH process.

These advantages make PDH technology well-suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 解决供应短缺：PDH直接解决了传统蒸汽裂解方法无法满足的日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：与生产多种产品的蒸汽裂解相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。

4. 提高选择性：使用PtSn等催化剂可以提高对丙烯的选择性。

5. 定制生产：PDH允许专门生产丙烯，不像蒸汽裂解会同时生产乙烯。

6. 温和的操作条件：该过程可以在相对较低的压力（1巴）下进行，比一些替代方案更节能。

7. 催化剂创新：对PtSn/ZnAl2O4等催化剂的持续研究正在提高稳定性并减少积碳形成，解决了PDH过程中的关键挑战。

这些优势使PDH技术非常适合解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
