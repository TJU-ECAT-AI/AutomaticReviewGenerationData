[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Addresses supply shortfall: PDH directly addresses the growing demand for propylene that cannot be met by traditional steam cracking methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It uses propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Targeted production: PDH allows for the selective production of propylene without generating large quantities of other products like ethylene.

4. Process efficiency: The direct conversion of propane to propylene is more efficient than extracting propylene as a by-product of other processes.

5. Scalability: PDH plants can be built to meet specific market demands for propylene.

6. Independence from oil refining: Unlike steam cracking, PDH is not tied to oil refining processes, allowing for more flexibility in production.

While the document does not provide extensive details on process efficiency or product selectivity, PDH technology's ability to specifically target propylene production makes it a promising solution to the challenges faced by conventional methods in meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 解决供应短缺：PDH直接解决了传统蒸汽裂解方法无法满足的日益增长的丙烯需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 定向生产：PDH允许选择性地生产丙烯，而不会产生大量其他产品如乙烯。

4. 工艺效率：丙烷直接转化为丙烯比从其他过程中提取丙烯作为副产品更有效率。

5. 可扩展性：PDH工厂可以根据特定的丙烯市场需求进行建设。

6. 独立于石油炼制：与蒸汽裂解不同，PDH不依赖于石油炼制过程，允许更灵活的生产。

虽然文档没有提供关于工艺效率或产品选择性的详细信息，但PDH技术能够专门针对丙烯生产的特性使其成为解决传统方法在满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求方面所面临挑战的一个有前景的解决方案。
