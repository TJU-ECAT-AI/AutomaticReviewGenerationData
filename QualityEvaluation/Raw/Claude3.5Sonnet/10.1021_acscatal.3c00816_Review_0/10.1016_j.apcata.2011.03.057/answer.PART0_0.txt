[1] "The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology is considered promising for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene that outpaces ethylene demand.

2. It helps overcome the shortfall in propylene supply from traditional steam cracking methods.

3. It allows for dedicated propylene production, unlike steam cracking which produces multiple products.

4. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in steam cracking.

5. PDH offers potentially higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking.

6. It provides more flexibility in adjusting propylene output based on market demands.

While not explicitly stated in the given text, PDH technology likely offers improved process efficiency compared to conventional methods, as it is a more direct route to propylene. However, the document does not provide specific details on efficiency comparisons or quantitative data on selectivity advantages.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术被认为是丙烯生产的最有前景的方法，原因如下：

1. 它直接解决了丙烯需求增长快于乙烯的问题。

2. 它有助于克服传统蒸汽裂解方法中丙烯供应不足的问题。

3. 它允许专门生产丙烯，不像蒸汽裂解会产生多种产品。

4. 它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解使用的石脑油更容易获得。

5. PDH可能提供比蒸汽裂解更高的丙烯选择性。

6. 它提供了根据市场需求调整丙烯产量的更大灵活性。

虽然给定文本中没有明确说明，但PDH技术可能比传统方法提供更高的工艺效率，因为它是生产丙烯的更直接路线。然而，该文档并未提供关于效率比较或选择性优势的具体细节或定量数据。
