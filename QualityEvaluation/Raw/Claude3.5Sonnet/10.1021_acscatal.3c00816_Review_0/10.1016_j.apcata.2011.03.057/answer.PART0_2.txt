[1] "The primary production method of propylene in the petrochemical industry is naphtha cracking, wherein ethylene is co-produced. The demand for propylene world-wide is growing faster than ethylene, which causes a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking. As a result, propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortfall."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Addresses supply shortfall: PDH directly targets propylene production to meet the growing global demand that is outpacing ethylene demand.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in conventional cracking.

3. Process efficiency: PDH is a dedicated process for propylene, unlike naphtha cracking which produces multiple products.

4. Product selectivity: PDH offers higher propylene selectivity compared to naphtha cracking, where propylene is a co-product.

5. Independence from ethylene production: PDH decouples propylene production from ethylene, allowing producers to adjust output based on market demand.

While not explicitly stated in the text, PDH likely also offers advantages in terms of energy efficiency and reduced carbon footprint compared to naphtha cracking, making it more sustainable in the long run.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 解决供应短缺：PDH直接针对丙烯生产，以满足超过乙烯需求增长的全球需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统裂解所用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：PDH是专门用于丙烯生产的工艺，不像石脑油裂解会产生多种产品。

4. 产品选择性：与石脑油裂解相比，PDH提供更高的丙烯选择性，在石脑油裂解中丙烯只是副产品。

5. 独立于乙烯生产：PDH将丙烯生产与乙烯脱钩，允许生产商根据市场需求调整产量。

虽然文中没有明确说明，但PDH可能在能源效率和减少碳足迹方面也比石脑油裂解有优势，从长远来看使其更具可持续性。
