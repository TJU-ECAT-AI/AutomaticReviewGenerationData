Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most effective methods to produce propylene. But the industrial Pt-based catalysts often suffer from short-term stability under the high temperature reaction environment (500–700°C) via sintering and coke deposition. Herein, stable PDH reaction in high propylene yield has been achieved by the confinement of Pt–Zn intermetallic alloys (IMAs) in the channels of silicalite-1. Single-site Zn in the MFI framework was found to play a key role on assisting and stabilizing the PtZn IMAs for efficient PDH. By the cooperative action of the spatial confined PtZn IMAs and the lattice confined framework Zn, high propylene selectivity (>99%) without obvious deactivation was realized on the as-developed catalyst (PtZn@S-1) under 600°C even after 90 h. The low deactivation constant (0.003 h−1) was 6 times lower than that of the industrial PtSn catalyst.
1 INTRODUCTION
Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks in the global economy for the production of various chemicals and fuels.1-4 The worldwide increasing demand of propylene together with the increasing availability of propane from clean energy source as shale gas has spurred interest in on-purpose production of propylene via direct dehydrogenation.5-9 Pt-based catalysts are widely used in industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes because of their superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage.10-12 High reaction temperature (500–700°C) is required to reach reasonable conversion level. Inevitably, alkane dehydrogenation is accompanied by coking via undesired side reactions and sintering via the growth of platinum particles, which greatly reduces the activity and stability of the catalysts.
The introduction of a second metal (Sn,13-17 Ga,18-20 Zn,12, 21-28 In,29 Cu,30, 31 Co,32 Mn,33 Ni,34 etc.) is an efficient way to suppress coke formation and Pt sintering. A series of results evidenced that the second metal increased the electron density of the platinum sites in Pt–M alloys, weakened Pt-olefin binding and thus inhibited the formation of coke precursors.29 The as-involved side reactions of cracking and hydrogenolysis are structure-sensitive, which are promoted on lager Pt ensembles.30 The formation of Pt–M alloy with surface isolated Pt atoms could eliminate the structure-sensitive hydrogenolysis pathway.21, 35 Meanwhile, the structure-insensitive alkane dehydrogenation was not affected. Miller and co-workers prepared silica-supported Pt–Zn intermetallic alloy (IMA) which displayed high ethylene selectivity (∼100%) during ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) at 600°C.21 Under high temperature reduction condition, contiguous Pt atoms prefer to be isolated into single atoms to form Pt–Zn intermetallic nanoparticles.25, 36 Besides, Gong group prepared the Pt/Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) by an impregnation method which showed excellent stability and propylene selectivity for at least 120 h on stream at 520°C.30 DFT calculations showed the isolated Pt atoms exhibited a quite low binding strength of propylene. Nevertheless, the stability of the isolated Pt catalyst rapidly decreased at 550°C due to the sintering of metal particles. The stability of atomic dilution Pt-based alloy catalysts at high temperature needs to be further improved.
Several efforts have been devoted to developing new strategies for stabilizing metal nanoparticles against sintering. The encapsulation strategy is an efficient method to protect metal nanoparticles from agglomeration and sintering through spatial confinement.37-41 Zeolites with ordered microporous structures and excellent thermal stability have been proved as ideal supports for fixing small metal nanoparticles.42-46 Corma and co-workers prepared PtSn clusters encapsulated in the sinusoidal channels of MFI zeolite via a ligand-assisted method, which showed high stability and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.6 Furthermore, catalytic stability was significantly improved by prolonging prereduction time due to the increased percentage of PtSn interaction as measured by the quasi in situ STEM.47 Yu et al. developed a ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method for encapsulating subnanometric Pt3 core–Zn shell clusters into five/six-membered-ring channel of silicalite-1 zeolite and achieved superefficient performance for PDH conversions at 550°C.48 Recently, Coperet and co-workers generated stable metallic nanoalloys by grafting additional single-site metal sites on amorphous silica (Pt0Znδ+/SiO225 and Pt0Gaδ+/SiO219). To the best of our knowledge, high-temperature (≥600°C) stability in high propylene yield should be further improved for the PDH reaction with the use of IMA catalysts.
Herein, we report the introduction of Zn single-site into silicalite-1 zeolite framework for the tailored confinement of PtZn IMA to push the limit of stable and efficient PDH. Pt–Zn intermetallic nanoalloys (IMAs) have been encapsulated within Zn-modified MFI zeolite. First, a Zn-containing MFI zeolite (Zn-MFI) was prepared via hydrothermal synthesis and Pt was simultaneously introduced by the stabilization of metal precursors using amino ligands. Sequential calcination and high temperature reduction treatments were used for the partly demetallation of Zn framework atoms and alloying with Pt species to generate PtZn IMAs (Scheme 1). The formation of PtZn IMAs was confirmed through detailed characterizations such as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra and CO-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (CO-FTIR). The PtZn@S-1 catalyst exhibited high propylene selectivity (99.3%) with a WHSV of 5.9 h−1 at 600°C. 40.2% Propane conversion was retained even after 90 h on stream. The deactivation constant was as low as 0.003 h−1 and coke formation was only 0.002 g coke/g cat, demonstrating the superior performance for high temperature PDH.

2 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1 Catalyst preparation
2.1.1 Synthesis of silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolite
Nano-sized silicalite-1 zeolites were synthesized at 170°C for 4 days under conventional hydrothermal conditions. The mole composition of mixing gel was 1.0 SiO2: 35 H2O: 0.4 TPAOH (25 wt%, J&K Scientific Ltd.). First, mix certain amount deionized water with 6.5 g TPAOH solution and then continuously stir for 10 min. Add 4.16 g TEOS (Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) dropwise and stir for 6 h until the solution clear. Transfer the gel in a 100 mL teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave at 170°C for 4 days. Wash the prepared zeolite with ethanol and water for three times. The sample was dried at 100°C for 12 h and then calcined at 550°C in the furnace for 8 h.
2.1.2 Synthesis of PtZn@S-1, K-PtZn@S-1, and Pt@S-1 catalyst
PtZn@S-1 was prepared with the molar composition of 1.0 SiO2:0.4 TPAOH:35 H2O:0.0015 Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (99%, J&K Scientific Ltd.): 0.009 Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99%, Aladdin) with the same procedure as the synthesis method of silicalite-1 zeolites. K-PtZn@S-1 was prepared by similar method with the addition of KNO3 (99.9%, Aladdin) solution.
2.1.3 Synthesis of PtZn/S-1 and Pt/S-1 catalyst
PtZn/S-1 (Pt 0.5 wt%, Zn 1.0 wt%) and Pt/S-1 (Pt 0.5 wt%) catalysts were prepared through typical impregnation method. 1.0 g calcined S-1 zeolite was mixed with the solution, which was prepared by 0.045 g Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.013 g H2PtCl6·6H2O (99%, Sino Platinum metals Co., Ltd.) and certain amount deionized water. The resulting sample was dried at 30°C for 12 h and 90°C for 12 h in the oven, followed by calcination at 550°C for 8 h in the furnace.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction detections were carried out by a Philips X'Pert MPD diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation source (0.154 nm) at 40 mA and 40 kV. The 2θ range was 5 to 60° with the scan rate of 5°/min or 1°/min.
Zeolite samples were embedded cured with epoxy resin (Spurr embedding agent: ERL 20 g, NSA 50 g, DER 16 g and DMAE 0.6 g). Add certain amount of sample powder into the bottom of the centrifuge tube with the embedding agent. Use a toothpick to mix the powder and embedding agent uniformly, and polymerize at 70°C overnight to make a series of ultra-thin slices (Leica uc7: slice thickness 40–60 nm, velocity 1.8 mm/s). The samples were observed under transmission electron microscope, which were conducted on a Talos F200X microscope.
29Si MAS NMR spectra (Agilent 600M) of the samples were transferred under ambient atmosphere into 4 mm zirconia rotos, obtained at 8 kHz spinning speed and measured by reference to tetramethylsilane (TMS). NMR spectra were record with an Agilent DSX-300 spectrometer.
N2 physisorption characterizations were conducted on a Micomeritics ASAP 2420 volumetric adsorption analyzer at −196°C. Before measurement, the zeolites were preheated under vacuum condition at 300°C overnight.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI instrument. The binding energy (BE) results were calibrated by turning that of C1s peak to 284.6 eV.
Elemental analysis characterization was quantified by an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Optima 2100DV).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) was collected on a Bruker FTIR spectrophotometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 by using coaddition of 64 scans. The zeolite powder was pressed into a small disc with dried KBr powder and characterized by FTIR under room temperature condition.
IR spectra of the carbon monoxide (CO-FTIR) adsorbed on zeolites was characterized on a Bruker FTIR spectrophotometer. The sample wafer (15 mg) was vacuumed at 400°C for 2 h. Then cooling to 50°C, the prepared samples were saturated with carbon monoxide. Then switch to argon to flush the instrument and record IR results at 10, 15, 25, 45, 60 min. The reason for the long-term flushing is to eliminate the physical adsorbed carbon monoxide.
FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption on the zeolites were conducted on a Bruker FTIR spectrophotometer. The sample wafer (15 mg) was vacuumed at 400°C for 2 h and then cooled to 50°C. The samples were saturated with pyridine vapor and then evacuated at 200 and 350°C for 30 min. Spectra were recorded in the range of 1700–1400 cm−1 by using coaddition with 64 scans. FTIR spectra of propylene adsorption were taken based on the similar procedure besides the catalysts were saturated with propylene and then evacuated at 60 and 400°C for 30 min.
The data of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were collected at room temperature in the fluorescent mode with a Lytle detector at beamline BL14W1 and BL15U1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, China).
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was conducted on an AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption instrument. Typically, 100 mg of samples were used for each measurement. The sample was pretreated at 500°C in the Helium gas flow for 30 min to eliminate impurities. After cooling to 50°C, the sample was saturated with 5% NH3/He and the gaseous and weakly adsorbed NH3 were subsequently removed by purge with He for 60 min. The temperature was raised to 800°C at a rate of 10°C/min and the NH3-TPD profile was recorded by a TCD detector.
Temperature-programmed desorption of hydrogen (H2-TPD) and propylene (C3H6-TPD) were also performed on the same instrument. The experimental procedures were similar. After pretreatment, for H2-TPD, the sample was saturated with 10% H2/Ar at 50°C and then purged with Argon at the same temperature for 1 h to remove the physical absorbed hydrogen. H2-TPD profile was recorded in flowing Ar at a heating rate of 10°C/min from 50 to 700°C. For the C3H6-TPD measurements, the sample was pretreated at 500°C in the Helium gas flow for 30 min. And then cooled to 100°C and treated under 25 vol% C3H6/He gas flow for 30 min. The gaseous and weakly adsorbed C3H6 were subsequently removed by purge with He for 60 min. Subsequently, the temperature was raised to 600°C at a rate of 10°C/min and the C3H6-TPD profile was recorded by a TCD detector. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was conducted on TGA Q50. The heat range was from 30 to 800°C with a rate of 10°C/min. An inVia Raman microscope (inVia Reflex) was used to detect the coke species using an excitation source of 532 nm.
2.3 Catalyst evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was tested in a fixed bed reactor. 0.2 g granular sample (20–40 mesh) and 2.0 g silicon carbide (20–40 mesh) were mixed thoroughly and filled in a stainless-steel tube (10 mm ID). Before reaction, samples were reduced at 600°C for 2 h under H2–N2 mixture (H2 5 mL/min and N2 45 mL/min). And then changed to reaction condition with the reactant mixture (40 mL/min, C3H8:H2:N2 = 1:1:2). The products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2010) equipped with and the Varian Micro-GC 490 equipped with TCD detector. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated as follows:

2.4 Computational details
All the calculations were carried out in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)49 with the generalized gradient approximation functional proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerho.50 The projector augmented-wave (PAW)51 method was employed for the interaction between the valence electrons and ion cores. Valence wave functions were expanded by plane-wave with a cutoff energy of 400 eV and the electronic tolerance value was 1 × 10−5 eV. A Methfessel–Paxton scheme with an energy smearing of 0.2 eV was adopted to determine the electronic occupancies. A 2 × 2 unit cell was built for calculation and the models were comprised of four layers separated by a vacuum of 15 Å. In all calculations, the bottom two layers were frozen and the top two layers were allowed to relax. The force tolerance was 0.03 eV/Å during the geometric optimization and the Monkhorst–Pack52 k-points mesh of 2 × 2 × 1 was used on the models. The binding energies were calculated using the following equation:
ΔEbind = Ecomplex − Ecatalyst − Eadsorbates
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Catalyst characteristics
3.1.1 Structural analysis of PtZn alloy
The structures of all the samples were confirmed by ex situ XRD after calcination at 550°C for 8 h and reduction at 600°C for 2 h. Figures S1 and S2 revealed well-crystallized zeolite with the typical MFI structure. It indicates that the ligand precursors did not interfere with hydrothermal crystallization of silicalite-1.53 Besides the strong diffraction peaks of MFI topology, several peaks appeared between 39° and 45°. All the samples before reduction showed the diffraction peak at 2θ = 39.8°, corresponding to the metallic Pt(111) crystal plane (JPCDS no. 04-0802). The peak of PtOx was not observed, which may be covered by the strong MFI peaks. After reduction treatment, the peaks were shifted to 2θ = 40.8°, which can be assigned to PtZn(111) plane (JCPDS no. 06-0604). It indicates that Zn2+ ions immobilized in the MFI support were reduced by hydrogen to form PtZn alloy. No Pt 4f XPS signal was observed in the PtZn@S-1 sample, which can be explained by the confinement of the PtZn nanoparticles inside the zeolites (Figure S3).53, 54
To investigate the detailed electronic structures of PtZn nanoparticles in the as-synthesized catalysts, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and CO-adsorbed Fourier-transform infrared (CO-FTIR) measurements were performed. Compared the reduced Pt–Zn catalysts with Pt foil, Pt L3 edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, Figure 1A) showed a slight increase of edge energy and a decrease of white line due to the incorporation of Zn. Compared with PtZn@S-1, K-PtZn@S-1 exhibited even larger changes of the edge energy, due to its higher Zn content in the PtZn nanoparticles. The first nearest-coordination peak of PtZn@S-1 displayed a slight shift in R space than that of Pt foil (Figure 1B). The fitting results for the Pt L3-edge of EXAFS spectra of various catalysts are listed in Table 1. In PtZn@S-1, each Pt atom was surrounded by an average of approximate seven Zn nearest neighbors (6.8 ± 1.0) at a bond distance of 2.67 ± 0.01 Å. The coordination number of K-PtZn@S-1 was 7.7 ± 1.0. In both catalysts, the Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy with isolated Pt atoms surrounded by eight Zn atoms was largely approached. Because the actual coordination numbers are usually lower due to the coordination-unsaturated nanoparticle surface.21, 25, 36 For PtZn/S-1, as the ratio of the Pt–Pt coordination number to that of Pt–Zn was around 2 (5.6 Pt–Pt at 2.79 Å and 3.2 Pt–Zn at 2.67 Å), Pt3Zn structure featuring 8 Pt–Pt bonds and 4 Pt–Zn bonds for each Pt atoms were determined.

The fit of Pt edge on the first coordination shell (ΔR = 2.0–3.0 Å) over the Fourier transform (FT) of the k3-weighted χ(k) functions in the range Δk = 3.0–12.6 Å−1. The standard Pt foil was fitted individually while the samples were fitted using a co-refinement approach resulting in one NPt–Pt, R, and σ2 for each sample and one common ΔE0 for all samples. The many-body amplitude reduction factor S02 = 0.85. The fit of the Pt-edge EXAFS spectra of Pt-zeolite samples are presented in Figures S4–S7.
CO adsorption (2150–2000 cm−1 region; linearly bonded CO on Pt atom) was used to further determine the effect of zinc on the electronic structure of the platinum phase (Figures 1C and S8). The presence of Zn in reduced PtZn catalysts resulted in a ~9 cm−1 red-shift of the CO stretching frequency, compared with that of Pt@S-1 (from 2073 to 2064 cm−1), probably due to an increased electron density of surface Pt metal. These results further confirmed the formation of a PtZn alloy phase.22, 27 The weak peak locating at ca. 1870 cm−1 was ascribed to the bridge CO adsorption on adjacent Pt atoms.55 This type of adsorption was hardly detected on PtZn@S-1. Therefore, the doping of Pt with Zn leaded to the dilution of Pt atoms in the particle, which caused the segregation of continuous Pt island and the formation of isolated Pt atoms. The highly symmetric band of PtZn@S-1 indicated that uniform PtZn IMAs were encapsulated in zeolite channels.
The Zn K-edge XANES energies of PtZn@S-1 and K-PtZn@S-1 roughly resemble that of ZnO, indicating that the Zn species mainly exist in the form of Zn2+ ions (Figure 1D–E).48 The fitting results for the Zn K-edge of EXAFS spectra of various catalysts are listed in Table S1. For PtZn@S-1, the peak at ~2.67 Å is ascribed to the presence of ZnPt bonds, which is consistent with the EXAFS fitting results of Pt L3-edge. The significant peak at ~1.95 Å is attributed to ZnO with a coordination number of ~2.0 at the Zn K-edge. No obvious peaks at 2.62 and 3.32 Å were observed in PtZn@S-1, demonstrating the absence of ZnZn bond in Zn metal and ZnO bond in bulk ZnO. The results indicate that the presence of two Zn species in PtZn@S-1, including Zn(0) in PtZn IMAs and single-site Zn(II) ions connecting with the framework oxygen in MFI zeolite (Scheme S1). Based on the EXAFS fitting results (Table S1), the introduction of K+ prolonged the bond length of ZnO and reduced the bond strength. It makes Zn2+ to be easily reduced, leading to weaker interaction between PtZn nanoparticle and the support. Additionally, compared with PtZn@S-1-cal (PtZn@S-1 before reduction), the coordination number of ZnO decreased and that of ZnPt increased. It further evidenced that part of framework Zn2+ ions were reduced to PtZn alloy after H2/Ar treatment at 600°C (Figure S9). To further verify the state of framework Zn in the catalysts, the coordination environment of Si species was analyzed by 29Si NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1F). The 29Si NMR spectra of all Zn-containing samples show two characteristic peaks at −118 ppm (framework Q4 Si connected to 4 other Si) and − 107.5 ppm (framework Q4 Si connected to 3 Si and 1 Zn/OH). Compared with K-PtZn@S-1, PtZn@S-1 exhibited stronger peak at ~107.5 ppm, illustrating its higher concentration of Zn2+ ions in the zeolite framework.
H2-TPR was performed to further investigate the interaction between metal and the support, and the data are depicted in Figure S10. For PtZn@S-1, the peak centered at 510°C indicates a strong interaction between the single-site Zn2+ and the support in the encapsulation structure synthesized by the one-pot method. In this case, the single-site Zn immobilized by the lattice oxygen are more resistant to be reduced by H2 than the regular large crystallites. The reduction peak of Zn2+ in K-PtZn@S-1 was at 455°C, which was lower than that of PtZn@S-1. Then Zn was hardly grafted into the zeolite framework, which subsequently weakened the interaction between Zn and the lattice oxygen. The only reduction peak of PtZn/S-1 at 394°C suggests the bulk ZnO crystallites located on the external surface possessing a weak interaction with the support.
To further prove that part of Zn atoms were incorporated into the framework of MFI zeolite, the vibrational modes of ZnOSi moieties in PtZn@S-1 were detected by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (970 cm−1, Figure S11). The results indicated the incorporation of Zn(II) centers were as the framework sites due to the p–d transition of 2p electron from skeleton oxygen to empty d band of heteroatom.56, 57 As shown in the Zn 2p XPS spectra (Figure S12), cationic Zn species in PtZn@S-1 exhibited a higher binding energy of about 1022.9 eV compared with that of PtZn/S-1 and K-PtZn@S-1. It can be explained by the fact that the lattice oxygen of the zeolite exhibits higher electronegativity than the O2− ligand in bulk zinc oxide. After high temperature reduction, the binding energy peak shifted to 1022.6 eV, indicating the generation of PtZn alloy via the reduction of some Zn ions. Meanwhile, the framework Zn made the length of SiO bond longer and the bond force smaller, which caused a red shift of the absorption peak of skeleton compared with that of K-PtZn@S-1.57, 58 In addition, Brønsted acid sites on PtZn@S-1 were detected by FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption shown in Figure S13 and Table S2. The strong Brønsted acidity in Zn-MFI and PtZn@S-1 were 0.0056 and 0.0068 mmol/g, respectively. In comparison, no strong Brønsted acid site was detected in K-PtZn@S-1. It could be one of the supporting evidences for the existence of framework Zn in PtZn@S-1. It is speculated that the framework Zn(II) sites stabilize Pt–Zn alloy to increase the stability and activity of PtZn alloy encapsulated in silicalite-1 zeolite.15, 18, 52
3.1.2 Physical properties of the catalysts
As shown in Table S3, all samples exhibited similar metal loading amounts of 0.41–0.48 wt% for Pt and 0.95–1.10 wt% for Zn, as measured by ICP-OES. Based on the N2 adsorption–desorption results (Figure S14), all zeolites possessed large pore volume (Vt of about 0.1 cm3/g). Compared to the conventional silicalite-1 zeolite, some decrease in pore volume was observed for metal-loaded zeolite. It indicates that the as-confined PtZn clusters occupied some pores of the zeolite.53 However, as inferred from the reaction data, the encapsulated zeolites still possess sufficient void space for the reactant transfer.
3.1.3 HR-TEM image of catalysts
Figure 2 shows the tomogram-section structure of PtZn@S-1, PtZn/S-1, and K-PtZn@S-1. This technology provides the sectioned view of the crystal, thus avoiding the effect of metal nanoparticles on the external surface. In the TEM tomographic images of PtZn@S-1 and K-PtZn@S-1 (Figure 2A,J), PtZn nanoparticles could be observed. It provides the direct evidence that metal nanoparticles were encapsulated in the silicalite-1 crystals as the “raisin in bread model”.45 The average size of PtZn nanoparticles in PtZn@S-1 is 2.4 ± 0.3 nm, whereas the average particle size in PtZn/S-1 is 5.5 ± 1.8 nm with a bimodal distribution. It indicates that the nanoparticles inside the channels of MFI zeolite were kept away from severe agglomeration and sintering even after calcination and reduction at 600°C. Besides, Figure S15 shows the lattice spacing of 0.221 nm for the nanoparticle, which well matches the interplane distance of (111) plane of intermetallic PtZn (P4/mmm).36 The introduction of K+ weakened the bond strength of ZnOSi, resulting in a larger particle size of 2.6 ± 0.5 nm in K-PtZn@S-1.59 Figure 2C presents the energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) line profiles of a PtZn particle in PtZn@S-1. From the EDS line profiles of Pt and Zn, it can be concluded that PtZn alloy was generated and part of Zn was incorporated into zeolite framework.

3.2 Catalytic performance
The PDH reaction was investigated under atmospheric pressure at 600°C. As shown in Figure 3A, the initial conversion of PtZn@S-1 catalyst was 46.6% at the space velocity (WHSV) of 5.9 h−1 in a feed of 25.3 kPa C3H8, 25.3 kPa H2 and N2 balance, which was near equilibrium (52%). After 90 h on stream, the dehydrogenation reaction showed a significantly small decrease in propane conversion of 0.075% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred. In terms of deactivation, a first-order deactivation model was used to estimate the catalyst stability.13, 30, 60 In Figure 3B, the extremely low deactivation rate of 0.003 h−1 for PtZn@S-1 quantitatively demonstrates its high stability compared with 0.012 h−1 for PtZn/S-1. The low deactivation constant (0.003 h−1) was 6 times lower than that of the industrial PtSn catalyst (Figure S16). For PtZn@S-1, the propylene selectivity was as high as 99.2% with a relatively high activity of 0.79 mol C3H6 mol−1Pt s−1. These values are superior to those of state-of-the-art Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts shown in Table S5. The high propylene selectivity (>99%) and stability were also maintained under 600°C regardless of extra hydrogen (Figure S17). For PtZn/S-1, PtZn alloy supported on the surface of zeolite suffered from severe agglomeration and sintering under such reaction condition. The K-PtZn@S-1 with broken framework Zn exhibited relatively low stability, indicating that the single-site framework Zn(II) ions help the stabilization of Pt–Zn IMAs. Catalytic activity of as-prepared samples under different temperature was in Figure S18. And the Mears and Weisz–Prater criteria evidenced the eliminate of external and internal mass transfer limitation (Table S4).45 In summary, due to the beneficial spatial and lattice confinement, PtZn@S-1 exhibited excellent stability and propylene selectivity together with a high activity.

3.3 Adsorption property of PtZn alloy
The adsorption energies of the adsorbed species on different catalysts can provide an auxiliary explanation on the changes of activity and selectivity. Based on the EAXFS fitting results, the active sites of PtZn@S-1 and PtZn/S-1 were simplified to PtZn IMA and Pt3Zn. Therefore, the catalytic models of Pt(111), Pt3Zn(111) and PtZn(111) surfaces were selected for comparison. The optimized adsorption configurations of the dehydrogenated intermediates absorbed on the three models are shown in Figure S19. The binding energies of the dehydrogenated intermediates over Pt(111) and Pt3Zn(111) and PtZn(111) surfaces were calculated and summarized in Figure 3C.30 The binding energy of C3H6* on PtZn(111) (−0.18 eV) was obviously lower than that of Pt(111) (−0.98 eV) and Pt3Zn(111) (−0.80 eV). The adsorption configuration of C3H6* is π mode on PtZn(111), whereas the di-σ mode is favorable on Pt(111) and Pt3Zn(111). Therefore, propylene desorption over PtZn IMA can be greatly facilitated. Then, the high propylene selectivity of PtZn IMA can be explained, which subsequently leads to stable PDH via effective inhibition of side reactions.
3.4 The role of Zn2+ single site
Incorporation of Zn into MFI was reported to generate Brønsted acid sites (framework Zn) and Lewis acid sites (extra-framework Zn).61 The acid site concentration and distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites were characterized by NH3-TPD (Figure 4A) and pyridine adsorption IR spectroscopy (Figure S13). For PtZn@S-1, the peak at about 350°C was assigned to the strong acid and the ratio of Brønsted acid to Lewis acid was about 0.1. It indicates that framework Zn and extra-framework Zn still existed simultaneously after reduction. In contrast, there was almost no Brønsted acid in K-PtZn@S-1, demonstrating that only extra-framework Zn sites existed in the silicalite-1 zeolite. The peak at 280°C was ascribed to medium acid. The introduction of K+ weakened the bond strength of ZnOSi.

Although single-site Zn(II) on silica have been developed as selective PDH catalysts, these active sites suffer from low activity compared with the metallic sites.62 In our system, the propane conversion on Zn-MFI was below 4% (Figure S20). Moreover, the conversion of propane on PtZn@S-1 containing both framework Zn and PtZn IMAs was slightly decreased from 46.6% to 39.8% after 90 h on stream (Figure 3A). In comparison, the conversion of propane was dropped from 48% to less than 20% in 30 h on K-PtZn@S-1 with the broken framework Zn. Then, it can be deduced that the framework Zn(II) sites play a supplementary role in PDH catalyzed by the PtZn catalysts. Herein, the high catalytic performance of PtZn@S-1 originates from a synergy of the single-site framework Zn and the confined PtZn IMAs.63-65 As shown in the H2-TPD profiles (Figure 4B), enhanced H2 storage capacity for PtZn@S-1 with single-site Zn(II) ions in the framework can provide higher local hydrogen concentration in the porous catalyst, which can further reduce the possibility of deep hydrogenation. Nevertheless, the conversion of propane was suppressed in the H2-rich environment, which was verified by the reaction data. As shown in Figure 3A, the initial conversion of propane on PtZn@S-1 was lower than that on K-PtZn@S-1. The interaction of propylene with the as-prepared samples were measured by C3H6-TPD, and the data are shown in Figure 4C. For PtZn@S-1, there was no adsorption peak when the temperature was higher than 350°C, indicating weak interaction between propylene and PtZn IMA, which is in good accordance with the DFT calculations. Propylene-adsorbed FTIR spectra (Figure S21) did not show any obvious peak at 400°C. Thus the weak adsorption of propylene is one of the origins for high C3H6 selectivity and good catalyst stability in PDH.
The Zn LMM Auger XPS spectra (Figure 5A) can also evidence the existence of framework Zinc. The peaks at about 993 eV and 990 eV correspond to Zn0 and bulk ZnnOn species, respectively. The peak below 990 eV can be assigned to the Zn(II) species attaching to the zeolite lattice oxygen due to the lower electronegativity of Zn compared to Si atom. The introduced Zn species are more positively charged in ZnOSi bands, leading to chemical shift towards lower location.66 For the reduced encapsulated catalysts, no metallic Zn peak existed because the PtZn nanoparticles encapsulated in zeolites cannot be detected by the surface technology. For K-PtZn@S-1, the peak at 987.2 eV is stable after reduction, demonstrating the presence of framework zinc on the zeolite surface. The lower kinetic energy of PtZn@S-1 at 986.2 eV also demonstrates the framework Zn possessing stronger interaction with lattice oxygen. After high temperature reduction, the peak only shifted to 986.5 eV, indicating that part of framework zinc was still confined by zeolite lattice.

3.5 Characterizations of spent catalysts
The spent catalysts were characterized to further shed light on the relationship between the improved catalytic performance and the structure of PtZn@S-1. TGA measurements of the spent catalysts were conducted to quantify the content of carbon deposition,67 and the results are depicted in Figure 5B,C. The mass loss before 300°C is mainly because of the volatilization of H2O. Besides the loss of physical-adsorbed water, the coke content of the spent PtZn@S-1 was only 0.2 wt% after 90 h on stream, which is only 1/6 that of PtZn/S-1. The absence of D band and G band in the Raman spectra of the spent PtZn@S-1 also evidenced its quite low carbon deposition (Figure S22). Encapsulated catalysts exhibited fairly low amount of carbon deposition, mainly because the isolated Pt atoms possessed quite low binding strength of propylene to avoid deep dehydrogenation compared with the pure Pt surface (Figure 3C). Subsequently, polyaromatic species were effectively suppressed in the zeolite pores.1
TEM micrographs of the spent catalysts were collected, and the results are shown in Figure 5D,E. No obvious carbon deposition was observed in the spent encapsulated catalyst. The metal particle size was substantially unchanged (2.6 ± 1.0 nm) for the spent PtZn@S-1, which was slightly increased (3.1 ± 1.0 nm) in K-PtZn@S-1 (Figure S23). In contrast, the metal nanoparticle size of the spent PtZn/S-1 was increased apparently to 6.9 ± 6.5 nm with uneven particle size distribution, owing to the aggregation and sintering of the metal species under harsh reaction condition. As shown in the XPS spectra of the spent catalysts (Figure 4B), the kinetic energy of PtZn@S-1 was 986.6 eV, which is almost the same as that before reaction (986.5 eV). It indicates that the framework Zn was stable during the reaction due to the strong lattice confinement by zeolite framework. After PDH reaction, the crystallinity of the zeolite remained unchanged (Figure S24).
The regeneration of PtZn@S-1 was also examined (Figure S25). Evaluating catalyst stability at near-equilibrium conversion of the reactant should be avoided because the result could be heavily influenced by the catalyst loading. The stability test under high space velocity condition was relatively accurate. Therefore, PDH reaction was conducted at 600°C under the WHSV of 11.8 h−1 for 40 h (Figure S26). After the completion of initial run, the catalyst was calcined in air with linear heating to 550°C for 1 h and holding for another 1 h. After two regeneration cycles, the initial propane conversion could be effectively recovered. Specially, high propylene selectivity (99.0–99.4%) has always been maintained during the whole reaction process. The deactivation rate was basically unchanged after regeneration, further evidencing the stable catalyst structure. In the industrial application, C3H8:H2 = 2:1 is generally used (Figure S27). For PtZn@S-1, after 40 h on stream, the dehydrogenation reaction showed a significantly small decrease in propane conversion of 0.135% per hour, suggesting that only slight deactivation had occurred. Both spatial confined PtZn IMAs and lattice confined single-site framework Zn contribute to the excellent PDH performance of PtZn@S-1 at elevated temperature.
4 CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we presented an alternative strategy to generate PtZn IMA encapsulated within Zn-embedded MFI zeolite using an in situ ligand-stabilized method. According to the HRTEM image, PtZn nanoparticles were encapsulated inside the channels of silicalite-1 zeolite, and the particle size was nearly unchanged after reaction. The single-site Zn in the MFI framework reinforced the interaction between the confined PtZn IMAs and the silicalite-1 support. Thus the sintering of the small PtZn nanoalloys can effectively be prevented. The isolated Pt atoms in the PtZn IMA suppressed side reaction and retained the activity of main reaction. Then, coking can effectively be inhibited. Overall, the stability and selectivity of the as-developed catalyst have been greatly enhanced. As a result, the as-developed PtZn@S-1 catalyst exhibited high propylene selectivity (99.3%) under a WHSV of 5.9 h−1 at 600°C. Propane conversion after 90 h on stream was 40.2% which was still 86% of the maximum conversion. Our discovery of the important roles of single-site framework Zn open new avenues in the preparation of other IMA catalysts with high performance.
