Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation is a highly efficient and selective route to produce propylene. The development of transition-metal-based catalysts, especially cobalt oxide–Co(II) for propane dehydrogenation reaction has gained momentum in the past few years. However, the formation of bulk metallic cobalt is a major drawback of cobalt oxide-based catalysts, which need to be circumvented to maintain the high propylene selectivity. In this study, a facile route is proposed to prepare stable Co(II) on a mesoporous silica matrix (Co-mSiO2) via a simple synthesis procedure using the neutral templating method. The cobalt content in the silica is varied to optimize the activity and stability during the reaction. The physicochemical properties of the catalyst measured using X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption–desorption, and transmission electron microscopy revealed the high surface area and well-dispersed cobalt oxide present in the mesoporous silica matrix. The coordination geometry found from the UV–vis and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis showed that Co(II) is highly dispersed with tetrahedral coordination in the mesoporous silica. The Co-mSiO2 catalyst with the lowest cobalt content of 2 wt % tested for the propane dehydrogenation reaction at the operating temperature of 600 °C showed 36% propane conversion with 94% propylene selectivity. 2Co-mSiO2 showed the nonredox properties of Co(II) with negligible metallic cobalt formed and a lower coke deposition rate (4 mgcarbon/gcat.·h) after the reaction supported by X-ray absorption near-edge structure and thermogravimetric analysis. The source for the side reaction (coke formation) can be assigned to the strong adsorption of propylene, which was unraveled using Fourier transform infrared analysis, and a nonredox mechanism is proposed for propane dehydrogenation reaction over the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst.

1. Introduction
Light olefins (ethylene and propylene) are among the essential building block chemicals used as feedstocks by the industry for the production of a wide range of chemicals. (1) Shale gas, containing a large amount of light hydrocarbons (ethane and propane), has gained huge interest in its utilization as an inexpensive hydrocarbon source. (2,3) Propylene is highly sought after because of its increasing demand for its utilization in making polypropylene, which is eventually used to make a wide range of products, including automobile parts, plastic bottles, etc. Unlike naphtha steam cracking, production of propylene via the dehydrogenation of propane is a more economical and highly efficient process. The yield of propylene from naptha cracking is much less than the ethylene yield, which makes the dehydrogenation process more preferable. The main reaction of propane dehydrogenation is to form propylene and H2 [reaction (1)], which is an endothermic reaction, while side reactions (2) and (3) also simultaneously occur.

To date, Pt–Sn- and CrOx-based metals/metal oxides supported on alumina catalysts are the commercial catalysts used for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. However, the detrimental effect of Cr(VI) on the environment and high cost of Pt are the key problems of the catalysts. (1,4) To this end, an abundant amount of research focused on the development of catalysts that satisfy the industrial-scale performance for the reaction and achieve similar or better propylene yield. Besides, a huge pool of research based on GaOx- (5,6) and VOx-based (7,8) catalysts have shown great potential activity in (nonoxidative and oxidative) propane dehydrogenation. Over the past few years, a tremendous effort has been implemented in formulating few first-row 3d metals (Ni, Zn, Fe, Co, and Sn) and group 13 metal oxides such as GaOx, In2O3, and Al2O3. (9−11) The main reason behind the shift in interest is the low cost and abundant availability of these groups of metals. (12,13)
Formation of the highly dispersed active site is highly desirable in the current development of catalysts applied for propane dehydrogenation. To this end, Yun et al. found that framework Fe2+ in ZSM-5 showed propylene selectivity of 78–85% at a low propane conversion (∼3.6%). Similarly, the isolated sites of transition-metal (d-block) elements such as iron oxide (FeOx), zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnOx), and cobalt oxide (CoOx) supported on silica oxide (SiO2) have shown high performance (catalytic activity and selectivity for propylene) via propane dehydrogenation. (14−19) All of these studies reported that Co(II) is the active phase for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Furthermore, cobalt species embedded in mesoporous alumina to form cobalt spinel with alumina showed excellent performance for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. (2,20) Besides, the formation of ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles was also reported to be highly selective toward propylene formation. In contrast, the formation of bulk cobalt particles was attributed to the cracking reaction. (21) In another study, Chen et al. reported promising results by investigating the effect of different reduction temperatures, and the formation of ultrafine cobalt nanoparticles on the β- zeolite showed good performance for the dehydrogenation reaction. However, there was not a significant difference in the performance between the ultrafine metallic cobalt formed and the unreduced catalyst. (22)
The critical issue with the cobalt-based catalyst reported so far is the lower stability under dehydrogenation reaction conditions. Cobalt oxide undergoes a reduction in the presence of reducing gases during the reaction to form metallic cobalt. The then formed metallic cobalt is active for cleavage of the C–C bond of alkane over C–H bond activation; this phenomenon leads to a side reaction to form carbon, thereby suppressing the selectivity of the desired product. The ease of formation of metallic cobalt from CoO mostly depends on the strength of interaction with the support. The formation of well-dispersed Co2+ or cobalt silicate is advantageous for achieving higher propylene selectivity. (23) Up to now, different types of supports have been used for the cobalt-based systems evaluated for alkane dehydrogenation using various techniques. (24)
Several novel methods are proposed to prepare highly dispersed cobalt oxide clusters; for example, Richardson et al. proposed the synthesis of encapsulated CoO clusters in the Silicalite-1 matrix using a steam-assisted method. (25) Peters et al. presented the formation of cobalt oxide clusters in the metal–organic framework and tested for an oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction. (26) Similarly, few other techniques were reported to prepare metal encapsulated inside the porous support matrix and also to prepare a highly dispersed metal oxide. (27) It can be inferred from all of these studies that the in situ incorporation of metal/metal oxides on the support is a promising option. The inert support SiO2 is suitable for accessing the actual activity of the metal active sites. Mesoporous silica is one of the most widely used supports applied for thermal catalytic conversion processes including reforming, water–gas shift, and dehydrogenation reactions. (28−30) The synthesis method for mesoporous silica varies from a hydrothermal method to a surfactant-directed templating method. A wide range of surfactants are utilized to synthesize mesoporous silica, and one among them is are neutral alkylamines, which are generally prepared under neutral pH solution conditions. A neutral templating method follows wherein the primary amines react with neutral inorganic species to form a hydrogen bond between the primary amines and neutral inorganic species. This method is also known as the synthetic route S0I0, where S0 = nonionic surfactants and I0 = neutral silica species. (31) The mesoporous silica prepared using the neutral templating method is also utilized to prepare a uniform well-dispersed metal for various applications. (32) Besides supported catalysts, a one-pot synthesis method to prepare metal incorporated inside the mesoporous pores was also reported for dry/steam reforming of methane and the direct oxidation of phenol to p-benzoquinone. (33,34)
To understand the current state of the art, it is crucial to develop a system with stabilized metal/metal oxide for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. This work focuses on the development of cobalt-containing mesoporous silica (Co-mSiO2) as a catalyst using a facile and simple one-pot S0I0 neutral templating preparation method. Co-mSiO2 is tested for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The cobalt content in mesoporous silica is also varied to find the effect of metal loading on the activity, selectivity, and stability during the reaction. The main objective is also to stabilize the Co(II) oxidation state during the reaction under a reducing atmosphere. The presence of Co(II), coordination geometry, and coordination atmosphere is confirmed using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV–vis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. The spent catalysts are characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the leading causes of deactivation. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalyst was calculated to compare with other similar catalytic systems. The interactions of propane and propylene with the catalysts are accessed using diffuse-reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis. Moreover, the robust behavior of the catalyst was explained by correlating with the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity crucial for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The key findings of this study include the simple one-step method to prepare a highly dispersed cobalt oxide site on the mesoporous-stabilized silica. The high surface area and narrow pore-size distribution of mesoporous silica help to form nanoclusters of cobalt oxide with enhanced dispersion. The cobalt oxide formed in this study showed a nonredox property with stable performance even after regeneration because of the strong interaction between cobalt oxide and mesoporous silica.
2. Experimental Methods
2.1. Preparation of the Catalysts
In the neutral templating (S0I0) method, the alkylamine used is dodecylamine (DDA), which acts as a templating agent, and a procedure similar to that previously reported was followed for the synthesis of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) and metal-containing HMS. (13,35) In the synthesis, first, around 3.5 g of the templating agent DDA was added to an ethanolic solution [30 mL of ethanol (99.99% purity) and 30 mL of water]. The mixture solution was stirred for 30 min to form a clear transparent solution. The silica (tetraethyl orthosilicate, TEOS) and cobalt precursors were then added to a separate beaker with 5 mL of ethanol, 15 mL of TEOS, and the appropriate weights of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate for 2, 5, and 10% metal loading. The second solution was slowly added to the first, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h under room temperature. After the stirring step, the precipitant was separated from the supernatant by a vacuum filtration technique. The powder was collected and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. Finally, the dried powder was calcined at 600 °C for 4 h with a ramping rate of 1 °C/min. A similar procedure was also used to prepare a pure silica support, except for the addition of a cobalt precursor. The samples containing cobalt are represented as xCo-mSiO2, where x represents the amount of cobalt, which was varied as 2, 5, and 10 wt %, and pure silica is represented as mSiO2. The samples must be stored in a desiccator containing absorbents to prevent the samples from absorbing moisture and keep the samples dry for characterization of the fresh samples.
2.2. Characterizations
2.2.1. XRD
The phases of the silica and cobalt were measured using a Shimadzu 6000 X-ray diffractometer consisting of Cu Kα radiation. The samples were scanned from 2θ = 10 to 80° for wide-angle XRD and from 2θ = 1 to 5° for small-angle XRD with a scanning rate of 2°/min.
2.2.2. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) Surface Area
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of fresh catalysts and support were analyzed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 physisorption analyzer; the experiments were conducted at 77 K in the presence of N2 gas and liquid N2 as a reference. The powder catalysts were degassed under vacuum at 300 °C for 6 h before sample analysis for the BET surface area.
2.2.3. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)
TEM (JEOL) and HRTEM–energy-dispersive X-ray spectrosopy (EDS) were employed to characterize the morphology and elemental distribution of xCo-mSiO2 samples and mSiO2 support. The samples were ultrasonicated in ethanol and dried in an oven before analysis.
2.2.4. XPS
The oxidation state of cobalt and its interaction with the support were accessed using an instrument consisting of a concentric hemispherical analyzer with a spatial resolution of 30 μm and containing an Al Kα gun X-ray source of energy, hν = 1486.6 eV. The samples were calibrated by measuring the C 1s hydrocarbon peak located at 284.5 eV. After XPS analysis on the catalysts, the spectra were analyzed using the XPS PeakFit software package.
2.2.5. UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy was performed with a Shimadzu instrument, and barium sulfide was used as the reference sample. The UV–vis spectra were measured between 200 and 1000 nm wavelength to cover the tetrahedral and octahedral regions of cobalt.
2.2.6. Hydrogen Temperature-Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR)
The reduction temperature of cobalt oxide using H2 as a probe gas was measured in an instrument supplied by Thermal Scientific known as a TPDRO-1100 apparatus. In the analysis, approximately 100 mg of the catalyst was weighed and purged with helium for 0.5 h, followed by in situ TPR using a mixture gas of 5% H2 in N2 at a flow rate of 20 mL/min. The temperature was slowly increased from 50 to 950 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min to cover the entire range of the cobalt oxide reduction step.
2.2.7. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
The XANES and EXAFS experiments were performed under transmission mode for Co K-edge absorption spectroscopy at the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source (XAFCA). A desired amount of the sample was thoroughly mixed in a mortar along with boron nitride (BN) powder as a diluent, and the powder mixture was pelletized to form a 1 cm disk. The spectra obtained from XANES and EXAFS analyses were processed, normalized, and analyzed using the Demeter 0.9.26 software package. Around 30 mg of the sample was mixed with BN to dilute the samples, which were mixed thoroughly in a mortar, and the powder was pelletized to form a 1 cm disk.
2.2.8. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), DRIFTS, and Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR)
The FTIR measurements were performed on a Bruker Vertex-70 spectrometer containing a high-temperature IR cell manufactured by Harrick, in which the FTIR experiments were performed using pyridine as the probe molecule. To access the acidity and type of acidic sites in a catalyst, herein a pyridine gas was used as the probe molecule. Before the adsorption–desorption of gases, the catalyst was preheated at 300 °C for 1 h under an inert atmosphere to ascertain removal of the surface hydroxyl groups or any other impurities present on the catalyst. Then, the sample was cooled to 150 °C. The FTIR experiments in the presence of pyridine as the probe molecule were performed for 1 h until the pyridine molecule saturated on the catalyst surface. The timing was optimized by measuring the spectrum and pyridine adsorption and stopped when saturation was observed. The chemisorbed pyridine molecule was desorbed at 150 °C by flushing the reactor chamber with pure helium for 30 min. The propane and propylene adsorption–desorption experiments were performed on an FTIR Harrick dome cell. The adsorption experiments were performed at 300 and 550 °C in the presence of diluted propane or propylene gas, followed by desorption under an inert atmosphere. The background was captured before the actual spectrum. ATR analysis of the samples was also performed on the same instrument using KBr as the reference sample, and each sample analysis was taken at room temperature.
2.2.9. TGA–Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA)
TGA–DTA was carried out on a Shimadzu instrument. Around 10 mg of the sample was kept in a sample chamber, and the temperature was increased from room temperature to 900 °C with a 10 °C/min ramping rate. The analysis was done under an air atmosphere.
2.2.10. Temperature-Programmed Surface Reaction (TPSR)
This experiment was performed in a Carbolite high-temperature reactor, and the outlet gas stream was connected to a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer. A total of 200 mg of catalyst was loaded into the reactor and heated to 600 °C prior to reaction to remove any impurities and moisture. Then the reactor was cooled to room temperature, the propane gas was fed with increasing temperature, and the product gases were analyzed in a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer system. The propane concentration was the same as that under the reaction conditions (section 2.3).
2.3. Catalytic Activity Test
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was conducted in a quartz tube reactor (inner diameter was 7 mm) under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst sample of 0.5 g was loaded between the quartz wool and quartz, and the Carbolite digital furnace was used to monitor and maintain the temperature of the catalyst bed. The catalyst powder was made into the form of small particles (<125 μm) to maintain a similar gas hourly space velocity for all of the catalysts. Before the reaction, the reactor was heated to 600 °C under helium flow with a temperature ramping rate of 10 °C/min. Then, 30 mL/min containing 10% propane diluted in helium was introduced as the reactant mixture. The produced gas mainly composed of H2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H6, and C3H8 was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) equipped with a Hayesep-D column. The carbon balance was below >95% for all of the experiments performed. The propane conversion and selectivity toward propylene were calculated by the following equations:
The TOF of the catalyst was measured at 600 °C with a propane conversion lower than 10% to operate the reaction under a kinetically controlled regime.
3. Result and Discussion
3.1. Characterization of Fresh Catalysts
3.1.1. Textural and Surface Properties of the Support and Catalysts
The one-pot synthesis steps applied for the preparation of cobalt-incorporated mesoporous silica are shown in Scheme 1. Figure 1a displays the wide-angle XRD patterns of all of the fresh catalysts showing only a broader peak at 2θ = 22°, which corresponds to noncrystalline silica. (36−38) The XRD patterns were performed at a low angle, as shown in Figure 1b, and the peak at 2–3° with [100] facets belongs to the typical mesoporous silica. (39,40) In this figure, it can be noted that, with an increase in the cobalt content, the intensity of the peak decreases and 10Co-mSiO2 shows no characteristic peak, indicating coverage of the pores of mesoporous SiO2 with cobalt. Another possible reason could be partial reduction in the porous structure when the cobalt content is increased. Besides, no distinguishable peaks for CoOx species were detected in all of the samples. Even with high cobalt loading in the 10Co-mSiO2 sample, the absence of CoOx peaks indicates high dispersion on the silica matrix.

The textural and structural properties measured from the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms are displayed in Table 1. The pure mSiO2 support shows the surface area of 1054 m2/g and the surface area decreased after cobalt incorporation in the SiO2 matrix alone with the following order: 2Co-mSiO2 (880 m2/g) > 5Co-mSiO2 (754 m2/g) > 10Co-mSiO2 (550 m2/g). N2 adsorption–desorption into the pores occurs by capillary condensation, forming a hysteresis, as shown in Figure S1a. The hysteresis loop was observed from 0.8 to 1 P/P0 due to capillary condensation in the pores with well-developed microporosity and mesoporosity. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms followed type IV isotherms, which are observed when monolayer and multilayer adsorption of N2 occurs on mesoporous silica. The average pore volume of only mSiO2 is the highest, and it reduces to the minimum of 0.03 cm3/g for a maximum cobalt loading of 10 wt %. Only the support mSiO2 showed an average pore size of 2.13 nm with a pore volume of 0.24 cm3/g. Upon the incorporation of cobalt into the mesoporous matrix and an increase in the cobalt content, the pore sizes observed are as follows: 2Co-mSiO2 (2.18 nm), 5Co-mSiO2 (2.2 nm), and 10Co-mSiO2 (2.3 nm), as shown in Figure S2b. Although there is no significant change in the average pore size of the mesoporous silica matrix, the pore volume changed significantly by varying the cobalt content from 2 to 10 wt % with pore volumes of 0.16 and 0.03 cm3/g, respectively. The decrease in the surface area and pore volume after cobalt incorporation is an indication of the occupancy of cobalt in the pores of mSiO2. This also supports the destruction of the mesoporous structure in 10Co-mSiO2, as shown in small-angle XRD patterns.

From the two characterization techniques performed so far, it can be deduced that all of the catalysts are amorphous with well-dispersed cobalt present in the mesoporous SiO2 matrix. The morphology of the fresh catalyst was accessed using HRTEM, and the images are shown in Figure 2. The morphology observed for the mSiO2, 2Co-mSiO2, and 5Co-mSiO2 samples can be correlated with a wormhole-like porous structure (Figure 2a–c). However, for the 10Co-mSiO2 sample, the wormhole-like structure was destroyed; instead, larger pores are evident, as shown in Figure 2d. Besides, there were no distinguishable large cobalt oxide particles present, which also supports the XRD results, indicating that CoOx exists in the form of nanoclusters. The presence of nanoparticles or nanoclusters can be determined using HRTEM. The HRTEM of fresh 2Co-mSiO2 (Figure 2) showed no sign of agglomeration after the calcination step. To find the particle size of the highly dispersed cobalt oxide in 2Co-mSiO2, this catalyst was treated with H2 at 700 °C for 1 h. The dark-field HRTEM images of the reduced catalyst are shown in Figure S2a,b. From the figure, the average particle size of cobalt calculated is 2.2 nm. This indicates that upon reduction the cobalt nanoclusters are formed. Considering a small degree of agglomeration after H2 treatment, it can be estimated that the cobalt oxide particle without reduction will be lower than or equal to 2 nm. This supports the formation of cobalt oxide nanoclusters in the best-performing 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst, which is the active phase for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The HRTEM images of the fresh 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst with distinguishable wormhole-like pores are shown in Figure S2c. The HRTEM–EDS mapping shows that Co and Si are well-dispersed on the mesoporous silica material (Figure S2d).

3.1.2. Reducibility of Cobalt in Co-mSiO2
H2-TPR was performed on all of the freshly calcined catalysts; the H2 consumption versus temperature plot is shown in Figure 3. All xCo-mSiO2 samples consist of two reduction peaks; (i) at the 700–800 °C region and (ii) between the 900 and 950 °C region. The reduction of cobalt oxide occurs in two steps, Co3+ → Co2+ → Co0, and the first step reduction of Co3O4 to CoO mostly takes place at a lower temperature below 600 °C. (17,41,42) Peak I, as indicated in Figure 3, belongs to the reduction of Co2+ → Co0, and peak II belongs to the reduction of Co2+ strongly interacted with SiO2 to form a silicate phase to metallic cobalt. The two high-temperature reduction peaks are an indication of highly dispersed Co2+ on the mesoporous silica subsurface and embedded inside the mesoporous SiO2 walls. (43,44) TPR analysis confirms the presence of strongly interacted cobalt species in coordination with silica in the mesoporous structure. The availability of cobalt in the form of oxide during propane dehydrogenation is of high importance. The weakly interacting cobalt oxide undergoes complete reduction to form bigger crystals of metallic cobalt, which causes the cracking reaction to form carbon. (45) Thus, it can be expected that cobalt oxide species present in mSiO2 might not undergo complete reduction to form metallic cobalt during the reducing reaction conditions.

3.1.3. Oxidation States and Coordination Geometry of Cobalt in xCo-mSiO2
TPR analysis showed two higher-temperature reduction peaks for cobalt oxide reduction, confirming the presence of strongly interacting cobalt species with the support. Because cobalt exists in multiple oxidation states with varying geometry, it is crucial to further find the existing oxidation states of cobalt in Co-mSiO2. Therefore, XPS was performed on all of the fresh catalysts, as shown in Figure 4a. The XPS spectrum of Co 2p consists of doublet peaks at 781.5 for 2p3/2 and 797.4 eV for 2p1/2, respectively. The shakeup peaks are located at binding energies (BEs) of 786.8 and 803 eV and are represented as “S”. The BE difference between the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 main peaks is about 16.1 eV. A difference of about ∼16 eV between the doublet peaks was reported to be due to the presence of a cobalt silicate structure, forming a mixed oxide within the silica matrix. (44,46−48) A BE value exceeding that of 782.0 eV is reported to be due to the Co2+ ions embedded within the zeolite matrix. (49) Besides, the BE value of Co 2p3/2 at 782.2 eV was found in Co-SBA-15 and 781.4 eV in Co-MCM-41, which can be allocated to highly dispersed small clusters of Co(II). (20,50) The values of Co 2p3/2 for all of the samples are located between the CoO phase (780 eV) and the CoO present inside the pores of the silica matrix (782.2 eV), indicating that the catalysts 2Co-mSiO2, 5Co-mSiO2, and 10Co-mSiO2 consist of the Co(II) oxidation state and also the cobalt silicate mixed oxide.
Figure 4
Figure 4. (a) Co 2p XPS spectra, and (b) UV–vis spectra of fresh xCo-mSiO2.
The coordination geometry of all of the fresh catalysts containing cobalt on mesoporous silica was obtained using UV–vis analysis performed at room temperature. The spectrum exhibited three absorption peaks, which are located at around 526, 590, and 640 nm, as shown in Figure 4b. These peaks are for the 4A2(F) → 4T1(P) transition of Co2+ ions in a tetrahedral geometry. (51) A shoulder peak indicated between 700 and 800 nm belongs to the octahedral-coordinated Co2+. The presence of tetrahedral- and octahedral-coordinated cobalt ions plays a significant role in determining the activity and selectivity for the alkane dehydrogenation reaction. (24) The tetrahedral-coordinated Co2+ are more favorable for propylene production, which showed nonredox properties. From XPS and TPR analysis, it was demonstrated that cobalt exists mostly in the Co(II) oxidation state. Thus, UV–vis analysis supports the presence of Co2+ in tetrahedral coordination, presenting strong interaction with silica in the form of cobalt silicate.
The XANES spectra of the three catalysts are shown in Figure 5a; the preedge energy of the reference CoO with the Co2+ oxidation state is located at 7709 eV, whereas the preedge slightly shifted to higher energy for the reference Co3O4, situated at 7710 eV. The preedge energies of all three samples, 2Co-mSiO2, 5Co-mSiO2, and 10Co-mSiO2, were close to 7709 keV, which corresponds to the Co(II) oxidation state. The energy profile for all of the catalysts followed a trend very close to that for CoO, which also supports the presence of the CoO phase in the catalysts. (52,53) This analysis also supports the TPR result, which indicated a high-temperature reduction peak of >700 °C for the three samples (Figure 3). Besides, the three spectra followed a similar pattern, which is an indication of the very identical structure of the catalyst irrespective of the metal loading. The coordination environments of cobalt evaluated from EXAFS analysis are shown in Figure 5b. The bond length of Co–O in the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst was comparatively more prolonged than those of 5Co-mSiO2 and 10Co-mSiO2 but notably longer than the reported Co–O bond length of Co3O4 (RCo–O = 1.91 Å). (54,55) Elongation of the Co–O bond in 2Co-mSiO2 is also an indication of the formation of smaller-size CoO compared to the other two samples. Further, the coordination numbers of the catalysts are around 4 and approximately similar to each other. The coordination number of 4 indicates the tetrahedral coordination geometry of CoO(Co2+) present in the SiO2 matrix. Therefore, this study reveals the tetrahedral coordination of cobalt present in the catalyst, which is highly active for the dehydrogenation reaction. The parameters obtained from the XANES and EXAFS fittings are shown in Table S1.

3.1.4. Acidic Centers of xCo-mSiO2
DRIFTS analysis was performed on all of the calcined samples to find the type of acidic center present. Herein, pyridine was used as a probe molecule to find the presence of a Lewis or Brønsted acidic center. (56) Several peaks appeared in the wavenumber range of 1700–1400 cm–1. Figure 6 shows that there exist four bands of the Lewis acidic sites, with strong bands located at 1449 cm–1, a weak-intensity peak at 1495 cm–1, and a broad peak between 1570 and 1630 cm–1. (57−59) All of these peaks belong to the Lewis acidic sites. The range between 1570 and 1630 cm–1 consists of Lewis acidic centers with different strengths. The shoulder peak at 1622 cm–1 corresponds to the strong Lewis (SL) acidic center, the peak at 1590 cm–1 belongs to the medium Lewis (ML) acidic site, and the peak at 1575 cm–1 originates because of the interaction of pyridine with the weak Lewis (WL) acidic center. (60,61) All of these peaks are present in three catalyst samples. 10Co-mSiO2 shows a distinguishable shoulder peak of 1622 cm–1 of the strong Lewis acidic center, and this strong Lewis acidic peak intensity decreased with decreasing cobalt loading. Hence, it can be inferred from pyridine adsorption analysis that a higher cobalt loading increases the acidic strength of the catalyst. The strong Lewis acidic center is also responsible for the promotion of a side reaction to form coke. (62) This analysis also reveals that cobalt species present in the form of Co(II) on the surface and Co(II) inside the silica matrix act as a Lewis acidic centers.

3.2. Catalytic Performance
A series of prepared xCo-mSiO2 were evaluated for the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 600 °C. The reaction performance was measured by estimating the propane conversion and propylene selectivity, calculated using the formula given in the Experimental Section and shown in Figure 7. The pure mesoporous SiO2 support showed a very low propane conversion (5%) and a lower selectivity (∼70%), as shown in Figure S4. After the incorporation of a small amount of Co (2 wt %), the performance for propane dehydrogenation was increased compared to that of bare mSiO2. For the initial several minutes of the reaction, the conversion was very similar for all of the catalysts. The initial conversion of 2Co-mSiO2 was 30% and reached a maximum of ∼36%. The final conversion obtained after 8 h of reaction was 30%. The selectivity of 2Co-mSiO2 reached close to 94% with no decrease in value throughout the reaction. With a further increase in the cobalt content to 5 wt %, the initial conversion was 36%, reaching a maximum value of 40% and starting to decrease after a while, with a final conversion of 27% after 8 h of reaction. The propylene selectivity was also around 92%, very close to that of 2Co-mSiO2. Finally, 10Co-mSiO2 showed a maximum conversion of 38%, and a significantly faster deactivation was observed compared to that of the other two catalysts, reaching a final conversion of 22%. The propylene selectivity initially reached 85%; however, it decreased with time, reaching 83% after 8 h. However, the rate of decrease in the propane conversion is distinctive among the three different cobalt content catalysts, as shown in Figure 7a–c. The decrease in the performance is explained in section 3.3 from characterization of the spent catalyst. The induction period is observed in all three catalysts; however, the time duration is higher in the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst. It has been reported that the induction period is observed because of conversion of the inactive phase to the active phase in a reducing reaction atmosphere. In this study, there are two possibilities for the induction period: One is the evolution of cobalt(II) embedded inside silica to the surface (Figures 3 and 4a). Another possibility is due to the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, which was investigated by TPSR of propane, as shown in Figure S5. The high-temperature removal of water in 2Co-mSiO2 catalysts hinders the initial catalytic activity and causes a longer induction period than the higher-cobalt-containing catalysts.

(d) TOF of the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst at 600 °C.
The presence of the Co(II) oxidation state with tetrahedral coordination is a highly desirable active site for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. In this study, the one-pot neutral templating synthesis method applied resulted in a high surface area and well-dispersed amorphous cobalt oxide. From a comparison of the performances of the three catalysts with high to low metal loading, it is evident that low metal loading is more favorable, especially to maintain a stable performance during the reaction. A disruption of the morphology and a decrease in the surface area of silica with 10% cobalt resulted in lower stability and faster deactivation of the catalyst.
Furthermore, the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst was chosen to find the TOF, assuming that all cobalt atoms are active, which was measured to be 11 h–1 at 600 °C during the initial hours and increased to a maximum value of ∼15 h–1, as shown in Figure 7d. The TOF value decreased to 13.8 h–1 after 24 h of reaction. The TOF value obtained using this catalyst was compared to those of other catalysts reported in the literature, as shown in Table S2. From this table, a comparison of the different types of metal oxide catalysts containing isolated sites, clusters, and nanoparticles is presented in terms of the initial and final TOF values. It was reported that metal oxide catalysts consisting of isolated sites or clusters prepared by a unique surface organometallic chemistry route and also by strong electrostatic adsorption methods showed higher TOFs tested for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. (63) When the cobalt-based catalysts reported so far for the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction are compared, mesoporous CoAl2O4 stand out with the highest initial TOF of 23.0 h–1, which decreased to 8.7 h–1. (64) All of the cobalt catalysts suffered from a significant decrease in the TOF value at a temperature value of 600 or 650 °C. The main cause of deactivation was attributed to the conversion of cobalt oxide to metallic cobalt, which promotes side reactions to form coke. Moreover, when iron was used as a dopant in Co/Al2O3, the nanosheet structure showed the highest specific activity for propylene formation relative to other similar types of only Co/Al2O3 nanosheet catalytic systems. (65,66) Therefore, it can be concluded from the comparative study that Co-mSiO2 showed a high catalytic activity and a lower rate of deactivation for two main reasons: one is the high thermal stability of mSiO2, and the second is due to the stabilization of Co(II) species inside the mesoporous silica network. The strong interaction of cobalt oxide with the support prevented the reduction of cobalt oxide to metallic cobalt, which is indicated by characterization techniques and also explained in characterizations of the spent catalysts.
The dehydrogenation and regeneration cycles were performed for the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst, as shown in Figure S6. It can be seen that the initial activity is still maintained after regeneration of the catalyst two times with similar propylene selectivities for all cycles. This shows that the catalyst can easily be regenerated in the presence of diluted oxygen (3 vol % for 0.5 h). The dehydrogenation–regeneration also highlights the robustness of cobalt oxide present in 2Co-mSiO2, which is capable of maintaining the Co(II) oxidation state after regeneration with good initial activity.
3.3. Characterization of the Spent Catalyst
Propane dehydrogenation occurs along with side reactions to form a lower hydrocarbon and carbon. Therefore, the characterizations were performed on all of the spent catalysts to identify the presence of carbon. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was measured using TGA–DTA, as shown in Figure 8a. The amount of coke formed on the catalysts followed the order 2Co-mSiO2 > 5Co-mSiO2 > 10Co-mSiO2, as shown in Table 2. The DTA graph shows an exothermic peak for all of the samples, which indicated combustion of carbon at different temperatures. In addition to carbon deposition on the catalysts, changes in the phase of the support or cobalt were evaluated using XRD analysis of the spent catalyst, as shown in Figure 8b. The XRD patterns of the spent 10Co-mSiO2 catalyst consist of a peak at 26°, assigned to the formation of graphitic carbon. This analysis illustrates the reason for the higher deactivation of 10Co-mSiO2 during the reaction. The gradual conversion of Co(II) to metallic cobalt under a reducing atmosphere of the reaction conditions could be one of the major causes of catalyst deactivation in the case of 10Co-mSiO2 along with coke deposition. Comparatively, a smaller-intensity peak of graphitic carbon is present in 5Co-mSiO2, whereas 2Co-mSiO2 shows no apparent graphitic carbon peak. There is no detectable peak for metallic cobalt in the 5Co-mSiO2 and 2Co-mSiO2 spent catalysts in the XRD analysis of the used catalyst after the reaction. The XANES analysis performed on the spent 2Co-mSiO2 showed a profile pattern very similar to that of fresh 2Co-mSiO2, shown in Figure 8c. Further, HRTEM of the spent catalysts was performed, and the images are shown in Figure S7. 10Co-mSiO2 showed the formation of large nanoparticles of cobalt, while 2Co-mSiO2 consists of negligible large cobalt nanoparticles obtained after the reaction. This suggests that 2Co-mSiO2 is resistant to agglomeration during the reaction, while a higher metal content undergoes agglomeration during the reaction. This is also the leading cause of higher and faster deactivation of 10Co-mSiO2 compared to that of 2Co-mSiO2. Additionally, HRTEM of 10Co-mSiO2 after 3 h shows the formation of large cobalt nanoparticles (Figure S7c), and with an increase in the reaction time, both cobalt nanoparticles and a filamentous type of carbon were observed in the spent catalysts (Figure S7d). The formation of filamentous carbon deteriorates the mesoporous structure (Figure S7e).

The main cause of deactivation of the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst is carbon deposition, and there is no evidence of the formation of metallic cobalt. The catalyst followed a nonredox mechanism, which resulted in higher propylene selectivity. Even though cobalt existed in the form Co(II) in the 10Co-mSiO2 catalyst, the presence of excess cobalt oxide on the surface of silica might be another reason for deactivation, which resulted in the formation of metallic cobalt. In contrast, low-cobalt-containing catalyst 2Co-mSiO2 was able to sustain a reduction atmosphere and suppressed or completely prevented the formation of metallic cobalt during the reaction.
3.4. Adsorption and Desorption Modes of Propane and Propylene on 2Co-mSiO2
To understand the adsorption of propane and propylene on 2Co-mSiO2, the two gases were flowed at 300 and 550 °C, followed by desorption in the presence of inert gas helium. The adsorption–desorption spectrum of propane is shown in Figure 9a. At 300 °C, the broad peak observed between 2900 and 2700 cm–1 is due to C–H bonds in methyl of gaseous propane. Another wide peak observed between 1600 and 1300 cm–1 may be due to strongly adsorbed propane. (10,67) However, upon desorption under helium flow, no peak is observed in either region. This indicates a weak interaction of propane with the catalysts at lower temperature. At 550 °C, similar peaks were observed in the two-wavenumber region. However, the peak at 2990 cm–1 shifted to 2981 cm–1, as shown in Figure 9b. This shift toward lower frequency indicates a decrease in energy, which may be due to the interaction of hydrogen with the cobalt ions. Additionally, the peak at 2967 cm–1 becomes prominent compared to the peak observed at 300 °C, illustrating the strong interaction of the methyl group of propane with the catalysts. (68) After desorption under a helium flow, no peak is detected even at higher temperature, illustrating the weaker interaction of the catalyst with propane.

When propylene is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts, there are few peaks observed at 300 °C, 2978, 2876, 1625, 1460, and 1381 cm–1 bands, which belong to gas-phase propylene, as shown in Figure 9c. However, the adsorbed propylene is usually observed between 1550 and 1460 cm–1. After desorption under an inert gas, a broad peak appeared at 1577 cm–1 corresponding to the strongly adsorbed propylene or carbonaceous product formed. (69) With an increase in the temperature, the gas-phase propylene peak becomes weaker because of less adsorption at higher temperature. The broad peak at 1577 cm–1 still persists even at higher temperature, which was not observed during propane adsorption. Moreover, a peak at 1650 cm–1 of C═C in propylene is present during adsorption at 300 and 550 °C, and it diminishes after desorption. A comparison of the adsorptions of propane and propylene on the catalyst indicates that propylene bonds strongly with the catalyst, which can be the source of carbon deposition.
3.5. Discussion
The stability of the CoO phase is an important property for a catalyst active for dehydrogenation. The implementation of a one-pot neutral templating method resulted in a high-surface-area mesoporous silica with highly dispersed CoO present in the silica framework, as observed from the characterization techniques of fresh catalysts in section 3.1. The highly dispersed CoO in mSiO2 resulted in a high propylene selectivity with good stability. Although the metal content of 10 wt % also showed the presence of tetrahedral-coordinated Co2+ similar to 2 and 5 wt % Co, the activity dropped drastically during the reaction. The decrease in activity could be attributed to the deposition of carbon and agglomeration of cobalt to form bulk cobalt, which also lowered the propylene selectivity toward the end of the reaction, which is evident from characterization fo the spent catalyst. The insignificant change in the oxidation state of cobalt in 2Co-mSiO2, as is evident from the XANES spectra of the spent catalysts, indicates that cobalt oxide follows a nonredox mechanism during the dehydrogenation reaction. The lower adsorption of propylene and propane from the in situ DRIFTS analysis also supports the nonredox property of cobalt oxide present in mesoporous silica, as shown in Figure S8. ATR analysis performed on the fresh samples showed a peak at around 962 cm–1 which corresponds to the Si–O–H bond, and the peak intensity of this bond decreases with an increase in the cobalt loading. The analysis revealed the surface coverage of cobalt oxide on the surface of silica. (34,70) Therefore, on the basis of this evidence, a simple mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Co-mSiO2 is drawn and shown in Figure 10.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a well-dispersed cobalt-containing mesoporous silica (Co-mSiO2) catalyst was successfully prepared using a facile one-pot synthesis, where a neutral template was used as for the assembly of cobalt in the mesoporous structure of silica at room temperature. The cobalt species is highly incorporated and/or highly dispersed in the mesoporous SiO2 support with a negligible agglomeration of metal oxide or formation of metallic cobalt after the reaction. The presence of actively interacted CoO was confirmed from TPR, XPS, UV–vis, XANES, and EXAFS analysis. An optimal performance was attained by 2Co-mSiO2, which showed 36% propane conversion and 94% propylene selectivity with a lower rate of coking of 4 mgcarbon/gcat·h after 8 h of reaction. The main cause of catalyst deactivation in the case of 10Co-mSiO2 can be assigned to coke formation and the conversion of metal oxide to metallic cobalt during the reaction. However, for 2Co-mSiO2, the sole cause of deactivation is coke deposition on the active surface. All of the catalysts showed coordination geometries very similar to that of Co(II) in tetrahedral coordination. The TOF value calculated for the 2Co-mSiO2 catalyst over a period of 24 h is promising compared to those of other similar types of systems reported previously for propane dehydrogenation. This work demonstrates that Co-mSiO2 is an encouraging catalyst system that can be further modified for the dehydrogenation reaction. Also, with a smaller cobalt content of 2 wt %, high activity, selectivity, and stability can be achieved for propane dehydrogenation. Besides, this work highlighted a simple way of developing highly dispersed transition-metal oxide catalysts suitable for a wide range of thermal catalytic conversions.
