Abstract
In this work, a peony-like coordinatively unsaturating pentahedral aluminum(III)-enriched alumina nanosheet (Al2O3-MG) was successfully prepared by a facile glocuse-assisted hydrothermal approach. In this process, the as-prepared melamine-Al(NO3)3 complex acts as Al source, structural directing agent, and precipitant, and the glucose serves as coordination-modulating, isolating, and structure-directing agent. More interestingly, benefitting from the unique morphology and abundant coordinatively unsaturating pentahedral aluminum(III) sites of carrier, the supported Pt–Sn catalyst (Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG) shows excellent catalytic performance. It gives 26.5% steady-state propane conversion with 99.1% propene selectivity and unexpected catalytic durability for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene under harsh reaction conditions. This work not only creates an excellent alumina support for highly efficient propane-to-propene catalyst but also opens up a window for designing the other oxide supports with diverse morphologies and coordination states regarding a variety of reactions.

I. Introduction
Propene is an important industrial raw material for producing many chemicals like acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, polypropylene, etc. (1−5) The commercial route for propene production is direct dehydrogenation of propane. It has achieved great development, (6−9) especially the use of Pt-based catalyst for its excellent ability to activate paraffinic C–H bonds and low activity for C–C bonds. (10) Propane direct dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction. Thus, 600 °C of high temperature is required to achieve an acceptable conversion of propane, (11) which would lead to deactivation of catalyst due to unavoidable sintering of active Pt metal and coke deposition. Hence, improving the stability of Pt-based catalysts is an urgent task.
Recently, different strategies were adopted to stabilize Pt-based catalysts. One is addition of metallic promoters to modify Pt, such as Sn, (12) Cu, (13) Ga, (14) and In. (15) The other is formation of Pt-based alloys like Pt–Cu, (16) Pt–Zn, (17) Pt–Mn. (18) Especially, the addition of Sn obviously improved both propene selectivity and catalyst stability through suppression of isomerization and hydrogenolysis reactions, minimizing Pt-sintering, neutralizing acidity of the support, and facilitating the transfer of the coke precursor from metal surface to support. (12,13) Besides the modification of active Pt metal by promoters, studies concerning support for Pt–Sn catalyst have also flourished. One strategy is to replace common Al2O3 with low-acidic MgAl2O4, (19) ZnAl2O4, (20) Mg(Al)O hydrotalcites, (21) which effectively stabilized precious metals and reduced coke deposition. Another strategy is to modulate the structure of Al2O3 support. From the kinetics and mass transfer, an open-structured Al2O3 like nanosheet, (22) layer, (23) and nanotube (24) facilitated the mass transfer (25) and the migration of coke precursor, which promoted the reaction.
Generally, the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) can also stabilize the active metals by the oxygen defects existing on the surface of reducible metal oxide like TiO2, (26,27) CeO2, (28) ZrO2. (29) Interestingly, the coordinatively unsaturated pentahedral coordination Al3+ centers (defined as Al3+penta) on a nonreducible alumina carrier could also anchor and stabilize active metals by the so-called “defect” sites. (30) Although the Al2O3 with Al3+penta sites have achieved great attention, (31−40) to develop a facile and efficient method remains a challenge.
Considering that the open structure and defect sites of support are essential to improve catalytic activation and stability of supported Pt–Sn catalysts, a new Al2O3 with unique open structure and enriched pentahedral coordination Al3+ is proposed. Recently, Al2O3 carriers with diverse morphologies including nanorods, (41) flower, (42) nanosticks, (43) nanowires, (44) as well as hollow microspheres (45) were prepared by modulating the Al3+ precursors and precipitants. From refs (46) and (47) melamine can well coordinate with Al3+ to form melamine–Al(NO3)3·9H2O (MA) complex. (46) The ammonia can also be supplied during hydrolysis of melamine. Hopefully, the gradually providing ammonia can adjust the morphology of Al2O3 by using a MA complex as precursor. (38) Moreover, the in situ formed carbon by the carbonization of glucose during the hydrothermal process can also change the morphology by depositing carbon on the as-formed Al(OH)3 nanostructures. (48) Furthermore, owing to good coordination ability of glucose, (49) the added glucose would competitively coordinate with Al(III) ions in the coordination process of melamine with Al. As a consequence, the addition of glucose would hopefully change the coordination state of Al. Therefore, glucose-assisted hydrothermal method can be proposed to synthesize alumina with novel morphology and changeable Al coordination state.
In this work, we report a facile glucose-assisted hydrothermal method for synthesizing novel peony-like coordinatively unsaturating pentahedral Al(III) enriched Al2O3 nanosheets by using MA complex as precursor. It presents an excellent carrier to prepare supported Pt–Sn catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Moreover, the sphere-like Al2O3 nanosheets (Al2O3-M) were also prepared by using the similar process as above except for the absence of glucose (Scheme 1). Interestingly, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG shows outstanding catalytic performance with 26.5% steady-state propane conversion, 99.1% propene selectivity, and unexpected catalytic durability under harsh reaction conditions. Al2O3 carriers and supported Pt–Sn catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption and desorption experiments, X-ray diffraction (XRD), 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (27Al MAS NMR), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), CO chemisorptions, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The origin of the outstanding catalytic performance of supported Pt–Sn catalyst for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene was proposed. It can be ascribed to the promoted mass transfer and coke precursor migration by the unique morphology and the improved Pt sintering-resistance by the stabilizing effect of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate aluminum(III). This work not only creates an excellent support for highly efficient propane-to-propene catalyst but also opens up a new window for designing the other new oxide supports regarding diverse catalytic applications.

II. Experimental Section
Preparation of Al2O3 Support
Novel peony-like pentacoordinate aluminum(III)-enriched alumina nanosheets were successfully prepared by a facile glucose-assisted hydrothermal approach. Typically, 7.5 g of aluminum nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Sinopharm, 99%) and 0.6 g of glucose were dissolved into 50 mL of deionized water to obtain a homogeneous aqueous solution. After that, melamine was added into the above solution under strong stirring at 60 °C under continuous stirring to obtain a homogeneous sol. The resulting sol was transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and then a hydrothermal process was performed. After cooling to ambient temperature, the product was collected by filtering and washing with deionized water several times and then dried at 105 °C overnight. Thus, peony-like pentacoordinate aluminum(III)-enriched alumina nanosheets were achieved by calcining the as-prepared solid in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 4 h. It is named as Al2O3-MG. The diverse molar ratios of glucose/melamine from 0.03 to 0.15 were used to obtain different alumina. A sphere-like alumina was also prepared by using the same procedure as that for Al2O3-MG except for the absence of glucose. It is named as Al2O3-M.
Preparation of Supported Pt–Sn Catalysts
The supported Pt–Sn catalysts on Al2O3-M, Al2O3-MG, and the commercially available Al2O3 (Al2O3-com) were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method. Typically, the calculated amount of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Shenyang Nonferrous Metal Research Institute, 37.5% Pt) and the required SnCl2·2H2O (TianJin GuangFu Technology Development Co. Ltd., 98%) were mixed in anhydrous alcohol to obtain Pt–Sn impregnant solution. After impregnation, the samples were dried for 12 h at 105 °C and calcined for 4 h at 600 °C. The theoretical loadings of Pt species and Sn were 0.5 wt % and 0.95%, respectively. The supported Pt catalysts were also prepared as references.
Characterization of Al2O3 Carriers and Supported Pt–Sn Catalysts
The SEM images were acquired on a JEOL JSM-5600LV SEM instrument. The textural properties of Al2O3 carriers were tested by nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments conducted on a Beishide 3H-2000PS1 apparatus at 77 K. Prior to test, the sample was degassed for 8 h at 150 °C. The actual Pt and Sn loadings were obtained using the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried out on a Rigaku automatic X-ray diffractometer (D/Max 2400). All NMR spectra were collected on an Agilent DD2-500 (B0 = 11.7 T). The XPS spectra were acquired using an ESCALAB 250 XPS system with Al Kα X-ray source. The 27Al MAS NMR was carried out on a DD2-500 instrument at 130.24 MHz with a probe of 4 mm and a pulse width of 0.34 μs. The spinning speed is 14 kHz with a pulse delay of 2 s. The chemical shifts were referenced with the aqueous solution of 1% Al(NO3)3. The TGA curves were acquired using a Mettle Toledo TGA/SDTA851 instrument. H2-TPR experiments were performed on the Builder PCA-1200 apparatus equipped with a thermal conductor detector (TCD). An amount of 50 mg of fresh catalyst (20–40 mesh) was placed in the quartz tube and pretreated in Ar for 1 h at 200 °C. The gas was switched into 15 mL min–1 H2/Ar (10%) after cooling to room temperature. The temperature was maintained at 850 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Before measurement, the spent catalysts were calcined at 630 °C for 2 h to remove the coke. Pt dispersity was obtained by CO-chemisorption on the Builder PCA-1200 apparatus equipped with a TCD detector. An amount of 100 mg of catalyst (20–40 mesh) was placed in a quartz tube and pretreated at 200 °C for 1 h in Ar atmosphere. After the sample was cooled down to room temperature, 20 mL min–1 10 vol % H2/Ar was introduced for reduction for 1 h at 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Then the quartz tube was cooled and maintained at 50 °C in 20 mL min–1 He. 0.3 mL pulse of 10 vol % CO/He mixture was introduced. The dispersity of activity sites was calculated using the followed formula:
where VS represents absorbed CO volume (mL), SF represents stoichiometric constant, SW represents the weight of active metal (g), and MW represents the relative molecular weight of Pt (g mol–1).
Catalytic Performance Test
Propane direct dehydrogenation was carried out in a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm at atmospheric pressure. An amount of 0.15 g catalyst (20–40 mesh) was placed into the constant temperature zone of reactor and prereduced in 20% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 1 h with a heating rate of 10 °C·min–1. Then gas mixture (26% propane) with a total flow rate of 50 mL·min–1 was passed through the reactor at 600 °C. The gas products were analyzed by a TCD on the on-line gas chromatograph with combined Porapak Q and molecular sieves 5A columns. The spent catalyst after 34 h running was regenerated by heated at 500 °C in muffle furnace, and the regeneration performance was tested by using a similar process as above. Conversion of propane and selectivity of products were calculated as follows:
where the letter “i” represents the carbon atom number of gas hydrocarbon products, and Fout[Ci′] represents the flow rate of corresponding product.
III. Results and Discussion
As illustrated in Scheme 1, the melamine, glucose, and Al(NO3)3 were added into deionized water. Then the resulting homogeneous sol was transferred into the Teflon-lined stainless autoclave. A hydrothermal process was performed. Al2O3-MG was prepared by the subsequent washing, drying, and calcination processes. A sphere-like alumina was prepared by using the same procedure as that for Al2O3-MG except for the absence of glucose. It is named Al2O3-M. The supported Pt–Sn catalysts on the as-prepared Al2O3-MG and Al2O3-M were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. They are denoted as Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M, respectively. A commercially available bulk Al2O3 (Al2O3-com) (Figure S1) was used as reference to prepare the supported Pt–Sn catalyst (Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com).
The acquired SEM images are depicted in Figure 1a–d. From Figure 1a, the as-prepared Al2O3-M in the absence of glucose features a sphere-like structure with a size of 2–4 μm. It is composed of closely packed Al2O3 sheets. However, a peony-like Al2O3-MG with a size of ∼1 μm composed of divergent sheets (yellow circles) about 300 nm was successfully prepared by adding glucose (Figure 1b). In order to probe the plausible formation mechanism of the peony-like Al2O3-MG, the SEM studies in the uncalcined Al2O3-MG and Al2O3-M were performed (Figure 1c and Figure 1d). The uncalcined Al2O3-M shows sphere-like nanosheet structures. It also has clear supramolecular aggregates (red circle) resulting from the hydrolysis of melamine (Figure 1c). (47) From Figure 1d, the uncalcined Al2O3-MG features an aggregate of particles. It is different from the peony-like structured Al2O3-MG nanosheets. Therefore, we speculate that the Al2O3 nanosheets have been really formed in the hydrothermal process using MA complex as precursor. The as-formed carbon depositing on the nanosheets endows the uncalcined Al2O3-MG with particulate-like but not nanosheets-like structures. This hypothesis is further verified by TEM studies. From Figure S2, the uncalcined Al2O3-MG features the peony-like structures (red circles) composed of nanosheets. The nanosheets are coated by the as-formed carbon from the hydrothermal process of glucose (Figure S2b). Owing to the isolating effect of the depositing carbon on the Al(OH)3, the peony-like Al2O3 nanosheets (Figure 1b) are formed by calcining the as-formed precursor (Figures 1d and S2). The role of glucose in the hydrothermal process has been further confirmed by the morphology evolution with a gradually increasing glucose (Figure S3). From Figure S3b, while 0.03 molar ratio of glucose/melamine is used, the sample still remains a sphere-like structure with a size of 2–4 μm. But the intensively packed sheets become looser and looser. If the molar ratio of glucose/melamine increases from 0.06 to 0.15, the peony-like nanosheet structure is formed (Figure S3b–f). It is proposed that the structure-directing role of glucose and the isolating role of the as-formed carbon from glucose create the peony-like opening-structured Al2O3 material.

On the basis of the above analysis, a plausible formation process is proposed and illustrated in Figure 1e. Without glucose, MA complex first forms sheet structure. Then the sheets closely pack into spherical structure during the hydrothermal process. If the glucose is added into the mixture, the glucose acts as structure-directing agent to induce assembly of nanosheets into peony-like structure. The isolating effect of the as-formed carbon from glucose depositing on nanosheets makes the assembly become much looser than the sphere-like Al2O3-M prepared in the absence of glucose. The more opened structure of peony-like structured Al2O3-MG composed of nanosheets benefits mass transfer and the coke precursor migration. It allows it to be an excellent carrier to prepare highly efficient supported-type catalysts.
The isotherms and pore size distribution are shown in Figure 2a and Figure 2b. Both of the two Al2O3 materials feature type IV isotherms with hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesopores. (50) Al2O3-MG represents a H4 hysteresis loop, suggesting existence of wedge pores from the peony-like structure. However, Al2O3-M exhibits a H3 hysteresis loop, implying that sphere-like Al2O3-M is composed of sheets with slit-shaped pores. Al2O3-MG shows 2–10 nm of narrow pore size distribution centering at 5 nm, while Al2O3-M shows a wide pore size distribution with 2–20 nm of pore size. Moreover, Al2O3-MG exhibits higher specific surface area (177.0 m2 g–1) than Al2O3-M (120.8 m2 g–1) owing to the isolating effect of carbon from glucose, while the former shows lower pore volume (0.39 cm3 g–1) than the latter (0.44 cm3 g–1) resulting from the nature of wedge pores. XRD patterns of Al2O3-M and Al2O3-MG are presented in Figure 2c. The two samples exhibit the characteristic diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3. The intensity of diffraction peaks of Al2O3-MG is much weaker than that of peaks of Al2O3-M. From ref (51) the diffraction peaks toward (311), (222), and (511) are sensitive to the Al3+ distribution. The weaker peaks indicate the much higher Al3+ disorder of Al2O3-MG than Al2O3-M. The nature of disordered Al3+ was further analyzed by 27Al solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2d), and the fitting spectra are presented in Figure S4. The peaks occurring at 9 and 66 ppm are indexed as the coordinatively saturating Al(III) ions in octahedral (Al3+octa) and tetrahedral (Al3+tetra) coordination, respectively. Interestingly, a peak at 36 ppm appears on the NMR spectrum of Al2O3-MG, indicating the existence of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al(III) (Al3+penta) in the Al2O3-MG. The Al3+penta sites are created by dehydroxylation and/or dehydration. (30) It can be proposed that the coordination bond between Al3+ and O of glucose molecule or O of the polyhydroxycarbon derived from glucose plays an important role in the formation of Al3+penta sites in Al2O3-MG. The O of glucose or of the polyhydroxycarbon derived from glucose binding with Al3+penta produces stable coordinatively saturating Al3+octa. It may be changed to Al3+penta owing to the elimination of C–O by calcination. That is to say, glucose acts as the coordination-modulating agent for changing the disorder degree of Al3+. It increases the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites in pentacoordination. As a consequence, Al2O3-MG shows 18.2 atom % much higher content of Al3+penta than Al2O3-M (1.5 atom %) (Figures 2d and S4). The enriched pentacoordinate Al(III) would efficiently stabilize the metal sites loaded on Al2O3-MG. (30) It allows it to be an excellent support to prepare a robust supported-type catalyst with high sintering-resistance. Moreover, considering the possibly existing C- or N-species from glucose and melamine, XPS and TGA experiments were performed. The survey XPS spectra and TGA curves of the Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M catalysts are presented in Figures S5 and S6, respectively. From Figure S5, no visible N can be detected on the XPS spectra. However, we clearly see the C XPS peaks with 18 atom % of surface carbon species. In order to make clear where the carbon on XPS spectra comes from, TGA experiments on the Al2O3-MG and Al2O3-M catalysts were performed (Figure S6). Almost no weight loss happens on the two catalysts. It confirms that the surface carbon species on XPS spectra does not come from residual carbon in the preparation of carriers. The surface carbon species on the XPS spectra would come from the absorbed CO2. That is to say, by combining XPS and TGA, we confirmed that no C- or N-species existed on the catalysts.

(e, f) Pt 4f and Sn 3d XPS spectra of Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Al2O3-M catalysts.
The as-prepared Al2O3-MG, Al2O3-M, and the commercially available Al2O3-com were employed as carrier to prepare Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M, and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com, respectively. For comparison, the supported Pt catalysts on Al2O3-MG and Al2O3-M were also prepared. From Tables 1 and S1, the five catalysts have 0.49–0.5 wt % of similar Pt loading, while the Sn loadings for Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M, and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com are 0.77, 0.76, and 0.86 wt %, respectively. From Figure 2d, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG shows a lowering Al3+penta sites with the constant total Al3+ sites compared to the bare Al2O3-MG carrier, implying that the loaded Pt atoms bind to coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites of Al2O3-MG via oxygen bridges. As a result, the Pt atoms can be effectively stabilized. From CO chemisorption results, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG shows lower Pt dispersity (6.5%) than the other two (11.1 and 10.5% for Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M, and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com, respectively). However, interestingly, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG catalyst shows unexpectedly higher Pt sintering resistance, and only 12% decrease in Pt dispersity takes place after it suffers from the harsh reaction conditions. Furthermore, compared to the fresh Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG, the spent one demonstrates a lowering amount of Al3+penta sites but an increasing amount of Al3+octa sites (Figure 2d), suggesting the transfer of Al3+penta to Al3+octa.

Figure S7 presents the H2-TPR profiles of Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M, Pt/Al2O3-MG, and Pt/Al2O3-M catalysts. All of them show two reduction zones. The first one centering at 200–300 °C can be assigned to the reduction of PtO2 interacting weakly with Al2O3 and the second one occurring at 400–600 °C can be assigned to the reduction of PtClxOy interacting strongly with Al2O3. (38) No difference in reduction temperature of the two peaks on Pt/Al2O3-MG and Pt/Al2O3-M catalyst can be observed. It suggests that Pt/Al2O3-MG has more PtClxOy interacting strongly with Al2O3 compared to Pt/Al2O3-M. Furthermore, the addition of Sn leads to an increase in reduction temperature. But the increase for Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG is less than that for Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M. It indicates that the interaction between Pt species and Sn species on former is weaker than that on the latter. (38) From refs (30) and (38) the abundant pentacoordinate Al3+ sites on peony-like Al2O3-MG nanosheets can stabilize the loaded metallic sites through intensifying the Pt–Al2O3 and Sn–Al2O3 interaction. As a consequence, the Pt–Sn interaction over Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG can be weakened in comparison with that over Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M. Therefore, the increase in the reduction temperature led by Pt–Sn interaction owing to the addition of Sn regarding of Al2O3-MG as support is less than that concerning Al2O3-M as support. On the other hand, it is evidence of stronger metal–Al2O3-MG interaction than metal–Al2O3-M interaction, ascribed to the abundant pentacocodinate Al(III) on Al2O3-MG.
XPS experiments on the Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M were performed to check the support effect and metal–support interaction (Figure 2e,f). From Figure 2e, compared to supported pure Pt catalyst (70.6 eV), the supported Pt–Sn catalysts show a higher binding energy concerning Pt0 4f (71.8 and 72.1 eV for Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG, respectively). It suggests the electron-defect Pt species led by the electron transfer from Pt to Sn. (13) From Figure 2f, both of the two catalysts show almost the same binding energy and ratio of Sn4+/Sn2+, the different carriers do not affect the Sn state and Pt–Sn interaction. However, Pt 4f appears at different binding energies on the Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M. Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG shows higher binding energy concerning Pt 4f than Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M (Figure 2e). It implies the more defect Pt species owing to the electron transfer from Pt to O bridge of Al–O, originating from the intensified Pt-support interaction owing to the enriched Al3+penta that is confirmed by NMR results (Figure 2d).
Figures 3 and S8 present the catalytic performance of the Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG, Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M, and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com catalysts in the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M catalysts show higher catalytic activity than Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com catalyst, ascribed to the unique peony-like and sphere-like structure. Although Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG has a lower Pt dispersity than Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M (6.5% vs 11.1%) (Table 1), the former shows slightly higher initial activity than the latter. It is ascribed to the promoted mass transfer and the improved accessibility of active sites owing to its higher surface area and larger size of opening-mouth structure of the peony-like Al2O3-MG. Furthermore, from Table S2, the developed Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG catalyst shows much higher specific activity with 99.1% propene selectivity compared to the previously reported Pt-based catalysts. More interestingly, it exhibits much higher catalytic durability than Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M catalyst. From Table 1, the deactivation rate constant of Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG is 0.017 h–1. It is much lower than that of Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M catalyst. Moreover, the recycling performance of the spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG catalyst is presented in Figure S9. The spent catalyst can be almost regenerated, indicating the good reusability of the developed catalyst.

TGA measurement was performed to explore the origin of much higher catalytic durability of Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG catalyst compared to Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com for direct dehydrogenation of propane under 600 °C of harsh reaction conditions. The test results are presented in Figures 4a and S10. From Figures 4a and S10, TGA curves show two weight loss steps. The first one appearing at ∼400 °C is assigned to the coke located at the active Pt, and the second one for the coke is located on the support. (52) The spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M show similar total coke amount (5.0% vs 4.9%), whose coke-resistance is slightly higher than that of Pt–Sn/Al2O3-com (5.7%). The abundant Al3+penta sites of Al2O3-MG do not lead to a visible improvement in coke resistance, which differs from the previously reported remarkably improved coke-resistance. (38) That is to say, the high catalytic durability of Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG cannot be ascribed to the change in the coke behavior. From the above XRD, 27Al MAS NMR, and chemisorption analyses, the intensified metal–support interaction by the stabilizing effect of coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate aluminum(III) efficiently improves the metal sintering resistance. It can be the main reason for the unexpectedly high catalytic stability.

From the 27Al MAS NMR spectra shown in Figures 2d and S4, the strongly stabilizing effect of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+penta through oxygen-bridge on the Pt sites was confirmed by the lowering content of Al3+penta of supported Pt–Sn catalyst (11.0 atom %) compared to the bare Al2O3-MG support (18.2 atom %). (30) Furthermore, the spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG catalyst shows a similar Al3+penta content to the fresh one (11.0 atom % vs 10.8 atom %). It suggests that no obvious change in Pt species happens. H2-TPR experiments on the fresh and spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG and Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M catalysts were performed to further study the stabilizing effect of Al3+penta sites in the Al2O3-MG carrier. From Figure 4b, the spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG exhibits similar H2-TPR behavior to the fresh one. It implies the invariable characteristic of active sites on the spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG catalyst compared to fresh one owing to the stabilizing effect of the Al3+penta sites. However, the spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M shows notably different redox behavior from the fresh one. It indicates the obvious change in the characteristic of active sites owing to the weak metal–support interaction. The first reduction peak assigned to the reduction of PtO2 interacted weakly with Al2O3 on Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M shifts to a higher temperature from 290 to 347 °C with a weak and broad characteristic when it suffers from the harsh reaction condition, indicating the Pt sintering. (38,53) Moreover, the second peak on Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M catalyst assigned to the reduction of PtClxOy interacted strongly with Al2O3 shifts to a lower reduction temperature from 560 to 525 °C after it suffers from reaction process, indicating the existence of strong PtClxOy-Al2O3 interaction. (38) The lowering strength of interaction of PtClxOy-Al2O3 on the spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3-M catalyst compared to the fresh one is also an indicator for the size growth of PtClxOy. In other words, the coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate aluminum(III) on the as-prepared Al2O3-MG carrier efficiently stabilizes the loaded Pt active sites by the strengthened metal–support interaction. As a consequence, the developed Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG catalyst shows notably promoted catalytic stability for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene.
IV. Conclusions
In summary, a novel peony-like coordinatively unsaturating pentahedral aluminum(III)-enriched alumina nanosheets (Al2O3-MG) were prepared by a facile glucose-assisted hydrothermal method. It serves as an excellent carrier to prepare supported Pt–Sn catalyst. Pt–Sn/Al2O3-MG demonstrates excellent catalytic performance for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene under harsh reaction conditions. 26.5% steady-state propane conversion with 99.1% propene selectivity and unexpected catalytic durability has been achieved. It originates from the promoted mass transfer and coke precursor migration by the unique morphology and the improved Pt sintering-resistance by the intensified metal–support interaction owing to the stabilizing effect of the abundant coordinatively unsaturating pentahedral aluminum(III). This work not only creates an excellent alumina carrier for propane-to-propene catalyst but also opens up a new window for designing the other new oxide supports regarding diverse catalytic applications.
