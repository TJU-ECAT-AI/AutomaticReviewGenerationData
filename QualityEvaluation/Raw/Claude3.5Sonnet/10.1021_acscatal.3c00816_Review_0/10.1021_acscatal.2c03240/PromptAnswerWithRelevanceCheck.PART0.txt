<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology, its advantages, or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods. The text appears to be a partial citation or reference to a scientific article about nickel catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but it does not provide any details about the PDH process itself or its benefits compared to other propylene production methods. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided information.
