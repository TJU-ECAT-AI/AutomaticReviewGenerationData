[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and isobutane is such attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, respectively."

[2] "Besides these two major processes, on-purpose production of lower olefins becomes more important to fulfill the growing demand especially for propene."

[3] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were also reported to be active and selective in DH of n-butane"

[4] "Catalysts with supported VOx are among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, helping to meet the growing demand specifically for propylene.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to traditional naphtha cracking.

3. High selectivity: PDH catalysts, especially supported VOx catalysts, show high selectivity towards propylene.

4. Good stability: Supported VOx catalysts demonstrate good onstream stability.

5. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH avoids the need for oxygen and associated safety concerns.

6. Product purity: Direct dehydrogenation typically produces higher purity propylene compared to cracking processes.

These advantages address challenges faced by conventional methods by providing a more flexible, efficient, and selective route to propylene production, helping to meet the increasing global demand.
