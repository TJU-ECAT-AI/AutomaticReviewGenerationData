<quotes>

[1] "Besides these two major processes, on-purpose production of lower olefins becomes more important to fulfill the growing demand especially for propene. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and isobutane is such attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, respectively."

[2] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were also reported to be active and selective in DH of n-butane"

[3] "Catalysts with supported VOx are among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

</quotes>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, which cannot be fully met by conventional production methods.

2. It provides an on-purpose production route specifically for propylene, allowing more targeted and efficient production.

3. PDH offers good selectivity towards propylene, minimizing unwanted byproducts.

4. The process demonstrates good onstream stability, allowing for consistent production over time.

5. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the diminishing naphtha feedstock used in steam cracking.

6. PDH technology can be more efficient than conventional methods as it is a dedicated process for propylene production rather than a byproduct of other processes.

While the text does not explicitly compare PDH to all conventional methods, it suggests that PDH addresses challenges in feedstock availability by using propane, improves efficiency through targeted production, and offers high selectivity and stability compared to other processes.

[2] "Catalysts with supported VOx are among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

[3] "Recently, we published a comparative study of isobutane DH over VOx species dispersed on SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2-Al2O3. Highest selectivity to isobutene was obtained over VOx/Al2O3 whereas VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"
