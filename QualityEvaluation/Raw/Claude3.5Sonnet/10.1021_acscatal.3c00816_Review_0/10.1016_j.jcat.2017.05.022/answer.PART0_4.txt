[1] "Besides these two major processes, on-purpose production of lower olefins becomes more important to fulfill the growing demand especially for propene."

[2] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and isobutane is such attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, respectively."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted production of propylene, addressing the growing demand that cannot be fully met by conventional methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers better control over the reaction and potentially higher energy efficiency.

4. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

5. Scalability: PDH plants can be built at various scales to meet specific market demands.

6. Independence from refinery operations: Unlike FCC, PDH is not tied to refinery operations, allowing for more flexible production.

These advantages address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional methods, making PDH particularly attractive for meeting the increasing global propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性地生产丙烯，满足传统方法无法完全满足的不断增长的需求。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 过程效率：作为一种非氧化过程，PDH提供了更好的反应控制和潜在的更高能源效率。

4. 产品选择性：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解（FCC）相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。

5. 可扩展性：PDH装置可以按各种规模建造，以满足特定的市场需求。

6. 独立于炼油厂操作：与FCC不同，PDH不依赖于炼油厂操作，允许更灵活的生产。

这些优势解决了传统方法在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使PDH特别适合满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。
