[1] "Besides these two major processes, on-purpose production of lower olefins becomes more important to fulfill the growing demand especially for propene. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and isobutane is such attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, respectively."

[2] "Catalysts with supported VOx are among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

[3] "Recently, we published a comparative study of isobutane DH over VOx species dispersed on SiO2, Al2O3, and SiO2-Al2O3. Highest selectivity to isobutene was obtained over VOx/Al2O3 whereas VOx supported on SiO2-containing supports performed less selectively due to coke formation and isomerization of isobutene to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes). The latter reaction is impossible with propene and therefore propane DH can be selectively catalyzed by VOx/MCM-41"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, on-demand production of propylene, addressing the growing global demand more directly than conventional methods.

2. Feedstock flexibility: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is more efficient than steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking in producing propylene.

4. High selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity to propylene, especially when using catalysts like VOx/MCM-41, which show good selectivity and stability.

5. Reduced byproducts: Unlike steam cracking, PDH does not produce unwanted byproducts like ethylene, allowing for a more focused production of propylene.

6. Improved control: The direct nature of PDH allows for better control over the production process and output.

7. Lower energy consumption: PDH generally requires less energy compared to the high temperatures needed for steam cracking.

8. Complementary to existing methods: PDH can be used alongside conventional methods to help meet the increasing propylene demand that cannot be fulfilled by steam cracking and FCC alone.

These advantages make PDH technology particularly well-suited to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性、按需生产丙烯，比传统方法更直接地满足不断增长的全球需求。

2. 原料灵活性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油更容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：作为直接转化工艺，PDH在生产丙烯方面比蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化更有效率。

4. 高选择性：PDH可以实现对丙烯的高选择性，特别是使用像VOx/MCM-41这样的催化剂时，表现出良好的选择性和稳定性。

5. 减少副产品：与蒸汽裂解不同，PDH不会产生不需要的副产品如乙烯，从而实现更集中的丙烯生产。

6. 改进控制：PDH的直接特性允许对生产过程和产出进行更好的控制。

7. 降低能耗：与蒸汽裂解所需的高温相比，PDH通常需要较少的能量。

8. 与现有方法互补：PDH可以与传统方法一起使用，以帮助满足仅靠蒸汽裂解和FCC无法满足的不断增长的丙烯需求。

这些优势使PDH技术特别适合解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
