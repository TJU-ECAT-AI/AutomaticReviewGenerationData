[1] "Besides these two major processes, on-purpose production of lower olefins becomes more important to fulfill the growing demand especially for propene. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and isobutane is such attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, respectively."

[2] "VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were also reported to be active and selective in DH of n-butane"

[3] "Catalysts with supported VOx are among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene, which cannot be fully met by conventional production methods.

2. It provides an on-purpose production route specifically for propylene, allowing more targeted and efficient production.

3. PDH offers good selectivity towards propylene, minimizing unwanted byproducts.

4. The process demonstrates good onstream stability, allowing for consistent production over time.

5. It utilizes propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to the diminishing naphtha feedstock used in steam cracking.

6. PDH technology can be more efficient than conventional methods as it is a dedicated process for propylene production rather than a byproduct of other processes.

While the text does not explicitly compare PDH to all conventional methods, it suggests that PDH addresses challenges in feedstock availability by using propane, improves efficiency through targeted production, and offers high selectivity and stability compared to other processes.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势：

1. 它直接解决了不断增长的丙烯需求，而这一需求无法通过传统生产方法完全满足。

2. 它为丙烯提供了一种专门的生产路线，实现更有针对性和高效的生产。

3. PDH对丙烯具有良好的选择性，最大限度地减少了不需要的副产品。

4. 该工艺表现出良好的在线稳定性，可以长期稳定生产。

5. 它使用丙烷作为原料，相比用于蒸汽裂解的日益减少的石脑油原料，丙烷更容易获得。

6. PDH技术可能比传统方法更高效，因为它是专门用于丙烯生产的工艺，而不是其他工艺的副产品。

虽然文本没有明确将PDH与所有传统方法进行比较，但它表明PDH通过使用丙烷解决了原料可用性的挑战，通过有针对性的生产提高了效率，并与其他工艺相比提供了高选择性和稳定性。
