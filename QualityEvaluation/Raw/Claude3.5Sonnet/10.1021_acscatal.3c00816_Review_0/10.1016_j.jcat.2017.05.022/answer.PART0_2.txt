[1] "Besides these two major processes, on-purpose production of lower olefins becomes more important to fulfill the growing demand especially for propene. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and isobutane is such attractive alternative to produce propene and isobutene, respectively."

[2] "Catalysts with supported VOx are among the most promising because they show good onstream stability and high selectivity. Reduced VOx species are suggested to be the active sites for DH"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted propylene production to meet growing demand, unlike traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

2. Feedstock flexibility: It uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to naphtha used in steam cracking.

3. High selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, especially with optimized catalysts like supported VOx.

4. Good stability: Catalysts such as supported VOx show good onstream stability, allowing for consistent production.

5. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH is potentially more efficient than multi-step processes.

6. Independence from petroleum refining: Unlike FCC, PDH is not tied to petroleum refining cycles.

These advantages make PDH well-suited to address challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术在丙烯生产方面具有以下几个关键优势：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许针对性生产丙烯以满足日益增长的需求，不像传统方法将丙烯作为副产品生产。

2. 原料灵活性：它使用丙烷作为原料，与蒸汽裂解中使用的石脑油相比更容易获得。

3. 高选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，特别是使用经过优化的催化剂如负载型VOx。

4. 良好的稳定性：像负载型VOx这样的催化剂表现出良好的在线稳定性，可以实现持续稳定的生产。

5. 工艺效率：作为直接转化过程，PDH可能比多步骤工艺更高效。

6. 独立于石油炼制：与流化催化裂化(FCC)不同，PDH不受石油炼制周期的限制。

这些优势使PDH非常适合解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
