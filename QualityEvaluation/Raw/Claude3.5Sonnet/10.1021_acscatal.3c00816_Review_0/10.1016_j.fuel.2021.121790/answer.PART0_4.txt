[1] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases"

[2] "Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand"

[3] "In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes."

[4] "In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins and propane dehydrogenation (PDH), etc., for propylene production are desirable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane from cheap shale and natural gas resources, addressing the limitation of conventional methods that rely on naphtha and crude oil.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is more energy-efficient compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes, which are high energy-consuming.

3. Environmental impact: PDH is a more environmentally-friendly process, reducing emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants associated with conventional methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH is a direct route to propylene, potentially offering higher selectivity compared to other processes.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH helps address the increasing global demand for propylene that conventional methods can no longer satisfy.

By leveraging abundant propane feedstocks, improving energy efficiency, reducing environmental impact, and potentially increasing product selectivity, PDH technology directly addresses the challenges faced by conventional production methods and positions itself as a promising solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.
