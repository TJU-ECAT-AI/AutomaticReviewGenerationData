[1] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases"

[2] "To cater to the foregoing issues, numerous groups' efforts have been dedicated to design various catalysts, such as the supported catalysts with active metal oxides (e.g., CoOx, VOx, GaOx, and SnOx, etc.), which exhibit considerable activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction."

[3] "Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand"

[4] "In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant shale and natural gas as feedstock, addressing the limitations of conventional methods that rely on naphtha and crude oil.

2. Process efficiency: Unlike steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, which are high energy-consuming processes, PDH is more energy-efficient.

3. Environmental impact: PDH significantly reduces CO2 and NOx emissions compared to conventional methods.

4. Product selectivity: With the development of various catalysts, PDH exhibits considerable activity and propylene selectivity.

5. Meeting demand: PDH helps address the growing demand for propylene that conventional methods can no longer satisfy.

6. Flexibility: As an alternative route to propylene production, PDH offers more options and flexibility in the petrochemical industry.

These advantages make PDH a promising solution to the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, while also addressing environmental concerns and meeting increasing global demand for propylene.
