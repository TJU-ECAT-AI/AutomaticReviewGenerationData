[1] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases"

[2] "Till now, the productivity of propylene practiced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes derived from naphtha and crude oil can no longer meet the ever-growing demand"

[3] "In addition, not only high energy-consuming is required, but also the emissions of CO2 and NOx contaminants are increased significantly during the foregoing two processes."

[4] "In such a case, more energy efficient and environmental-friendly benign processes, such as methanol-to-olefins and propane dehydrogenation (PDH), etc., for propylene production are desirable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant shale gas and natural gas as feedstocks, addressing the challenge of limited naphtha and crude oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is more energy-efficient compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes, which are highly energy-consuming.

3. Environmental impact: PDH is a more environmentally-friendly process, producing fewer CO2 and NOx emissions compared to conventional methods.

4. Product selectivity: PDH offers higher propylene selectivity, as it directly converts propane to propylene, unlike steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking which produce a mixture of products.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH helps address the ever-growing demand for propylene that conventional methods can no longer satisfy.

6. Flexibility: As an alternative route to propylene production, PDH provides more options and flexibility in the propylene supply chain.

These advantages make PDH a promising technology to overcome the challenges of feedstock limitations, high energy consumption, and environmental concerns associated with traditional propylene production methods, while meeting the increasing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用廉价且丰富的页岩气和天然气作为原料，解决了传统生产方法面临的石脑油和原油资源有限的挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺相比，PDH的能源效率更高，而传统工艺则非常耗能。

3. 环境影响：PDH是一种更环保的工艺，与传统方法相比，产生的CO2和NOx排放更少。

4. 产品选择性：PDH提供更高的丙烯选择性，因为它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，不像蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解那样产生混合产品。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH有助于满足传统方法无法满足的日益增长的丙烯需求。

6. 灵活性：作为丙烯生产的替代路线，PDH为丙烯供应链提供了更多选择和灵活性。

这些优势使PDH成为一种有前景的技术，可以克服与传统丙烯生产方法相关的原料限制、高能耗和环境问题等挑战，同时满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。
