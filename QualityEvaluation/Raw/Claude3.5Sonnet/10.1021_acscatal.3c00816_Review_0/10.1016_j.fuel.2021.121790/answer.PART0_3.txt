[1] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases"

[2] "Currently, two representative of PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts have been commercially applied in the PDH process"

[3] "Such catalysts perform high activity and selectivity, but some corresponding drawbacks are accompanied, 1) the high-price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI); 2) the rapid deactivation caused by the sintering of metal particles and the coke deposition; 3) the successive regeneration resulting in activity attenuation and massive CO2 emissions."

[4] "To cater to the foregoing issues, numerous groups' efforts have been dedicated to design various catalysts, such as the supported catalysts with active metal oxides (e.g., CoOx, VOx, GaOx, and SnOx, etc.), which exhibit considerable activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize cheap and abundant shale gas and natural gas as feedstock, addressing the issue of limited naphtha and crude oil resources faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH offers better control over the reaction and potentially higher energy efficiency compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, allowing for more targeted production of propylene compared to the mixed product streams from conventional methods.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH potentially produces fewer CO2 and NOx emissions compared to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes.

5. Economical advantages: With the increasing availability of low-cost propane from shale gas, PDH becomes more economically attractive.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in catalyst design. Current commercial catalysts like PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 have drawbacks including high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation. Ongoing research is focused on developing alternative catalysts that are more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly to address these issues and further improve the PDH process.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术具有几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用廉价且丰富的页岩气和天然气作为原料，解决了传统生产方法面临的石脑油和原油资源有限的问题。

2. 工艺效率：作为一种非氧化过程，PDH提供了更好的反应控制，与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解相比，可能具有更高的能源效率。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，与传统方法的混合产品流相比，可以更有针对性地生产丙烯。

4. 环境效益：与传统的蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺相比，PDH可能产生更少的CO2和NOx排放。

5. 经济优势：随着页岩气中低成本丙烷的日益可用，PDH变得更具经济吸引力。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在催化剂设计方面。目前的商业催化剂如PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3存在高成本、毒性和快速失活等缺点。正在进行的研究集中在开发更高效、更具成本效益和环境友好的替代催化剂，以解决这些问题并进一步改进PDH工艺。
