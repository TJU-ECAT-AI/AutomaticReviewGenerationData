[1] "Non-oxidative PDH as an alternative route to propylene has received particular attention in recent years from industry and academia with the increasing exploration of cheap shale and natural gases"

[2] "Currently, two representative of PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts have been commercially applied in the PDH process"

[3] "Such catalysts perform high activity and selectivity, but some corresponding drawbacks are accompanied, 1) the high-price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI); 2) the rapid deactivation caused by the sintering of metal particles and the coke deposition; 3) the successive regeneration resulting in activity attenuation and massive CO2 emissions."

[4] "To cater to the foregoing issues, numerous groups' efforts have been dedicated to design various catalysts, such as the supported catalysts with active metal oxides (e.g., CoOx, VOx, GaOx, and SnOx, etc.), which exhibit considerable activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction. Nevertheless, such catalysts still yet suffer from rapid deactivation easily."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH can utilize cheap and abundant shale gas and natural gas as feedstocks, addressing the issue of limited naphtha availability faced by conventional steam cracking methods.

2. Process efficiency: As a non-oxidative process, PDH is more energy-efficient compared to traditional steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH offers high propylene selectivity, allowing for more targeted production of propylene compared to conventional methods that produce a mix of olefins.

4. Environmental benefits: PDH potentially has lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional processes, though this depends on the specific catalyst and process design.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. Catalyst limitations: Current commercial catalysts (PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3) have drawbacks including high cost, toxicity, and rapid deactivation due to coking and sintering.

2. Catalyst regeneration: Frequent regeneration of catalysts leads to activity loss over time and increased CO2 emissions.

3. Catalyst development: While alternative catalysts (e.g., CoOx, VOx, GaOx, SnOx) show promise in activity and selectivity, they still suffer from rapid deactivation.

Overall, PDH technology offers significant potential to address the growing demand for propylene, but further advancements in catalyst design and process optimization are needed to fully realize its benefits and overcome existing limitations.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH可以利用廉价且丰富的页岩气和天然气作为原料，解决了传统蒸汽裂解方法面临的石脑油供应有限的问题。

2. 工艺效率：作为一种非氧化过程，与传统的蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解方法相比，PDH更加节能。

3. 产品选择性：PDH提供高丙烯选择性，与生产混合烯烃的传统方法相比，可以更有针对性地生产丙烯。

4. 环境效益：PDH潜在地具有较低的CO2排放，尽管这取决于具体的催化剂和工艺设计。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 催化剂限制：当前商业催化剂（PtSn/Al2O3和CrOx/Al2O3）存在缺点，包括成本高、毒性和由于结焦和烧结导致的快速失活。

2. 催化剂再生：频繁的催化剂再生会导致活性随时间损失并增加CO2排放。

3. 催化剂开发：虽然替代催化剂（如CoOx、VOx、GaOx、SnOx）在活性和选择性方面显示出前景，但它们仍然容易快速失活。

总的来说，PDH技术在满足日益增长的丙烯需求方面具有巨大潜力，但需要在催化剂设计和工艺优化方面取得进一步进展，以充分实现其效益并克服现有限制。
