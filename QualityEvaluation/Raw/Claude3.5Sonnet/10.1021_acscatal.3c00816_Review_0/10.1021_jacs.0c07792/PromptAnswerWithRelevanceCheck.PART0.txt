<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to answering the question about propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology and its advantages for propylene production. The document appears to be about a coking-resistant iron catalyst for ethane dehydrogenation, which is a different process. Without relevant information from the provided text, I cannot accurately answer the question about PDH technology's advantages or how it addresses challenges in propylene production.
