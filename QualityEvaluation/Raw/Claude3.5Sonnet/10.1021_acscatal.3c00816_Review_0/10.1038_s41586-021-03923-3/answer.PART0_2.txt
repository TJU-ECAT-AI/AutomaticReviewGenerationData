The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the key advantages of PDH technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology:

1. PDH is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, which is an industrially important platform chemical. This suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock availability, as it uses propane instead of oil.

2. The research introduces a new method for preparing environmentally compatible catalysts based on commercial ZnO. This addresses the environmental challenges faced by conventional PDH technologies that use toxic Cr(VI) compounds or require ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration.

3. The newly developed catalyst shows about three times higher propene productivity compared to existing catalysts, while maintaining similar propene selectivity. This indicates improved process efficiency and potentially addresses the challenge of product selectivity.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss all the advantages of PDH technology, it does highlight improvements in environmental compatibility and catalyst performance, which are likely to contribute to making PDH a promising method for propylene production.

虽然文献并未直接回答关于PDH技术在原料可用性、过程效率和产品选择性方面的主要优势的所有方面，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出PDH技术的一些优势：

1. PDH是生产丙烯的一种重要替代油基裂解工艺的方法，丙烯是一种工业上重要的平台化学品。这表明PDH在原料可用性方面可能具有优势，因为它使用丙烷而不是石油。

2. 该研究介绍了一种基于商业ZnO制备环境兼容催化剂的新方法。这解决了传统PDH技术使用有毒的Cr(VI)化合物或需要使用对生态有害的氯进行催化剂再生所面临的环境挑战。

3. 新开发的催化剂显示出比现有催化剂高出约三倍的丙烯生产率，同时保持类似的丙烯选择性。这表明过程效率得到了提高，并可能解决了产品选择性的挑战。

尽管文献没有明确讨论PDH技术的所有优势，但它确实强调了环境兼容性和催化剂性能的改进，这些可能有助于使PDH成为丙烯生产的一种有前景的方法。
