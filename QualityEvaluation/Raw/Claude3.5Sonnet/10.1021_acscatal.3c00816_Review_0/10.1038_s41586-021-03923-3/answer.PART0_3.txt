The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology:

1. PDH is an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for producing propene, which is an industrially important platform chemical. This suggests that PDH may offer advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility, as it uses propane rather than oil.

2. The development of new catalysts, such as the ZnO-based catalyst described in the literature, addresses some of the environmental concerns associated with current commercial PDH technologies. This new catalyst is described as environmentally compatible, avoiding the toxicity issues of Cr-containing catalysts and the need for ecologically harmful chlorine in catalyst regeneration.

3. The newly developed ZnO-based catalyst shows improved performance, with about three times higher propene productivity at similar propene selectivity compared to a commercial KCrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. This suggests that PDH technology, when coupled with advanced catalysts, can offer improved process efficiency and maintain high product selectivity.

While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss feedstock availability or compare PDH to all conventional production methods, it does highlight some advantages in terms of environmental compatibility and potential for improved efficiency and selectivity through catalyst development.

文献并未直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的主要优势的所有方面。然而，根据提供的信息，我们可以推断PDH技术的一些优势：

1. PDH是生产丙烯的油基裂解工艺的重要替代方法，丙烯是一种重要的工业平台化学品。这表明PDH可能在原料灵活性方面具有优势，因为它使用丙烷而不是石油。

2. 新型催化剂的开发，如文献中描述的基于ZnO的催化剂，解决了当前商业PDH技术存在的一些环境问题。这种新催化剂被描述为环境兼容的，避免了含铬催化剂的毒性问题和催化剂再生过程中使用生态有害氯的需求。

3. 新开发的基于ZnO的催化剂显示出improved性能，与商业KCrOx/Al2O3催化剂相比，丙烯生产率提高了约三倍，同时保持了类似的丙烯选择性。这表明PDH技术，当与先进催化剂结合时，可以提供改进的工艺效率并保持高产品选择性。

虽然文献没有明确讨论原料可用性或将PDH与所有传统生产方法进行比较，但它确实强调了一些环境兼容性方面的优势，以及通过催化剂开发提高效率和选择性的潜力。
