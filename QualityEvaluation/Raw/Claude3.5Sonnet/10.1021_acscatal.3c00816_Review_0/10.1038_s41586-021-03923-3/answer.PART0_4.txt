The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH technology:

1. PDH is presented as an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for propene production, suggesting it may address feedstock availability issues associated with oil-based methods.

2. The research introduces a new environmentally compatible catalyst based on commercial ZnO, which addresses the environmental concerns associated with current commercial PDH technologies that use toxic Cr(VI) compounds or require ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration.

3. The newly developed catalyst demonstrates about three times higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity compared to existing catalysts, indicating improved process efficiency.

While the text doesn't explicitly discuss all the advantages of PDH technology or how it addresses challenges faced by conventional production methods, it does highlight improvements in environmental compatibility and process efficiency, which are likely key factors in making PDH a promising method for propylene production.

虽然文献并未直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在原料供应、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的主要优势的所有方面，但根据所提供的信息，我们可以推断出PDH技术的一些优势：

1. PDH被描述为生产丙烯的一种重要的替代油基裂解工艺，这表明它可能解决了与油基方法相关的原料供应问题。

2. 该研究介绍了一种基于商业ZnO的新型环境兼容催化剂，解决了当前商业PDH技术使用有毒Cr(VI)化合物或需要使用生态有害氯进行催化剂再生的环境问题。

3. 新开发的催化剂在保持类似丙烯选择性的同时，展现出约三倍于现有催化剂的丙烯生产力，表明工艺效率得到了提高。

尽管文本没有明确讨论PDH技术的所有优势，或它如何解决传统生产方法面临的挑战，但它确实强调了环境兼容性和工艺效率的改进，这可能是使PDH成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法的关键因素。
