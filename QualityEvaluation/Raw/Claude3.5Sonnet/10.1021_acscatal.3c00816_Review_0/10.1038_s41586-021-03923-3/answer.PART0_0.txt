The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity compared to conventional production methods. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some advantages of PDH:

1. PDH is presented as an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for propene production, suggesting it may address feedstock availability issues associated with traditional methods.

2. The research introduces a new environmentally compatible catalyst based on commercial ZnO, which addresses the environmental concerns associated with current commercial PDH technologies using Cr or Pt catalysts.

3. The newly developed catalyst shows about three times higher propene productivity while maintaining similar propene selectivity, indicating improved process efficiency.

While the document doesn't explicitly discuss all the advantages of PDH technology or compare it comprehensively to conventional methods, it does highlight some key improvements in catalyst technology that could make PDH more attractive for propylene production.

虽然文献并没有直接回答关于丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面相比传统生产方法的关键优势的所有方面，但根据提供的信息，我们可以推断出PDH的一些优势：

1. PDH被描述为生产丙烯的重要替代方案，取代油基裂解工艺，这表明它可能解决了传统方法相关的原料可用性问题。

2. 研究介绍了一种基于商业ZnO的新型环境兼容催化剂，解决了当前使用Cr或Pt催化剂的商业PDH技术相关的环境问题。

3. 新开发的催化剂显示出约三倍的丙烯生产率，同时保持类似的丙烯选择性，表明工艺效率得到了提高。

虽然文档没有明确讨论PDH技术的所有优势，或全面比较它与传统方法的差异，但它确实强调了催化剂技术的一些关键改进，这可能使PDH在丙烯生产中更具吸引力。
