The literature does not directly address all aspects of the question regarding the key advantages of PDH technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity. However, based on the information provided, PDH is presented as an important alternative to oil-based cracking processes for propene production. The main advantages of the new PDH method described in the literature are:

1. Environmental compatibility: The new method uses ZnO-based catalysts, which are more environmentally friendly compared to commercial PDH technologies that use toxic Cr(VI) compounds or require ecologically harmful chlorine for catalyst regeneration.

2. Improved productivity: The developed catalyst shows about three times higher propene productivity compared to conventional catalysts, while maintaining similar propene selectivity.

3. Use of alternative feedstock: PDH uses propane as a feedstock, which can be an advantage in regions where propane is more readily available than oil-based feedstocks.

While the literature does not explicitly discuss feedstock availability or process efficiency, the improved catalyst performance and use of propane as a feedstock suggest that PDH technology could address some challenges faced by conventional production methods.

文献并未直接回答关于PDH技术在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的主要优势的所有方面。然而，根据所提供的信息，PDH被认为是生产丙烯的油基裂解工艺的重要替代方案。文献中描述的新PDH方法的主要优势包括：

1. 环境兼容性：新方法使用基于ZnO的催化剂，与使用有毒Cr(VI)化合物或需要使用对生态有害的氯气进行催化剂再生的商业PDH技术相比，更加环保。

2. 提高生产力：开发的催化剂显示出约三倍于传统催化剂的丙烯生产力，同时保持类似的丙烯选择性。

3. 使用替代原料：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，这在丙烷比油基原料更容易获得的地区可能是一个优势。

虽然文献没有明确讨论原料可用性或工艺效率，但改进的催化剂性能和使用丙烷作为原料表明，PDH技术可能解决了传统生产方法面临的一些挑战。
