[1] "The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene"

[2] "Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness"

[3] "The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C)"

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for industrial-scale propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. It directly addresses the increasing demand for propylene in the feedstock market.

2. PDH utilizes Pt catalysts, which offer efficient C-H bond activation, longer catalyst lifespan, and environmental friendliness compared to conventional methods.

3. The process is highly selective, focusing on C-H bond activation rather than C-C bond cleavage, leading to improved product selectivity.

4. PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, providing more control over output compared to traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

5. It can utilize propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than the feedstocks used in conventional propylene production methods.

While PDH technology requires significant energy input due to the thermal stability of propane, its advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity make it a promising solution to address the challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术因以下几个关键优势而成为工业规模丙烯生产的有前景方法：

1. 它直接应对了原料市场对丙烯日益增长的需求。

2. PDH使用铂催化剂，与传统方法相比，这种催化剂具有高效的C-H键活化、更长的催化剂寿命和环境友好性等优势。

3. 该过程具有高度选择性，专注于C-H键活化而非C-C键断裂，从而提高了产品选择性。

4. PDH允许有目的地生产丙烯，与传统方法将丙烯作为副产品生产相比，可以更好地控制产量。

5. 它可以利用丙烷作为原料，而丙烷比传统丙烯生产方法使用的原料更容易获得。

虽然由于丙烷的热稳定性，PDH技术需要大量能量输入，但其在原料灵活性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的优势使其成为解决传统丙烯生产方法所面临挑战的有前景的解决方案。
