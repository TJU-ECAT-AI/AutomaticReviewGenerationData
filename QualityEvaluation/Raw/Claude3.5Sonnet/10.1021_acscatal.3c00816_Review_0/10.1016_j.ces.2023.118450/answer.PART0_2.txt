[1] "The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene"

[2] "Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene in the feedstock market.

2. It is an "on-purpose" production method, allowing for targeted propylene production.

3. Pt-based catalysts used in PDH provide efficient C-H bond activation, avoiding undesired C-C bond cleavage.

4. The process offers longer catalyst lifetimes compared to conventional methods.

5. PDH is more environmentally friendly than traditional propylene production methods.

These advantages allow PDH to overcome challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The ability to use propane as a feedstock provides an alternative to traditional naphtha cracking, addressing feedstock availability issues. The selective C-H bond activation improves propylene selectivity compared to less selective cracking processes. Additionally, the longer catalyst lifetimes and environmental benefits contribute to improved overall process efficiency and sustainability.

PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为一种有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 它直接满足了丙烯在原料市场上不断增长的需求。

2. 它是一种"定向"生产方法，允许有针对性地生产丙烯。

3. PDH中使用的铂基催化剂提供了高效的C-H键活化，避免了不必要的C-C键断裂。

4. 与传统方法相比，该工艺提供了更长的催化剂寿命。

5. PDH比传统的丙烯生产方法更环保。

这些优势使PDH能够克服传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。使用丙烷作为原料的能力为传统的石脑油裂解提供了一种替代方案，解决了原料可用性问题。选择性C-H键活化提高了丙烯选择性，相比于较低选择性的裂解过程。此外，更长的催化剂寿命和环境效益有助于提高整体工艺效率和可持续性。
