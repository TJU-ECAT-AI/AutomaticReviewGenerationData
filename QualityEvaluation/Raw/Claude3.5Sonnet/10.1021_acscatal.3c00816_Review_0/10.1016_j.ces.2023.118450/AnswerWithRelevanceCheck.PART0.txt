          [1] "The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene"

[2] "Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness"

[3] "The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C)"

[4] "But solely Pt-supported catalysts easily agglomerate into large Pt particles, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity as the result of metal sintering and coke poisoning on the active sites"

          PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, industrial-scale production of propylene, directly addressing the growing demand in the feedstock market.

2. Efficient and selective: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH enable efficient C-H bond activation while preserving C-C bonds, leading to high propylene selectivity.

3. Longer catalyst lifespan: The catalysts used in PDH have longer reactive longevity, reducing the need for frequent replacements.

4. Environmental friendliness: PDH technology is more environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods.

5. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than traditional naphtha or ethane feedstocks.

6. High-temperature process: The high-temperature activation (500-700°C) allows for efficient conversion of propane to propylene.

These advantages address challenges faced by conventional methods by offering a more direct, efficient, and selective route to propylene production, with better utilization of available feedstocks and improved environmental performance.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly related to catalyst performance. Solely Pt-supported catalysts tend to agglomerate, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity due to metal sintering and coke formation. To address these issues, researchers are developing improved catalyst designs, such as bimetallic catalysts and optimized support materials, to enhance stability, selectivity, and efficiency of the PDH process.

          PDH技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH允许有针对性的工业规模丙烯生产，直接满足原料市场不断增长的需求。

2. 高效和选择性：PDH使用的铂基催化剂能够有效活化C-H键，同时保持C-C键完整，从而实现高丙烯选择性。

3. 更长的催化剂寿命：PDH使用的催化剂具有更长的反应寿命，减少了频繁更换的需求。

4. 环境友好：与传统方法相比，PDH技术更加环保。

5. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用丙烷作为原料，比传统的石脑油或乙烷原料更容易获得。

6. 高温工艺：高温活化（500-700°C）允许丙烷高效转化为丙烯。

这些优势解决了传统方法面临的挑战，提供了一种更直接、更高效、更选择性的丙烯生产路线，能更好地利用可用原料并改善环境表现。

然而，PDH技术也面临着挑战，特别是与催化剂性能相关的问题。单独的铂负载催化剂容易团聚，导致活性快速损失和丙烯选择性低，这是由于金属烧结和积碳形成。为了解决这些问题，研究人员正在开发改进的催化剂设计，如双金属催化剂和优化的载体材料，以提高PDH过程的稳定性、选择性和效率。
