<quotes>

[1] "The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene"

[2] "Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness"

[3] "The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C)"

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for industrial-scale propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. It directly addresses the increasing demand for propylene in the feedstock market.

2. PDH utilizes Pt catalysts, which offer efficient C-H bond activation, longer catalyst lifespan, and environmental friendliness compared to conventional methods.

3. The process is highly selective, focusing on C-H bond activation rather than C-C bond cleavage, leading to improved product selectivity.

4. PDH allows for on-purpose propylene production, providing more control over output compared to traditional methods that produce propylene as a byproduct.

5. It can utilize propane as a feedstock, which is more readily available than the feedstocks used in conventional propylene production methods.

While PDH technology requires significant energy input due to the thermal stability of propane, its advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity make it a promising solution to address the challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods.

PDH technology has emerged as a promising method for industrial-scale propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. It directly addresses the increasing demand for propylene in the feedstock market.

2. It utilizes Pt catalysts, which offer efficient C-H bond activation, longer catalyst life, and environmental friendliness.

3. It allows for on-purpose production of propylene, providing more control over output compared to traditional byproduct methods.

4. It can use propane as feedstock, which is more readily available than traditional naphtha or ethane feedstocks.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly related to catalyst performance. Solely Pt-supported catalysts tend to agglomerate, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity due to metal sintering and coke formation. To address these issues, researchers are developing improved catalyst designs, such as bimetallic catalysts and optimized support materials, to enhance stability, selectivity, and efficiency of the PDH process.

PDH技术之所以成为工业规模丙烯生产的最有前景方法，是因为它具有几个关键优势：

1. 它直接解决了原料市场对丙烯日益增长的需求。

2. 它使用铂催化剂，具有高效的C-H键活化、更长的催化剂寿命和环境友好性。

3. 它允许有目的地生产丙烯，与传统的副产品方法相比，对产出有更多控制。

4. 它可以使用丙烷作为原料，比传统的石脑油或乙烷原料更容易获得。

然而，PDH技术也面临着挑战，特别是与催化剂性能相关的问题。单独的铂负载催化剂容易团聚，导致活性快速损失和丙烯选择性低，这是由于金属烧结和积碳形成。为了解决这些问题，研究人员正在开发改进的催化剂设计，如双金属催化剂和优化的载体材料，以提高PDH过程的稳定性、选择性和效率。

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it a promising method for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the growing demand for propylene in the feedstock market.

2. It is an "on-purpose" production method, allowing for targeted propylene production.

3. Pt-based catalysts used in PDH provide efficient C-H bond activation, avoiding undesired C-C bond cleavage.

4. The process offers longer catalyst lifetimes compared to conventional methods.

5. PDH is more environmentally friendly than traditional propylene production methods.

These advantages allow PDH to overcome challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity. The ability to use propane as a feedstock provides an alternative to traditional naphtha cracking, addressing feedstock availability issues. The selective C-H bond activation improves propylene selectivity compared to less selective cracking processes. Additionally, the longer catalyst lifetimes and environmental benefits contribute to improved overall process efficiency and sustainability.
