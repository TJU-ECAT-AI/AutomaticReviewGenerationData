[1] "The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene"

[2] "Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness"

[3] "The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C)"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH allows for targeted, industrial-scale production of propylene, addressing the growing demand directly.

2. Efficient and selective: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH enable efficient C-H bond activation while preserving C-C bonds, leading to high propylene selectivity.

3. Longer catalyst lifespan: The catalysts used in PDH have longer reactive longevity, reducing the need for frequent replacements.

4. Environmental friendliness: PDH technology is more environmentally friendly compared to conventional methods.

5. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize propane as feedstock, which is increasingly available due to the shale gas boom.

6. High-temperature process: The high-temperature activation (500-700°C) allows for efficient conversion of propane to propylene.

These advantages address challenges faced by conventional methods by offering a more direct, efficient, and selective route to propylene production, with better utilization of available feedstocks and improved environmental performance.
