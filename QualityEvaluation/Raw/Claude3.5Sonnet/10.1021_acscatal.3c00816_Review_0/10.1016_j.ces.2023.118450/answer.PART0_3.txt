[1] "The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene"

[2] "Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient CH bond activation rather than CC bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness"

[3] "The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol1, 500700 C)"

PDH technology offers several key advantages that make it promising for propylene production:

1. It directly addresses the heavy demand for propylene in the feedstock market.

2. It uses propane as feedstock, which is more readily available compared to conventional methods.

3. Pt-based catalysts used in PDH provide efficient C-H bond activation, longer catalyst lifespan, and environmental friendliness.

4. It allows for on-purpose, industrial-scale production of propylene.

5. It offers improved process efficiency and product selectivity compared to traditional methods.

However, PDH also faces challenges, particularly the high energy requirements for propane activation and the need for catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction conditions. Ongoing research focuses on developing more stable and efficient catalysts to further improve the PDH process.

PDH技术为丙烯生产提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的方法：

1. 它直接解决了原料市场对丙烯的巨大需求。

2. 它使用丙烷作为原料，相比传统方法更容易获得。

3. PDH中使用的铂基催化剂提供了高效的C-H键活化、更长的催化剂寿命和环境友好性。

4. 它允许有目的性的、工业规模的丙烯生产。

5. 与传统方法相比，它提供了更高的工艺效率和产品选择性。

然而，PDH也面临挑战，特别是丙烷活化所需的高能量要求，以及需要能够承受苛刻反应条件的催化剂。目前的研究正致力于开发更稳定、更高效的催化剂，以进一步改进PDH工艺。
