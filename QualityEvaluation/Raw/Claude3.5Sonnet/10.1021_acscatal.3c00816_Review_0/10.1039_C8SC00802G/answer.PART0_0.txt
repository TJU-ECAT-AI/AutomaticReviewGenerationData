[1] "Due to the scarceness of fossil fuels and the discovery of shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is becoming a more promising way to meet the increasing demand of propylene."

[2] "Propylene is one of the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry, which is employed in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc."

[3] "Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are currently used in commercial PDH processes and deliver comparably high initial yields and stability."

[4] "Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are more environmentally friendly. However, pure Pt suffers from coke formation as well as low selectivity towards propylene."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity by utilizing propane, which is abundant due to the discovery of shale gas. This makes PDH less dependent on traditional fossil fuel sources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which can potentially offer higher efficiency compared to more complex, multi-step conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: While pure platinum catalysts suffer from low selectivity, the development of bimetallic catalysts (such as PtIn or PtSn) has significantly improved selectivity towards propylene and reduced coke formation.

4. Environmental friendliness: Platinum-based catalysts used in PDH are more environmentally friendly compared to chromium-based alternatives.

5. High yields and stability: Commercial PDH processes using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts deliver high initial yields and stability.

6. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology is well-positioned to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, which is crucial for various industrial applications including the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile.

These advantages make PDH technology a versatile and sustainable solution to address the challenges faced by conventional propylene production methods, particularly in terms of feedstock flexibility, process efficiency, and product selectivity.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接解决了原料稀缺的挑战，利用了由于页岩气的发现而变得丰富的丙烷。这使得PDH对传统化石燃料来源的依赖性降低。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是从丙烷到丙烯的直接转化过程，与更复杂的多步骤传统方法相比，可能提供更高的效率。

3. 产品选择性：虽然纯铂催化剂存在选择性低的问题，但双金属催化剂（如PtIn或PtSn）的开发显著提高了对丙烯的选择性，并减少了积碳形成。

4. 环境友好性：PDH中使用的铂基催化剂比铬基替代品更加环保。

5. 高产量和稳定性：使用铂和铬基催化剂的商业PDH工艺提供了高初始产量和稳定性。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术能够很好地满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求，这对于包括聚丙烯、环氧丙烷和丙烯腈在内的各种工业应用至关重要。

这些优势使PDH技术成为一种versatile和可持续的解决方案，能够解决传统丙烯生产方法面临的挑战，特别是在原料灵活性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面。
