Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity by utilizing propane, which is abundant due to the discovery of shale gas. This makes PDH less dependent on traditional fossil fuel sources.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process from propane to propylene, which can potentially offer higher efficiency compared to more complex, multi-step conventional methods.

3. Product selectivity: While pure platinum catalysts suffer from low selectivity, the development of bimetallic catalysts (such as PtIn or PtSn) has significantly improved selectivity towards propylene and reduced coke formation.

4. Environmental friendliness: Platinum-based catalysts used in PDH are more environmentally friendly compared to chromium-based alternatives.

5. High yields and stability: Commercial PDH processes using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts deliver high initial yields and stability.
