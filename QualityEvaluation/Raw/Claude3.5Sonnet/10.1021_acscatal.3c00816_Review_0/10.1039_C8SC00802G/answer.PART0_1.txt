Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has become the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH addresses the challenge of fossil fuel scarcity by utilizing propane, which is increasingly available due to the discovery of shale gas. This provides a more sustainable feedstock source compared to conventional methods.

2. Meeting growing demand: As propylene is a crucial compound in the chemical industry, used in the production of various products, PDH offers a direct and efficient way to meet the increasing global demand for propylene.

3. Process efficiency: PDH processes using Pt- and Cr-based catalysts deliver high initial yields and stability, indicating good process efficiency.

4. Environmental considerations: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH are more environmentally friendly compared to Cr-based catalysts, addressing growing concerns about the environmental impact of chemical processes.

5. Selectivity improvement potential: While pure Pt catalysts suffer from low selectivity towards propylene, research is ongoing to improve selectivity through alloying with other elements, suggesting room for further optimization of the PDH process.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology offers a more efficient, sustainable, and potentially more selective method for propylene production compared to conventional production methods.
