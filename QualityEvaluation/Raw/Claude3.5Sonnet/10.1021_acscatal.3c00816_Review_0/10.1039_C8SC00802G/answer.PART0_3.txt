Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH addresses the challenge of fossil fuel scarcity by utilizing propane, which is abundant due to the discovery of shale gas. This ensures a stable and potentially cost-effective feedstock supply.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct conversion process, which can be more efficient than conventional multi-step methods. The use of Pt- and Cr-based catalysts in commercial PDH processes delivers high initial yields and stability, contributing to overall process efficiency.

3. Product selectivity: While pure Pt catalysts suffer from low selectivity, research has shown that alloying Pt with other elements (such as In or Sn) can significantly improve propylene selectivity. This addresses the challenge of achieving high product selectivity in propylene production.

4. Environmental considerations: Pt-based catalysts used in PDH are more environmentally friendly compared to Cr-based catalysts, aligning with increasing environmental regulations and sustainability goals in the chemical industry.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH technology is well-positioned to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, which is crucial for producing various important chemical products like polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile.

6. Adaptability to changing feedstock landscape: As the availability of traditional feedstocks for propylene production (like naphtha from oil refining) becomes more uncertain, PDH offers a flexible alternative that can utilize the growing supply of propane from shale gas production.

By addressing these challenges in feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, PDH technology presents a promising solution for sustainable and efficient propylene production in the face of evolving market demands and resource availability.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH通过利用丙烷解决了化石燃料稀缺的挑战，而丙烷由于页岩气的发现而变得丰富。这确保了稳定且可能具有成本效益的原料供应。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是一种直接转化工艺，可能比传统的多步骤方法更加高效。在商业PDH工艺中使用铂和铬基催化剂可以提供高初始产率和稳定性，从而提高整体工艺效率。

3. 产品选择性：虽然纯铂催化剂选择性较低，但研究表明，将铂与其他元素（如铟或锡）合金可以显著提高丙烯选择性。这解决了在丙烯生产中实现高产品选择性的挑战。

4. 环境考虑：PDH中使用的铂基催化剂比铬基催化剂更环保，符合化学工业日益严格的环境法规和可持续发展目标。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH技术能够满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，这对于生产聚丙烯、环氧丙烷和丙烯腈等各种重要化学产品至关重要。

6. 适应不断变化的原料格局：随着传统丙烯生产原料（如石油炼制的石脑油）的可用性变得更加不确定，PDH提供了一种灵活的替代方案，可以利用页岩气生产带来的不断增长的丙烷供应。

通过解决这些原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面的挑战，PDH技术为面对不断变化的市场需求和资源可用性提供了一种可持续和高效的丙烯生产解决方案。
