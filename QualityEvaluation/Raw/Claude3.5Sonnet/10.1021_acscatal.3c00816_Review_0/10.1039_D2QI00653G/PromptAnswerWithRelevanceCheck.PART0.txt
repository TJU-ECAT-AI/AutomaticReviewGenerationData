<quotes>

[1] "PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."

[2] "With the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[3] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[4] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

[5] "The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Specificity: PDH is an on-purpose process that produces only propylene, unlike conventional methods that yield a mix of hydrocarbon products.

2. Feedstock availability and cost: The abundance of propane in shale gas, made accessible through fracking technology, has significantly reduced the cost of PDH feedstock.

3. Flexibility: PDH factories are highly adaptable and can be modified to run various reactions, increasing their versatility and economic potential.

4. Profitability: The price difference between propylene and propane, coupled with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable.

5. Addressing conventional method limitations: PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by traditional production methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, which are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, emit large amounts of CO2, and have relatively low propylene selectivity.

6. Meeting increasing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet the growing demand for propylene, PDH offers a more efficient and selective production process.

These advantages position PDH as a superior technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it particularly well-suited to address the challenges of increasing global propylene demand.
