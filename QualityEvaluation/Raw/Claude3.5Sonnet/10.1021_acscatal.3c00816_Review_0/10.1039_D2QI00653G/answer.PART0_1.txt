[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent."

[2] "Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."

[3] "With the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[4] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[5] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, rather than generating a mixture of hydrocarbon products. This results in higher product selectivity compared to conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of fracking technology has led to an abundance of shale gas, which contains large amounts of propane. This has made PDH feedstocks extremely cheap and readily available.

3. Process efficiency: PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run various reactions, providing flexibility in production.

4. Economic viability: The price difference between propylene and propane, combined with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable.

5. Addressing challenges: PDH technology addresses the limitations of conventional production methods by offering higher propylene selectivity, utilizing abundant and cheap feedstock, and providing a more efficient and flexible production process.

These advantages position PDH as a superior alternative to traditional propylene production methods, especially in light of the increasing global demand for propylene and its wide range of applications in various industries.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 定向生产：PDH专门设计用于生产丙烯，而不是生成混合烃类产品。与传统方法相比，这种方法的产品选择性更高。

2. 原料可用性：页岩气开采技术的发展导致了页岩气的大量供应，而页岩气中含有大量丙烷。这使得PDH的原料变得极其便宜且容易获得。

3. 工艺效率：PDH工厂具有高度的可调性，可以适应运行多种不同的反应，提供了生产的灵活性。

4. 经济可行性：丙烯和丙烷之间的价格差异，加上不断增长的丙烯市场，使PDH变得非常有利可图。

5. 解决挑战：PDH技术通过提供更高的丙烯选择性、利用丰富且廉价的原料，以及提供更高效和灵活的生产过程，解决了传统生产方法的局限性。

这些优势使PDH成为传统丙烯生产方法的优越替代方案，特别是考虑到全球对丙烯的需求不断增加，以及丙烯在各种行业中的广泛应用。
