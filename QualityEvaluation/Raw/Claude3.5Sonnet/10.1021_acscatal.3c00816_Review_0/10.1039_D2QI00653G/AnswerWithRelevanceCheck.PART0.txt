          [1] "PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."

[2] "With the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[3] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[4] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

[5] "The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene."

[6] "Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production, addressing the challenges faced by conventional production methods:

1. Selective production: PDH is an on-purpose process that produces only propylene, resulting in higher product selectivity compared to conventional methods that yield mixed hydrocarbon products.

2. Feedstock availability and cost: The development of fracking technology has led to abundant shale gas production, which contains large amounts of propane. This has made PDH feedstocks extremely inexpensive and readily available.

3. Process efficiency and flexibility: PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run various reactions, providing operational versatility and improved efficiency.

4. Economic viability: The price difference between propylene and propane, combined with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable.

5. Environmental benefits: Unlike conventional methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, which rely heavily on fossil fuels and emit large amounts of CO2, PDH offers a more environmentally friendly alternative.

6. Meeting increasing demand: Conventional methods have relatively low propylene selectivity and cannot meet the growing demand for propylene. PDH addresses this challenge by providing a more efficient and selective production process.

7. Product versatility: Propylene produced through PDH can be used to create a wide range of value-added products, including polymers, oxygenates, and consumer goods.

These advantages collectively address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods, making PDH a superior choice for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法，解决了传统生产方法面临的挑战：

1. 选择性生产：PDH是一个专门的过程，只生产丙烯，与产生混合碳氢化合物产品的传统方法相比，这导致了更高的产品选择性。

2. 原料可用性和成本：页岩气开采技术的发展导致了大量页岩气的生产，其中含有大量丙烷。这使得PDH的原料变得极其便宜且容易获得。

3. 工艺效率和灵活性：PDH工厂具有高度可调性，可以适应运行各种反应，提供操作上的多样性和提高效率。

4. 经济可行性：丙烯和丙烷之间的价格差异，加上不断增长的丙烯市场，使PDH极其有利可图。

5. 环境效益：与严重依赖化石燃料并排放大量二氧化碳的流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解等传统方法不同，PDH提供了一种更环保的替代方案。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：传统方法的丙烯选择性相对较低，无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。PDH通过提供更高效和选择性的生产过程解决了这一挑战。

7. 产品多样性：通过PDH生产的丙烯可用于创造广泛的增值产品，包括聚合物、含氧化合物和消费品。

这些优势共同解决了传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使PDH成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的优选方案。
