[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent."

[2] "Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."

[3] "In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[4] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[5] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Specificity: PDH is an on-purpose process that produces only propylene, avoiding the production of mixed hydrocarbon products common in conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of fracking technology has led to abundant and cheap propane from shale gas, providing a cost-effective feedstock for PDH.

3. Flexibility: PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run various reactions, offering versatility in production.

4. Economic viability: The price difference between propylene and propane, coupled with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable.

5. Product versatility: Propylene produced through PDH can be used to create a wide range of value-added products, including polymers, oxygenates, and consumer goods.

These advantages address the challenges faced by conventional production methods by providing a more efficient, selective, and economically viable process for propylene production, while also taking advantage of newly available feedstock sources.
