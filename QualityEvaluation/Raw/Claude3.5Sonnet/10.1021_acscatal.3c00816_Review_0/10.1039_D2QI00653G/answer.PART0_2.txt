[1] "PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."

[2] "With the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[3] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[4] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

[5] "The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Selective production: PDH is an on-purpose process that produces only propylene, rather than a mixture of hydrocarbon products. This results in higher product selectivity compared to conventional methods.

2. Cheap feedstock: The development of fracking technology has led to abundant shale gas production, which contains large amounts of propane. This has made PDH feedstocks extremely inexpensive.

3. Flexibility: PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run various reactions, providing operational versatility.

4. Profitability: The price difference between propylene and propane, combined with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable.

5. Environmental benefits: Unlike conventional methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, which rely heavily on fossil fuels and emit large amounts of CO2, PDH offers a more environmentally friendly alternative.

6. Meeting demand: Conventional methods have relatively low propylene selectivity and cannot meet the increasing demand for propylene. PDH addresses this challenge by providing a more efficient and selective production process.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it a promising solution for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 选择性生产：PDH是一个专门的过程，只生产丙烯，而不是混合碳氢化合物产品。与传统方法相比，这导致了更高的产品选择性。

2. 廉价原料：页岩气开采技术的发展导致了大量页岩气的生产，其中含有大量丙烷。这使得PDH的原料变得极其便宜。

3. 灵活性：PDH工厂具有高度可调性，可以适应运行各种反应，提供操作上的多样性。

4. 盈利能力：丙烯和丙烷之间的价格差异，加上不断增长的丙烯市场，使PDH极其有利可图。

5. 环境效益：与严重依赖化石燃料并排放大量二氧化碳的流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解等传统方法不同，PDH提供了一种更环保的替代方案。

6. 满足需求：传统方法的丙烯选择性相对较低，无法满足日益增长的丙烯需求。PDH通过提供更高效和选择性的生产过程解决了这一挑战。

这些优势使PDH能够解决传统生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战，使其成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的有前途的解决方案。
