[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic chemicals that can be processed into various types of value-added products, such as polymers (e.g., polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and polyesters), oxygenates (e.g., acetone and acetaldehyde), daily care products, and washing detergent."

[2] "Particularly, PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."

[3] "In addition, with the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[4] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[5] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed to produce propylene, avoiding the formation of hybrid hydrocarbon products typical in conventional methods.

2. Feedstock availability: The development of fracking technology has led to abundant and cheap propane from shale gas, providing a cost-effective feedstock for PDH.

3. Process efficiency: PDH factories are highly flexible and can be adapted to run various reactions, improving overall operational efficiency.

4. Economic viability: The price difference between propylene and propane, coupled with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable.

5. Product selectivity: By focusing solely on propylene production, PDH addresses the challenge of low propylene selectivity faced by conventional methods like fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking.

These advantages collectively address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods, making PDH a superior choice for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.
