[1] "PDH technology is recognized to be one of the most promising methods for the production of propylene because it is an on-purpose process to produce only propylene instead of hybrid hydrocarbon products."

[2] "With the advent of fracking technology to produce shale gas, which contains a large amount of propane, the feedstocks for PDH have become extremely cheap."

[3] "Moreover, PDH factories are highly adjustable and can be adapted to run many other different reactions."

[4] "The differences between the price of propylene and propane and the growing propylene market make PDH extraordinarily profitable."

[5] "The conventional propylene production processes include fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, both these methods depend heavily on fossil fuels and emit a large amount of CO2. Besides, these methods still have relatively low propylene selectivity, which no longer meets the increasing demand for propylene."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Specificity: PDH is an on-purpose process that produces only propylene, unlike conventional methods that yield a mix of hydrocarbon products.

2. Feedstock availability and cost: The abundance of propane in shale gas, made accessible through fracking technology, has significantly reduced the cost of PDH feedstock.

3. Flexibility: PDH factories are highly adaptable and can be modified to run various reactions, increasing their versatility and economic potential.

4. Profitability: The price difference between propylene and propane, coupled with the growing propylene market, makes PDH extraordinarily profitable.

5. Addressing conventional method limitations: PDH technology addresses the challenges faced by traditional production methods such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, which are heavily dependent on fossil fuels, emit large amounts of CO2, and have relatively low propylene selectivity.

6. Meeting increasing demand: As conventional methods struggle to meet the growing demand for propylene, PDH offers a more efficient and selective production process.

These advantages position PDH as a superior technology in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity, making it particularly well-suited to address the challenges of increasing global propylene demand.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 特异性：PDH是一种专门的工艺，只生产丙烯，不同于传统方法产生混合烃类产品。

2. 原料可用性和成本：页岩气中丙烷的丰富性，通过压裂技术变得可获得，显著降低了PDH原料成本。

3. 灵活性：PDH工厂具有高度适应性，可以修改运行各种反应，增加了其多样性和经济潜力。

4. 盈利能力：丙烯和丙烷之间的价格差异，加上不断增长的丙烯市场，使PDH极其有利可图。

5. 解决传统方法的局限性：PDH技术解决了传统生产方法如流化催化裂化和蒸汽裂解所面临的挑战，这些方法严重依赖化石燃料，排放大量二氧化碳，且丙烯选择性相对较低。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法难以满足不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH提供了一个更高效和选择性的生产过程。

这些优势使PDH在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面成为一种优越的技术，特别适合解决全球丙烯需求不断增长的挑战。
