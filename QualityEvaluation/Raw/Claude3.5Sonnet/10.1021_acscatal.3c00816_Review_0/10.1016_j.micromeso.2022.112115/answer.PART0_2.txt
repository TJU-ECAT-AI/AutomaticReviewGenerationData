[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."

[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."

[3] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare PDH technology to conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability and process efficiency. However, it does highlight some advantages of a specific PDH catalyst system:

The Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts developed for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) show high propylene selectivity (>95%) and good regeneration stability. The use of modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports enhances the performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts. This is achieved through the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid properties.

The catalyst system also demonstrates improved anti-coke stability and enhanced selectivity due to the reduced surface acidity of Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios. This facilitates C3H6 (propylene) desorption.

While these properties suggest advantages in terms of product selectivity and catalyst stability, the literature does not provide direct comparisons to conventional production methods or discuss broader issues of feedstock availability and overall process efficiency.

文献并未直接讨论全球对丙烯的需求，也没有在原料可用性和工艺效率方面将PDH技术与传统生产方法进行比较。但是，它确实强调了一种特定PDH催化剂系统的一些优势：

为丙烷脱氢(PDH)开发的Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂表现出高丙烯选择性(>95%)和良好的再生稳定性。使用改性的Ti-ZSM-5分子筛作为载体可以提高非贵金属Co基催化剂的性能。这是通过Ti物种调节的活性Co物种状态和表面酸性实现的。

由于高Si/Ti比的Ti-ZSM-5分子筛表面酸性降低，该催化剂系统还表现出改善的抗积碳稳定性和增强的选择性。这有利于C3H6（丙烯）的脱附。

虽然这些特性表明在产品选择性和催化剂稳定性方面具有优势，但文献并未直接与传统生产方法进行比较，也未讨论更广泛的原料可用性和整体工艺效率问题。
