[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."

[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."

[3] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare PDH technology to conventional production methods. However, it does highlight some advantages of a specific PDH catalyst system:

The Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts described show high propylene selectivity (>95%) and good regeneration stability. The modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolite supports enhance PDH performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts. The catalysts also demonstrate reduced surface acidity, which facilitates propylene desorption and improves selectivity and anti-coke stability.

While these properties suggest potential benefits in terms of process efficiency and product selectivity, the literature does not provide information on feedstock availability or directly compare this method to conventional propylene production techniques.

该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将PDH技术与传统生产方法进行比较。但是，它确实突出了一种特定PDH催化剂系统的一些优点：

所描述的Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂显示出高丙烯选择性（>95%）和良好的再生稳定性。改性的Ti-ZSM-5分子筛载体增强了非贵金属钴基催化剂的PDH性能。这些催化剂还表现出降低的表面酸性，有利于丙烯脱附，提高了选择性和抗积炭稳定性。

虽然这些特性暗示了在工艺效率和产品选择性方面的潜在优势，但该文献并未提供有关原料供应的信息，也未直接将此方法与传统丙烯生产技术进行比较。
