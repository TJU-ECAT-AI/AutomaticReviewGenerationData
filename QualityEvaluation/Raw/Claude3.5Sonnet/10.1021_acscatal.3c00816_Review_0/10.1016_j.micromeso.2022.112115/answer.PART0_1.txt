[1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."

[2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."

[3] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

The literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare PDH technology to conventional production methods. However, based on the information provided, some advantages of the described PDH technology using Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts can be inferred:

1. High selectivity: The catalysts exhibit over 95% C3H6 (propylene) selectivity, indicating efficient conversion of propane to the desired product.

2. Stability and regeneration: The catalysts show good regeneration stability in recycling PDH reactions, suggesting longer catalyst life and potentially more efficient operations.

3. Enhanced performance: The use of modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports improves the PDH performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts.

4. Improved anti-coke stability: The reduced surface acidity of Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites facilitates C3H6 desorption, enhancing selectivity and resistance to coke formation.

5. Use of non-noble metals: The catalysts are based on cobalt, which is likely more cost-effective than noble metal catalysts.

While these advantages are notable, the document does not provide information on feedstock availability or direct comparisons to conventional production methods.

该文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将PDH技术与传统生产方法进行比较。然而，根据所提供的信息，可以推断出使用Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH技术具有以下优势：

1. 高选择性：催化剂表现出超过95%的C3H6（丙烯）选择性，表明丙烷到目标产物的转化效率高。

2. 稳定性和再生能力：催化剂在循环PDH反应中表现出良好的再生稳定性，这意味着催化剂寿命更长，可能具有更高的操作效率。

3. 性能增强：使用改性的Ti-ZSM-5分子筛作为载体，提高了非贵金属Co基催化剂的PDH性能。

4. 改善抗积碳稳定性：Ti-ZSM-5分子筛表面酸性降低，促进了C3H6的脱附，提高了选择性和抗积碳稳定性。

5. 使用非贵金属：催化剂基于钴，可能比贵金属催化剂更具成本效益。

虽然这些优势很显著，但该文档并未提供关于原料可用性或与传统生产方法的直接比较的信息。
