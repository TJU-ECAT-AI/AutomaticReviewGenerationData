I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Highlights
•
TiZSM5 zeolitesupported Co nanoparticle catalyst selectively catalyze propane dehydrogenation.
•
Ti/Si ratios determine the location and chemical state of the Ti species in the TiZSM5 supports.
•
Ti/Si ratios tune the dispersion and chemical state of Co species and surface acid property.
•
Suppressing C3H8 CC cracking and facilitating C3H6 desorption lead to high selectivity and anticoke stability.
Abstract
With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property. The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions. The characterization results illustrate the structural evolution of Ti from the framework and extra-framework Ti species to the small-size anatase TiO2 species with decreasing the Si/Ti ratio of the Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites, tailoring the dispersion and chemical state of the Co sites at different Co-zeolite or Co-TiO2 interfaces. The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


In light of the growing global demand for propylene, what are the key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology that make it the most promising method for propylene production, and how does it specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
