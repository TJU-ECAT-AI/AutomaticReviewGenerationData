          [1] "With the modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) performance of the non-noble metal Co-based catalysts can be enhanced, which is benefited from the Ti species-tuned state of active Co species and surface acid property."

          [2] "The developed Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit >95% C3H6 selectivity and good regeneration stability in the recycling PDH reactions."

          [3] "The Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios also show significantly reduced surface acidity especially the Brnsted acidity in comparison with the Al-ZSM-5 zeolite, thus facilitating the C3H6 desorption for enhancing the selectivity and anti-coke stability."

          While the literature does not directly address the global demand for propylene or compare PDH technology to conventional production methods, it highlights some key advantages of the Co/Ti-ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH):

          1. High selectivity: The catalysts exhibit over 95% propylene (C3H6) selectivity, addressing the challenge of product selectivity.
          2. Regeneration stability: Good regeneration stability in recycling PDH reactions, potentially improving process efficiency.
          3. Enhanced performance: Modified Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites as supports enhance the PDH performance of non-noble metal Co-based catalysts.
          4. Reduced surface acidity: Ti-ZSM-5 zeolites with high Si/Ti ratios show significantly reduced surface acidity, especially Brønsted acidity, facilitating propylene desorption and enhancing selectivity and anti-coke stability.
          5. Use of non-noble metals: The catalysts are based on cobalt, which is likely more cost-effective than noble metal catalysts.

          These advantages suggest that the described catalysts could potentially improve the efficiency and selectivity of propylene production through PDH. However, the literature does not provide information on feedstock availability or directly compare this method to conventional production methods in terms of overall process efficiency or addressing global demand challenges.

          虽然文献并未直接讨论全球丙烯需求或将PDH技术与传统生产方法进行比较，但它突出了Co/Ti-ZSM-5催化剂用于丙烷脱氢（PDH）的一些主要优势：

          1. 高选择性：催化剂表现出超过95%的丙烯（C3H6）选择性，解决了产品选择性的挑战。
          2. 再生稳定性：在循环PDH反应中表现出良好的再生稳定性，可能提高了过程效率。
          3. 性能增强：使用改性的Ti-ZSM-5沸石作为载体，提高了非贵金属Co基催化剂的PDH性能。
          4. 降低表面酸度：具有高Si/Ti比的Ti-ZSM-5沸石显示出显著降低的表面酸度，特别是Brønsted酸度，这有助于丙烯脱附并提高选择性和抗积碳稳定性。
          5. 使用非贵金属：催化剂基于钴，可能比贵金属催化剂更具成本效益。

          这些优势表明，所描述的催化剂可能通过PDH提高丙烯生产的效率和选择性。然而，文献并未提供关于原料可用性的信息，也没有直接将此方法与传统生产方法进行比较，特别是在整体工艺效率或解决全球需求挑战方面。
