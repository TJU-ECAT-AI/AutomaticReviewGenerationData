[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."

[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundantly available, especially with the growth of shale gas production. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by traditional methods that rely on petroleum.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). It allows for better control of the reaction and potentially higher yields.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods. With proper catalyst design and reaction conditions, PDH can minimize unwanted side reactions and maximize propylene yield.

4. Economic advantage: The significant price gap between propane (feedstock) and propylene (product) makes PDH economically attractive, potentially offering better profit margins.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

6. Meeting growing demand: As traditional methods struggle to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, PDH offers a scalable solution to bridge the supply gap.

7. Reduced dependence on petroleum: By using propane instead of naphtha or other petroleum-derived feedstocks, PDH helps diversify the propylene production sources and reduces reliance on crude oil.

These advantages collectively make PDH technology a promising solution to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷，这种原料丰富可得，特别是随着页岩气生产的增长。这解决了传统方法依赖石油面临的原料稀缺问题。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂解（FCC）相比，PDH是生产丙烯的更直接和高效的路线。它允许更好地控制反应，并可能获得更高的产率。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性。通过适当的催化剂设计和反应条件，PDH可以最大限度地减少不需要的副反应，最大化丙烯产率。

4. 经济优势：丙烷（原料）和丙烯（产品）之间的巨大价格差距使PDH在经济上具有吸引力，可能提供更好的利润率。

5. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在更靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，减少运输成本并提高供应链效率。

6. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法难以满足日益增长的全球丙烯需求，PDH提供了一种可扩展的解决方案来弥补供应缺口。

7. 减少对石油的依赖：通过使用丙烷而不是石脑油或其他石油衍生的原料，PDH有助于多样化丙烯生产来源，减少对原油的依赖。

这些优势共同使PDH技术成为一个有前景的解决方案，可以解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
