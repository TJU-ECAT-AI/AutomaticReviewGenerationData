[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."

[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundantly available compared to the depleting petroleum resources used in traditional production methods.

2. Economic efficiency: There is a significant price gap between propane and propylene, making PDH an economically attractive option.

3. Targeted production: PDH is a direct and selective process for producing propylene, unlike steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking which produce a mixture of products.

4. Meeting demand: Traditional methods are unable to meet the growing market demand for propylene, while PDH offers a solution to bridge this supply gap.

5. Process efficiency: As a direct conversion process, PDH potentially offers higher efficiency compared to the multi-step processes involved in traditional methods.

6. Feedstock flexibility: PDH allows for the use of diverse propane sources, including those from natural gas processing and oil refining.

By addressing these challenges, PDH technology presents a more sustainable and efficient approach to propylene production, capable of meeting the increasing global demand for this vital petrochemical building block.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比用于传统生产方法的正在枯竭的石油资源，丙烷更加丰富。

2. 经济效益：丙烷和丙烯之间存在显著的价格差距，使PDH成为一个经济上具有吸引力的选择。

3. 定向生产：PDH是一个直接和选择性的丙烯生产过程，不像蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解那样产生混合产品。

4. 满足需求：传统方法无法满足不断增长的丙烯市场需求，而PDH提供了一个弥补这一供应缺口的解决方案。

5. 工艺效率：作为一个直接转化过程，PDH潜在地提供了比传统方法涉及的多步骤过程更高的效率。

6. 原料灵活性：PDH允许使用多样化的丙烷来源，包括来自天然气处理和石油精炼的丙烷。

通过解决这些挑战，PDH技术提供了一种更可持续和高效的丙烯生产方法，能够满足这种重要石化基础原料不断增长的全球需求。
