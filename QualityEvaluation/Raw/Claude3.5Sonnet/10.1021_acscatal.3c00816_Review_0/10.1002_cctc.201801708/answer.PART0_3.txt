[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."

[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as feedstock, which is abundantly available due to the shale gas revolution. This addresses the challenge of feedstock scarcity faced by traditional methods that rely on petroleum.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene, making it more efficient compared to complex multi-step processes like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high propylene selectivity, allowing for more targeted production of propylene compared to traditional methods that produce a mix of products.

4. Economic viability: The significant price gap between propane (feedstock) and propylene (product) makes PDH economically attractive.

5. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propylene consumers, reducing transportation costs and improving supply chain efficiency.

6. Sustainability: PDH can potentially be more environmentally friendly than petroleum-based processes, especially when coupled with renewable energy sources.

These advantages allow PDH to address the growing global demand for propylene more effectively than conventional production methods, which are limited by petroleum depletion and cannot produce sufficient quantities to meet market demand.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，由于页岩气革命，丙烷供应充足。这解决了传统方法依赖石油面临的原料稀缺挑战。

2. 工艺效率：PDH是将丙烷转化为丙烯的直接单步工艺，与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化(FCC)等复杂的多步工艺相比，效率更高。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现高丙烯选择性，与传统方法相比，可以更有针对性地生产丙烯，而不是生产混合产品。

4. 经济可行性：丙烷（原料）和丙烯（产品）之间的显著价格差距使PDH在经济上具有吸引力。

5. 灵活性：PDH装置可以建在更靠近丙烯消费者的地方，减少运输成本，提高供应链效率。

6. 可持续性：特别是当与可再生能源源结合时，PDH可能比基于石油的工艺更环保。

这些优势使PDH能够比传统生产方法更有效地满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求，而传统方法受到石油枯竭的限制，无法生产足够数量以满足市场需求。
