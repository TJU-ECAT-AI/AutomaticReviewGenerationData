[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."

[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundantly available compared to the depleting petroleum resources used in traditional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods, which often produce a mixture of products.

4. Economic benefits: There is a significant price gap between propane (feedstock) and propylene (product), making PDH economically attractive.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH can help address the increasing global demand for propylene, which traditional methods are struggling to meet due to petroleum depletion.

6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages.

These advantages allow PDH to specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability (by using abundant propane instead of depleting petroleum), process efficiency (through a more direct conversion process), and product selectivity (by focusing on propylene production rather than a mix of products).

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH使用丙烷作为原料，相比于传统生产方法所使用的日益枯竭的石油资源，丙烷更加丰富。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化（FCC）相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。

3. 产品选择性：PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性，而传统方法通常会产生混合产品。

4. 经济效益：丙烷（原料）和丙烯（产品）之间存在显著的价格差距，使PDH在经济上具有吸引力。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：PDH可以帮助满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，而传统方法由于石油枯竭而难以满足这一需求。

6. 灵活性：PDH工厂可以建在靠近丙烷来源或丙烯消费者的地方，提供物流优势。

这些优势使PDH能够特别解决传统生产方法在原料可用性（通过使用丰富的丙烷而不是枯竭的石油）、工艺效率（通过更直接的转化过程）和产品选择性（通过专注于丙烯生产而不是混合产品）方面面临的挑战。
