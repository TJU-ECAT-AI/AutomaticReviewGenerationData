[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."

[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane, which is abundantly available compared to petroleum-based feedstocks used in traditional methods. This addresses the challenge of feedstock depletion faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). It allows for better control of the reaction and potentially higher yields.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods, which often produce a mix of olefins and other byproducts. This results in a more focused production of the desired propylene.

4. Economic advantage: The price gap between propane (feedstock) and propylene (product) makes PDH economically attractive, potentially offering better profit margins.

5. Meeting growing demand: As traditional methods struggle to meet the increasing global demand for propylene, PDH technology provides a scalable solution to bridge the supply gap.

6. Reduced dependence on petroleum: By using propane as a feedstock, PDH reduces reliance on petroleum, addressing concerns about the depletion of oil resources.

These advantages collectively make PDH a promising technology to address the challenges of feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional propylene production methods.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术提供了几个关键优势，使其成为最有前途的丙烯生产方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用丙烷作为原料，与传统方法使用的石油基原料相比，丙烷更加丰富。这解决了传统生产方法面临的原料枯竭挑战。

2. 工艺效率：与蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解（FCC）相比，PDH是一种更直接、更高效的丙烯生产路线。它允许更好地控制反应并可能获得更高的产率。

3. 产品选择性：与传统方法相比，PDH可以实现更高的丙烯选择性，传统方法通常会产生混合的烯烃和其他副产品。这导致更集中地生产所需的丙烯。

4. 经济优势：丙烷（原料）和丙烯（产品）之间的价格差使PDH在经济上具有吸引力，可能提供更好的利润空间。

5. 满足不断增长的需求：随着传统方法难以满足全球不断增长的丙烯需求，PDH技术提供了一种可扩展的解决方案来弥补供应缺口。

6. 减少对石油的依赖：通过使用丙烷作为原料，PDH减少了对石油的依赖，解决了人们对石油资源枯竭的担忧。

这些优势共同使PDH成为一种有前途的技术，可以解决传统丙烯生产方法在原料可用性、工艺效率和产品选择性方面面临的挑战。
