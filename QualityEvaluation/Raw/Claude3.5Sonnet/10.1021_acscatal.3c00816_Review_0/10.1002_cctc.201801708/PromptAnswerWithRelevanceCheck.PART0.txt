<quotes>

[1] "Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on."

[2] "The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum."

[3] "Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundantly available compared to the depleting petroleum resources used in traditional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a more direct and efficient route to produce propylene compared to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC).

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve higher propylene selectivity compared to traditional methods, which often produce a mixture of products.

4. Economic benefits: There is a significant price gap between propane (feedstock) and propylene (product), making PDH economically attractive.

5. Meeting growing demand: PDH can help address the increasing global demand for propylene, which traditional methods are struggling to meet due to petroleum depletion.

6. Flexibility: PDH plants can be built closer to propane sources or propylene consumers, offering logistical advantages.

These advantages allow PDH to specifically address the challenges faced by conventional production methods in terms of feedstock availability (by using abundant propane instead of depleting petroleum), process efficiency (through a more direct conversion process), and product selectivity (by focusing on propylene production rather than a mix of products).
