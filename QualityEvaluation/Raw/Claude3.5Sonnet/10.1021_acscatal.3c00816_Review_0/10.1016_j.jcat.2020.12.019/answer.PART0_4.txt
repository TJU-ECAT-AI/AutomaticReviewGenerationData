[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."

[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas"

[4] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant propane from shale gas as feedstock, addressing the challenge of raw material supply.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, one-step process to convert propane to propylene, which is more efficient compared to conventional multi-step methods.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity to propylene, maximizing the desired product yield.

4. Valuable by-product: The process produces hydrogen as a valuable by-product, improving overall economics.

5. Flexibility: PDH helps bridge the growing gap between propylene supply and demand by providing an on-purpose propylene production method.

6. Environmental considerations: There is a focus on developing eco-friendly catalysts for PDH, potentially reducing the environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

These advantages allow PDH to address the challenges of feedstock limitations, process complexity, and product yield faced by conventional propylene production methods, making it a promising technology to meet the increasing global demand for propylene.
