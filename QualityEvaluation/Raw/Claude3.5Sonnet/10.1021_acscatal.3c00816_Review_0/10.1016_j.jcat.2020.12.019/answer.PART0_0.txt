[1] "The gap between supply and demand of propylene has become more and more evident, because of a large consumption of the downstream products derived from propylene."

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) constitutes an important alternative for the production of propylene, and thus considerable attention has been paid to the development of eco-friendly and cost-efficient catalysts for this process."

[3] "Among these technologies, propane dehydrogenation attracts much attention in the current industrial context, because the cheap propane is widely available from abundant shale gas"

[4] "Furthermore, high selectivity to propylene can be achieved with the valuable H2 as the by-product in the propane dehydrogenation process."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology offers several key advantages that make it the most promising method for propylene production:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes cheap and abundant propane, which is readily available from shale gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock limitations faced by conventional production methods.

2. Process efficiency: PDH is a direct, single-step process for converting propane to propylene. This simplicity leads to improved efficiency compared to more complex multi-step processes.

3. Product selectivity: PDH can achieve high selectivity to propylene, which is crucial for maximizing yield and reducing unwanted byproducts. This addresses the challenge of low selectivity in some conventional methods.

4. Valuable byproduct: The PDH process produces hydrogen as a valuable byproduct, which can be used in other industrial processes or as a clean energy source.

5. Addressing supply-demand gap: PDH technology directly addresses the growing gap between propylene supply and demand by providing an on-purpose production method specifically for propylene.

6. Environmental considerations: The development of eco-friendly catalysts for PDH addresses environmental concerns associated with some conventional production methods.

These advantages make PDH technology a promising solution to meet the increasing global demand for propylene while addressing challenges related to feedstock availability, process efficiency, and product selectivity faced by conventional production methods.
