[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,"

[3] "which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has become the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which has become increasingly available due to the emergence of shale gas and increased natural gas production. This shift from traditional naphtha feedstock to light alkanes has driven the development of on-purpose PDH technologies.

2. Process specificity: Unlike conventional methods that produce propylene as a by-product, PDH is an on-purpose technology specifically designed for propylene production, allowing for better control and optimization of the process.

3. Potential for high selectivity: While PDH faces challenges in terms of alkene selectivity, advancements in catalyst design (such as the single-site [PtZn4] catalyst described in the paper) can achieve high propylene selectivity, addressing this challenge.

4. Independence from petroleum feedstocks: By using propane from natural gas sources, PDH reduces dependence on petroleum-based feedstocks, diversifying the propylene production supply chain.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. Energy intensity: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high reaction temperatures, which impacts energy efficiency.

2. Catalyst stability: High temperatures can lead to catalyst deactivation, necessitating the development of more stable catalysts.

3. Side reactions: At high temperatures, undesired side reactions like cracking and deep dehydrogenation can occur, producing unwanted by-products and coke.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research and development in catalyst design and process optimization continue to improve PDH technology, making it an increasingly attractive option for meeting the growing global demand for propylene.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术已成为最有前景的丙烯生产方法，原因如下：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，而由于页岩气的出现和天然气产量的增加，丙烷的供应量不断增加。这种从传统的石脑油原料向轻烷烃的转变推动了定向PDH技术的发展。

2. 工艺特异性：与将丙烯作为副产品的传统方法不同，PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的定向技术，可以更好地控制和优化生产过程。

3. 高选择性潜力：虽然PDH在烯烃选择性方面面临挑战，但催化剂设计的进步（如论文中描述的单点[PtZn4]催化剂）可以实现高丙烯选择性，解决这一挑战。

4. 独立于石油基原料：通过使用来自天然气源的丙烷，PDH减少了对石油基原料的依赖，使丙烯生产供应链多样化。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 能源密集：该过程高度吸热，需要高反应温度，影响能源效率。

2. 催化剂稳定性：高温可能导致催化剂失活，需要开发更稳定的催化剂。

3. 副反应：在高温下，可能发生不需要的副反应，如裂解和深度脱氢，产生不需要的副产品和焦炭。

尽管存在这些挑战，但在催化剂设计和工艺优化方面的持续研究和开发不断改进PDH技术，使其成为满足全球日益增长的丙烯需求的越来越具有吸引力的选择。
