          [1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures,"

[3] "which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[4] "Especially, it has been shown that larger ensembles of active sites catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including cracking and deep dehydrogenation, leading to the production of C1 and C2 molecules and coke."

[5] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."

[6] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

          Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as the most promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH utilizes light alkanes, particularly propane, which are increasingly available due to the emergence of shale gas and natural gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional naphtha-based production methods.

2. On-purpose production: PDH is specifically designed for propylene production, allowing for more targeted and efficient production compared to traditional methods where propylene is often a byproduct.

3. Process simplicity and flexibility: As a direct conversion process, PDH offers improved efficiency and greater flexibility in production capacity and location compared to more complex conventional routes.

4. Independence from petroleum feedstocks: By using propane from natural gas sources, PDH reduces dependence on petroleum-based feedstocks, diversifying the propylene production supply chain.

5. Potential for high selectivity: While PDH faces challenges in terms of alkene selectivity, advancements in catalyst design can potentially achieve high propylene selectivity.

However, PDH technology also faces significant challenges:

1. Energy intensity: The process is highly endothermic, requiring high reaction temperatures, which impacts energy efficiency.

2. Selectivity issues: High temperatures can lead to unwanted side reactions like cracking and deep dehydrogenation, reducing propylene selectivity and producing unwanted byproducts and coke.

3. Catalyst stability: The harsh reaction conditions can cause rapid catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration or replacement.

To address these challenges, ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures, improve propylene selectivity, and resist deactivation. The development of single-site catalysts is one approach to tackle these issues by inhibiting structure-sensitive side reactions and improving stability.

Overall, while PDH technology offers significant advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility and on-purpose production, continuous research and development in catalyst design and process optimization are crucial to overcome its challenges and fully realize its potential as a leading method for propylene production.

          丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用轻烷烃，特别是丙烷，这些原料由于页岩气和天然气资源的出现而日益丰富。这解决了传统基于石脑油生产方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 定向生产：PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的技术，与传统方法相比（丙烯通常是副产品），允许更有针对性和高效的生产。

3. 工艺简单和灵活性：作为直接转化过程，PDH提供了更高的效率，并在生产能力和位置方面提供了更大的灵活性，相比更复杂的传统路线。

4. 独立于石油基原料：通过使用来自天然气源的丙烷，PDH减少了对石油基原料的依赖，使丙烯生产供应链多样化。

5. 高选择性潜力：虽然PDH在烯烃选择性方面面临挑战，但催化剂设计的进步可能实现高丙烯选择性。

然而，PDH技术也面临重大挑战：

1. 能源密集：该过程高度吸热，需要高反应温度，影响能源效率。

2. 选择性问题：高温可能导致不需要的副反应，如裂解和深度脱氢，降低丙烯选择性并产生不需要的副产品和焦炭。

3. 催化剂稳定性：苛刻的反应条件可能导致催化剂快速失活，需要频繁再生或更换。

为了解决这些挑战，正在进行的研究专注于开发更高效的催化剂，这些催化剂可以在较低温度下工作，提高丙烯选择性，并抵抗失活。单点催化剂的开发是解决这些问题的一种方法，通过抑制结构敏感的副反应和提高稳定性。

总的来说，虽然PDH技术在原料灵活性和定向生产方面提供了显著的优势，但在催化剂设计和工艺优化方面的持续研究和开发对于克服其挑战并充分实现其作为丙烯生产主要方法的潜力至关重要。
