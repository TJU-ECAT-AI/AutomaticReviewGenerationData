[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH capitalizes on the increasing availability of light alkanes, particularly propane, from shale gas and natural gas sources. This shift away from traditional naphtha feedstock allows for more flexible and potentially cost-effective production.

2. On-purpose production: PDH is an "on-purpose" technology, meaning it's specifically designed to produce propylene. This allows for better control over production volumes and can help meet the growing global demand for propylene more directly than traditional methods.

3. Process simplicity: Compared to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, PDH is a relatively simple, single-step process that directly converts propane to propylene.

However, PDH technology also faces some challenges:

1. Energy intensity: The process is highly endothermic, requiring significant energy input and high reaction temperatures.

2. Selectivity issues: High temperatures can lead to unwanted side reactions, reducing propylene selectivity and producing byproducts like methane, ethylene, and coke.

3. Catalyst stability: The harsh reaction conditions can cause rapid catalyst deactivation, necessitating frequent regeneration or replacement.

To address these challenges, researchers are focusing on developing more efficient catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures, improve propylene selectivity, and resist deactivation. The development of single-site catalysts, as described in the literature, is one approach to tackle these issues by inhibiting structure-sensitive side reactions and improving stability.

Overall, while PDH technology offers significant advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility and on-purpose production, ongoing research is crucial to overcome its challenges and fully realize its potential as a leading method for propylene production.

丙烷直接脱氢（PDH）技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH利用了页岩气和天然气来源的轻烷烃（特别是丙烷）的日益增加的可用性。这种从传统的石脑油原料的转变允许更灵活和潜在的更具成本效益的生产。

2. 定向生产：PDH是一种"定向"技术，意味着它专门设计用于生产丙烯。这允许更好地控制生产量，并且可以比传统方法更直接地满足不断增长的全球丙烯需求。

3. 工艺简单：与蒸汽裂解或流化催化裂化相比，PDH是一个相对简单的单步过程，直接将丙烷转化为丙烯。

然而，PDH技术也面临一些挑战：

1. 能源密集：该过程高度吸热，需要大量能量输入和高反应温度。

2. 选择性问题：高温可能导致不希望的副反应，降低丙烯选择性并产生副产品如甲烷、乙烯和焦炭。

3. 催化剂稳定性：苛刻的反应条件可能导致催化剂快速失活，需要频繁再生或更换。

为了解决这些挑战，研究人员正在专注于开发更高效的催化剂，这些催化剂可以在较低温度下工作，提高丙烯选择性，并抵抗失活。文献中描述的单位点催化剂的开发是解决这些问题的一种方法，通过抑制结构敏感的副反应和提高稳定性。

总的来说，虽然PDH技术在原料灵活性和定向生产方面提供了显著的优势，但持续的研究对于克服其挑战并充分实现其作为丙烯生产主要方法的潜力至关重要。
