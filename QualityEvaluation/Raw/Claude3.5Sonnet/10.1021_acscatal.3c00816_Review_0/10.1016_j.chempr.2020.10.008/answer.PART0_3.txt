[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

The key advantages of propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for propylene production include:

1. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize light alkanes, particularly propane, which are increasingly available due to the emergence of shale gas and natural gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional naphtha-based production methods.

2. On-purpose production: PDH is an "on-purpose" technology specifically designed for propylene production, allowing for more targeted and efficient production compared to traditional methods where propylene is often a byproduct.

3. Potential for high selectivity: While high reaction temperatures present challenges, PDH technology has the potential for high propylene selectivity when optimized, addressing the need for improved product selectivity in propylene production.

4. Independence from petroleum feedstocks: By utilizing propane as a feedstock, PDH reduces reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks, which can be subject to price volatility and supply constraints.

5. Scalability: As a commercial technology, PDH can be implemented at various scales to meet growing propylene demand.

However, PDH also faces challenges, particularly in terms of process efficiency due to its energy-intensive nature and the need for high reaction temperatures, which can negatively impact catalyst stability and propylene selectivity. Ongoing research and development in catalyst design and process optimization aim to address these challenges and further improve the efficiency and selectivity of PDH technology.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术用于丙烯生产的主要优势包括：

1. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用轻烷烃，特别是丙烷，这些原料由于页岩气和天然气资源的出现而日益丰富。这解决了传统基于石脑油生产方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 定向生产：PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的"定向"技术，与传统方法相比（丙烯通常是副产品），允许更有针对性和高效的生产。

3. 高选择性潜力：虽然高反应温度带来挑战，但经过优化的PDH技术有潜力实现高丙烯选择性，满足提高丙烯生产选择性的需求。

4. 独立于石油基原料：通过利用丙烷作为原料，PDH减少了对易受价格波动和供应限制影响的石油基原料的依赖。

5. 可扩展性：作为一种商业技术，PDH可以在不同规模上实施，以满足日益增长的丙烯需求。

然而，PDH也面临挑战，特别是在过程效率方面，由于其能源密集性和对高反应温度的需求，这可能对催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性产生负面影响。正在进行的催化剂设计和工艺优化研究旨在解决这些挑战，并进一步提高PDH技术的效率和选择性。
