[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology that has received much attention, but high reaction temperatures result in a decrease of propylene selectivity and catalyst stability."

Propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) technology has emerged as a promising method for propylene production due to several key advantages:

1. Feedstock availability: PDH directly utilizes propane, which has become increasingly available due to the emergence of shale gas and natural gas resources. This addresses the challenge of feedstock availability faced by conventional naphtha-based production methods.

2. On-purpose production: PDH is an on-purpose technology specifically designed for propylene production, allowing for more efficient and targeted production compared to traditional methods where propylene is obtained as a byproduct.

3. Process flexibility: As a standalone process, PDH offers greater flexibility in production capacity and location, enabling producers to respond more effectively to market demands.

4. Potential for higher yields: While PDH faces challenges in terms of selectivity at high temperatures, ongoing research and development in catalyst design aim to improve propylene yields and selectivity.

5. Independence from oil-based feedstocks: By using propane as feedstock, PDH reduces dependence on oil-derived naphtha, potentially offering more stable feedstock pricing and supply.

However, PDH technology also faces challenges, particularly in terms of high energy requirements, the need for high reaction temperatures, and issues with catalyst stability and propylene selectivity. These challenges are being addressed through ongoing research into more efficient catalysts and process designs.

丙烷直接脱氢(PDH)技术因其几个关键优势而成为丙烯生产的最有前景的方法：

1. 原料可用性：PDH直接利用丙烷，而随着页岩气和天然气资源的出现，丙烷的可用性不断增加。这解决了传统石脑油基生产方法面临的原料可用性挑战。

2. 定向生产：PDH是专门为丙烯生产设计的定向技术，与传统方法相比，它可以实现更高效和有针对性的生产，传统方法中丙烯是作为副产品获得的。

3. 过程灵活性：作为一个独立的过程，PDH在生产能力和位置方面提供了更大的灵活性，使生产商能够更有效地响应市场需求。

4. 提高产率的潜力：虽然PDH在高温下面临选择性方面的挑战，但正在进行的催化剂设计研究和开发旨在提高丙烯产率和选择性。

5. 独立于石油基原料：通过使用丙烷作为原料，PDH减少了对石油衍生的石脑油的依赖，可能提供更稳定的原料价格和供应。

然而，PDH技术也面临挑战，特别是在高能耗需求、需要高反应温度以及催化剂稳定性和丙烯选择性方面的问题。通过对更高效的催化剂和工艺设计的持续研究，这些挑战正在得到解决。
