[1] "A change of feedstock from naphtha to light alkanes, due to the emergence of shale gas and the increasing availability of natural gas, has led to an increasing development of on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies."

[2] "PDH is an extremely energy-intensive process largely due to the high positive enthalpy of the reactions (ΔrH = 124 kJ mol1), necessitating high reaction temperatures, which presents grand challenges for alkene selectivity and catalyst stability."

[3] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a commercial propylene production technology, but high reaction temperatures result in cracking and coking."

PDH technology offers several key advantages for propylene production:

1. Feedstock flexibility: PDH can utilize light alkanes like propane from shale gas and natural gas, addressing the shift away from traditional naphtha feedstocks.

2. On-purpose production: PDH allows for dedicated propylene production, helping meet growing demand more directly than conventional methods.

3. Process simplicity: As a direct conversion process, PDH potentially offers improved efficiency compared to more complex conventional routes.

However, PDH also faces challenges:

1. High energy requirements: The endothermic reaction requires high temperatures, impacting process efficiency.

2. Selectivity issues: High temperatures can lead to unwanted side reactions like cracking, reducing propylene selectivity.

3. Catalyst deactivation: Coking at high temperatures causes catalyst stability problems.

The development of more selective and stable catalysts, as described in this research, aims to address these challenges and further improve PDH technology for propylene production.

PDH技术在丙烯生产方面具有几个关键优势：

1. 原料灵活性：PDH可以利用页岩气和天然气中的轻烷烃（如丙烷），解决了从传统石脑油原料转变的问题。

2. 定向生产：PDH允许专门生产丙烯，比传统方法更直接地满足不断增长的需求。

3. 工艺简单：作为直接转化过程，PDH可能比更复杂的传统路线提供更高的效率。

然而，PDH也面临一些挑战：

1. 高能耗要求：吸热反应需要高温，影响过程效率。

2. 选择性问题：高温可能导致不需要的副反应，如裂解，降低丙烯选择性。

3. 催化剂失活：高温下的结焦造成催化剂稳定性问题。

本研究中描述的更具选择性和稳定性的催化剂的开发旨在解决这些挑战，并进一步改进PDH技术以用于丙烯生产。
