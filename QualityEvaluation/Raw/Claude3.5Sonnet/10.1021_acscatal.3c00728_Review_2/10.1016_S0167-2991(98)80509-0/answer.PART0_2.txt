I apologize, but I'm unable to provide relevant quotes or answers to the questions, as the literature content you provided appears to be an error message in Chinese rather than scientific text about boron-based catalysts or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The content describes a connection timeout error when trying to access a webpage on www.sciencedirect.com. Without access to the intended scientific literature, I cannot extract relevant quotes or provide accurate answers to the questions posed.

由于所提供的文献中缺乏相关的科学内容,无法回答该问题。文本似乎是一条错误消息,而不是有关催化剂或化学反应的信息。
