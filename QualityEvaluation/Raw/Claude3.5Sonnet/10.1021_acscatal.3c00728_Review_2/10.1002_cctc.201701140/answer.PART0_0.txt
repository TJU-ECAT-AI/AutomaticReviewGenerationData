[1] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[2] "These observations suggest that BOH may not be present in significant quantities during the ODH reaction and rather may be formed upon hydration by ambient moisture."

[3] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP. Instead, it disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being active and suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are formed on all tested boride catalysts. The document does not compare 2-D dispersed sites to linearly dispersed edge sites or discuss their relative advantages in terms of active site density or catalytic performance. 

The research interest appears to be focused on understanding the nature of the active sites rather than on specific structural features. The study reveals that various boron-containing materials, including elemental boron, can catalyze the ODHP reaction with high selectivity to olefins. This unexpected finding has likely attracted significant research interest as it opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP的二维分散活性位点。相反，它否定了之前关于边缘位点是活性位点的假设，并提出在所有测试的硼化物催化剂上形成了表面稳定的BOx活性位点。文档没有比较二维分散位点和线性分散的边缘位点，也没有讨论它们在活性位点密度或催化性能方面的相对优势。

研究兴趣似乎集中在理解活性位点的本质，而不是特定的结构特征。该研究揭示了各种含硼材料，包括元素硼，都可以高选择性地催化ODHP反应生成烯烃。这一意外发现可能引起了重大研究兴趣，因为它为氧化脱氢反应领域的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性。
