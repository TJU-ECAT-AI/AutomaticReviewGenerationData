          [1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),7 n-butane, and isobutane8 to form the corresponding olefins selectively."

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

[4] "Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

[5] "To elucidate further the role of boron as the element responsible for the ODH activity and to decouple the influence of the non-boron constituent element within the tested materials, the catalytic activity of elemental boron was also evaluated."

          The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it challenges previous assumptions about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. The study suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction, rather than relying on edge sites.

The research interest appears to stem from the discovery that many boron-containing compounds, not just boron nitride, can catalyze ODHP with high selectivity to olefins. This suggests a common mechanism involving BOx active sites across different boron-based materials, regardless of their bulk structure.

The literature mentions that crystal structure may influence the formation of BOx species, with layered borides potentially presenting different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides. This could affect active site density, but specific advantages in terms of catalytic performance are not detailed in the given text.

While the document doesn't directly address 2-D dispersed active sites or their advantages, it presents a shift in understanding from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites in boron-based ODHP catalysts. This new understanding, along with the discovery that various boron-containing materials can catalyze ODHP, has likely sparked further research interest in this area, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

          该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它挑战了之前关于边缘位点是硼氮化物催化剂活性位点的假设。研究表明，在ODHP反应过程中，各种含硼材料表面会形成稳定的BOx活性位点，而不是依赖于边缘位点。

研究兴趣似乎源于发现许多含硼化合物，而不仅仅是氮化硼，都能以高选择性催化ODHP反应生成烯烃。这表明不同的硼基材料可能存在一个共同的机制，涉及BOx活性位点，而不受其体相结构的影响。

文献提到，晶体结构可能会影响BOx物种的形成，层状硼化物可能比四方硼化物呈现出不同的硼表面浓度。这可能会影响活性位点密度，但文中并未详细说明在催化性能方面的具体优势。

虽然文档没有直接讨论二维分散活性位点或其优势，但它呈现了一个认知上的转变，即从边缘位点催化转向硼基ODHP催化剂中的表面全域BOx活性位点。这种新的理解，加上发现各种含硼材料都可以催化ODHP反应，可能引发了该领域的进一步研究兴趣，为氧化脱氢反应领域的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性。
