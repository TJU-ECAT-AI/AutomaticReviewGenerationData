[1] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[2] "These observations suggest that BOH may not be present in significant quantities during the ODH reaction and rather may be formed upon hydration by ambient moisture."

[3] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP. Instead, it disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being active and suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites are formed on all tested boride catalysts. The document does not compare 2-D dispersed sites to linearly dispersed edge sites or discuss their relative advantages in terms of active site density or catalytic performance. 

The research interest appears to be focused on understanding the nature of the active sites rather than on specific structural features. The study reveals that various boron-containing materials, including elemental boron, can catalyze the ODHP reaction with high selectivity to olefins. This unexpected finding has likely attracted significant research interest as it opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP的二维分散活性位点。相反，它否定了之前关于边缘位点是活性位点的假设，并提出在所有测试的硼化物催化剂上形成了表面稳定的BOx活性位点。文档没有比较二维分散位点和线性分散的边缘位点，也没有讨论它们在活性位点密度或催化性能方面的相对优势。

研究兴趣似乎集中在理解活性位点的本质，而不是特定的结构特征。该研究揭示了各种含硼材料，包括元素硼，都可以高选择性地催化ODHP反应生成烯烃。这一意外发现可能引起了重大研究兴趣，因为它为氧化脱氢反应领域的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性。

[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[3] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP. Instead, it focuses on various boron-containing materials and elemental boron as catalysts for ODHP. The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites on boron nitride. It suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on all tested boride catalysts under reaction conditions, responsible for the selective formation of olefins.

The research interest appears to stem from the discovery that many boron-containing materials, not just boron nitride, can catalyze ODHP with high selectivity to olefins. This broadens the range of potential catalysts for this reaction. However, the literature does not specifically discuss advantages in terms of active site density or catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites.

The study's focus is on identifying the common features across various boron-containing catalysts that lead to their similar catalytic behavior, rather than on comparing 2-D dispersed sites to edge sites. Therefore, the specific advantages of 2-D dispersed sites and reasons for research interest in these structural features cannot be directly answered based on the given literature.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点。相反，它主要关注各种含硼材料和元素硼作为ODHP的催化剂。研究否定了之前关于硼氮化物边缘位点是活性位点的假说。它提出，在所有测试的硼化物催化剂上，在反应条件下形成了表面稳定的BOx活性位点，这些位点负责选择性地形成烯烃。

研究兴趣似乎源于发现许多含硼材料，而不仅仅是氮化硼，都能以高选择性催化ODHP生成烯烃。这拓宽了该反应的潜在催化剂范围。然而，文献并未具体讨论与线性分散的边缘位点相比，在活性位点密度或催化性能方面的优势。

该研究的重点是识别各种含硼催化剂之间导致其相似催化行为的共同特征，而不是比较二维分散位点和边缘位点。因此，基于给定的文献，无法直接回答二维分散位点的具体优势以及对这些结构特征研究兴趣的原因。

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, the research focuses on various boron-containing materials and elemental boron as catalysts for ODHP.

The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. It suggests that for all tested boride catalysts, including elemental boron, the active sites are surface-stabilized BOx species formed under ODHP reaction conditions. These BOx sites are responsible for the selective formation of olefins.

The research attracts interest because it reveals that the high selectivity to olefins in ODHP reactions is not exclusive to boron nitride materials but is a property of many boron-containing compounds. This finding opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in ODHP reactions.

The study does not provide specific information about active site density or detailed comparisons of catalytic performance between different types of active sites. However, it does note that the reactivity differences between elemental boron and other boron-containing materials may be due to differences in active site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点在ODHP反应中的应用，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，研究重点关注了各种含硼材料和单质硼作为ODHP反应的催化剂。

研究否定了之前关于硼氮化物催化剂边缘位点是活性位点的假设。它提出，对于所有测试的硼化物催化剂，包括单质硼，活性位点是在ODHP反应条件下形成的表面稳定的BOx物种。这些BOx位点负责选择性地形成烯烃。

这项研究之所以引起兴趣，是因为它揭示了ODHP反应中对烯烃的高选择性不仅限于硼氮化物材料，而是许多含硼化合物的共同特性。这一发现为ODHP反应中的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性。

研究没有提供关于活性位点密度的具体信息，也没有详细比较不同类型活性位点之间的催化性能。然而，它确实指出，单质硼与其他含硼材料之间的反应活性差异可能是由于活性位点密度的差异以及表面BOx物种与次表面体相结构之间的电子相互作用造成的。

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP. Instead, it challenges previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. The study suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction, including elemental boron and other borides. These BOx sites are responsible for the selective formation of olefins.

The research does not specifically compare 2-D dispersed sites to linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density or catalytic performance. Rather, it focuses on demonstrating that multiple boron-containing materials, not just boron nitride, can catalyze the ODHP reaction with high selectivity to olefins.

The study's findings have likely attracted research interest because they reveal that the exceptional selectivity to olefins in ODHP reactions is not exclusive to boron nitride materials but is a property of various boron-containing compounds. This broadens the scope of potential catalysts for ODHP and suggests new directions for catalyst design and optimization in this field.

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it challenges previous assumptions about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. The study suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction, rather than relying on edge sites.

The research interest appears to stem from the discovery that many boron-containing compounds, not just boron nitride, can catalyze ODHP with high selectivity to olefins. This suggests a common mechanism involving BOx active sites across different boron-based materials, regardless of their bulk structure.

The literature mentions that crystal structure may influence the formation of BOx species, with layered borides potentially presenting different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides. This could affect active site density, but specific advantages in terms of catalytic performance are not detailed in the given text.

Overall, while the document doesn't directly address 2-D dispersed active sites or their advantages, it presents a shift in understanding from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites in boron-based ODHP catalysts, which has likely sparked further research interest in this area.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它挑战了之前关于边缘位点是硼氮化物催化剂活性位点的假设。研究表明，在ODHP反应过程中，各种含硼材料表面会形成稳定的BOx活性位点，而不是依赖于边缘位点。

研究兴趣似乎源于发现许多含硼化合物，而不仅仅是氮化硼，都能以高选择性催化ODHP反应生成烯烃。这表明不同的硼基材料可能存在一个共同的机制，涉及BOx活性位点，而不受其体相结构的影响。

文献提到，晶体结构可能会影响BOx物种的形成，层状硼化物可能比四方硼化物呈现出不同的硼表面浓度。这可能会影响活性位点密度，但文中并未详细说明在催化性能方面的具体优势。

总的来说，虽然文档没有直接讨论二维分散活性位点或其优势，但它呈现了一个认知上的转变，即从边缘位点催化转向硼基ODHP催化剂中的表面全域BOx活性位点，这可能引发了该领域的进一步研究兴趣。
