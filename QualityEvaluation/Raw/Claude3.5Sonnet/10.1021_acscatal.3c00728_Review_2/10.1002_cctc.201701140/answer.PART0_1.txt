[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "Aside from BN, we now show that the boron-containing materials boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB) all catalyze the ODHP reaction and show identical trends in their product distributions"

[3] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP. Instead, it focuses on various boron-containing materials and elemental boron as catalysts for ODHP. The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites on boron nitride. It suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on all tested boride catalysts under reaction conditions, responsible for the selective formation of olefins.

The research interest appears to stem from the discovery that many boron-containing materials, not just boron nitride, can catalyze ODHP with high selectivity to olefins. This broadens the range of potential catalysts for this reaction. However, the literature does not specifically discuss advantages in terms of active site density or catalytic performance compared to linearly dispersed edge sites.

The study's focus is on identifying the common features across various boron-containing catalysts that lead to their similar catalytic behavior, rather than on comparing 2-D dispersed sites to edge sites. Therefore, the specific advantages of 2-D dispersed sites and reasons for research interest in these structural features cannot be directly answered based on the given literature.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点。相反，它主要关注各种含硼材料和元素硼作为ODHP的催化剂。研究否定了之前关于硼氮化物边缘位点是活性位点的假说。它提出，在所有测试的硼化物催化剂上，在反应条件下形成了表面稳定的BOx活性位点，这些位点负责选择性地形成烯烃。

研究兴趣似乎源于发现许多含硼材料，而不仅仅是氮化硼，都能以高选择性催化ODHP生成烯烃。这拓宽了该反应的潜在催化剂范围。然而，文献并未具体讨论与线性分散的边缘位点相比，在活性位点密度或催化性能方面的优势。

该研究的重点是识别各种含硼催化剂之间导致其相似催化行为的共同特征，而不是比较二维分散位点和边缘位点。因此，基于给定的文献，无法直接回答二维分散位点的具体优势以及对这些结构特征研究兴趣的原因。
