[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),"

[2] "To elucidate further the role of boron as the element responsible for the ODH activity and to decouple the influence of the non-boron constituent element within the tested materials, the catalytic activity of elemental boron was also evaluated."

[3] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP. Instead, it challenges previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. The study suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction, including elemental boron and other borides. These BOx sites are responsible for the selective formation of olefins.

The research does not specifically compare 2-D dispersed sites to linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density or catalytic performance. Rather, it focuses on demonstrating that multiple boron-containing materials, not just boron nitride, can catalyze the ODHP reaction with high selectivity to olefins.

The study's findings have likely attracted research interest because they reveal that the exceptional selectivity to olefins in ODHP reactions is not exclusive to boron nitride materials but is a property of various boron-containing compounds. This broadens the scope of potential catalysts for ODHP and suggests new directions for catalyst design and optimization in this field.

文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点。相反，它挑战了之前关于硼氮化物催化剂边缘位点是活性位点的假设。研究表明，在ODHP反应过程中，各种含硼材料（包括单质硼和其他硼化物）上形成了表面稳定的BOx活性位点。这些BOx位点负责选择性地形成烯烃。

研究并未具体比较二维分散位点与线性分散边缘位点在活性位点密度或催化性能方面的差异。相反，它着重展示了多种含硼材料，而不仅仅是氮化硼，都能以高选择性催化ODHP反应生成烯烃。

这项研究的发现之所以可能引起研究界的兴趣，是因为它揭示了ODHP反应中对烯烃的异常高选择性并非氮化硼材料所独有，而是各种含硼化合物的共同特性。这扩大了ODHP潜在催化剂的范围，并为该领域的催化剂设计和优化提供了新的方向。
