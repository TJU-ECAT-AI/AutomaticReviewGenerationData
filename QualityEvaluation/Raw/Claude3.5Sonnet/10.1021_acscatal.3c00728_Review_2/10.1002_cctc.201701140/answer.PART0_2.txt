[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),7 n-butane, and isobutane8 to form the corresponding olefins selectively."

[2] "To elucidate further the role of boron as the element responsible for the ODH activity and to decouple the influence of the non-boron constituent element within the tested materials, the catalytic activity of elemental boron was also evaluated."

[3] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[4] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, the research focuses on various boron-containing materials and elemental boron as catalysts for ODHP.

The study disproves previous hypotheses about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. It suggests that for all tested boride catalysts, including elemental boron, the active sites are surface-stabilized BOx species formed under ODHP reaction conditions. These BOx sites are responsible for the selective formation of olefins.

The research attracts interest because it reveals that the high selectivity to olefins in ODHP reactions is not exclusive to boron nitride materials but is a property of many boron-containing compounds. This finding opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in ODHP reactions.

The study does not provide specific information about active site density or detailed comparisons of catalytic performance between different types of active sites. However, it does note that the reactivity differences between elemental boron and other boron-containing materials may be due to differences in active site density and electronic interactions between surface BOx species and the subsurface bulk structure.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点在ODHP反应中的应用，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，研究重点关注了各种含硼材料和单质硼作为ODHP反应的催化剂。

研究否定了之前关于硼氮化物催化剂边缘位点是活性位点的假设。它提出，对于所有测试的硼化物催化剂，包括单质硼，活性位点是在ODHP反应条件下形成的表面稳定的BOx物种。这些BOx位点负责选择性地形成烯烃。

这项研究之所以引起兴趣，是因为它揭示了ODHP反应中对烯烃的高选择性不仅限于硼氮化物材料，而是许多含硼化合物的共同特性。这一发现为ODHP反应中的催化剂设计和优化开辟了新的可能性。

研究没有提供关于活性位点密度的具体信息，也没有详细比较不同类型活性位点之间的催化性能。然而，它确实指出，单质硼与其他含硼材料之间的反应活性差异可能是由于活性位点密度的差异以及表面BOx物种与次表面体相结构之间的电子相互作用造成的。
