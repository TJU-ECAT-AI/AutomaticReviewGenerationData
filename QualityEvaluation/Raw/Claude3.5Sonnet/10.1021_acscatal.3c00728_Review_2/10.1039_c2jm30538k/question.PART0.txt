Nano-boron carbide supported platinum catalysts with much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance
Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were successfully deposited on the surface of nano-B4C with fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin film through a polyol process in an ethylene glycol solution. The electrochemical surface area of the Pt/B4C was investigated and showed remarkable enhancement compared with conventional Pt/C catalysts, which could be attributed to fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage occurring during the hydrogen desorption process. It was also found that the novel Pt/B4C catalysts presented much enhanced methanol oxidation activity and CO tolerance by a negative shift in the onset potential and an increase of the peak current density in comparison to Pt/C catalysts. Meanwhile, the Pt/B4C showed an improved oxygen reduction reaction activity compared to the Pt/C catalyst.
Introduction
Much attention has recently been focused on low temperature fuel cells with energy conversion based on methanol (CH3OH) instead of hydrogen, because CH3OH is a safer, cheaper and widely available fuel and can be introduced easily in the existing fuel distribution systems.13 Currently, platinum (Pt) is still regarded as the most widely used electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).47 However, pure Pt is readily poisoned by carbon monoxide (CO) produced as an intermediate during the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), inhibiting the widespread application of DMFCs.810 In order to enhance the catalytic activity, alloying Pt with transition metals (such as Ru, Fe, Co, Ni, Au and Mo) has been proven to be a successful strategy for the development of new catalysts for DMFCs.1116 Among them, the PtRu catalyst is the most studied and successful candidate for MOR. The adsorption of hydroxyls on oxygenated Ru, which forms at a lower potential than Pt, promotes the oxidation of CO adsorbed on the Pt into CO2 and thus releases the occupied active sites. However, it has been found that Ru is prone to dissolve out of PtRu catalysts and degrades the durable performance of DMFCs.12,13,16 Unfortunately, the dissolution of the transition metals is also observed from the cathode, which is caused by an acidic electrolyte (pH < 1) and a high operating potential (up to 1.2 V).
It is well known that the properties of the support materials are essential for the catalysts to produce high catalytic activity. Pt nanoparticles (NPs) supported on a high surface area carbon (Pt/C), such as Vulcan XC-72, have played a vital role in fuel cells, and improved the activity and the utilization of Pt. In the development of improved catalysts for fuel cells, much effort has been now focused on the effects of the support material.1720 Recently, researchers have demonstrated that novel nanostructured carbons, such as graphene nanosheets, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbon and carbon nanofibers, constitute attractive alternative supports because of synergistic effects.2127 Transition metal oxide composites, such as TiO2, SnO2 and CeO2, have also attracted attention due to their electrochemical activity and stabilization function towards the supported catalysts.28,29 In addition, WC has attracted much interest due to the special properties of Pt-like behaviour in some reactions and insolubility in acid solutions. Shen and coworkers have reported that prepared Pt-WC/C electrocatalysts exhibit improved CO anti-poisoning properties.30
Until now, the discovery of alterative catalysts with higher MOR activity and CO tolerance has been a key research objective for DMFCs. Boron carbide (B4C) does not react with acids and alkalis, and its low density and high chemical potential make it one of the most stable substances toward acid. B4C also possesses the special qualities of high temperature, high strength and high grinding efficiency, and has been widely used as a wear-resistant material, in armor and as a neutron absorber.3133 B4C is expected to be used as a catalyst support in fuel cells, because it might promote catalytic activity through synergistic effects.3436 To the best of our knowledge, there have been only a few reports describing the use of B4C as a catalyst support for noble metals in fuel cells. Grubb and McKee36 have investigated commercial B4C powder supported Pt as an anode material in phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs); the results indicate that an enhancement of the Pt activity has been achieved and that Pt on B4C is more resistant to sintering than Pt black or Pt on graphite at equal surface coverage. In this study, for the first time, the effects of nano-B4C, especially with fragmentary nanostructured carbon thin film as a catalyst support, are investigated for MOR and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. The presence of carbon thin film facilitates the electrical conduction of the support materials. Meanwhile, the CO tolerance of our new Pt/B4C catalyst is demonstrated by CO stripping experiments.
Experimental
Materials synthesis
Pt/B4C catalysts were synthesized via an ethylene glycol (EG) reduction method. To deposit the Pt nanoparticles homogeneously on the as-received nano-B4C (Kaier Nano Co., Ltd.), 80 mg of B4C was added to EG solution and it was ultrasonically treated for 30 min, then transferred into a round bottom flask. Afterwards, the calculated amount of Pt precursor H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) solution was added dropwise into the B4C suspension under vigorous stirring. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 1213 with a 2.0 M NaOH aqueous solution. Then the mixture was heated under reflux at 160 C for 23 h to ensure the complete reduction of the metal salts. After stirring overnight, the mixture was filtered and washed with deionized water. The obtained catalyst was dried at 90 C overnight in a vacuum oven. Upon reaction with sodium borohydride, no changes happened to the colourless and transparent filtrate, which demonstrated that all of the H2PtCl6 had been reduced and deposited on the B4C. For comparison purposes, Vulcan XC-72 supported Pt catalysts (Pt/C) were synthesized following a similar procedure and the Pt loading was maintained at 20 wt% for all the catalysts.
Electrochemical characterization
The electrochemical measurements were carried out using an Autolab PGSTAT 30 potentiostat (Eco Chemie B.V., Holland) with a three-electrode setup. The prepared glassy carbon (GC) electrode was held vertically in an electrolytic cell filled with a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at room temperature. A large surface area Pt foil was employed as the counter electrode, while a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. All potentials measured were quoted against a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Electrolyte solutions were deaerated by high-purity nitrogen for 30 min prior to any electrochemical measurements. For working electrode preparation, 6 mg of catalyst was dispersed in 1 mL of deionized water and then mixed with 100 μL 5 wt% perfluorosulfonic acid (PSFA) Nafion (DuPont Co., Ltd.) solution. After ultrasonic stirring, 5 μL of this ink was deposited on the flat surface of the GC disk.
For determination of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Pt NPs in the catalysts, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded from 0 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s1 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The ECSA of the catalysts was calculated based on the following relation:
where QH is the charge for hydrogen adsorption (mC cm2), [Pt] represents the Pt loading (mg cm2) in the electrode, and 0.21 represents the charge required to oxidize a monolayer of H2 on bright Pt. The adsorption of the hydroxyl species was calculated based on the OHad peak in the CV curves at a potential larger than 0.6 V. Dividing the hydroxyl adsorption area by the overall active surface area resulted in the surface coverage of the OHad species (ΘOHad).37,38
For the CO tolerance test, CO gas (99.99% purity) was bubbled for 30 min with the potential held at 0.1 V to allow the complete adsorption of CO onto the active catalytic sites. Dissolved CO in the electrolyte was removed by bubbling nitrogen into the electrolyte for 30 min. Two CVs were successively performed at a scan rate of 20 mV s1; the first cycle was conducted to oxidize the irreversibly adsorbed CO and the second to verify the complete oxidation of the adsorbed CO on the surface of the Pt NPs. Measurements of the MOR activity were performed from 0 to 1.2 V in a 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M CH3OH solution as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s1. In addition, the study of the ORR performance of both the catalysts was conducted in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) system. Polarization curves were obtained at room temperature with a scan rate of 10 mV s1 and a rotation rate of 1600 rpm, recorded from 1.1 to 0.2 V.
Results and discussion
HRTEM (JEOL 2010) was used to characterize the morphological structure of the nano-B4C and the dispersion of Pt NPs on the support. Nano-B4C with a rhombohedral crystal structure exhibits an average particle size of around 40 nm within the 2050 nm range as shown in Fig. 1A. Fragmentary amorphous layers with a thickness of around 2 nm adhering to the edge of the B4C are also observed in some parts of the nano-B4C powder, which can be attributed to the formation of uncrystallized carbon thin film in the synthesis process of the nano-B4C powder. For application in fuel cell electrocatalysts, the existence of the nanostructured carbon thin film on nano-B4C can effectively improve the electronic conduction of the B4C ceramic support, which has a relatively low intrinsic electrical conductivity like silicon carbide (SiC).19Fig. 1B shows the representative HRTEM image for Pt NPs uniformly dispersed on the nano-B4C support with a particle size of around 3 nm. As displayed in Fig. 1C, the nano-B4C shows well-defined 2D lattice planes; it can be seen that the orientation of the crystal planes is random, and the amorphous carbon thin film is also observed at some particle edges of the nano-B4C. In addition, through the lattice analyses, the lattice planes with a spacing of 0.24 nm and 0.22 nm correspond to B4C (021) and Pt (111), respectively. In contrast, the exposed surface of Vulcan XC-72 is bare without any lattice fringes (except Pt NPs) due to its amorphous structure for the conventional Pt/C catalyst (see Fig. 1D).39

To evaluate the electrochemical activity of the Pt/B4C catalyst, CV curves were tested in nitrogen saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 suspension. The typical hydrogen and oxygen adsorption and desorption behavior is presented in Fig. 2A, and no additional current peak is generated. The ECSA of the Pt NPs was calculated from the integrated charge (after subtraction of the capacitance contribution) in the hydrogen adsorption region of the steady CV, based on a monolayer hydrogen adsorption charge of 0.21 mC cm2 on bright Pt.40,41 The ECSA is determined to be 88 m2 g1 for the Pt/B4C catalysts, which is 40% larger than that of the conventional Pt/C catalysts (63 m2 g1). The activity of Pt is affected by many factors, such as the size, the support, the shape of the Pt particles and the synthesis method.4244 In this study, the improved ECSA for the Pt/B4C catalysts may be ascribed to the B4C support since the size and shape of the Pt particles are similar (see Fig. 1), and the synthesis method for both the Pt/B4C and Pt/C catalysts is the same. It is well known that the electrical conductivity of the support is one of the main suppression factors of the catalytic activity of catalysts. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the fragmentary amorphous carbon thin film adhering to the edge of the B4C enhances the electronic conduction of the B4C nanoparticles, which makes the B4C more electrochemically suitable for the catalyst support in comparison with the pristine carbides. The CV curves of both the Vulcan XC-72 and B4C supports were also recorded before the Pt NPs were deposited (as shown in Fig.2A). It is interesting to note that the intrinsic CV curves of the Vulcan XC-72 and B4C are almost identical, suggesting that they have the same electrochemical behaviour in 0.5 M H2SO4. Since both the supports do not adsorb hydrogen (see Fig. 2A), the higher ECSA of Pt in the Pt/B4C catalysts can be attributed to the synergistic effects between the Pt NPs and the B4C support.35,36 Meanwhile, the synergistic effects of the B4C support also greatly alter the ability to adsorb hydroxyl species (OHad, E > 0.6 V). As shown in Fig. 2B, both the onset and peak potentials for the Pt/B4C show negative shifts compared to the conventional Pt/C catalysts on the backward sweep, which clearly indicates that the Pt NPs on the B4C support undergo fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage.37,38

The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/B4C and Pt/C catalysts for MOR was characterized by CV in an electrolyte of 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M CH3OH at 50 mV s1. Interestingly, the electro-oxidation curves for MOR are proportional to the ECSA, as shown in Fig. 3A. A large MOR peak is observed at a potential of 0.84 V on the forward scan, which is usually considered as being associated with the oxidation of methanol and with the removal of the carbonaceous species generated via the incomplete oxidation of alcohol. It shows that the peak current density of Pt is 63 mA cm2, which is nearly twice that of Pt/C catalysts (37 mA cm2). This indicates that the Pt/B4C catalyst has a higher activity than that of Pt/C, which is consistent with the result of the ECSA. The mechanism for methanol oxidation on Pt can be summarized as follows:45,46

or

In the case of the Pt/B4C, the equilibrium of the electrosorption shifts toward the right because of fast hydroxyl adsorption and the high OHad coverage occurring on the Pt NPs surface; the newly formed H+ reacts rapidly with the OHad during the sorption, which can promote the sorption process and accelerate the formation of PtCO. Therefore, fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage help to promote CO oxidation on Pt (PtCO) to CO2 and thus releases the occupied active site, resulting in a much enhanced activity. It is likely that the synergistic effects of the B4C support functions in the same way as Ru in Pt-Ru/C catalysts. Meanwhile, Fig. 3A also shows that the Pt/B4C catalyst has a negative onset potential shift of about 41 mV for methanol oxidation compared to that of the Pt/C catalyst. This indicates that the B4C support could effectively reduce the overpotential for methanol oxidation, resulting in a greatly enhanced catalytic activity for MOR.
In the absorption process, methanol molecules adsorb on the surface of Pt and the PtCO forms after the dehydrogenation. Therefore, a good catalyst should possess excellent CO tolerance ability, because the absorbed CO is the main poisoning intermediate during MOR. In order to investigate the reason for the high MOR activity of Pt/B4C, the oxidation of pre-adsorbed PtCO was conducted by CO stripping voltammetry in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s1 as shown in Fig. 3B. The onset potential for CO oxidation on Pt/B4C catalysts is visibly shifted negatively by about 92 mV, and the peak potential by about 37 mV, compared to those of the Pt/C catalysts. This means that the absorbed CO is prone to oxidation on Pt/B4C at lower potential, which is helpful for releasing the active sites of Pt for the further oxidation of methanol in DMFCs. In addition, this result indicates that the assertion mentioned above is established, which also explains the higher activity of Pt/B4C for the oxidation of methanol.
The electrochemical activity and stability of the Pt/B4C and Pt/C catalysts were recorded with chronoamperometry, which is widely used to characterize the electrocatalyst stability in fuel cells.47,48Fig. 4 shows the chronoamperometric curves at 0.6 V for methanol oxidation. For both catalysts, the current density shows a decrease with time, indicating that poisoning of catalysts resulted from the adsorbed intermediates during the MOR. Nevertheless, the Pt/B4C presents a higher current density than that of the Pt/C catalysts over the whole process, indicating that the Pt/B4C catalyst is more poison-tolerant compared to the conventional Pt/C catalyst.
Fig. 4 Currenttime curves for the Pt/B4C and Pt/C catalysts recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4 + 0.5 M CH3OH solutions at a constant potential of 0.6 V.
The ORR activity was also measured by obtaining polarization curves in an oxygen-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The activity of the catalysts is expressed as a half-wave potential. Fig. 5 shows a small positive shift of about 10 mV in the mixed kinetic-diffusion controlled region for the Pt/B4C compared to that of the Pt/C catalyst. This indicates that the Pt NPs improve their ORR activity after being depositing on the B4C support. As expected, the corresponding change of the half-wave potential is consistent with the ECSA mentioned above. Nevertheless, they illustrate a slightly higher ORR activity than that on carbon supports due to minor differences in the half-wave potential and the diffusion limiting current between the Pt/B4C and Pt/C catalysts.

Conclusions
Pt NPs with a diameter of around 3 nm were loaded homogeneously onto the nano-B4C support with fragmentary sections of amorphous carbon thin film. The novel Pt/B4C catalyst exhibited a distinctly higher catalytic activity compared to the conventional Pt/C catalyst. More importantly, it was found that the current density of the Pt/B4C was nearly twice that of the conventional Pt/C catalyst for MOR activity, and the CO tolerance was much enhanced by a negative shift in the onset potential, which could be attributed to its higher ECSA as well as fast hydroxyl adsorption and high OHad coverage on the Pt NPs. These results suggest promising applications for the nano-B4C as a catalyst support in DMFCs or other industrial fields.
