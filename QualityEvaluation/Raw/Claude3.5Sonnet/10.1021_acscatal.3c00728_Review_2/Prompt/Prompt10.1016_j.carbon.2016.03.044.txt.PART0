I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Abstract
The low utilization and stability of noble-metal catalysts is always a big barrier to commercialize proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Here we report a positive progress on stabilizing the catalyst by modulating 2D graphene as an advanced support of Pt nanoparticles, where the interlayer of graphene is near perfectly intercalated by nano-B4C ceramics. The strong restriction effect of nano-ceramics in graphene interlayers, can greatly improves the usage and electrochemical stability of Pt catalysts. As results, our new graphene/B4C supported Pt catalyst (Pt-RGO/B4C) shows greatly enhanced electrochemical surface area (121 m2 g1) and mass activity (185 A g1 Pt) towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which is remarkably higher than the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported Pt (Pt/RGO) catalyst and the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In addition, the Pt-RGO/B4C electrode also possesses higher fuel cell performance than the Pt/RGO electrode. Especially, after the electrochemical acceleration test for 10000 cycles, our new catalyst presents an excellent stability, even retains 45.2% initial electrochemical surface area, while the Pt/RGO and Pt/C are only 29.7 and 23.4%, respectively. These indicate our unique catalyst is promising to allow the PEM fuel cell have high ORR activity and stability.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How are 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, what specific advantages do they offer over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, and why have these unique structural features attracted significant research interest in the field?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
