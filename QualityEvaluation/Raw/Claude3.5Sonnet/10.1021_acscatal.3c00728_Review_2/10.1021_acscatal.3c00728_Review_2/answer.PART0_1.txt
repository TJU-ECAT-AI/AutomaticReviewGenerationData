2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through two main methods:

1. Doping active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of various hosting materials.
2. Utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials.

These 2-D dispersed active sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density. The higher density of active sites can lead to improved catalytic performance.

The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites have attracted extensive research interest in the field of ODHP reactions. This is likely due to their potential for enhanced catalytic activity, improved selectivity, and better overall performance compared to traditional catalysts with linearly dispersed edge sites.

硼基催化剂中用于ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点通过两种主要方法开发：

1. 在各种宿主材料表面掺杂活性硼氧化物/硼羟基单元。
2. 利用体相硼化物材料的暴露表面。

这些二维分散活性位点相比线性分散的边缘位点在活性位点密度方面具有显著优势。更高的活性位点密度可以带来更好的催化性能。

这些二维活性位点的独特结构特征在ODHP反应领域引起了广泛的研究兴趣。这可能是由于它们在提高催化活性、改善选择性和整体性能方面相比传统的线性分散边缘位点催化剂具有潜力。
