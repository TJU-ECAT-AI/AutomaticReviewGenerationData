2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed by doping boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials. Additionally, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also serve as 2-D dispersed active sites. These 2-D active sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be substantially improved. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their higher density and improved catalytic performance, have attracted considerable research interest in the field of ODHP reactions.
