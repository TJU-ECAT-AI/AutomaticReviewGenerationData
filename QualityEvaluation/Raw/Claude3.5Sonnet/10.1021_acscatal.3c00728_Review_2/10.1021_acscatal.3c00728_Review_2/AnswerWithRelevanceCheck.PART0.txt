          [1] "The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction."

          [2] "Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved."

          [3] "Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features."

          2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through two main methods: 1) doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and 2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials. These 2-D dispersed active sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be substantially improved. This increased density of active sites can potentially lead to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and distribution across surfaces, have attracted considerable research interest in the field of ODHP reactions. Researchers are drawn to these materials due to their potential for higher catalytic activity and efficiency compared to traditional linearly dispersed edge sites.

          在ODHP反应中，硼基催化剂的二维分散活性位点主要通过两种方法开发：1）将活性硼氧化物或硼羟基单元掺杂到各种载体材料的表面上，2）利用体相硼化物材料的暴露表面。与线性分散的边缘位点相比，这些二维分散活性位点在活性位点密度方面具有显著优势，可以大幅提高。活性位点密度的增加可能会导致催化性能的提升。这些二维活性位点的独特结构特征，包括其改进的密度和在表面上的分布，已经在ODHP反应领域引起了相当大的研究兴趣。研究人员被这些材料所吸引，是因为它们相比传统的线性分散边缘位点，具有更高的催化活性和效率潜力。
