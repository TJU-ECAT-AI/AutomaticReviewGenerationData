2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP are developed through two main methods: 1) doping active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of various hosting materials, and 2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials. These 2-D dispersed active sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be substantially improved. This increased density of active sites can lead to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and potential for better catalytic activity, have attracted extensive research interest in the field of ODHP reactions.

在ODHP反应中，硼基催化剂的二维分散活性位点主要通过两种方法开发：1）将活性硼氧化物/硼羟基单元掺杂到各种宿主材料的表面上，2）利用体相硼化物材料的暴露表面。与线性分散的边缘位点相比，这些二维分散活性位点在活性位点密度方面具有显著优势，可以大大提高。活性位点密度的增加可以导致催化性能的提升。这些二维活性位点的独特结构特征，包括其改进的密度和潜在的更好催化活性，已经在ODHP反应领域引起了广泛的研究兴趣。
