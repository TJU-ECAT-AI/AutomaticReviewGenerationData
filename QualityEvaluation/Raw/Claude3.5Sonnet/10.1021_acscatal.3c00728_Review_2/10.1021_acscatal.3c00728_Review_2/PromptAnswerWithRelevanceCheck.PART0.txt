[1] "The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction."

[2] "Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved."

[3] "Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through two main methods: 1) by doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and 2) by utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials. These 2-D dispersed active sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be substantially improved. This increased density of active sites can potentially lead to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and distribution across surfaces, have attracted considerable research interest in the field of ODHP reactions. Researchers are drawn to these materials due to their potential for higher catalytic activity and efficiency compared to traditional linearly dispersed edge sites.
