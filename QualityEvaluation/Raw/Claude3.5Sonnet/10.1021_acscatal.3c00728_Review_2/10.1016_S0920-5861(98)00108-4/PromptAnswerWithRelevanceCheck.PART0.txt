<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information about 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. The document discusses various catalysts for propane oxidation, including V2O5-based, rare-earth oxide-based, and B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, but does not mention 2-D dispersed active sites or their specific advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites. The document also does not discuss active site density or why these structural features have attracted research interest in the field. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.
