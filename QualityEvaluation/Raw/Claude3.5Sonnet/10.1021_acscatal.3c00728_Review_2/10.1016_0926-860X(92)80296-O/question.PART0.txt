I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Influence of boria loading on the acidity of B2O3/Al2O3 catalysts for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam
Abstract
Boron oxide catalysts supported on alumina have been prepared with boria loadings in the range 020 wt.-%. These materials were characterized by B.E.T. surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction and temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and were used as catalysts for the Beckmann rearrangement of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam by passing the oxime vapour through a reactor containing the catalysts at 300C. The surface areas of the samples decreased as the boria loading was increased, and all catalysts tested for the rearrangement reaction diminished in activity with time-onstream. There was a direct relationship between the amount of coke which formed on the surface and the loss in catalytic activity. This loss was least for the highest boron oxide loading tested, and this catalyst also featured the least amount of coke formation. Selectivity to caprolactam was associated with the presence of surface acidic sites of intermediate strength. A correlation was observed between the concentration of these surface sites and the selectivity to caprolactam.

How are 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts developed for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, what specific advantages do they offer over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density and catalytic performance, and why have these unique structural features attracted significant research interest in the field?

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
