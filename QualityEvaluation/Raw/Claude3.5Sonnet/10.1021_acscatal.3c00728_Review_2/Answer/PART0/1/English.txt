2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction are developed through two main methods: 1) doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and 2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials. These 2-D dispersed active sites offer a significant advantage over linearly dispersed edge sites in terms of active site density, which can be substantially improved. This increased density of active sites can potentially lead to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and distribution across surfaces, have attracted considerable research interest in the field of ODHP reactions. Researchers are drawn to these materials due to their potential for higher catalytic activity and efficiency compared to traditional linearly dispersed edge sites.

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it challenges previous assumptions about edge sites being the active sites for boron nitride catalysts. The study suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction, rather than relying on edge sites.

The research interest appears to stem from the discovery that many boron-containing compounds, not just boron nitride, can catalyze ODHP with high selectivity to olefins. This suggests a common mechanism involving BOx active sites across different boron-based materials, regardless of their bulk structure.

The literature mentions that crystal structure may influence the formation of BOx species, with layered borides potentially presenting different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides. This could affect active site density, but specific advantages in terms of catalytic performance are not detailed in the given text.

While the document doesn't directly address 2-D dispersed active sites or their advantages, it presents a shift in understanding from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites in boron-based ODHP catalysts. This new understanding, along with the discovery that various boron-containing materials can catalyze ODHP, has likely sparked further research interest in this area, opening up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The provided literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, the research focuses on developing active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts through various plasma treatments, particularly using N2 plasma.

The study demonstrates that h-BN can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation, overcoming limitations of traditional metal oxide catalysts. However, commercial h-BN has limited active sites due to its high crystallinity, necessitating methods to increase their density and improve catalytic performance.

Plasma treatment, especially with N2, creates three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species. These defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C).

The research shows a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC N-defects), suggesting that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites. This implies that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance.

While not explicitly creating 2-D dispersed active sites, this approach demonstrates a method to increase the density of active sites on the h-BN surface, thereby improving catalytic performance. The unique structural features of h-BN and the ability to modify its surface through plasma treatment have attracted significant research interest in the field of ODHP catalysis.
