[1] "The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction."

          [2] "Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved."

          [3] "Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features."

[1] "We recently reported that boron nitride (BN) materials, both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), catalyzed the ODH of propane (ODHP),7 n-butane, and isobutane8 to form the corresponding olefins selectively."

[2] "This observation disproves previous mechanistic hypotheses that edge sites on the boron nitride would be the active sites and rather suggests the formation of an analogous surface-stabilized BOx active site for all tested boride catalysts."

[3] "The results suggested an active and selective BOx site was formed under the ODHP reaction conditions and was responsible for the selective reaction pathway to form olefins."

[4] "Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) could present different boron surface concentrations than tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), which would thus affect the formation of BOx species during ODH."

[5] "To elucidate further the role of boron as the element responsible for the ODH activity and to decouple the influence of the non-boron constituent element within the tested materials, the catalytic activity of elemental boron was also evaluated."

[1] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[2] "With the investigation of various boron-containing catalysts in different alkane atmospheres, it has been generally accepted that the oxygen-containing boron species on the surface of the catalyst is the catalytic origin of the ODH reaction."

[3] "At present, since the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited amount of active sites, it is necessary to effectively improve the reaction performance of this material to boost industrialization."

[4] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[5] "High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

[6] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[7] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[8] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[9] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."
