The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique structural features and potential advantages over traditional linearly dispersed edge sites. These 2-D active sites can be created through two primary methods: (1) doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and (2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2].

One of the key advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites is the substantial improvement in active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2]. This increased density of active sites can potentially lead to enhanced catalytic performance, making these materials particularly attractive for ODHP reactions.

Recent studies have challenged previous assumptions about the role of edge sites in boron-based catalysts. Instead of edge sites being the primary active sites, research now suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This shift in understanding has opened up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The crystal structure of boron-containing materials has been found to influence the formation of BOx species. Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) may present different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), potentially affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This structural diversity offers opportunities for tailoring catalysts with optimized active site densities and distributions.

In the case of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which has shown promising results in selectively oxidizing propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation, the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited number of active sites [10.1002/anie.202106713]. To address this limitation and improve catalytic performance, researchers have explored various surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment.

Plasma treatment, particularly with N2, has been shown to create three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species [10.1002/anie.202106713]. These defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C) [10.1002/anie.202106713].

The research has demonstrated a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of TBC N-defects, suggesting that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites [10.1002/anie.202106713]. This finding implies that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance, aligning with the advantages observed in 2-D dispersed active sites.

※※※

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP reactions represents a significant advancement in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The shift from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites has opened up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. Future research efforts may focus on:

1. Exploring novel methods to create and control the density of 2-D dispersed active sites on various boron-containing materials.
2. Investigating the synergistic effects between the boron active sites and different hosting materials to further enhance catalytic performance.
3. Developing in-situ characterization techniques to better understand the formation and evolution of BOx species under reaction conditions.
4. Optimizing plasma treatment parameters and exploring other surface modification techniques to create tailored defect structures in boron-based catalysts.
5. Scaling up the production of high-performance boron-based catalysts with 2-D dispersed active sites for potential industrial applications in ODHP processes.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially revolutionizing the production of valuable olefins from alkanes.

By moving beyond the traditional focus on edge sites and exploring surface-wide active sites, researchers have opened up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. The ability to create higher densities of active sites through techniques such as doping and surface modification offers the potential for substantial improvements in catalytic performance.

Future research in this area may focus on further optimizing the density and distribution of 2-D dispersed active sites, perhaps through the development of novel hosting materials or advanced surface modification techniques.

The positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of TBC N-defects suggests that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites, implying that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance.

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP reactions represents a significant advancement in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The ability to create high-density active sites across surfaces, rather than relying solely on edge sites, opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. Future research efforts may focus on:

1. Developing novel methods for creating and controlling the distribution of 2-D dispersed active sites on various boron-based materials.
2. Investigating the synergistic effects between the boron active sites and the hosting materials to further enhance catalytic performance.
3. Exploring the potential of 2-D dispersed active sites in other catalytic reactions beyond ODHP, such as other dehydrogenation or oxidation reactions.
4. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the nature and behavior of these active sites under reaction conditions.
5. Developing structure-activity relationships to guide the rational design of next-generation boron-based catalysts with optimized 2-D dispersed active sites.

These research directions could lead to the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and related reactions, potentially revolutionizing the production of valuable chemical intermediates in the petrochemical industry.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique structural features and potential for enhanced catalytic performance. These active sites can be developed through two primary methods: (1) doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and (2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2]. This approach offers several advantages over traditional linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of active site density.

One of the key advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites is the significant improvement in active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2]. This increased density of active sites can potentially lead to enhanced catalytic performance, making these materials particularly attractive for ODHP reactions. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and distribution across surfaces, have attracted considerable research interest in the field [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2].

Recent studies have challenged previous assumptions about edge sites being the primary active sites for boron nitride catalysts in ODHP reactions. Instead, research suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This discovery has led to a paradigm shift in understanding the catalytic mechanism, moving from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites in boron-based ODHP catalysts.

The crystal structure of boron-containing materials has been found to influence the formation of BOx species. Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) may present different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), potentially affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This observation opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

In the case of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which has shown promising results in selectively oxidizing propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation, the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited number of active sites [10.1002/anie.202106713]. To address this limitation and improve catalytic performance, researchers have explored various surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment.

Plasma treatment, particularly with N2, has been shown to create three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species [10.1002/anie.202106713]. These defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C) [10.1002/anie.202106713]. The positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of TBC N-defects suggests that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites, implying that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance.

2. Investigating the influence of different crystal structures and surface modifications on the formation and stability of BOx species.
3. Exploring the potential of hybrid materials that combine the advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites with other catalytic components to further enhance performance.
4. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the formation mechanism and nature of BOx active sites under reaction conditions.
5. Scaling up the production of optimized boron-based catalysts with 2-D dispersed active sites for industrial applications in ODHP and related reactions.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially revolutionizing the production of valuable olefins from alkanes.
