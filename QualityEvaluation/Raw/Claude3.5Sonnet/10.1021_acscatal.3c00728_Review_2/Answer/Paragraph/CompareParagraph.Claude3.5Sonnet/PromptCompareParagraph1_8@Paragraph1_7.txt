The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has emerged as a promising approach to enhance catalytic performance. These active sites can be developed through two primary methods: (1) doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and (2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_2]. This approach offers significant advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of active site density, which can be substantially improved [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_2].

The increased density of active sites in 2-D dispersed configurations potentially leads to enhanced catalytic performance. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and distribution across surfaces, have attracted considerable research interest in the field of ODHP reactions [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_2].

Recent studies have challenged previous assumptions about edge sites being the primary active sites for boron nitride catalysts. Instead, research suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This shift in understanding from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites has opened up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The crystal structure of boron-based materials may influence the formation of BOx species, with layered borides potentially presenting different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This structural difference could affect active site density and, consequently, catalytic performance.

In parallel research, efforts have been made to increase the density of active sites on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) surfaces through plasma treatment, particularly using N2 plasma [10.1002/anie.202106713]. This approach creates three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species. These defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520Â°C) [10.1002/anie.202106713].

The research shows a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of TBC N-defects, suggesting that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites [10.1002/anie.202106713]. This implies that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance, aligning with the concept of 2-D dispersed active sites.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP reactions represents a significant advancement in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The shift from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide active sites opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. Future research efforts may focus on:

1. Developing novel methods to create and control the density of 2-D dispersed active sites on various boron-based materials.
2. Investigating the synergistic effects between the boron active sites and the hosting materials to further enhance catalytic performance.
3. Exploring the potential of combining plasma treatment techniques with 2-D dispersed active site development to create highly efficient ODHP catalysts.
4. Conducting in-depth mechanistic studies to better understand the formation and behavior of BOx species under reaction conditions, which could lead to more rational catalyst design.
5. Extending the concept of 2-D dispersed active sites to other catalytic systems beyond ODHP, potentially revolutionizing various industrial processes.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP and other related reactions, ultimately contributing to more sustainable chemical production processes.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique structural features and potential for enhanced catalytic performance. These active sites can be developed through two primary methods: (1) doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and (2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_2]. This approach offers several advantages over traditional linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of active site density.

One of the key advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites is the significant improvement in active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_2]. This increased density of active sites can potentially lead to enhanced catalytic performance, making these materials particularly attractive for ODHP reactions. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and distribution across surfaces, have attracted considerable research interest in the field [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728\_2].

Recent studies have challenged previous assumptions about edge sites being the primary active sites for boron nitride catalysts in ODHP reactions. Instead, research suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This discovery has led to a paradigm shift in understanding the catalytic mechanism, moving from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites in boron-based ODHP catalysts.

The crystal structure of boron-containing materials has been found to influence the formation of BOx species. Layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) may present different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B), potentially affecting the formation of BOx species during ODH [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This observation opens up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

In the case of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which has shown promising results in selectively oxidizing propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation, the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited number of active sites [10.1002/anie.202106713]. To address this limitation and improve catalytic performance, researchers have explored various surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment.

Plasma treatment, particularly with N2, has been shown to create three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species [10.1002/anie.202106713]. These defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520Â°C) [10.1002/anie.202106713]. The positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of TBC N-defects suggests that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites, implying that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP reactions represents a significant advancement in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The shift from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites opens up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. Future research efforts may focus on:

1. Developing novel methods to create and control the density of 2-D dispersed active sites on various boron-containing materials.
2. Investigating the influence of different crystal structures and surface modifications on the formation and stability of BOx species.
3. Exploring the potential of hybrid materials that combine the advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites with other catalytic components to further enhance performance.
4. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques to gain deeper insights into the formation mechanism and nature of BOx active sites under reaction conditions.
5. Scaling up the production of optimized boron-based catalysts with 2-D dispersed active sites for industrial applications in ODHP and related reactions.

These research directions could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for ODHP reactions, potentially revolutionizing the production of valuable olefins from alkanes.
