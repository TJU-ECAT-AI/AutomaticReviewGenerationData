The given literature does not contain information specific to 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on boron nitride (BN) nanosheets for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. It does not discuss 2-D dispersed active sites or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Therefore, this question cannot be directly answered based on the provided text.

The given literature does not contain any information about 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on boron nitride (BN) catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, not propane. It does not discuss 2-D dispersed active sites or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. The literature primarily explores the mechanism of ethane activation and oxygen involvement in the reaction over BN catalysts, but does not address the specific structural features or advantages mentioned in the question.

[1] "Very recently, the advent of boron nitride for the selective ODH of propane confirmed the exciting opportunity of BN catalysts for controllable aliphatic CH activation; the arm-chair BN edge was proposed to activate O2 onsite to form a B-O-O-N intermediate on the basis of calculations, and thereby the rupture of the nonterminal CH of propane ensued."

[2] "A follow-up study noted that on the basis of spectroscopic evidence, the BOH group in boron nitride was responsible for hydrogen abstraction of propane to propene and that this group simultaneously prevented overoxidation to CO2."

[3] "Herein, we prepared a high-surface-area BN nanosheet (s-BN) for the ODH of ethane, an alkane with only terminal CH bonds, to study the selectivity for ethylene."

[4] "Consequently, the majority of the surface was inactive, which implied the active sites were likely located at the edges of the BN catalysts."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. Instead, it focuses on boron nitride (BN) catalysts, particularly BN nanosheets, for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane. 

The document mentions that active sites in BN catalysts are likely located at the edges of the material, rather than being 2-D dispersed across the surface. It discusses the formation of BO(H) active sites at the edges of BN through the aid of ethane, which then facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction.

The research interest in these catalysts stems from their ability to achieve high selectivity for olefin production without CO2 emission, unlike conventional metal-based catalysts. The BN catalysts show excellent performance in ethane ODH, with the potential for 100% selectivity to ethylene at certain conversion levels.

While the document doesn't directly compare 2-D dispersed sites to linearly dispersed edge sites, it does highlight the advantages of BN catalysts in terms of selectivity and stability for ODH reactions. However, it doesn't provide information on active site density or specific advantages of 2-D dispersed sites over edge sites.

这篇文献并没有具体讨论用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点。相反，它主要关注硼氮(BN)催化剂，特别是BN纳米片，用于乙烷的氧化脱氢(ODH)反应。

文档提到，BN催化剂中的活性位点可能位于材料的边缘，而不是二维分散在表面上。它讨论了在乙烷的帮助下在BN边缘形成BO(H)活性位点，这些位点随后促进脱氢反应。

对这些催化剂的研究兴趣源于它们能够在烯烃生产中实现高选择性，且不产生CO2排放，这与传统的金属基催化剂不同。BN催化剂在乙烷ODH中表现出优异的性能，在某些转化水平下有潜力实现100%的乙烯选择性。

虽然文档没有直接比较二维分散位点和线性分散的边缘位点，但它确实强调了BN催化剂在ODH反应的选择性和稳定性方面的优势。然而，它没有提供有关活性位点密度或二维分散位点相对于边缘位点的具体优势的信息。
