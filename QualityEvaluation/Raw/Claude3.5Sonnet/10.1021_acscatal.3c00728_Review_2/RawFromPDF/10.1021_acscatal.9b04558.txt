Abstract
Because of the structural complexity and inhomogeneity, the effect of the coordination environment on the catalytic properties is underexplored in heterogeneous catalytic systems. To address this challenge, the atomically dispersed Pt is anchored on two Mo-based supports with similar morphology and particle size, that is, face-centered cubic-structured α-MoC and MoN. Spectroscopic and computational investigations demonstrate that the Pt atoms are coordinated with N atoms in Pt/MoN but with Mo atoms in Pt/α-MoC, leading to an entirely different catalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The Pt mass activity for Pt/MoN reaches 0.71 A/mgPt at 0.9 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], which is 15 times higher Pt mass activity than that of Pt/α-MoC. Density functional theory calculations correlate the better ORR performance of Pt/MoN with the weaker adsorption of OH* because of the modulation of electronic properties of Pt by the coordination with N atoms. This study highlights the importance of controlling the coordination environment of metal atoms in heterogeneous (electro)catalysis and suggests that tuning the coordination environment could be an effective strategy in catalyst development.

Impact Of Coordination Environment
Support Effect
1. Introduction
Coordination environment of the metal center is an integral component of the active site and could play a decisive role in determining the activity and selectivity in catalysis. (1,2) The effect of ligands on the catalytic properties of metal centers has been investigated with great detail in organometallic community. (3−5) Meanwhile, the structural complexity and inhomogeneity of the bonding of metal species on the support pose challenges to understand the effect of local coordination environment on the catalytic performance. For example, the different shape and size of the supported metal nanoparticles make the unequivocal attribution of the difference in reactivities to the effect of local coordination difficult. (6) In this regard, atomically dispersed metal atoms on supports offer an effective approach to reduce the complexity of solid catalysts because isolated single-metal atom centers have been demonstrated to have uniform coordination environment. (7−16) Another challenge in isolating the impact of local coordination with the support on the catalytic properties of the metal center is the multitude of possible roles the support could play, and thus, it is important to control the structure of supports to allow fair comparisons. (17−20)
Transition-metal carbides (TMCs) and transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are intermetallic compounds consisting of carbon or nitrogen atoms incorporating into the metal lattice. (21−23) It is reported that TMCs and TMNs interact strongly with surface metal species and therefore are excellent supports for the synthesis of atomically dispersed catalysts. (24,25) In our previous work, we found that the face-centered cubic (fcc)-structured α-MoC is effective in anchoring atomically dispersed Pt, (26) as well as Au (27) clusters, with remarkable catalytic performance toward water/methanol reforming and the water gas shift reaction, respectively. The typical synthesis procedure of α-MoC involves the fcc-structured MoN as an intermediate, and these two compounds have similar morphology, size, and crystalline phase. (28) Thus, α-MoC and MoN can be used as supports to understand the impact of bonding of atomically dispersed metal species on their catalytic properties. Herein, we fabricated two catalysts with atomically dispersed Pt on α-MoC and MoN (referred to as Pt/α-MoC and Pt/MoN, respectively) with Pt coordinated to Mo and N, respectively. The markedly different activity and stability of these two catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are attributed to the distinct coordination environments of Pt. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the binding strength between oxygen species and catalyst surface could be effectively modulated by coordination environment, leading to distinct ORR performance.
2. Results and Discussion
The fcc-structured MoN was synthesized via a temperature-programmed nitridation of MoO3 in the flow of NH3 at 785 °C. The atomically dispersed Pt was then introduced to MoN by the wet-impregnation method, followed by activation in NH3 at 590 °C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 1A) patterns of MoN and Pt/MoN match well with those of fcc molybdenum nitride. The absence of Pt peaks for Pt/MoN indicates that the size of Pt species is below the detection limit of XRD. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Pt/MoN shows that the MoN particles (Figure S1) are 0.5–3 μm in size. The high-resolution (HR)-TEM (Figure 1B) image reveals that MoN nanoparticles (3–20 nm) agglomerate into micrometer-sized particles. The similarity between the Pt/MoN and the bare MoN (Figures S2 and S3) suggests that the introduction of Pt does not significantly alter the structure of the support. The aberration-corrected scanning TEM (STEM) Z-contrast image of Pt/MoN (Figure 1C) shows that Pt is atomically dispersed on MoN, while the Pt nanoparticle is not observed. The atomically dispersed Pt nanoparticles supported on α-MoC were synthesized and characterized (Figures 1D and S4) following similar protocols. (26) It can be found from the N2 physisorption experiment that Pt/MoN and Pt/α-MoC catalysts possess similar BET surface areas and porosity distributions (Figure S5). Moreover, the Pt loadings of both samples were controlled around 0.20% (wt %, Table S1).

The coordination environment of Pt in these two atomically dispersed catalysts was characterized in detail. X-ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra of Pt/MoN (Figure 2A) show that the near-edge absorption energy of the supported Pt species is located between that of Pt foil and PtO2, implying that the Pt species are positively charged. Similarly, the Pt species on Pt/α-MoC are also found to be cationic in nature, but with a lower oxidation state than Pt/MoN. Moreover, there are significant differences in the Pt L3-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the two catalysts (Figure 2B). No detectable Pt–Pt coordination was observed in Pt/α-MoC or Pt/MoN, confirming the full atomic dispersion of Pt, which was consistent with the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)–STEM observations. For Pt/MoN, the only peak located at 1.7 Å is associated with the Pt–N scattering, while the peak at 2.8 Å for Pt/α-MoC is assigned to the Pt–Mo scattering. (26) To quantitatively determine the structural parameters of Pt in both catalysts, the main peaks in the R-space were fitted via Fourier transform (Figures S6 and S7 and Table S2). For Pt/MoN, the coordination number of Pt–N is about 4.8 with an average bond length of 2.04 Å. For Pt/α-MoC, the coordination number and the bond length of Pt–Mo are about 6.4 and 2.82 Å, respectively. The effectiveness of the EXAFS fittings has been verified with the wavelet transformation (WT) of the EXAF spectra (Figures 2C,D and S8). The combination of results from STEM, XANES, and EXAFS provide strong evidence supporting that Pt is atomically dispersed on both MoN and α-MoC but in distinct coordination environments.

(C) WT analysis of Pt/MoN and (D) Pt/α-MoC. Although Pt is atomically dispersed on both MoN and α-MoC, the coordination atoms are different.
The ORR activities of Pt/MoN, Pt/α-MoC, and supports (MoN and α-MoC) were evaluated in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH with the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method. For comparison, the curve for the commercial Pt/C catalyst was also included. As can be seen from the result of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, Figure 3A), MoN and α-MoC exhibit similar ORR activity, which is significantly enhanced after the introduction of atomically dispersed Pt. The specific activity and limiting current density (jL) of Pt/MoN are comparable to that of commercial Pt/C, while the mass activity at 0.9 V [vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] of Pt/MoN reaches 0.71 A/mgPt (Figure 3B), which is 15 times higher than that of Pt/α-MoC. We can reasonably attribute the difference in activities to their surface coordination environments as the two kinds of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts possess identical crystal structures, morphologies, microstructure, and loadings of noble metal. Moreover, the mass activity of Pt/MoN is better than most of the reported Pt-based ORR electrocatalysts evaluated in the alkaline condition (Table S3). (14,29−38) LSV measurements of Pt/MoN electrocatalysts were performed at different rotation rates (Figure 3C), and corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots were shown in the inset. The value of electron-transfer number (n) was calculated to be 3.8 for Pt/MoN. In addition, the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technology also indicates that both Pt/MoN and Pt/α-MoC catalyze ORR in a four-electron pathway (Figures S9 and S10). The yield of H2O2, which is the product of two-pathway ORR, is calculated below 10% for both atomically dispersed Pt catalysts. Interestingly, it has been reported that Cl (24) or S (39) coordinated Pt atomically dispersed catalyst-reduced O2 in a two-electron pathway, in which the selectivity toward H2O2 reaches over 90%. These results indicate that the coordination environment of atomically dispersed catalyst could not only influence on the catalytic activity but also the reaction pathway of ORR.

(C) ORR polarization curves of Pt/MoN at different rotating rates and K–L plots (inset). (D) ORR polarization curves of Pt/MoN and commercial Pt/C catalysts before and after 3000 potential cycles. With different coordination environments, Pt/MoN exhibits better ORR activity and stability than that of Pt/α-MoC.
Long-term durability is a key figure of merit for ORR catalysts, and Pt/MoN is superior to commercial Pt/C and Pt/α-MoC. For a typical accelerated degradation test, the working electrode was swept between 0.6 and 1.1 V at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. There was little change in half-wave potential (ca. 21 mV) for Pt/MoN (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the i–t curve further shows the remarkable long-term durability of Pt/MoN, which retains more than 80% of current density after a 30 000 s test, as compared with 60 and 50% retention of the initial current density on commercial Pt/C catalyst and Pt/α-MoC, respectively (Figure S11). STEM images before and after stability test show that the commercial Pt/C catalyst suffers from the agglomeration of the Pt species (Figures S12 and S13). For Pt/MoN catalyst, strong metal–support interaction as well as relatively low Pt content effectively prevents the Pt species from serious agglomeration (Figures S14 and S15), which is responsible for the outstanding ORR stability.
DFT calculations were employed to gain further insights into the coordination environment and ORR performance of Pt-based atomically dispersed catalysts. We adopt the N-terminated MoN(111) and Mo-terminated α-MoC(111) to represent MoN and α-MoC catalysts, respectively. As for the Pt atoms on MoX (X = N or C), the adatom model allows solo Pt–N and Pt–Mo coordination for Pt/MoN and Pt/α-MoC (Figure 4A), respectively, which is consistent with the EXAFS results. To understand the ORR activity difference on these two models, the free energetics of four-electron ORR mechanism under alkaline medium were explored (Figure 4B). The ideal catalyst for the ORR needs to activate molecular oxygen, while at the same time, binding oxygen species such as O, OH weakly. (40,41) Excluding the potential effect (the solid lines), on the Pt/MoN surface, the first three steps were exothermal processes, and the last step (OH* → OH– + *) is slightly endothermal (0.25 eV). At U = 1.0 V versus RHE (dashed lines), the removal of the last OH* only needs an energy input of 0.48 eV on the Pt/MoN surface, indicating that the ORR on Pt/MoN is thermodynamically facile at room temperature. For Pt/α-MoC, the first three steps are downhilled, while the last step is obviously endothermal with endothermic energy of 0.75 eV, which is larger than that on Pt/MoN of 0.25 eV. Therefore, Pt/MoN is calculated to possess better ORR catalytic activity than Pt/α-MoC because of the weaker adsorption of OH*. As can be seen from the XAFS result, more electrons are transferred from Pt to MoN via Pt–N bond than those from Pt to α-MoC via Pt–Mo bond, leading to the lower occupied d-band and higher oxidation state of Pt single-atoms on Pt/MoN, consistent with the d-band center calculations (Figure S16). The lower occupied Pt d-band in the case of Pt/MoN will allow for low efficient hybridization to form bonds to the adsorbate (OH*), and the weak interaction between the intermediates and Pt/MoN finally results in excellent ORR activity. (42)

It is recognized that the interaction between the atomically dispersed species and the surface atoms of the support, that is, the coordination environment, has a profound impact on the catalytic performance. (43) To further understand the Pt–N coordination environment on Pt/MoN, it is critical to determine the surface composition of the MoN support. Synchrotron radiation photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES) was employed to investigate MoN at photon energies of 1253 and 600 eV, which could probe the bulk and the surface of MoN, respectively. (44) As can be seen from the Mo 3d spectra (Figure 5A), nitridic Mo resolved at 229.0 eV is the dominant Mo component on the surface of MoN. The binding energies of N 1s and Mo 3p species partially overlap in the region of 390–400 eV. The peaks at 396.8 and 394.7 eV are assigned to nitridic N and Mo, respectively (Figure 5B). (45) Compared with the spectrum for bulk phase at a higher photon energy (1253 eV), the intensity of the shoulder corresponding to Mo species is much weaker in the more surface-sensitive spectrum at a lower photon energy of 600 eV, indicating that the N element is enriched on the surface of MoN. Therefore, the Pt atoms on MoN are more likely coordinated with N atoms rather than Mo atoms, as a result of the surface composition of MoN.

The different surface composition can endow different coordination environment and further electronic properties of the single-metal atom centers, finally leading to very different ORR catalytic activities of the atomically dispersed catalysts. To investigate the generality of the coordination environment effect in ORR, we prepared non-noble metal/MoN catalysts and studied their catalytic performance. Co/MoN exhibits higher activity and durability than Fe/MoN, Ni/MoN, and Co/α-MoC (Figures S17 and S18). TEM and EXAFS reveal that Co is atomically dispersed on the surface of MoN and coordinates with N atoms (Figures S19 and S20). For Co/MoN, the Co–N coordination leads to the positively charged Coδ+ species (Figure S21) serving as a catalytically active center for ORR. The relatively high metal loading of atomically dispersed Co species (ca. 1%, wt %) leads to its comparable ORR performance with commercial Pt/C and Pt/MoN (0.25%, wt %). Hence, based on our results, the catalytic performance of atomically dispersed catalyst could be optimized by fine-tuning the coordination environment of metal atom.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized atomically dispersed Pt/MoN and Pt/α-MoC with distinct coordination environments of Pt. Pt/MoN exhibits 15 times higher mass activity and better stability in catalyzing the ORR than Pt/α-MoC, which is attributed to the distinct bonding configuration between Pt and the support. Spectroscopic investigations indicated that Pt atoms were coordinated with N and Mo atoms on Pt/MoN and Pt/α-MoC, respectively. Compared with the Mo atoms, the coordination of Pt with N atoms in Pt/MoN can lead to the downshift Pt d-band, which can weaken the binding energy of OH* and exhibit better catalytic performance toward ORR via the DFT calculations. In this study, we not only synthesize well-defined atomically dispersed catalysts with outstanding ORR activity but also clarify the relationship between catalytic performance and coordination environment of atomically dispersed catalysts.
