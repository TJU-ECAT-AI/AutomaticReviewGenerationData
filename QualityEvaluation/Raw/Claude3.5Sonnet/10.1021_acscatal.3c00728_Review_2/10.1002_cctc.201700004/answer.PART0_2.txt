The given literature does not contain any information about 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction. The document focuses on edge-hydroxylated boron nitride catalysts with linearly dispersed edge sites, rather than 2-D dispersed active sites. It does not make comparisons between 2-D and linearly dispersed sites in terms of active site density or catalytic performance. The literature also does not discuss why these structural features have attracted research interest in the field. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided document.

给定的文献中没有关于硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点的信息。该文档主要关注具有线性分散边缘位点的边缘羟基化氮化硼催化剂，而不是二维分散活性位点。它没有比较二维和线性分散位点在活性位点密度或催化性能方面的差异。该文献也没有讨论为什么这些结构特征在该领域引起了研究兴趣。因此，基于所提供的文档无法回答这个问题。
