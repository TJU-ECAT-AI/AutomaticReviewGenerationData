The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has gained significant attention in recent years due to their superior performance and unique structural features. These catalysts are typically synthesized using methods such as chemical vapor deposition, wet impregnation, or in-situ growth techniques, allowing for a more uniform distribution of active sites across the catalyst surface. Compared to linearly dispersed edge sites, 2-D dispersed active sites offer a notably higher density of catalytic centers, leading to improved reaction efficiency and propene yield. The unique structural characteristics of these 2-D sites, including their increased exposure and accessibility, contribute to enhanced catalyst stability and selectivity. Furthermore, the ability to fine-tune the electronic properties of these sites through careful control of the boron-substrate interactions has sparked increased research interest in this field. As a result, 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts are emerging as a promising approach for optimizing ODHP reactions, potentially paving the way for more sustainable and economical propene production processes.
