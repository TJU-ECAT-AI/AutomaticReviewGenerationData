The given literature does not contain any information specifically addressing 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP, their advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, or why these structural features have attracted research interest. The document focuses on other aspects of boron-containing catalysts for alkane oxidation, such as reaction kinetics, active site generation, and catalyst stability. It does not discuss 2-D dispersed active sites or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites.
