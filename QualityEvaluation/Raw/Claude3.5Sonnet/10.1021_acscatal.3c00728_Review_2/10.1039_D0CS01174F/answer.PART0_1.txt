[1] "The endeavors aiming at rational design and improvement of boron-based catalytic systems have been devoted to increasing the surface area and the exposure of oxygenated boron active sites."

[2] "For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

[3] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it mentions efforts to increase surface area and exposure of active sites through methods like edge-hydroxylation, synthesis with specific precursors, and creating 3D architectures from 2D nanosheets. These approaches aim to enhance catalytic activity by increasing the number of accessible active sites, but do not explicitly address 2-D dispersion or its advantages over linear edge sites. The research interest appears to be focused on general strategies to optimize boron-based catalysts rather than on specific structural features like 2-D dispersed sites.

文献中并未具体讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点,也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反,文献提到了通过边缘羟基化、使用特定前体合成以及将二维纳米片组装成三维结构等方法来增加表面积和活性位点暴露的努力。这些方法旨在通过增加可接触的活性位点数量来提高催化活性,但并未明确提及二维分散或其相对于线性边缘位点的优势。研究兴趣似乎集中在优化硼基催化剂的一般策略上,而不是像二维分散位点这样的特定结构特征上。
