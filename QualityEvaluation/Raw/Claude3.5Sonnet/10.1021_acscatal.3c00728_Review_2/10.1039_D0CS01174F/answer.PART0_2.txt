[1] "In recent years, the emerging metal-free boron-based catalysts represent promising alternatives for the industrialization of the ODH of light alkanes with superior selectivity toward light olefins and atom economy for valuable carbon-based products by minimizing CO2 emission, and knowledge on both fundamental and application issues is growing."

[2] "For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

[3] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it mentions various strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of boron-based materials, including edge-hydroxylation, synthesis methods, and assembly of 2D nanosheets into 3D structures. These approaches aim to increase surface area and exposure of active sites, but do not explicitly address 2-D dispersed sites or their advantages over linear edge sites. The research interest in boron-based catalysts stems from their promising performance in ODH reactions, showing high selectivity towards light olefins and minimizing CO2 emissions. However, the specific structural features asked about in the question are not directly addressed in the given literature.

文献中并没有具体讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点,也没有将它们与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反,文献提到了几种提高硼基材料催化活性的策略,包括边缘羟基化、合成方法和将二维纳米片组装成三维结构。这些方法旨在增加表面积和活性位点的暴露,但并未明确讨论二维分散位点或其相对于线性边缘位点的优势。对硼基催化剂的研究兴趣主要源于它们在ODH反应中表现出的良好性能,对轻烯烃具有高选择性并最大限度地减少CO2排放。然而,问题中提到的具体结构特征在给定的文献中并未直接涉及。
