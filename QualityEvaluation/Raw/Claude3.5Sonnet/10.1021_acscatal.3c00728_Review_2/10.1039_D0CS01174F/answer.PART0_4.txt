[1] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it mentions strategies to increase surface area and exposure of active sites, such as edge-hydroxylation, synthesis methods, and 3D assembly of 2D nanosheets. These approaches aim to enhance catalytic activity by increasing the number of accessible active sites, but do not explicitly address 2-D dispersion or its advantages over linear edge sites. The research interest appears to be focused on maximizing the exposure of active oxygenated boron species rather than on specific 2-D dispersed structures.

文献中并未具体讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP的二维分散活性位点,也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反,它提到了一些增加表面积和暴露活性位点的策略,如边缘羟基化、合成方法和二维纳米片的三维组装。这些方法旨在通过增加可接触的活性位点数量来提高催化活性,但并未明确提及二维分散或其相对于线性边缘位点的优势。研究兴趣似乎集中在最大化暴露含氧硼活性物种上,而不是特定的二维分散结构。
