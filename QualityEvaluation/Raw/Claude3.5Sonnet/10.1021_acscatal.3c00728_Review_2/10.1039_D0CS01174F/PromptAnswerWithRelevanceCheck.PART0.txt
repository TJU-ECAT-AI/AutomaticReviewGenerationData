[1] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "These studies will disclose the key issues regarding the reaction mechanism, e.g. the knowledge on the geometric and electronic characters of boron sites, the transformations of the BO and BOH groups, and the roles of the adjacent structure of oxygen-containing boron sites in the alkane ODH reactions, based on which the structureactivity relationship of the boron-based catalysts in the ODH of light alkanes may be established."

[3] "Previous studies have revealed that hydroxylated boron sites on boron nitride edges are decisive for the specific catalytic activity in the ODH reaction. It is beneficial for making use of this finding to improve the activity of catalysts by means of maximization of the presence of OH-containing boron sites."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. The document mainly focuses on increasing surface area and exposure of oxygenated boron active sites through various strategies like edge-hydroxylation, synthesis methods, and 3D ordered architectures. It mentions that hydroxylated boron sites on edges are important for catalytic activity, but does not directly address 2-D dispersed sites or their advantages over linear edge sites. The research interest appears to be more broadly on understanding and optimizing the geometric and electronic properties of boron sites, rather than specifically on 2-D vs linear dispersion.

文献中没有具体讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点,也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。该文档主要集中于通过各种策略增加表面积和暴露含氧硼活性位点,如边缘羟基化、合成方法和三维有序结构。文中提到边缘上的羟基化硼位点对催化活性很重要,但并未直接讨论二维分散位点或其相对于线性边缘位点的优势。研究兴趣似乎更广泛地集中在理解和优化硼位点的几何和电子性质上,而不是专门针对二维与线性分散的比较。

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it mentions efforts to increase surface area and exposure of active sites through methods like edge-hydroxylation, synthesis with specific precursors, and creating 3D architectures from 2D nanosheets. These approaches aim to enhance catalytic activity by increasing the number of accessible active sites, but do not explicitly address 2-D dispersion or its advantages over linear edge sites. The research interest appears to be focused on general strategies to optimize boron-based catalysts rather than on specific structural features like 2-D dispersed sites.

文献中并未具体讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点,也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反,文献提到了通过边缘羟基化、使用特定前体合成以及将二维纳米片组装成三维结构等方法来增加表面积和活性位点暴露的努力。这些方法旨在通过增加可接触的活性位点数量来提高催化活性,但并未明确提及二维分散或其相对于线性边缘位点的优势。研究兴趣似乎集中在优化硼基催化剂的一般策略上,而不是像二维分散位点这样的特定结构特征上。

[1] "Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient ODH catalytic systems to improve the selectivity of olefin products, most of which used metal-based catalysts. These metal-based catalysts displayed high reactivity toward the oxidative conversion of alkanes but suffered from serious deep oxidation to COx, causing significant CO2 emission, owing to the strong interaction between the defected electrophilic metal sites and the electron-rich olefin products. The discovery of boron-based metal-free catalysts showed that this was well circumvented owing to the nucleophilicity of the metal-free catalysts that repelled the approach of olefins."

[2] "The endeavors aiming at rational design and improvement of boron-based catalytic systems have been devoted to increasing the surface area and the exposure of oxygenated boron active sites. For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on increasing surface area and exposure of oxygenated boron active sites in general. 

The main strategies mentioned for improving boron-based catalysts include:

1. Edge-hydroxylation of boron nitride (BN)
2. Synthesis of BN using boric acid and dicyanamide
3. Assembling 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures
4. Functionalizing silicon boride
5. Supporting B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15
6. Creating ordered macroporous boron phosphate

These approaches aim to increase the number of accessible active sites and enhance catalytic performance. The key advantage of boron-based catalysts is their nucleophilic nature, which repels electron-rich olefin products and prevents deep oxidation to COx, unlike metal-based catalysts that suffer from significant CO2 emission.

While the literature does not directly address the question about 2-D dispersed active sites, it does highlight the importance of maximizing active site exposure and optimizing catalyst structure for improved performance in ODHP reactions.

文献并未特别讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP的二维分散活性位点，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它主要关注的是如何增加表面积和氧化硼活性位点的暴露。

文献中提到的改进硼基催化剂的主要策略包括：

1. 氮化硼(BN)的边缘羟基化
2. 使用硼酸和二氰胺合成BN
3. 将2D BN纳米片组装成3D有序结构
4. 功能化硅硼化物
5. 将B2O3负载在高表面积的SBA-15上
6. 制备有序大孔硼酸盐

这些方法旨在增加可接触的活性位点数量并提高催化性能。硼基催化剂的主要优势在于其亲核性质，可以排斥富电子的烯烃产物，防止深度氧化生成COx，这与容易产生大量CO2排放的金属基催化剂不同。

虽然文献没有直接回答关于二维分散活性位点的问题，但它确实强调了最大化活性位点暴露和优化催化剂结构对提高ODHP反应性能的重要性。
