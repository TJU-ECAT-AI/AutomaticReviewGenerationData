[1] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

[2] "These studies will disclose the key issues regarding the reaction mechanism, e.g. the knowledge on the geometric and electronic characters of boron sites, the transformations of the BO and BOH groups, and the roles of the adjacent structure of oxygen-containing boron sites in the alkane ODH reactions, based on which the structureactivity relationship of the boron-based catalysts in the ODH of light alkanes may be established."

[3] "Previous studies have revealed that hydroxylated boron sites on boron nitride edges are decisive for the specific catalytic activity in the ODH reaction. It is beneficial for making use of this finding to improve the activity of catalysts by means of maximization of the presence of OH-containing boron sites."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. The document mainly focuses on increasing surface area and exposure of oxygenated boron active sites through various strategies like edge-hydroxylation, synthesis methods, and 3D ordered architectures. It mentions that hydroxylated boron sites on edges are important for catalytic activity, but does not directly address 2-D dispersed sites or their advantages over linear edge sites. The research interest appears to be more broadly on understanding and optimizing the geometric and electronic properties of boron sites, rather than specifically on 2-D vs linear dispersion.

文献中没有具体讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点,也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。该文档主要集中于通过各种策略增加表面积和暴露含氧硼活性位点,如边缘羟基化、合成方法和三维有序结构。文中提到边缘上的羟基化硼位点对催化活性很重要,但并未直接讨论二维分散位点或其相对于线性边缘位点的优势。研究兴趣似乎更广泛地集中在理解和优化硼位点的几何和电子性质上,而不是专门针对二维与线性分散的比较。
