[1] "Considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient ODH catalytic systems to improve the selectivity of olefin products, most of which used metal-based catalysts. These metal-based catalysts displayed high reactivity toward the oxidative conversion of alkanes but suffered from serious deep oxidation to COx, causing significant CO2 emission, owing to the strong interaction between the defected electrophilic metal sites and the electron-rich olefin products. The discovery of boron-based metal-free catalysts showed that this was well circumvented owing to the nucleophilicity of the metal-free catalysts that repelled the approach of olefins."

[2] "The endeavors aiming at rational design and improvement of boron-based catalytic systems have been devoted to increasing the surface area and the exposure of oxygenated boron active sites. For h-BN, the edge-hydroxylation of BN, synthesis of BN with boric acid and dicyanamide, and assembly of 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures were reported as effective ways to enhance the catalytic activity of BN."

[3] "By means of similar strategies, functionalized silicon boride, supported B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15, and ordered macroporous boron phosphate were also reported with remarkable performance in the ODH of light alkanes."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on increasing surface area and exposure of oxygenated boron active sites in general. 

The main strategies mentioned for improving boron-based catalysts include:

1. Edge-hydroxylation of boron nitride (BN)
2. Synthesis of BN using boric acid and dicyanamide
3. Assembling 2D BN nanosheets into 3D ordered architectures
4. Functionalizing silicon boride
5. Supporting B2O3 on high surface area SBA-15
6. Creating ordered macroporous boron phosphate

These approaches aim to increase the number of accessible active sites and enhance catalytic performance. The key advantage of boron-based catalysts is their nucleophilic nature, which repels electron-rich olefin products and prevents deep oxidation to COx, unlike metal-based catalysts that suffer from significant CO2 emission.

While the literature does not directly address the question about 2-D dispersed active sites, it does highlight the importance of maximizing active site exposure and optimizing catalyst structure for improved performance in ODHP reactions.

文献并未特别讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP的二维分散活性位点，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它主要关注的是如何增加表面积和氧化硼活性位点的暴露。

文献中提到的改进硼基催化剂的主要策略包括：

1. 氮化硼(BN)的边缘羟基化
2. 使用硼酸和二氰胺合成BN
3. 将2D BN纳米片组装成3D有序结构
4. 功能化硅硼化物
5. 将B2O3负载在高表面积的SBA-15上
6. 制备有序大孔硼酸盐

这些方法旨在增加可接触的活性位点数量并提高催化性能。硼基催化剂的主要优势在于其亲核性质，可以排斥富电子的烯烃产物，防止深度氧化生成COx，这与容易产生大量CO2排放的金属基催化剂不同。

虽然文献没有直接回答关于二维分散活性位点的问题，但它确实强调了最大化活性位点暴露和优化催化剂结构对提高ODHP反应性能的重要性。
