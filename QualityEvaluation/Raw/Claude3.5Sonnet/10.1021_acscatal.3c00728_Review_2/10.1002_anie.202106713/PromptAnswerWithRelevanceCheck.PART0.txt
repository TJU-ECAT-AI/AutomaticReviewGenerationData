[1] "Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."

[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[4] "The washed filtrate was dried, and white solids were obtained, which were determined to be the mixture of boric acid and amorphous boron oxide"

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on using plasma treatments to modify the local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts.

The study uses N2, O2, H2, and Ar plasmas to create different types of defects and functionalities on the h-BN surface. Among these, N2-treated BN showed the best performance, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity towards olefins at 520°C. This improved activity was attributed to the formation of three-boron center N-defects, which were found to play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion.

The research interest in these plasma-treated h-BN catalysts stems from their ability to create specific defects and functionalities that can enhance catalytic performance. For example, N2 plasma treatment increased the number of N-defects, which were found to be favorable sites for generating active species. This approach allows for the controlled modification of the catalyst surface, potentially leading to higher active site density and improved catalytic performance.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss 2-D dispersed active sites or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites, it does demonstrate the importance of creating specific defects and functionalities on the catalyst surface to enhance performance. This approach of tailoring the local chemical environment of h-BN through plasma treatment represents a novel method for developing more efficient catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它侧重于使用等离子体处理来修饰六方氮化硼(h-BN)催化剂的局部化学环境。

该研究使用N2、O2、H2和Ar等离子体在h-BN表面创造不同类型的缺陷和功能基团。其中，N2处理的BN表现最佳，在520°C下丙烷转化率达26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。这种改进的活性归因于三硼中心N缺陷的形成，这些缺陷被发现在促进丙烷转化中起关键作用。

对这些等离子体处理的h-BN催化剂的研究兴趣源于它们能够创造特定的缺陷和功能基团，从而提高催化性能。例如，N2等离子体处理增加了N缺陷的数量，这些缺陷被发现是产生活性物种的有利位点。这种方法允许对催化剂表面进行可控修饰，可能导致更高的活性位点密度和改进的催化性能。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论二维分散活性位点或将其与线性分散边缘位点进行比较，但它确实展示了在催化剂表面创造特定缺陷和功能基团以提高性能的重要性。这种通过等离子体处理来调整h-BN局部化学环境的方法代表了一种开发更高效ODHP反应催化剂的新方法。

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. However, it provides relevant information on the development and advantages of active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP:

1. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been discovered as a selective catalyst for oxidizing propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation.

2. Oxygen-containing boron species on the catalyst surface are generally accepted as the catalytic origin for the ODH reaction.

3. Commercial h-BN has limited active sites due to high crystallinity, necessitating improvements in reaction performance.

4. Researchers use rational etching and chemical modifications to improve catalyst activity and understand reaction mechanisms.

5. Plasma treatment is used to modify surface properties and composition of catalytic materials by breaking and forming chemical bonds.

6. The study found a positive correlation between reaction rates and certain defects (g1), suggesting that aggregated boron sites are favored as active sites.

These findings indicate that researchers are focused on creating and optimizing active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly through surface modifications and defect generation. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss 2-D dispersed active sites, the emphasis on surface modifications and defect creation suggests that increasing the density and accessibility of active sites is a key area of interest in improving catalytic performance for ODHP reactions.

The literature does not directly discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. However, the study focuses on developing active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts through various plasma treatments.

The research demonstrates that N2 plasma treatment creates more three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species. These defects play a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C).

The study shows a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC N-defects), suggesting that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites. This implies that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance.

The research interest in these structural features stems from their ability to selectively oxidize propane to propylene with negligible CO2 formation, overcoming limitations in traditional metal oxide catalysts. Additionally, the use of plasma treatment as an efficient up-to-down synthesis method provides a feasible way to design functionalized or defects-rich catalysts, deepening the understanding of active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP reactions.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论硼基催化剂中二维分散的活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应，也没有将它们与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。然而，这项研究重点关注通过各种等离子体处理在六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂中发展活性位点。

研究表明，N2等离子体处理在h-BN表面创造了更多的三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，这些缺陷作为生成活性物种的有利位点。这些缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用，导致了显著的催化性能（在520°C下，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%）。

研究显示反应速率与g1缺陷（TBC N缺陷）强度之间存在正相关关系，表明聚集的硼位点更有利于成为活性位点。这意味着在h-BN表面创造更高密度的这些缺陷可能会提高催化性能。

对这些结构特征的研究兴趣源于它们能够选择性地将丙烷氧化成丙烯，同时产生极少量的CO2，克服了传统金属氧化物催化剂的局限性。此外，使用等离子体处理作为一种高效的自上而下合成方法，为设计功能化或富缺陷的催化剂提供了可行的方式，加深了对ODHP反应中硼基催化剂活性位点的理解。

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. However, it does discuss the development of active sites through plasma treatment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).

The study focuses on creating N-defects on the surface of h-BN using different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar). These treatments, particularly N2 plasma, create three-boron center (TBC) N-defects, which play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The TBC defects are found to be more effective than one-boron center (OBC) defects in the ODH reaction.

The plasma treatment method offers advantages in terms of creating a higher density of active sites. For example, N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C. This performance is attributed to the increased number of N-defects, particularly TBC defects, which evolve into active BOx species during the ODH reaction.

While the study doesn't explicitly compare 2-D dispersed sites to linearly dispersed edge sites, it does highlight the importance of surface modifications and defect creation in improving catalytic performance. The ability to control and optimize the density and type of defects through plasma treatment has likely attracted significant research interest in the field, as it offers a way to enhance the activity and selectivity of boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

研究重点是使用不同的等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）在h-BN表面创造N缺陷。这些处理，特别是N2等离子体，创造了三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，这在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。在ODH反应中，TBC缺陷被发现比单硼中心（OBC）缺陷更有效。

等离子体处理方法在创造更高密度的活性位点方面具有优势。例如，经N2处理的BN在520°C下显示出显著的活性，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。这种性能归因于N缺陷数量的增加，特别是TBC缺陷，它们在ODH反应过程中演变为活性BOx物种。

虽然这项研究没有明确比较二维分散位点和线性分散的边缘位点，但它确实强调了表面改性和缺陷创造在提高催化性能方面的重要性。通过等离子体处理来控制和优化缺陷的密度和类型的能力可能吸引了该领域的大量研究兴趣，因为它为提高硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中的活性和选择性提供了一种方法。

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on the development of active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts through plasma treatment.

The research interest in h-BN for ODHP stems from its extraordinary olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. The active sites in h-BN are believed to be oxygen-containing boron species on the catalyst surface. However, the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN results in a limited number of active sites, necessitating methods to increase their density and improve catalytic performance.

The study uses plasma treatment (with N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to modify the surface properties and composition of h-BN. This method breaks surface chemical bonds and creates new ones, effectively increasing the number of active sites. The N2-plasma treated BN showed the best performance, achieving 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C.

The research revealed that three-boron center N-defects (g1 defects) play a leading role in the ODH reaction. There was a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of these defects, suggesting that aggregated boron sites are favorable for catalytic activity.

While this approach does not specifically create 2-D dispersed active sites, it demonstrates a method to increase the density of active sites on the h-BN surface, thereby improving catalytic performance. The unique structural features of h-BN and the ability to modify its surface have attracted significant research interest in the field of ODHP catalysis.

h-BN在ODHP领域引起研究兴趣是因为与金属氧化物相比，它具有非常高的烯烃选择性。h-BN中的活性位点被认为是催化剂表面的含氧硼物种。然而，商业h-BN的高结晶度导致活性位点数量有限，因此需要寻找方法来增加活性位点密度并提高催化性能。

该研究使用等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）来改变h-BN的表面性质和组成。这种方法破坏表面化学键并创造新的化学键，有效地增加了活性位点的数量。经N2等离子体处理的BN表现最佳，在520°C下实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。

研究发现，三硼中心N缺陷（g1缺陷）在ODH反应中起主导作用。反应速率与这些缺陷的强度呈正相关，表明聚集的硼位点有利于催化活性。

虽然这种方法并不特别创建二维分散活性位点，但它展示了一种增加h-BN表面活性位点密度的方法，从而提高了催化性能。h-BN的独特结构特征及其表面可修饰性在ODHP催化领域引起了极大的研究兴趣。
