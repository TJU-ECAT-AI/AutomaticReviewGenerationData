[1] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[2] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[3] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[4] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[5] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

The literature does not directly discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. However, the study focuses on developing active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts through various plasma treatments.

The research demonstrates that N2 plasma treatment creates more three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species. These defects play a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C).

The study shows a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC N-defects), suggesting that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites. This implies that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance.

The research interest in these structural features stems from their ability to selectively oxidize propane to propylene with negligible CO2 formation, overcoming limitations in traditional metal oxide catalysts. Additionally, the use of plasma treatment as an efficient up-to-down synthesis method provides a feasible way to design functionalized or defects-rich catalysts, deepening the understanding of active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP reactions.

这篇文献并没有直接讨论硼基催化剂中二维分散的活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应，也没有将它们与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。然而，这项研究重点关注通过各种等离子体处理在六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂中发展活性位点。

研究表明，N2等离子体处理在h-BN表面创造了更多的三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，这些缺陷作为生成活性物种的有利位点。这些缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用，导致了显著的催化性能（在520°C下，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%）。

研究显示反应速率与g1缺陷（TBC N缺陷）强度之间存在正相关关系，表明聚集的硼位点更有利于成为活性位点。这意味着在h-BN表面创造更高密度的这些缺陷可能会提高催化性能。

对这些结构特征的研究兴趣源于它们能够选择性地将丙烷氧化成丙烯，同时产生极少量的CO2，克服了传统金属氧化物催化剂的局限性。此外，使用等离子体处理作为一种高效的自上而下合成方法，为设计功能化或富缺陷的催化剂提供了可行的方式，加深了对ODHP反应中硼基催化剂活性位点的理解。
