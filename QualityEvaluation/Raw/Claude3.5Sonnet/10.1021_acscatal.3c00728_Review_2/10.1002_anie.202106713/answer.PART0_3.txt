[1] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C. Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[3] "There was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[4] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. However, it does discuss the development of active sites through plasma treatment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).

The study focuses on creating N-defects on the surface of h-BN using different plasma treatments (N2, O2, H2, and Ar). These treatments, particularly N2 plasma, create three-boron center (TBC) N-defects, which play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion. The TBC defects are found to be more effective than one-boron center (OBC) defects in the ODH reaction.

The plasma treatment method offers advantages in terms of creating a higher density of active sites. For example, N2-treated BN showed remarkable activity with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C. This performance is attributed to the increased number of N-defects, particularly TBC defects, which evolve into active BOx species during the ODH reaction.

While the study doesn't explicitly compare 2-D dispersed sites to linearly dispersed edge sites, it does highlight the importance of surface modifications and defect creation in improving catalytic performance. The ability to control and optimize the density and type of defects through plasma treatment has likely attracted significant research interest in the field, as it offers a way to enhance the activity and selectivity of boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP的二维分散活性位点，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。然而，它确实讨论了通过等离子体处理六方氮化硼（h-BN）来开发活性位点。

研究重点是使用不同的等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）在h-BN表面创造N缺陷。这些处理，特别是N2等离子体，创造了三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，这在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用。在ODH反应中，TBC缺陷被发现比单硼中心（OBC）缺陷更有效。

等离子体处理方法在创造更高密度的活性位点方面具有优势。例如，经N2处理的BN在520°C下显示出显著的活性，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。这种性能归因于N缺陷数量的增加，特别是TBC缺陷，它们在ODH反应过程中演变为活性BOx物种。

虽然这项研究没有明确比较二维分散位点和线性分散的边缘位点，但它确实强调了表面改性和缺陷创造在提高催化性能方面的重要性。通过等离子体处理来控制和优化缺陷的密度和类型的能力可能吸引了该领域的大量研究兴趣，因为它为提高硼基催化剂在ODHP反应中的活性和选择性提供了一种方法。
