[1] "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides."

[2] "With the investigation of various boron-containing catalysts in different alkane atmospheres, it has been generally accepted that the oxygen-containing boron species on the surface of the catalyst is the catalytic origin of the ODH reaction."

[3] "At present, since the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited amount of active sites, it is necessary to effectively improve the reaction performance of this material to boost industrialization."

[4] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[5] "High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

[6] "N2-BN displayed the best performance, of which propane conversion of 26.0% and selectivity of 76.7% toward propylene or 89.4% for all olefins were achieved at 520C."

[7] "There was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

The literature does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on the development of active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts through plasma treatment.

The research interest in h-BN for ODHP stems from its extraordinary olefin selectivity compared to metal oxides. The active sites in h-BN are believed to be oxygen-containing boron species on the catalyst surface. However, the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN results in a limited number of active sites, necessitating methods to increase their density and improve catalytic performance.

The study uses plasma treatment (with N2, O2, H2, and Ar) to modify the surface properties and composition of h-BN. This method breaks surface chemical bonds and creates new ones, effectively increasing the number of active sites. The N2-plasma treated BN showed the best performance, achieving 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C.

The research revealed that three-boron center N-defects (g1 defects) play a leading role in the ODH reaction. There was a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of these defects, suggesting that aggregated boron sites are favorable for catalytic activity.

While this approach does not specifically create 2-D dispersed active sites, it demonstrates a method to increase the density of active sites on the h-BN surface, thereby improving catalytic performance. The unique structural features of h-BN and the ability to modify its surface have attracted significant research interest in the field of ODHP catalysis.

该文献并未具体讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP反应的二维分散活性位点，也没有将其与线性分散边缘位点进行比较。相反，它主要关注通过等离子体处理来开发六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂中的活性位点。

h-BN在ODHP领域引起研究兴趣是因为与金属氧化物相比，它具有非常高的烯烃选择性。h-BN中的活性位点被认为是催化剂表面的含氧硼物种。然而，商业h-BN的高结晶度导致活性位点数量有限，因此需要寻找方法来增加活性位点密度并提高催化性能。

该研究使用等离子体处理（N2、O2、H2和Ar）来改变h-BN的表面性质和组成。这种方法破坏表面化学键并创造新的化学键，有效地增加了活性位点的数量。经N2等离子体处理的BN表现最佳，在520°C下实现了26.0%的丙烷转化率和89.4%的烯烃选择性。

研究发现，三硼中心N缺陷（g1缺陷）在ODH反应中起主导作用。反应速率与这些缺陷的强度呈正相关，表明聚集的硼位点有利于催化活性。

虽然这种方法并不特别创建二维分散活性位点，但它展示了一种增加h-BN表面活性位点密度的方法，从而提高了催化性能。h-BN的独特结构特征及其表面可修饰性在ODHP催化领域引起了极大的研究兴趣。
