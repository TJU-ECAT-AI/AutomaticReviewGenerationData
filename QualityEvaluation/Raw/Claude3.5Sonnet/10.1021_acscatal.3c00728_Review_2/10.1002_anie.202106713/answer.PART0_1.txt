[1] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[2] "With the investigation of various boron-containing catalysts in different alkane atmospheres, it has been generally accepted that the oxygen-containing boron species on the surface of the catalyst is the catalytic origin of the ODH reaction."

[3] "At present, since the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited amount of active sites, it is necessary to effectively improve the reaction performance of this material to boost industrialization."

[4] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[5] "High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

[6] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. However, it provides relevant information on the development and advantages of active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP:

1. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been discovered as a selective catalyst for oxidizing propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation.

2. Oxygen-containing boron species on the catalyst surface are generally accepted as the catalytic origin for the ODH reaction.

3. Commercial h-BN has limited active sites due to high crystallinity, necessitating improvements in reaction performance.

4. Researchers use rational etching and chemical modifications to improve catalyst activity and understand reaction mechanisms.

5. Plasma treatment is used to modify surface properties and composition of catalytic materials by breaking and forming chemical bonds.

6. The study found a positive correlation between reaction rates and certain defects (g1), suggesting that aggregated boron sites are favored as active sites.

These findings indicate that researchers are focused on creating and optimizing active sites in boron-based catalysts, particularly through surface modifications and defect generation. While the literature doesn't explicitly discuss 2-D dispersed active sites, the emphasis on surface modifications and defect creation suggests that increasing the density and accessibility of active sites is a key area of interest in improving catalytic performance for ODHP reactions.

虽然文献没有直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于ODHP的二维分散活性位点，或将它们与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较，但它提供了关于硼基催化剂中ODHP活性位点开发和优势的相关信息：

1. 六方氮化硼（h-BN）被发现是一种可以选择性地将丙烷氧化为丙烯，且CO2生成量可忽略不计的催化剂。

2. 普遍认为，催化剂表面的含氧硼物种是ODH反应的催化来源。

3. 由于商业h-BN的高结晶度导致活性位点数量有限，因此有必要有效提高该材料的反应性能以促进工业化。

4. 研究人员使用合理的刻蚀和化学修饰来提高催化剂活性并理解反应机理。

5. 等离子体处理被用来通过断裂和形成化学键来修改催化材料的表面性质和成分。

6. 研究发现反应速率与某些缺陷（g1）之间存在正相关关系，表明聚集的硼位点更有利于成为活性位点。

这些发现表明，研究人员专注于在硼基催化剂中创建和优化活性位点，特别是通过表面修饰和缺陷生成。虽然文献没有明确讨论二维分散活性位点，但对表面修饰和缺陷创建的强调表明，增加活性位点的密度和可及性是提高ODHP反应催化性能的一个关键研究领域。
