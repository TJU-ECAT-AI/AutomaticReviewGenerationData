[1] "Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h-BN."

[2] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[3] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[4] "The washed filtrate was dried, and white solids were obtained, which were determined to be the mixture of boric acid and amorphous boron oxide"

[5] "This phenomenon indicated that the generation of active sites preferentially occurred at the boron terminal with N-defects, experimentally supporting the previous theoretical calculations."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on using plasma treatments to modify the local chemical environment of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts.

The study uses N2, O2, H2, and Ar plasmas to create different types of defects and functionalities on the h-BN surface. Among these, N2-treated BN showed the best performance, with 26.0% propane conversion and 89.4% selectivity towards olefins at 520°C. This improved activity was attributed to the formation of three-boron center N-defects, which were found to play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion.

The research interest in these plasma-treated h-BN catalysts stems from their ability to create specific defects and functionalities that can enhance catalytic performance. For example, N2 plasma treatment increased the number of N-defects, which were found to be favorable sites for generating active species. This approach allows for the controlled modification of the catalyst surface, potentially leading to higher active site density and improved catalytic performance.

While the study doesn't explicitly discuss 2-D dispersed active sites or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites, it does demonstrate the importance of creating specific defects and functionalities on the catalyst surface to enhance performance. This approach of tailoring the local chemical environment of h-BN through plasma treatment represents a novel method for developing more efficient catalysts for the ODHP reaction.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它侧重于使用等离子体处理来修饰六方氮化硼(h-BN)催化剂的局部化学环境。

该研究使用N2、O2、H2和Ar等离子体在h-BN表面创造不同类型的缺陷和功能基团。其中，N2处理的BN表现最佳，在520°C下丙烷转化率达26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%。这种改进的活性归因于三硼中心N缺陷的形成，这些缺陷被发现在促进丙烷转化中起关键作用。

对这些等离子体处理的h-BN催化剂的研究兴趣源于它们能够创造特定的缺陷和功能基团，从而提高催化性能。例如，N2等离子体处理增加了N缺陷的数量，这些缺陷被发现是产生活性物种的有利位点。这种方法允许对催化剂表面进行可控修饰，可能导致更高的活性位点密度和改进的催化性能。

虽然该研究没有明确讨论二维分散活性位点或将其与线性分散边缘位点进行比较，但它确实展示了在催化剂表面创造特定缺陷和功能基团以提高性能的重要性。这种通过等离子体处理来调整h-BN局部化学环境的方法代表了一种开发更高效ODHP反应催化剂的新方法。
