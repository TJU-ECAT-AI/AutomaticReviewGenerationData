          [1] "Recently, the discovery that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) selectively oxidized propane to propylene with only negligible CO2 formation broke through the restriction of this process."

[2] "With the investigation of various boron-containing catalysts in different alkane atmospheres, it has been generally accepted that the oxygen-containing boron species on the surface of the catalyst is the catalytic origin of the ODH reaction."

[3] "At present, since the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited amount of active sites, it is necessary to effectively improve the reaction performance of this material to boost industrialization."

[4] "Rational etching and chemical modifications on the surface of catalysts are critical for improving activity and understanding the reaction mechanism."

[5] "High energy species (radicals, ions, and electrons) in plasma are capable of modifying surface property and composition of catalytic materials through breaking surface chemical bonds and reacting with surface atoms to form new chemical bonds."

[6] "N2-treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520C."

[7] "Spectroscopy demonstrated that three-boron center N-defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane."

[8] "As shown in Figure3e, there was a positive correlation between reaction rates and g1 intensity, which meant that g1 defect played a leading role in the ODH reaction compared with g2. This may support the previous report that aggregated boron was in favor to become active sites."

[9] "The generation of N-defects and its evolution into BOx during the ODH reaction of propane were proposed and shown in Figure6. Two types of N-defects (TBC and OBC) were generated during plasma treatment while TBC possibly preferred to become active BOx species under the ODH atmosphere and further converted propane to propylene."

          The provided literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, the research focuses on developing active sites in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts through various plasma treatments, particularly using N2 plasma.

The study demonstrates that h-BN can selectively oxidize propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation, overcoming limitations of traditional metal oxide catalysts. However, commercial h-BN has limited active sites due to its high crystallinity, necessitating methods to increase their density and improve catalytic performance.

Plasma treatment, especially with N2, creates three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species. These defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C).

The research shows a positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of g1 defects (TBC N-defects), suggesting that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites. This implies that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance.

While not explicitly creating 2-D dispersed active sites, this approach demonstrates a method to increase the density of active sites on the h-BN surface, thereby improving catalytic performance. The unique structural features of h-BN and the ability to modify its surface through plasma treatment have attracted significant research interest in the field of ODHP catalysis.

          所提供的文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的二维分散活性位点，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，研究重点关注通过各种等离子体处理，特别是使用N2等离子体，在六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂中发展活性位点。

研究表明，h-BN能够选择性地将丙烷氧化成丙烯，同时产生极少量的CO2，克服了传统金属氧化物催化剂的局限性。然而，由于商业h-BN的高结晶度，其活性位点数量有限，因此需要寻找方法来增加活性位点密度并提高催化性能。

等离子体处理，尤其是N2等离子体，在h-BN表面创造了三硼中心（TBC）N缺陷，这些缺陷作为生成活性物种的有利位点。这些缺陷在促进丙烷转化中起着关键作用，导致了显著的催化性能（在520°C下，丙烷转化率为26.0%，烯烃选择性为89.4%）。

研究显示反应速率与g1缺陷（TBC N缺陷）强度之间存在正相关关系，表明聚集的硼位点更有利于成为活性位点。这意味着在h-BN表面创造更高密度的这些缺陷可能会提高催化性能。

虽然这种方法并不特别创建二维分散活性位点，但它展示了一种增加h-BN表面活性位点密度的方法，从而提高了催化性能。h-BN的独特结构特征及其表面可通过等离子体处理进行修饰的能力在ODHP催化领域引起了极大的研究兴趣。
