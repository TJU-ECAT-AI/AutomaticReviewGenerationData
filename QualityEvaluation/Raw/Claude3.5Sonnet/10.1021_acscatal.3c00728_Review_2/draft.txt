1. Development, methods, and advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, with emphasis on their improved density, unique structural features, and increased research interest compared to linearly dispersed edge sites.

The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction has garnered significant attention in recent years due to their unique structural features and potential for enhanced catalytic performance. These 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed through two primary methods: (1) doping active boron oxide or boron hydroxyl units onto the surface of various hosting materials, and (2) utilizing the exposed surface of bulk boride materials [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2]. This approach offers several advantages over traditional linearly dispersed edge sites, particularly in terms of active site density and catalytic performance.

One of the key advantages of 2-D dispersed active sites is the significant improvement in active site density compared to linearly dispersed edge sites [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2]. This increased density of active sites can potentially lead to enhanced catalytic performance, as more sites are available for the ODHP reaction to occur. The unique structural features of these 2-D active sites, including their improved density and distribution across surfaces, have attracted considerable research interest in the field of ODHP reactions [10.1021/acscatal.3c00728_2].

Recent studies have challenged previous assumptions about edge sites being the primary active sites for boron nitride catalysts in ODHP reactions. Instead, research suggests that surface-stabilized BOx active sites form on various boron-containing materials during the ODHP reaction [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This shift in understanding from edge-site catalysis to surface-wide BOx active sites has opened up new possibilities for catalyst design and optimization in the field of oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

The crystal structure of boron-containing materials has been found to influence the formation of BOx species, with layered borides (e.g., NiB, TiB2, hBN) potentially presenting different boron surface concentrations compared to tetragonal borides (e.g., WB, Co2B) [10.1002/cctc.201701140]. This difference in surface concentration could affect the density and distribution of active sites, further contributing to the increased interest in 2-D dispersed active sites.

In the case of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), which has shown promise in selectively oxidizing propane to propylene with minimal CO2 formation, the high crystallinity of commercial h-BN leads to a limited number of active sites [10.1002/anie.202106713]. To address this limitation and improve catalytic performance, researchers have explored various surface modification techniques, such as plasma treatment.

N2 plasma treatment has been shown to create three-boron center (TBC) N-defects on the h-BN surface, which act as favorable sites for generating active species [10.1002/anie.202106713]. These defects play a crucial role in facilitating propane conversion, leading to remarkable catalytic performance (26.0% propane conversion with 89.4% selectivity toward olefins at 520°C) [10.1002/anie.202106713]. The positive correlation between reaction rates and the intensity of TBC N-defects suggests that aggregated boron sites are more favorable for becoming active sites, implying that creating a higher density of these defects on the h-BN surface can potentially improve catalytic performance [10.1002/anie.202106713].

Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP reactions represents a significant advancement in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. By moving beyond the traditional focus on edge sites and exploring surface-wide active sites, researchers have opened up new avenues for catalyst design and optimization. The ability to create higher densities of active sites through techniques such as doping and surface modification offers the potential for substantial improvements in catalytic performance.

Future research in this area may focus on further optimizing the density and distribution of 2-D dispersed active sites, perhaps through the development of novel hosting materials or advanced surface modification techniques. Additionally, the exploration of other boron-containing compounds and their potential for forming 2-D dispersed active sites could lead to the discovery of even more efficient catalysts for ODHP reactions. The integration of computational modeling and in-situ characterization techniques may provide deeper insights into the formation and behavior of these active sites under reaction conditions, enabling more targeted catalyst design strategies.

Furthermore, the principles and methodologies developed for boron-based ODHP catalysts may find applications in other catalytic processes, potentially leading to breakthroughs in fields such as CO2 conversion, biomass valorization, or fine chemical synthesis. As research in this area continues to evolve, it is likely that 2-D dispersed active sites will play an increasingly important role in the development of high-performance catalysts for a wide range of industrial applications.
