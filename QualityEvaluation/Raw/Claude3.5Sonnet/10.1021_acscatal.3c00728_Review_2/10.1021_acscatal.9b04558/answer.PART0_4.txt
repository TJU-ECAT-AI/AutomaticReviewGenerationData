<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information relevant to the development of 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane (ODHP) reaction, their advantages over linearly dispersed edge sites, or why these structural features have attracted research interest. The article appears to be about atomically dispersed Pt catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction, which is unrelated to the question asked.

所给文献中没有包含任何与硼基催化剂中2-D分散活性位点在丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应中的开发、它们相对于线性分散边缘位点的优势,或者这些结构特征为何引起研究兴趣相关的信息。这篇文章似乎是关于原子分散的Pt催化剂用于氧还原反应,与所问问题无关。
