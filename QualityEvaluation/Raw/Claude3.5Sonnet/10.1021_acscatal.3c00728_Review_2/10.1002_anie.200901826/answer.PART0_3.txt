[1] "EF-TEM shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

The document does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it describes boron oxide as being highly dispersed throughout carbon nanotube (CNT) substrates, with some deposited in the CNT cavities and tips, and a sub-monolayer of BOx species dispersed on the surface. The advantages mentioned are improved selectivity towards propene formation and increased resistance to oxidation, rather than increased active site density. The research interest appears to stem from the ability of boron modification to suppress combustion sites and enhance propene selectivity in ODHP reactions, not from any unique 2-D structural features.

该文档并未具体讨论用于ODHP的硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点,也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反,它描述了氧化硼在碳纳米管(CNT)基底上高度分散,一些沉积在CNT空腔和尖端,而BOx物种的亚单层则分散在表面。提到的优势是提高了对丙烯形成的选择性和抗氧化能力,而不是增加活性位点密度。研究兴趣似乎源于硼修饰能够抑制燃烧位点并增强ODHP反应中的丙烯选择性,而不是源于任何独特的二维结构特征。
