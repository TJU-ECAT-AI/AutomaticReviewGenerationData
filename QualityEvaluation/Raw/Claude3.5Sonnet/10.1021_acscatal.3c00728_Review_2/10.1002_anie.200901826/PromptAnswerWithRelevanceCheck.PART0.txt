[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it describes boron oxide modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) where boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate. The boron oxide forms a highly dispersed sub-monolayer on the CNT surface, filling surface defects and holes. This modification improves thermal stability and selectivity towards propene formation in ODHP reactions.

The advantages offered by this boron oxide modification include:

1. Improved chemical stability and resistance to oxidation
2. Enhanced selectivity towards propene formation
3. Suppression of total oxidation reactions
4. Inhibition of dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species

These structural features have attracted research interest because they provide a metal-free, environmentally friendly alternative to conventional metal oxide catalysts for ODHP reactions, while offering comparable or superior selectivity. The boron-modified CNTs also enable easier investigation of reaction mechanisms compared to more complex metal oxide systems.

文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应,也没有将其与线性分散边缘位点进行比较。相反,它描述了硼氧化物改性的碳纳米管(CNTs),其中硼和氧在CNT基底上高度分散。硼氧化物在CNT表面形成高度分散的亚单层,填充表面缺陷和孔洞。这种改性提高了热稳定性,并在ODHP反应中提高了对丙烯形成的选择性。

硼氧化物改性提供的优势包括:

1. 提高化学稳定性和抗氧化性
2. 提高对丙烯形成的选择性
3. 抑制完全氧化反应
4. 抑制O2的解离吸附,维持选择性氧物种

这些结构特征之所以引起研究兴趣,是因为它们为ODHP反应提供了一种无金属、环保的替代方案,可以替代传统的金属氧化物催化剂,同时提供相当或更优的选择性。与更复杂的金属氧化物系统相比,硼改性CNTs还可以更容易地研究反应机理。

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it describes boron oxide as being highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with a sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes. The boron modification appears to improve thermal stability and selectivity by blocking combustion sites rather than creating new active sites. The paper does not discuss specific advantages in terms of active site density or unique structural features attracting research interest. Therefore, the question as posed cannot be fully answered based on the given literature.

[1] "Boron makes it selective: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) modified by boron oxide catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with remarkable selectivity."

[2] "The implementation of an electron-attracting dopant, such as boron or boron oxide, will reduce the generation of highly reactive oxygen species and is thus expected to increase the selectivity to propene."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on boron oxide-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as catalysts.

The boron oxide is highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with most deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a small fraction forms an amorphous coating on the outer surface, while a highly dispersed sub-monolayer of BOx species is present throughout. This dispersion offers advantages in terms of selectivity by reducing the generation of highly reactive oxygen species.

The boron modification increases selectivity towards propene formation in ODHP compared to unmodified CNTs. It also improves the chemical stability of the catalyst.

While the paper does not discuss 2-D dispersed sites specifically, the highly dispersed nature of the boron oxide on CNTs and its impact on catalytic performance have attracted research interest in developing more selective and stable catalysts for ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它主要关注硼氧化物修饰的碳纳米管(CNTs)作为催化剂。

硼氧化物在CNT基底上高度分散，大部分沉积在CNTs的空腔和尖端。只有一小部分在外表面形成1-2nm厚的无定形涂层，而高度分散的亚单层BOx物种则普遍存在。这种分散方式通过减少高活性氧物种的生成，在选择性方面提供了优势。

硼修饰提高了ODHP反应中对丙烯形成的选择性，相比未经修饰的CNTs。它还提高了催化剂的化学稳定性。

虽然论文没有具体讨论二维分散位点，但硼氧化物在CNTs上的高度分散性及其对催化性能的影响引起了研究人员的兴趣，以开发更具选择性和稳定性的ODHP反应催化剂。

The document does not specifically discuss 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it describes boron oxide as being highly dispersed throughout carbon nanotube (CNT) substrates, with some deposited in the CNT cavities and tips, and a sub-monolayer of BOx species dispersed on the surface. The advantages mentioned are improved selectivity towards propene formation and increased resistance to oxidation, rather than increased active site density. The research interest appears to stem from the ability of boron modification to suppress combustion sites and enhance propene selectivity in ODHP reactions, not from any unique 2-D structural features.
