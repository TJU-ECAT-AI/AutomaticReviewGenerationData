[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it describes boron oxide modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) where boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate. The boron oxide forms a highly dispersed sub-monolayer on the CNT surface, filling surface defects and holes. This modification improves thermal stability and selectivity towards propene formation in ODHP reactions.

The advantages offered by this boron oxide modification include:

1. Improved chemical stability and resistance to oxidation
2. Enhanced selectivity towards propene formation
3. Suppression of total oxidation reactions
4. Inhibition of dissociative adsorption of O2, sustaining selective oxygen species

These structural features have attracted research interest because they provide a metal-free, environmentally friendly alternative to conventional metal oxide catalysts for ODHP reactions, while offering comparable or superior selectivity. The boron-modified CNTs also enable easier investigation of reaction mechanisms compared to more complex metal oxide systems.

文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应,也没有将其与线性分散边缘位点进行比较。相反,它描述了硼氧化物改性的碳纳米管(CNTs),其中硼和氧在CNT基底上高度分散。硼氧化物在CNT表面形成高度分散的亚单层,填充表面缺陷和孔洞。这种改性提高了热稳定性,并在ODHP反应中提高了对丙烯形成的选择性。

硼氧化物改性提供的优势包括:

1. 提高化学稳定性和抗氧化性
2. 提高对丙烯形成的选择性
3. 抑制完全氧化反应
4. 抑制O2的解离吸附,维持选择性氧物种

这些结构特征之所以引起研究兴趣,是因为它们为ODHP反应提供了一种无金属、环保的替代方案,可以替代传统的金属氧化物催化剂,同时提供相当或更优的选择性。与更复杂的金属氧化物系统相比,硼改性CNTs还可以更容易地研究反应机理。
