The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it focuses on boron oxide-modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as catalysts.

The boron oxide is highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with most deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a small fraction forms an amorphous coating on the outer surface, while a highly dispersed sub-monolayer of BOx species is present throughout. This dispersion offers advantages in terms of selectivity by reducing the generation of highly reactive oxygen species.

The boron modification increases selectivity towards propene formation in ODHP compared to unmodified CNTs. It also improves the chemical stability of the catalyst.

While the paper does not discuss 2-D dispersed sites specifically, the highly dispersed nature of the boron oxide on CNTs and its impact on catalytic performance have attracted research interest in developing more selective and stable catalysts for ODHP reactions.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中的二维分散活性位点用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应，也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反，它主要关注硼氧化物修饰的碳纳米管(CNTs)作为催化剂。

硼氧化物在CNT基底上高度分散，大部分沉积在CNTs的空腔和尖端。只有一小部分在外表面形成1-2nm厚的无定形涂层，而高度分散的亚单层BOx物种则普遍存在。这种分散方式通过减少高活性氧物种的生成，在选择性方面提供了优势。

硼修饰提高了ODHP反应中对丙烯形成的选择性，相比未经修饰的CNTs。它还提高了催化剂的化学稳定性。

虽然论文没有具体讨论二维分散位点，但硼氧化物在CNTs上的高度分散性及其对催化性能的影响引起了研究人员的兴趣，以开发更具选择性和稳定性的ODHP反应催化剂。
