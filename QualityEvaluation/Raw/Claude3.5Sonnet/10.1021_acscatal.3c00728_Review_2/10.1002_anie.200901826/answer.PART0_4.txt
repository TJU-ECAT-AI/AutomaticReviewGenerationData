[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Owing to the chosen preparation method, the majority of amorphous B2O3 is deposited in the cavity and on the tips of CNTs. Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent"

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it describes boron oxide as being highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with some deposited in the CNT cavities and tips, and a sub-monolayer of BOx species dispersed on the surface. The advantages mentioned are improved selectivity towards propene formation and increased resistance to oxidation, rather than increased active site density. The unique structural features that have attracted research interest appear to be the highly dispersed nature of the boron oxide and its covalent bonding to the CNT structure, which provides thermal stability and acts as a protective backbone against oxidation.

该文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点,也没有将它们与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反,文献描述了氧化硼在CNT基底上高度分散,部分沉积在CNT空腔和顶端,以及BOx物种以亚单层形式分散在表面。提到的优势是提高了对丙烯形成的选择性和增加了抗氧化能力,而不是增加活性位点密度。吸引研究兴趣的独特结构特征似乎是氧化硼的高度分散性质及其与CNT结构的共价键合,这提供了热稳定性并作为抗氧化的保护骨架。
