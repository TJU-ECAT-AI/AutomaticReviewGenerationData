[1] "Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF-TEM) shows that both boron and oxygen are highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate"

[2] "Only a minor fraction of the outer CNT surface is covered by an amorphous coating of about 12nm thickness, whereas a highly dispersed sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species is expected to be omnipresent, as the reduced surface area of modified CNTs may also be interpreted as the filling of surface defects and holes in the graphene layers."

[3] "The good thermal stability of the doped samples during TPO indicates a covalent bonding to the CNT structure, whereas the B2O3/P2O5 filling of the CNTs acts as a backbone against oxidation."

The literature does not directly address 2-D dispersed active sites in boron-based catalysts for ODHP or compare them to linearly dispersed edge sites. Instead, it describes boron oxide as being highly dispersed throughout the CNT substrate, with a sub-monolayer deposition of BOx species filling surface defects and holes. The boron modification appears to improve thermal stability and selectivity by blocking combustion sites rather than creating new active sites. The paper does not discuss specific advantages in terms of active site density or unique structural features attracting research interest. Therefore, the question as posed cannot be fully answered based on the given literature.

文献并未直接讨论硼基催化剂中用于丙烷氧化脱氢(ODHP)反应的二维分散活性位点,也没有将其与线性分散的边缘位点进行比较。相反,它描述了氧化硼在碳纳米管(CNT)基底上高度分散,BOx物种以亚单层沉积的形式填充表面缺陷和孔洞。硼的修饰似乎通过阻挡燃烧位点而不是创造新的活性位点来提高热稳定性和选择性。该论文没有讨论活性位点密度方面的具体优势或吸引研究兴趣的独特结构特征。因此,基于给定的文献,无法完全回答所提出的问题。
