[1] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."

[2] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[3] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CnH2n + 2 → CnH2n + H2, is a simple reaction; however, inherent thermodynamic hurdles and kinetic complications are associated with the elementary steps of the reaction."

[4] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation."

[5] "Industrial chromium oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are prepared by impregnation of an aqueous solution of chromate salt between 5 and 15 wt.% Cr loadings on high surface support material"

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic process with limited alkene yields due to reaction thermodynamics.

2. High temperature requirements: While higher temperatures increase alkane conversion, they also decrease alkene selectivity.

3. Side reactions: Increasing temperature and chain length lead to unwanted reactions like dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation.

4. Catalyst stability: Maintaining catalyst performance at high temperatures is challenging.

Researchers are addressing these challenges through:

1. Catalyst development: Focusing on platinum-based catalysts promoted with tin to improve performance and stability.

2. Support materials: Using high surface area supports for chromium oxide catalysts to enhance activity.

3. Optimization of reaction conditions: Balancing temperature and other parameters to maximize propylene yield while minimizing side reactions.

4. Alternative approaches: Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation and other strategies to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

Opportunities lie in developing novel catalysts with improved high-temperature stability, higher propylene selectivity, and better resistance to coking and other side reactions. Additionally, there is potential for process innovations that can help overcome thermodynamic constraints and improve overall efficiency of PDH for industrial propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 热力学限制：PDH是一个吸热过程，由于反应热力学，烯烃产率有限。

2. 高温要求：虽然较高的温度会增加烷烃转化率，但也会降低烯烃选择性。

3. 副反应：温度和碳链长度的增加会导致不需要的反应，如脱氢环化、芳构化、热裂解和积碳。

4. 催化剂稳定性：在高温下维持催化剂性能具有挑战性。

研究人员正通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 催化剂开发：专注于用锡促进的铂基催化剂，以提高性能和稳定性。

2. 载体材料：使用高比表面积的载体来制备铬氧化物催化剂，以提高活性。

3. 优化反应条件：平衡温度和其他参数，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化副反应。

4. 替代方法：探索氧化脱氢和其他策略来克服热力学限制。

机会在于开发具有改进的高温稳定性、更高丙烯选择性以及对积碳和其他副反应更好抗性的新型催化剂。此外，还有潜力进行工艺创新，以帮助克服热力学限制，提高PDH在工业丙烯生产中的整体效率。
