[1] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[2] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."

[3] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[4] "Despite a large number of reports and many reviews covering different aspects of the subject, and more than two decades of investigations on ODH, gaps still exist between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation."

[5] "Catalyst improvement endeavors can benefit from insights on alkane CH bond activation mechanisms."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic process with alkene yields limited by reaction thermodynamics.

2. High-temperature stability: Higher temperatures increase alkane conversion but decrease alkene selectivity due to side reactions like dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation.

3. Propylene selectivity: Maintaining high propylene selectivity while achieving high conversion rates is challenging.

4. Resistance to side reactions: Preventing unwanted reactions that reduce propylene yield and cause catalyst deactivation.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Investigating alternative reaction routes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Developing catalysts with improved high-temperature stability and resistance to coking.

3. Exploring novel catalyst designs and promoters to enhance propylene selectivity.

4. Studying CH bond activation mechanisms to gain insights for rational catalyst design.

5. Investigating autothermal strategies to offset energy requirements.

Despite decades of research, there remains a gap between laboratory achievements and industrial implementation, indicating ongoing opportunities for innovation in PDH catalysts and processes.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 热力学限制：PDH是一个吸热过程，烯烃产率受反应热力学限制。

2. 高温稳定性：更高的温度会增加烷烃转化率，但会降低烯烃选择性，因为会发生脱氢环化、芳构化、热裂解和积碳等副反应。

3. 丙烯选择性：在实现高转化率的同时保持高丙烯选择性具有挑战性。

4. 抗副反应能力：防止降低丙烯产率和导致催化剂失活的不良反应。

研究人员正在通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 研究氧化脱氢(ODH)等替代反应路线，以克服热力学限制。

2. 开发具有改进的高温稳定性和抗积碳能力的催化剂。

3. 探索新型催化剂设计和助剂，以提高丙烯选择性。

4. 研究CH键活化机理，为合理设计催化剂提供见解。

5. 研究自热策略以抵消能量需求。

尽管经过几十年的研究，实验室成果和工业应用之间仍存在差距，这表明PDH催化剂和工艺仍有持续创新的机会。
