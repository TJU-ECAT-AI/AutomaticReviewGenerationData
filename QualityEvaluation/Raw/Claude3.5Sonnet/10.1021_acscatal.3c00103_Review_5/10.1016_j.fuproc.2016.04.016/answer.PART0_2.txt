[1] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[2] "Lower alkenes, especially ethene and propene, are key intermediates or monomers of industrial polymers."

[3] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."

[4] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[5] "Stoichiometrically, non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, CnH2n + 2 → CnH2n + H2, is a simple reaction; however, inherent thermodynamic hurdles and kinetic complications are associated with the elementary steps of the reaction."

[6] "The process usually involves repeated cycles of a dehydrogenation reaction and catalyst regeneration."

[7] "Commercial platinum catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnating the support material with a solution of platinum and tin precursors. Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

[8] "Industrial chromium oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are prepared by impregnation of an aqueous solution of chromate salt between 5 and 15 wt.% Cr loadings on high surface support material"

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic process with limited alkene yields due to reaction thermodynamics.

2. High temperature requirements: While higher temperatures increase conversion, they also decrease propylene selectivity due to side reactions like dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation.

3. Catalyst stability and regeneration: The process requires repeated cycles of dehydrogenation and catalyst regeneration, highlighting the need for stable catalysts.

4. Balancing activity and selectivity: Catalysts must be designed to maximize propylene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing improved catalyst formulations: Focus is on platinum-based and chromium oxide-based catalysts, typically supported on materials like alumina.

2. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods: Techniques such as impregnation with platinum and tin precursors or chromate salts are being refined.

3. Exploring alternative approaches: Oxidative dehydrogenation and autothermal strategies are being investigated to overcome thermodynamic limitations and reduce energy input.

4. Enhancing catalyst stability: Efforts are being made to improve catalyst longevity and regeneration efficiency.

5. Tuning selectivity: Research is aimed at developing catalysts that favor propylene formation while suppressing side reactions at high temperatures.

These efforts aim to create more efficient, stable, and selective catalysts for PDH, making the process more economically viable and competitive with traditional propylene production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 热力学限制：PDH是一个吸热过程，由于反应热力学，烯烃产率有限。

2. 高温要求：虽然更高的温度会增加转化率，但也会由于副反应（如脱氢环化、芳构化、热裂解和积炭）而降低丙烯选择性。

3. 催化剂稳定性和再生：该过程需要重复进行脱氢和催化剂再生循环，突出了对稳定催化剂的需求。

4. 平衡活性和选择性：催化剂的设计必须在最大化丙烯产率的同时最小化不需要的副反应。

研究人员正在通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 开发改进的催化剂配方：重点是基于铂和氧化铬的催化剂，通常负载在氧化铝等材料上。

2. 优化催化剂制备方法：正在完善铂和锡前体或铬酸盐的浸渍等技术。

3. 探索替代方法：正在研究氧化脱氢和自热策略，以克服热力学限制并减少能量输入。

4. 增强催化剂稳定性：正在努力提高催化剂的寿命和再生效率。

5. 调整选择性：研究旨在开发在高温下有利于丙烯形成同时抑制副反应的催化剂。

这些努力旨在为PDH创造更高效、更稳定和更具选择性的催化剂，使该工艺在经济上更加可行，并能与传统的丙烯生产方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解）竞争。
