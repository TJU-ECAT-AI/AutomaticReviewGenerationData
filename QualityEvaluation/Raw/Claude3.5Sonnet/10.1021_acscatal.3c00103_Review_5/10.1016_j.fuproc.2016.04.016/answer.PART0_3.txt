[1] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[2] "Dehydrogenation of light alkanes is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."

[3] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[4] "Current industrial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are platinum and chromium based."

[5] "Commercial platinum catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnating the support material with a solution of platinum and tin precursors."

[6] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation."

[7] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic process with limited alkene yields due to reaction thermodynamics.

2. High temperature requirements: While higher temperatures increase alkane conversion, they also lead to decreased alkene selectivity and increased side reactions.

3. Catalyst stability: Catalysts must withstand high temperatures and resist deactivation.

4. Side reactions: Dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation can reduce propylene selectivity.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing platinum and chromium-based catalysts, which are currently the primary industrial catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

2. Promoting platinum catalysts with tin to improve performance and stability.

3. Using alumina as a support material and titrating its acidic sites with alkali to minimize undesired side reactions.

4. Exploring alternative catalyst formulations and supports to enhance propylene selectivity and catalyst stability.

5. Investigating novel reactor designs and process configurations to optimize reaction conditions and minimize thermodynamic limitations.

Opportunities in PDH research include developing catalysts with improved high-temperature stability, higher propylene selectivity, and better resistance to coking and other side reactions. Additionally, there is potential for exploring new support materials, promoters, and catalyst preparation methods to enhance overall PDH performance.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 热力学限制：PDH是一个吸热过程，由于反应热力学的限制，烯烃产率有限。

2. 高温要求：虽然更高的温度可以增加烷烃转化率，但也会导致烯烃选择性降低和副反应增加。

3. 催化剂稳定性：催化剂必须能够承受高温并抵抗失活。

4. 副反应：脱氢环化、芳构化、热裂解和积碳可能会降低丙烯选择性。

研究人员正在通过以下方式解决这些挑战：

1. 开发铂和铬基催化剂，这些目前是烷烃脱氢的主要工业催化剂。

2. 用锡促进铂催化剂以提高性能和稳定性。

3. 使用氧化铝作为载体材料，并用碱对其酸性位进行滴定，以最大程度地减少不需要的副反应。

4. 探索替代催化剂配方和载体，以提高丙烯选择性和催化剂稳定性。

5. 研究新型反应器设计和工艺配置，以优化反应条件并最小化热力学限制。

PDH研究的机会包括开发具有更好高温稳定性、更高丙烯选择性以及更好的抗积碳和其他副反应能力的催化剂。此外，还有潜力探索新的载体材料、助剂和催化剂制备方法，以提高整体PDH性能。
