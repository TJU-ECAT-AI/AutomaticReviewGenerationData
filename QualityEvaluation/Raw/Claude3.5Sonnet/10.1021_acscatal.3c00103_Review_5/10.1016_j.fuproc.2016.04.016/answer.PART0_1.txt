[1] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[2] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[3] "Current industrial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are platinum and chromium based."

[4] "Industrial alkane dehydrogenations are non-oxidative highly endothermic processes."

[5] "Auto-thermal and oxidative alkane dehydrogenation strategies can offset a significant fraction of the required energy input."

[6] "The autothermal and oxidative alkane dehydrogenation strategies are currently immature technologies."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic process requiring high temperatures, which leads to equilibrium constraints on propylene yield.

2. Decreased selectivity at higher temperatures: As temperature increases, side reactions like dehydrocyclization, aromatization, and thermal cracking become more prevalent, reducing propylene selectivity.

3. Coke formation: Higher temperatures also promote coke formation, which deactivates catalysts.

4. High energy input: The endothermic nature of PDH requires significant energy input.

Researchers are addressing these challenges through various approaches:

1. Developing improved catalysts: Current industrial catalysts are platinum or chromium-based. Researchers are working on enhancing their stability, selectivity, and resistance to coking.

2. Exploring auto-thermal and oxidative dehydrogenation strategies: These approaches can offset some of the energy input required, potentially allowing for lower operating temperatures. However, these technologies are still immature.

3. Investigating alternative reactor designs: Different reactor configurations may help manage heat input and product selectivity more effectively.

4. Studying reaction mechanisms: Better understanding of CH bond activation mechanisms on catalyst surfaces may lead to more rational catalyst design.

Opportunities in PDH research include:

1. Development of novel catalyst materials with improved performance.
2. Optimization of reactor designs for better heat management and product selectivity.
3. Advancement of auto-thermal and oxidative dehydrogenation technologies to industrial viability.
4. Integration of PDH with other processes for better overall efficiency.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 热力学限制：PDH是一个吸热过程，需要高温，这导致丙烯产率受到平衡限制。

2. 高温下选择性降低：随着温度升高，脱氢环化、芳构化和热裂解等副反应变得更加普遍，降低了丙烯选择性。

3. 积碳形成：高温也促进了积碳形成，使催化剂失活。

4. 高能量输入：PDH的吸热性质需要大量能量输入。

研究人员正通过各种方法应对这些挑战：

1. 开发改进的催化剂：目前的工业催化剂是基于铂或铬的。研究人员正在努力提高它们的稳定性、选择性和抗积碳能力。

2. 探索自热和氧化脱氢策略：这些方法可以抵消部分所需的能量输入，可能允许在较低的操作温度下进行。然而，这些技术仍处于不成熟阶段。

3. 研究替代反应器设计：不同的反应器配置可能有助于更有效地管理热输入和产品选择性。

4. 研究反应机理：更好地理解催化剂表面上的CH键活化机理可能导致更合理的催化剂设计。

PDH研究的机会包括：

1. 开发性能更好的新型催化剂材料。
2. 优化反应器设计，以实现更好的热管理和产品选择性。
3. 推进自热和氧化脱氢技术到工业可行性阶段。
4. 将PDH与其他过程集成，以提高整体效率。
