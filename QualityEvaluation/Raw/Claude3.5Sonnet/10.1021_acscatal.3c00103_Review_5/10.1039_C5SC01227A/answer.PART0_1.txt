[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[3] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[4] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

[5] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation
2. Balancing high reaction temperatures needed for propylene formation with unwanted deep dehydrogenation and coking
3. Achieving high propylene selectivity

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing strategies to avoid coke formation
2. Investigating promoters to increase robustness against coking, including:
   - Late transition metals
   - Main-group metals like Sn and Ga
   - Alkali-metal oxides
   - Rare-earth metal oxides
3. Exploring alternative catalysts to the commonly used supported Pt or CrOx
4. Considering the thermodynamic limitations of the endothermic PDH reaction

The opportunities in PDH lie in its potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene, making it an attractive alternative to traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes for light alkene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 由于积碳形成导致的催化剂失活
2. 平衡丙烯形成所需的高反应温度与不需要的深度脱氢和积碳
3. 实现高丙烯选择性

研究人员正在通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 开发避免积碳形成的策略
2. 研究提高抗积碳能力的助剂，包括：
   - 后过渡金属
   - 主族金属如Sn和Ga
   - 碱金属氧化物
   - 稀土金属氧化物
3. 探索替代常用的负载型Pt或CrOx催化剂
4. 考虑PDH吸热反应的热力学限制

PDH的机遇在于由于丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异而带来的潜在盈利能力，使其成为传统蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解工艺生产轻烯烃的有吸引力的替代方案。
