[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Although the recovery rate of propylene from a FCC unit have increased from 29% in 1980 to 80% in 2009, the fast growing demand for propylene still pushes up its price."

[3] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[4] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[5] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

[6] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, especially at high temperatures required for the endothermic reaction.

2. Balancing high reaction temperatures needed for propane-to-propylene conversion with avoiding deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation.

3. Achieving high propylene selectivity while maintaining catalytic activity.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing strategies to avoid coke formation, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst stability and activity.

2. Investigating the use of promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides to increase catalyst robustness against coking.

3. Exploring alternative catalysts to the commonly used supported Pt or CrOx, aiming to combine high activity with better resistance to deactivation.

4. Studying the balance between reaction conditions that favor propylene formation and those that minimize unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

These efforts aim to develop catalysts with improved high-temperature stability, enhanced propylene selectivity, and better resistance to side reactions, while considering the thermodynamic limitations of the PDH process. The goal is to make PDH a more competitive and sustainable alternative to traditional propylene production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, especially given the growing demand for propylene and the potential profitability due to the price difference between propane and propylene.

在工业丙烯生产中,丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括:

1. 由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活,特别是在吸热反应所需的高温条件下。

2. 平衡丙烷转化为丙烯所需的高反应温度与避免导致焦炭形成的深度脱氢。

3. 在保持催化活性的同时实现高丙烯选择性。

研究人员正通过以下方式应对这些挑战:

1. 开发避免焦炭形成的策略,这对维持催化剂的稳定性和活性至关重要。

2. 研究使用后过渡金属、主族金属(Sn、Ga)、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物等促进剂,以提高催化剂抗焦炭能力。

3. 探索替代常用的负载型Pt或CrOx催化剂,旨在结合高活性和更好的抗失活能力。

4. 研究有利于丙烯形成的反应条件与最小化不需要的副反应和焦炭形成之间的平衡。

这些努力旨在开发具有改进的高温稳定性、增强的丙烯选择性和更好的抗副反应能力的催化剂,同时考虑PDH过程的热力学限制。目标是使PDH成为比传统的丙烯生产方法(如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂化)更具竞争力和可持续性的替代方案,特别是考虑到丙烯需求的不断增长以及丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异所带来的潜在盈利能力。
