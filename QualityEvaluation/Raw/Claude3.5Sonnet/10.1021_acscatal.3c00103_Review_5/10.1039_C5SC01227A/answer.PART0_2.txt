[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Although the recovery rate of propylene from a FCC unit have increased from 29% in 1980 to 80% in 2009, the fast growing demand for propylene still pushes up its price."

[3] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[4] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[5] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

[6] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. High demand and profitability: There is a fast-growing demand for propylene, pushing up its price. PDH shows high potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue.

3. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic reaction, requiring high temperatures to favor propane-to-propylene transformation. However, high temperatures also enhance undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation.

4. Need for improved catalysts: Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing strategies to avoid coke formation and increase catalyst robustness. This includes:

   a) Using additional promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn and Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides.
   
   b) Focusing on high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions.

5. Exploring alternatives: PDH is being explored as an alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha and other oil byproducts, which currently dominate light alkene production.

The research in this field aims to optimize catalysts and reaction conditions to balance the thermodynamic requirements for propylene production while minimizing unwanted side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

工业丙烯生产中丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战和机遇包括：

1. 高需求和盈利性：丙烯需求快速增长，推高了其价格。由于丙烷和丙烯之间的巨大价格差异，PDH显示出高盈利潜力。

2. 催化剂失活：虽然负载型Pt催化剂表现出高活性，但由于积碳形成导致的催化剂失活仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。

3. 热力学限制：PDH是一个吸热反应，需要高温来有利于丙烷到丙烯的转化。然而，高温也会增强不期望的深度脱氢，导致积碳形成。

4. 需要改进的催化剂：研究人员正在通过开发避免积碳形成和提高催化剂稳定性的策略来应对这些挑战。这包括：

   a) 使用额外的促进剂，如晚过渡金属、主族金属（Sn和Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物。
   
   b) 关注高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抗副反应能力。

5. 探索替代方案：PDH正被探索作为传统方法（如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解石脑油及其他油类副产品）的替代方案，这些传统方法目前主导着轻烯烃生产。

该领域的研究旨在优化催化剂和反应条件，以平衡丙烯生产的热力学要求，同时最小化不必要的副反应和催化剂失活。
