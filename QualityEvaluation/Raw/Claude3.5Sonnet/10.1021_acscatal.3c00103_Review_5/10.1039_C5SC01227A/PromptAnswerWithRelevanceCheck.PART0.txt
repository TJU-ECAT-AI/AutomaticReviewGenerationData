[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Although the recovery rate of propylene from a FCC unit have increased from 29% in 1980 to 80% in 2009, the fast growing demand for propylene still pushes up its price."

[3] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[4] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[5] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

[6] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Catalyst deactivation due to coke formation, especially at high temperatures required for the endothermic reaction.

2. Balancing high reaction temperatures needed for propane-to-propylene conversion with avoiding deep dehydrogenation that leads to coke formation.

3. Achieving high propylene selectivity while maintaining catalytic activity.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing strategies to avoid coke formation, which is crucial for maintaining catalyst stability and activity.

2. Investigating the use of promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides to increase catalyst robustness against coking.

3. Exploring alternative catalysts to the commonly used supported Pt or CrOx, aiming to combine high activity with better resistance to deactivation.

4. Studying the balance between reaction conditions that favor propylene formation and those that minimize unwanted side reactions and coke formation.

These efforts aim to develop catalysts with improved high-temperature stability, enhanced propylene selectivity, and better resistance to side reactions, while considering the thermodynamic limitations of the PDH process. The goal is to make PDH a more competitive and sustainable alternative to traditional propylene production methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, especially given the growing demand for propylene and the potential profitability due to the price difference between propane and propylene.
