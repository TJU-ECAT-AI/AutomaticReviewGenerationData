[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Although the recovery rate of propylene from a FCC unit have increased from 29% in 1980 to 80% in 2009, the fast growing demand for propylene still pushes up its price."

[3] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[4] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[5] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

[6] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. High demand and profitability: There is a fast-growing demand for propylene, pushing up its price. PDH shows high potential profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue.

3. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic reaction, requiring high temperatures to favor propane-to-propylene transformation. However, high temperatures also enhance undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation.

4. Need for improved catalysts: Researchers are addressing these challenges by developing strategies to avoid coke formation and increase catalyst robustness. This includes:

   a) Using additional promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides.
   b) Focusing on high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions.

5. Alternative to traditional methods: PDH is being explored as an alternative to traditional methods like steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha and other oil byproducts, which currently dominate light alkene production.

The research in this field is primarily focused on developing catalysts that can withstand high temperatures, maintain high propylene selectivity, and resist coking and other side reactions, while operating within the thermodynamic constraints of the PDH reaction.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战和机遇包括：

1. 高需求和盈利能力：丙烯需求快速增长，推高其价格。由于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异较大，PDH显示出高盈利潜力。

2. 催化剂失活：虽然负载型铂催化剂显示出高活性，但由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。

3. 热力学限制：PDH是一个吸热反应，需要高温来有利于丙烷到丙烯的转化。然而，高温也会增强不desired的深度脱氢，导致焦炭形成。

4. 需要改进的催化剂：研究人员正在通过开发避免焦炭形成和提高催化剂稳定性的策略来应对这些挑战。这包括：

   a) 使用额外的促进剂，如后过渡金属、主族金属（Sn，Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物。
   b) 专注于高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和对副反应的抵抗力。

5. 传统方法的替代：PDH正在被探索作为传统方法（如蒸汽裂解和石脑油等油品的流化催化裂解）的替代方法，这些方法目前主导着轻烯烃的生产。

该领域的研究主要集中在开发能够承受高温、保持高丙烯选择性、抵抗结焦和其他副反应的催化剂，同时在PDH反应的热力学限制内运作。
