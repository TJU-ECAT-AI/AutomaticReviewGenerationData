[1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."

[2] "Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production."

[3] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."

[4] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for high temperatures to overcome thermodynamic limitations, which leads to side reactions and catalyst deactivation. The main causes of catalyst deactivation are sintering and coke deposition. 

Researchers are addressing these challenges by focusing on developing catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity. They are employing various strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding resistance to sintering and coke formation. These strategies include:

1. Introducing promoters
2. Encapsulation
3. Hydroxyl anchoring
4. Support modifications

These approaches aim to regulate active sites, inhibit sintering and coke deposition, and improve overall catalyst performance. However, each strategy comes with its own set of challenges, such as economic viability, complexity in production processes, and the need for further research to optimize their effectiveness.

The opportunities in PDH lie in the potential to develop more efficient and stable catalysts that can withstand high temperatures while maintaining high propylene selectivity. This would lead to improved industrial production of highly pure propylene, meeting the growing demand for this important chemical feedstock.
