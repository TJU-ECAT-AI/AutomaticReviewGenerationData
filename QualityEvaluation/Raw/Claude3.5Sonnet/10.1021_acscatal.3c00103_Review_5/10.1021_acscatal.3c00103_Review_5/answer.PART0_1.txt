[1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."

[2] "Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production."

[3] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."

[4] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include the need for high temperatures to overcome thermodynamic limitations, which can lead to side reactions and catalyst deactivation. The main causes of catalyst deactivation are sintering and coke deposition. Researchers are addressing these challenges by focusing on developing catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity.

To improve catalyst performance, researchers are employing several strategies:

1. Introducing promoters to regulate active sites and inhibit sintering and coke deposition.
2. Using encapsulation techniques to control particle size, adjust active sites, and create spatial segmentation.
3. Applying hydroxyl anchoring methods to secure active sites.
4. Modifying catalyst supports to enhance stability and selectivity.

These approaches aim to create high-performance catalysts with improved resistance to sintering and coke formation, thus addressing the need for catalysts that can withstand high temperatures while maintaining high propylene selectivity and minimizing side reactions.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括需要高温来克服热力学限制，这可能导致副反应和催化剂失活。催化剂失活的主要原因是烧结和积碳。研究人员正在通过专注于开发具有高稳定性和丙烯选择性的催化剂来应对这些挑战。

为了提高催化剂性能，研究人员采用了几种策略：

1. 引入助剂以调节活性位点并抑制烧结和积碳。
2. 使用包覆技术控制粒子大小，调整活性位点，并创建空间分隔。
3. 应用羟基锚定方法来固定活性位点。
4. 修改催化剂载体以提高稳定性和选择性。

这些方法旨在创造具有改善的抗烧结和抗积碳能力的高性能催化剂，从而解决需要能够承受高温同时保持高丙烯选择性和最小化副反应的催化剂的问题。
