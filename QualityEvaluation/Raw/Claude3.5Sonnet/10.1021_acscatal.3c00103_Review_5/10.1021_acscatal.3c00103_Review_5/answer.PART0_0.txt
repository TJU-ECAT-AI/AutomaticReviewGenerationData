[1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."

[2] "Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production."

[3] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."

[4] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. High temperature requirements: The PDH reaction requires high temperatures for efficient propane conversion, but this leads to side reactions and catalyst development challenges.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Sintering and coke deposition are major causes of catalyst deactivation, reducing the efficiency and lifespan of catalysts.

3. Balancing stability and selectivity: There is an urgent need for catalysts with both high stability and propylene selectivity to meet industrial production demands.

Researchers are addressing these challenges through several strategies:

1. Promoter addition: Introducing promoters to regulate active sites and inhibit sintering and coke deposition.

2. Encapsulation: Developing techniques to encapsulate metal or metal oxide clusters within zeolite matrices for better size control and spatial segmentation.

3. Hydroxyl anchoring: Using methods like SOMC (Surface Organometallic Chemistry) to anchor active sites onto supports.

4. Support modifications: Exploring different support morphologies and developing hierarchical zeolites to reduce diffusion limitations and improve catalyst performance.

These approaches aim to create high-performance catalysts with improved resistance to sintering and coking, while maintaining high propylene selectivity under the demanding conditions of PDH reactions.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 高温要求：PDH反应需要高温以实现高效的丙烷转化，但这会导致副反应和催化剂开发的挑战。

2. 催化剂失活：烧结和积碳是催化剂失活的主要原因，降低了催化剂的效率和使用寿命。

3. 平衡稳定性和选择性：迫切需要具有高稳定性和丙烯选择性的催化剂，以满足工业生产需求。

研究人员正通过以下几种策略来应对这些挑战：

1. 添加助剂：引入助剂来调节活性位点，抑制烧结和积碳。

2. 包覆：开发将金属或金属氧化物簇包覆在沸石基质中的技术，以实现更好的尺寸控制和空间分隔。

3. 羟基锚定：使用表面有机金属化学（SOMC）等方法将活性位点锚定到载体上。

4. 载体改性：探索不同的载体形态，开发分级沸石，以减少扩散限制，提高催化剂性能。

这些方法旨在创造高性能催化剂，在PDH反应的苛刻条件下提高抗烧结和抗积碳能力，同时保持高丙烯选择性。
