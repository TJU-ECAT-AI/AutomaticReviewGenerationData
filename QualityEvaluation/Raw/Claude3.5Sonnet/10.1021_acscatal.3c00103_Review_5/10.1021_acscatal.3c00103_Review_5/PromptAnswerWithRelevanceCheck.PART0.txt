[1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."

[2] "Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production."

[3] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."

[4] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. High temperature requirements: The PDH reaction requires high temperatures for efficient propane conversion, but this leads to side reactions and catalyst development challenges.

2. Catalyst deactivation: Sintering and coke deposition are major causes of catalyst deactivation, reducing the efficiency and lifespan of catalysts.

3. Balancing stability and selectivity: There is an urgent need for catalysts with both high stability and propylene selectivity to meet industrial production demands.

Researchers are addressing these challenges through several strategies:

1. Promoter addition: Introducing promoters to regulate active sites and inhibit sintering and coke deposition.

2. Encapsulation: Developing techniques to encapsulate metal or metal oxide clusters within zeolite matrices for better size control and spatial segmentation.

3. Hydroxyl anchoring: Using methods like SOMC (Surface Organometallic Chemistry) to anchor active sites onto supports.

4. Support modifications: Exploring different support morphologies and developing hierarchical zeolites to reduce diffusion limitations and improve catalyst performance.

These approaches aim to create high-performance catalysts with improved resistance to sintering and coking, while maintaining high propylene selectivity under the demanding conditions of PDH reactions.
