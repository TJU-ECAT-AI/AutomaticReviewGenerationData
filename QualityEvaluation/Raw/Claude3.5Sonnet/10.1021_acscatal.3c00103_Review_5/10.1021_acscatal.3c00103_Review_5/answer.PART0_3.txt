[1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."

[2] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."

[3] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."

[4] "Adding promoters is one of the most efficient strategies in active site regulation to inhibit sintering and coke deposition. Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."

[5] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. High temperature requirements: PDH reactions require high temperatures for optimal propane conversion, which can lead to side reactions and catalyst deactivation.

2. Catalyst deactivation: The main causes are sintering (particle agglomeration) and coke deposition on active sites.

3. Balancing catalyst stability and economic viability: Strategies to improve catalyst performance often involve expensive materials or complex processes.

Researchers are addressing these challenges through various approaches:

1. Developing catalysts with improved stability and propylene selectivity at high temperatures.

2. Introducing promoters to regulate active sites and inhibit sintering and coke deposition.

3. Employing encapsulation techniques for better size control, site adjustment, and spatial segmentation of catalysts.

4. Exploring hydroxyl anchoring and support modifications to enhance catalyst performance.

5. Investigating economical and universal strategies for controllable encapsulation and promoter addition.

The main opportunities lie in refining these approaches to create more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for industrial PDH processes.
