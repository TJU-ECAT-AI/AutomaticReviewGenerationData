          [1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Although the recovery rate of propylene from a FCC unit have increased from 29% in 1980 to 80% in 2009, the fast growing demand for propylene still pushes up its price."

[3] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[4] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[5] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

[6] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

          The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. High demand and profitability: There is a growing demand for propylene, creating an opportunity for PDH as an alternative production method due to the price difference between propane and propylene.

2. Catalyst deactivation: A major challenge is the deactivation of catalysts, particularly supported Pt catalysts, due to coke formation. This necessitates the development of more stable catalysts.

3. High-temperature requirements: PDH is an endothermic reaction, requiring high temperatures for favorable propane-to-propylene conversion. However, these high temperatures also promote undesired deep dehydrogenation and coke formation.

4. Selectivity: Achieving high propylene selectivity while minimizing side reactions and coke formation is crucial.

5. Thermodynamic limitations: The endothermic nature of the reaction poses thermodynamic challenges that need to be addressed in process design.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing new catalyst formulations: Investigating promoters such as late transition metals, main-group metals (Sn, Ga), alkali-metal oxides, and rare-earth metal oxides to enhance catalyst stability and resistance to coking.

2. Optimizing reaction conditions: Balancing temperature requirements to maximize propylene yield while minimizing coke formation.

3. Exploring novel catalyst supports and structures: Aiming to improve catalyst performance and longevity.

4. Investigating regeneration techniques: Developing methods to effectively remove coke and restore catalyst activity.

5. Process integration: Designing PDH processes that efficiently manage heat requirements and product separation.

These research efforts aim to make PDH a more viable and competitive process for industrial propylene production by addressing the key challenges of catalyst stability, selectivity, and overall process efficiency.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战和机遇包括：

1. 高需求和盈利能力：丙烯需求不断增长，由于丙烷和丙烯之间的价格差异，PDH成为一种有潜力的替代生产方法。

2. 催化剂失活：主要挑战之一是催化剂（特别是负载型铂催化剂）由于积碳而失活。这需要开发更稳定的催化剂。

3. 高温要求：PDH是一个吸热反应，需要高温才能有利于丙烷向丙烯的转化。然而，这些高温也会促进不期望的深度脱氢和积碳形成。

4. 选择性：在最小化副反应和积碳形成的同时，实现高丙烯选择性至关重要。

5. 热力学限制：反应的吸热性质给过程设计带来了热力学挑战，需要加以解决。

研究人员正在通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 开发新的催化剂配方：研究后过渡金属、主族金属（Sn、Ga）、碱金属氧化物和稀土金属氧化物等助剂，以提高催化剂的稳定性和抗积碳能力。

2. 优化反应条件：平衡温度要求，以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化积碳形成。

3. 探索新型催化剂载体和结构：旨在提高催化剂性能和寿命。

4. 研究再生技术：开发有效去除积碳并恢复催化剂活性的方法。

5. 过程集成：设计能够有效管理热量需求和产品分离的PDH工艺。

这些研究努力旨在通过解决催化剂稳定性、选择性和整体过程效率的关键挑战，使PDH成为工业丙烯生产更可行和更具竞争力的工艺。
