          [1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."

[2] "Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production."

[3] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."

[4] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."

[5] "Adding promoters is one of the most efficient strategies in active site regulation to inhibit sintering and coke deposition. Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."

[6] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."

          The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. High temperature requirements: PDH reactions require high temperatures for optimal propane conversion due to thermodynamic limitations. This can lead to side reactions and catalyst development challenges.

2. Catalyst deactivation: The main causes are sintering (particle agglomeration) and coke deposition on active sites.

3. Balancing catalyst stability, selectivity, and economic viability: There is an urgent need for catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity to meet industrial production demands. However, strategies to improve catalyst performance often involve expensive materials or complex processes.

Researchers are addressing these challenges through various approaches:

1. Introducing promoters: This is one of the most efficient strategies for regulating active sites and inhibiting sintering and coke deposition. However, excessive amounts of metal promoters can make catalysts uneconomical.

2. Encapsulation: This is a hot topic in developing stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, site adjustment, and spatial segmentation.

3. Hydroxyl anchoring: This method is used to secure active sites on catalyst supports.

4. Support modifications: These aim to enhance catalyst stability and selectivity.

5. Developing catalysts with improved high-temperature stability and propylene selectivity.

The main opportunities lie in refining these approaches to create more efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for industrial PDH processes, while considering the thermodynamic limitations of the reaction.

          丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 高温要求：由于热力学限制，PDH反应需要高温才能实现最佳丙烷转化。这可能导致副反应和催化剂开发的挑战。

2. 催化剂失活：主要原因是烧结（粒子团聚）和活性位上的积碳。

3. 平衡催化剂的稳定性、选择性和经济可行性：迫切需要具有高稳定性和丙烯选择性的催化剂以满足工业生产需求。然而，提高催化剂性能的策略通常涉及昂贵的材料或复杂的工艺。

研究人员正通过各种方法解决这些挑战：

1. 引入助剂：这是调节活性位点并抑制烧结和积碳的最有效策略之一。然而，过量的金属助剂可能使催化剂不经济。

2. 包覆：这是开发稳定PDH催化剂的热门话题，因为它在尺寸控制、位点调整和空间分隔方面具有优势。

3. 羟基锚定：这种方法用于将活性位点固定在催化剂载体上。

4. 载体改性：旨在提高催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

5. 开发具有改进的高温稳定性和丙烯选择性的催化剂。

主要机会在于完善这些方法，以创造更高效、稳定和具有成本效益的工业PDH过程催化剂，同时考虑反应的热力学限制。
