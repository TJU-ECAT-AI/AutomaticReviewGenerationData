          [1] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."

[2] "Steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Great efforts have been made to improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by using various strategies. However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."

[4] "Advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."

[5] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."

[6] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging. Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."

[7] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency."

[8] "Developing low-temperature and highly selective catalysts is the direction for their industrial application for ODH reactions."

[9] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."

          The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations on propane conversion and productivity
2. Limited equilibrium conversion and prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures
3. Need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to deactivation
4. High noble metal loadings and deactivation rates of current catalysts
5. Insufficient understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions
6. Lack of suitable alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts

Researchers are addressing these challenges through:

1. Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, due to its more favorable thermodynamics
2. Developing low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for ODH reactions
3. Investigating novel catalytic materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) that show high selectivity to propylene
4. Improving existing CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts through various strategies to enhance their performance
5. Employing advanced characterization techniques, such as operando/in situ methods (XAFS, XRD, XPS, E-TEM), to better understand active sites and reaction mechanisms
6. Researching alternative catalysts with lower noble metal content to reduce costs and improve stability

Opportunities in PDH research include:

1. Developing efficient catalyst design strategies and exploring new chemistry
2. Creating catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity and stability
3. Improving overall energy efficiency of the PDH process
4. Discovering novel materials and structures for catalysts that can overcome the limitations of conventional systems
5. Enhancing the fundamental understanding of catalyst behavior under realistic reaction conditions
