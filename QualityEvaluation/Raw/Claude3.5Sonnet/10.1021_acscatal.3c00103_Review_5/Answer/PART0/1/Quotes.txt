[1] "Dehydrogenation of C2 and C3 alkanes are particularly of interest as alternatives to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking for obtaining C2 and C3 alkenes."

[2] "Alkane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process in which alkene yields are limited by the reaction thermodynamics."

[3] "Although the equilibrium conversion of alkanes increases with temperature, alkene selectivity decreases with increasing temperature and chain length due to an increased tendency toward dehydrocyclization/aromatisation, thermal cracking and coke formation."

[4] "Current industrial alkane dehydrogenation catalysts are platinum and chromium based."

[5] "Industrial alkane dehydrogenations are non-oxidative highly endothermic processes."

[6] "Auto-thermal and oxidative alkane dehydrogenation strategies can offset a significant fraction of the required energy input."

[7] "Commercial platinum catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation are typically prepared by impregnating the support material with a solution of platinum and tin precursors."

[8] "Platinum is usually promoted with tin to improve its performance and stability for alkane dehydrogenation."

[9] "Alumina is a common support material for platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Prior titration of acidic sites on the aluminum with alkali minimizes undesired acid catalytic cracking and coking side reactions."

[10] "Industrial chromium oxide dehydrogenation catalysts are prepared by impregnation of an aqueous solution of chromate salt between 5 and 15 wt.% Cr loadings on high surface support material"

[1] "PDH has been considered one of the most promising techniques to obtain highly pure propylene and applied in industrial propylene production for decades. High temperature is preferable to achieve high propane conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation of the PDH reaction, which can induce a series of side reactions and pose challenges to the development of PDH catalysts."

[2] "Currently, exploring catalysts with high stability and propylene selectivity is still urgent to meet further demand for industrial production."

[3] "Sintering and coke deposition are the main causes for the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts."

[4] "Introducing promoters, encapsulation, hydroxyl anchoring, support modifications, and so forth have been proven to be the most efficient strategies to build high-performance catalysts with outstanding antisintering and anticoke ability."

[5] "Adding promoters is one of the most efficient strategies in active site regulation to inhibit sintering and coke deposition. Excessive amounts of metal promoters are needed in metal-based catalysts to construct and sustain stable intermetallic compounds or alloys, making these catalysts uneconomical."

[6] "Encapsulation is one of the hottest topics in the construction of stable PDH catalysts due to its advantages in size control, sites adjustment, and spatial segmentation."

[1] "Currently, the most common approaches to produce light alkenes are steam creaking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel and other oil byproducts."

[2] "Although the recovery rate of propylene from a FCC unit have increased from 29% in 1980 to 80% in 2009, the fast growing demand for propylene still pushes up its price."

[3] "Thus, an alternative process, such as the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), shows a high potential in profitability due to the large price difference between propane and propylene."

[4] "Currently, the most commonly used commercial PDH catalysts include supported Pt or CrOx. Although supported Pt catalysts show high activity, the catalyst deactivation due to coke formation remains a challenging issue."

[5] "Moreover, since PDH is an endothermic reaction (ΔH298K = 124 kJ mol1), high reaction temperatures favor transformation from propane to propylene. However, the undesired deep dehydrogenation leading to coke formation is also enhanced at high temperatures."

[6] "Thus, the development of strategies to avoid coke formation is an important field of research. The robustness against coking can be increased with additional promoters, such as late transition metals, main-group metals including Sn and Ga, alkali-metal oxides and rare-earth metal oxides."

[1] "Propylene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates, is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes"

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[4] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 or SiO2 are most widely used."

[5] "High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process."

[6] "Coke deposition is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation, while the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species under high temperatures are responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reaction."

[7] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH, it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."

[8] "Under optimized conditions, a high propylene production rate of 4.11 molC3H6·molPt-1·s-1, high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h-1 can be simultaneously achieved at 823 K."

[1] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."

[2] "Steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Great efforts have been made to improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by using various strategies. However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."

[4] "Advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."

[5] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."

[6] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging. Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."

[7] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency."

[8] "Developing low-temperature and highly selective catalysts is the direction for their industrial application for ODH reactions."

[9] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."

[1] "Current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[2] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

[4] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[5] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[6] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."
