The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations: PDH is an endothermic process with limited alkene yields due to reaction thermodynamics.

2. High temperature requirements: While higher temperatures increase alkane conversion, they also lead to decreased alkene selectivity and increased side reactions such as dehydrocyclization, aromatization, thermal cracking, and coke formation.

3. Catalyst stability: Catalysts must withstand high temperatures and resist deactivation.
