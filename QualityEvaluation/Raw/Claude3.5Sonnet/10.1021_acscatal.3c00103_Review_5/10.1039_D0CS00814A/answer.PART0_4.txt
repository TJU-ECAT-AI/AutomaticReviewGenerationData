The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity in direct dehydrogenation routes.

2. Need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions.

3. Development of efficient design strategies and new chemistry for superior dehydrogenation performance.

4. Finding alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts.

5. Understanding active sites and reaction mechanisms under real reaction conditions.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) as alternative processes to overcome thermodynamic limitations.

2. Developing low-temperature and highly selective catalysts for ODH reactions.

3. Investigating novel materials such as transition-metal nitrides and carbides as potential economic alternatives to noble-metal catalysts.

4. Employing advanced characterization techniques like operando/in situ XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM to reveal active sites and mechanisms under reaction conditions.

5. Utilizing theoretical calculations and establishing more realistic models to assist in explaining experimental results and guide catalyst design.

These efforts aim to improve catalyst performance, increase propylene selectivity, and enhance overall process efficiency in industrial propylene production via PDH.
