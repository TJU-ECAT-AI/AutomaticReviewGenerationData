[1] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."

[2] "Steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Great efforts have been made to improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by using various strategies. However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."

[4] "Advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."

[5] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."

[6] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging. Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."
