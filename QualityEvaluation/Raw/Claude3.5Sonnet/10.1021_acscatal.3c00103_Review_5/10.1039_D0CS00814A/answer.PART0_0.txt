[1] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."

[2] "Steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Great efforts have been made to improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by using various strategies. However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."

[4] "Advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."

[5] "Research on alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts remains a great challenge."

[6] "Revealing the active sites and mechanisms of these catalysts under reaction conditions is highly urgent and challenging. Operando/in situ characterization techniques should be encouraged and operated, such as in situ and time-resolved XAFS, XRD, XPS, and environmental TEM (E-TEM)."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Limited equilibrium conversion and prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures
2. Need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions
3. High noble metal loadings and deactivation rates of current catalysts
4. Insufficient understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions
5. Lack of suitable alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based catalysts

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing efficient catalyst design strategies and exploring new chemistry
2. Improving the performance of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts through various strategies
3. Seeking catalysts with lower noble metal loadings and improved stability
4. Employing advanced characterization techniques, such as operando/in situ methods (XAFS, XRD, XPS, E-TEM), to better understand active sites and reaction mechanisms
5. Investigating alternative catalysts to conventional metal and metal oxide-based materials

Despite these efforts, there are still significant opportunities for improvement in PDH catalyst design and performance, as well as in the fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms and active sites under realistic conditions.

工业丙烯生产中丙烷脱氢(PDH)的主要挑战包括：

1. 平衡转化率有限，高温下副反应普遍发生
2. 需要具有高温稳定性、丙烯选择性和抗副反应能力的催化剂
3. 当前催化剂的贵金属负载量高，失活率高
4. 对反应条件下的活性位点和反应机理了解不足
5. 缺乏合适的替代传统金属和金属氧化物基催化剂的替代品

研究人员正通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 开发高效的催化剂设计策略并探索新化学
2. 通过各种策略改进CrOx和Pt基催化剂的性能
3. 寻求具有更低贵金属负载量和改进稳定性的催化剂
4. 采用先进的表征技术，如原位/同步方法（XAFS、XRD、XPS、E-TEM），以更好地理解活性位点和反应机理
5. 研究传统金属和金属氧化物基材料的替代催化剂

尽管做出了这些努力，PDH催化剂设计和性能以及在实际条件下对反应机理和活性位点的基本理解方面仍有显著的改进机会。
