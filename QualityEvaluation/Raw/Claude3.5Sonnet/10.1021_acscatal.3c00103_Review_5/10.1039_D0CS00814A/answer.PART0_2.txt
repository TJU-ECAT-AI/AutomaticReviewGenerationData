[1] "Although direct dehydrogenation routes have been industrialized, the propane productivity is still thermodynamically limited. Comparatively, ODH due to its favorable thermodynamics has the potential to improve reaction efficiency."

[2] "Steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Great efforts have been made to improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by using various strategies. However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."

[4] "Recently, I. Hermans and coworkers reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibited unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in great selectivity to olefins of about 79% propylene and 12% ethylene."

[5] "Developing low-temperature and highly selective catalysts is the direction for their industrial application for ODH reactions."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations on propane conversion
2. Prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures
3. Need for catalysts with high-temperature stability 
4. Improving propylene selectivity
5. Reducing noble metal loadings in catalysts
6. Decreasing catalyst deactivation rates

Researchers are addressing these challenges through several approaches:

1. Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, due to its more favorable thermodynamics
2. Investigating novel catalytic materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) that show high selectivity to propylene
3. Developing low-temperature catalysts to reduce side reactions and improve energy efficiency
4. Improving existing CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts through various strategies to enhance their performance
5. Researching alternative catalysts with lower noble metal content to reduce costs
6. Focusing on creating highly selective and stable catalysts that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions

These efforts aim to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of PDH while improving catalyst performance, stability, and selectivity to make the process more economically viable and environmentally friendly for industrial propylene production.
