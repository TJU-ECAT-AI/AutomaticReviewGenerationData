The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Limited equilibrium conversion and prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures
2. Catalyst deactivation and need for lower noble metal loadings
3. Thermodynamic limitations on propane productivity

Researchers are addressing these challenges through:

1. Developing more efficient catalyst design strategies and exploring new chemistry
2. Investigating oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) as an alternative to direct dehydrogenation, due to its more favorable thermodynamics
3. Focusing on creating low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for ODH reactions
4. Improving existing CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts to enhance stability, selectivity, and resistance to deactivation
5. Exploring alternative catalyst materials and structures to overcome limitations of conventional catalysts

The main opportunities lie in developing novel catalytic systems and processes that can overcome the thermodynamic limitations, improve energy efficiency, and enhance catalyst stability and selectivity at industrially relevant conditions.
