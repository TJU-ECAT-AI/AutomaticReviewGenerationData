[1] "Although various catalysts have shown superior dehydrogenation performance, the efficient design strategies and new chemistry have not been well summarized."

[2] "Steps will need to be taken to overcome drawbacks of this reaction and improve the energy efficiency, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Great efforts have been made to improve the performances of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts by using various strategies. However, further improvements with lower noble metal loadings and deactivation rates are highly desired."

[4] "Advanced characterization and deeper discussion of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions are still inadequate."

[5] "Although grand opportunities exist, several major challenges in the aspects of dehydrogenation technologies, catalyst development and characterization as well as theoretical stimulation methods should be considered."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Limited equilibrium conversion and prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures
2. Need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to deactivation
3. Reducing noble metal loadings while maintaining catalyst performance
4. Inadequate understanding of active sites and reaction mechanisms under reaction conditions

Researchers are addressing these challenges through:

1. Developing alternative dehydrogenation processes like oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH)
2. Exploring novel catalyst designs and materials, including single-atom catalysts and transition-metal nitrides and carbides
3. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques such as operando/in situ methods to better understand catalyst behavior under reaction conditions
4. Improving theoretical models and simulations to better match experimental conditions and catalyst complexities

Opportunities in PDH research include:

1. Developing low-temperature, highly selective catalysts for ODH reactions
2. Coupling PDH with exothermic reactions to improve overall energy efficiency
3. Exploring ambient temperature or near-ambient catalytic dehydrogenation processes like photocatalysis and electrocatalysis
4. Scaling up the production of catalysts with well-defined structures, particularly single-atom catalysts
