[1] "Current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Thermodynamic limitations leading to limited equilibrium conversion
2. Prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures
3. Need for catalysts with high-temperature stability
4. Requirement for high propylene selectivity
5. Necessity for catalysts resistant to deactivation

Researchers are addressing these challenges through several approaches:

1. Developing improved catalysts with lower noble metal loading and increased stability
2. Exploring alternative catalysts, particularly metal oxides like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx
3. Investigating oxidative dehydrogenation to overcome thermodynamic limitations
4. Improving energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process
5. Studying regeneration techniques to recover catalyst activity

Despite these efforts, a practicable alternative to the current PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. The main hurdles for alternative formulations are rapid deactivation due to coke deposition and incomplete activity recovery after regeneration. Oxidative dehydrogenation is being explored as a potential solution to achieve full paraffin conversion and overcome thermodynamic limitations, but it introduces new challenges such as avoiding overoxidation of hydrocarbons.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 热力学限制导致平衡转化率有限
2. 高温下副反应普遍存在
3. 需要具有高温稳定性的催化剂
4. 要求高丙烯选择性
5. 需要抗失活的催化剂

研究人员正通过以下几种方法来应对这些挑战：

1. 开发贵金属负载量更低、稳定性更高的改进型催化剂
2. 探索替代催化剂，特别是GaOx、MoOx和VOx等金属氧化物
3. 研究氧化脱氢以克服热力学限制
4. 提高脱氢过程的能源效率
5. 研究再生技术以恢复催化剂活性

尽管做出了这些努力，但目前还没有开发出可替代现有PtSn和CrOx系统的实用替代方案。替代配方的主要障碍是由于焦炭沉积导致的快速失活以及再生后活性无法完全恢复。氧化脱氢正在被探索作为一种潜在的解决方案，以实现全烷烃转化并克服热力学限制，但它也带来了新的挑战，如避免碳氢化合物过度氧化。
