[1] "Current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

[2] "Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[3] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

[4] "To be commercially attractive, dehydrogenation catalysts must provide high olefin yields at high space velocities. In other words, catalysts should display high specific activity, which is to say good conversion at short contact times."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Improving catalyst stability at high temperatures
2. Increasing propylene selectivity
3. Reducing side reactions
4. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations on conversion
5. Developing catalysts with high specific activity

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Exploring alternative catalysts, particularly metal oxides like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx
2. Working to lower noble metal loading in existing catalysts
3. Improving energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process
4. Investigating ways to increase catalyst resistance to coke deposition
5. Developing more effective catalyst regeneration methods

However, a practicable alternative to the current PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. The main opportunities lie in creating catalysts that can maintain high activity and selectivity at high space velocities while resisting deactivation. Researchers are also exploring ways to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of the reaction, such as through the use of membrane reactors or oxidative dehydrogenation approaches.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 提高催化剂在高温下的稳定性
2. 提高丙烯选择性
3. 减少副反应
4. 克服转化率的热力学限制
5. 开发具有高比活性的催化剂

研究人员正通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 探索替代催化剂，特别是GaOx、MoOx和VOx等金属氧化物
2. 努力降低现有催化剂中的贵金属负载量
3. 提高脱氢过程的能源效率
4. 研究提高催化剂抗积碳能力的方法
5. 开发更有效的催化剂再生方法

然而，目前尚未开发出可替代当前PtSn和CrOx系统的实用替代品。主要机会在于创造能在高空速下保持高活性和选择性，同时抵抗失活的催化剂。研究人员还在探索克服反应热力学限制的方法，例如使用膜反应器或氧化脱氢方法。
