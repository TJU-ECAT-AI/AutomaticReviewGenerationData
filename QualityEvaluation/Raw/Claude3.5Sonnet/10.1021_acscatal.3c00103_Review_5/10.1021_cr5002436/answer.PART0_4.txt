[1] "Current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."

[2] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."

[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved."

[4] "An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction."

[5] "Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Limited equilibrium conversion
2. Prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures
3. Catalyst deactivation, mainly due to coke deposition
4. High noble metal loading in current catalysts
5. Energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process

Researchers are addressing these challenges through several approaches:

1. Developing alternative catalysts: Metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx are being investigated as potential replacements for PtSn and CrOx systems. However, these alternatives still face issues with rapid deactivation and incomplete activity recovery after regeneration.

2. Exploring oxidative dehydrogenation: This method eliminates thermodynamic limitations by using an oxidant to combust the hydrogen formed during the reaction, allowing full paraffin conversion. Both O2 and CO2 are being studied as oxidizing agents, each with its own advantages and challenges.

3. Investigating solid oxygen carriers: Materials like CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, and others are being researched for their ability to selectively oxidize hydrogen through the selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction.

4. Implementing membrane technology: Researchers are studying the use of membranes to remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shifting the equilibrium towards propylene production.

5. Improving catalyst stability and regeneration: Efforts are being made to develop catalysts that are more resistant to coking and can maintain their activity over longer periods.

6. Enhancing process monitoring and control: Advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as operando Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy, are being developed to monitor catalyst deactivation and optimize regeneration cycles in industrial settings.

These approaches aim to address the need for catalysts with high-temperature stability, propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions while overcoming thermodynamic limitations.
