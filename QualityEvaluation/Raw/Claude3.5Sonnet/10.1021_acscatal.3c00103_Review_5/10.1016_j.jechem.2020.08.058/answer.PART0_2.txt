[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[2] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[3] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 or SiO2 are most widely used."

[4] "High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process."

[5] "Coke deposition is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation, while the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species under high temperatures are responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reaction."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Improving catalyst activity while reducing costs, especially for precious metal catalysts like platinum.

2. Preventing agglomeration of metal species during reaction and regeneration.

3. Addressing catalytic deactivation at high temperatures.

4. Achieving high propane conversion and good stability simultaneously.

5. Overcoming thermodynamic limitations of the reaction.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Zn to enhance activity and stability.

2. Using high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls (e.g. Al2O3, SiO2) to disperse and stabilize catalyst species.

3. Optimizing zeolite supports like Si-Beta to provide confinement effects and improve catalyst performance.

4. Investigating the causes of catalyst deactivation, such as loss of active species and metal aggregation, to develop more stable catalysts.

5. Fine-tuning reaction conditions and catalyst compositions to achieve high propylene selectivity and production rates.

These efforts aim to create robust, low-cost catalysts suitable for industrial PDH processes that can operate at reasonable temperatures with high stability and selectivity.
