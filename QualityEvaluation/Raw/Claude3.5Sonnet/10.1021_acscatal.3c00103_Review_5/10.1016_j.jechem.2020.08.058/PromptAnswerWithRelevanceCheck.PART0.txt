<quotes>

[1] "Propylene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates, is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes"

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[4] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH, it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."

[5] "Under optimized conditions, a high propylene production rate of 4.11 molC3H6·molPt-1·s-1, high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h-1 can be simultaneously achieved at 823 K."
