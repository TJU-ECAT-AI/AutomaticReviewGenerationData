[1] "Propylene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates, is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes"

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[4] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH, it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."

[5] "Under optimized conditions, a high propylene production rate of 4.11 molC3H6·molPt-1·s-1, high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h-1 can be simultaneously achieved at 823 K."

The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Developing alternatives to traditional energy-intensive and waste-producing methods like steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

2. Improving the activity and efficiency of Pt-based catalysts to reduce costs associated with using precious metals.

3. Addressing the issue of metal species agglomeration and catalytic deactivation during high-temperature reactions.

4. Stabilizing Pt species on supports at high temperatures (723-923 K) required for reasonable propane conversion.

5. Suppressing undesired coke formation during the PDH process.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Zn, to improve catalytic performance and stability.

2. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction parameters to achieve high propylene production rates, selectivity, and sustainability.

3. Using supports like zeolites to stabilize metal species and prevent agglomeration.

4. Investigating the effects of different metal loadings and preparation methods on catalyst performance.

5. Exploring the use of additives like H2 to suppress coke formation and prolong catalyst lifetime.

These efforts aim to create catalysts with high-temperature stability, excellent propylene selectivity, and resistance to side reactions while considering thermodynamic limitations of the PDH process.
