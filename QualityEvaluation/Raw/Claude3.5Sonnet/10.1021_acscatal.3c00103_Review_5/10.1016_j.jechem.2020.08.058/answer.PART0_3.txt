[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[2] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[3] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 or SiO2 are most widely used."

[4] "High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process."

[5] "Coke deposition is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation, while the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species under high temperatures are responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reaction."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Improving catalyst activity while reducing costs, especially for precious metal catalysts like platinum.

2. Preventing agglomeration of metal species and catalyst deactivation during high-temperature reactions.

3. Achieving high propane conversion and propylene selectivity simultaneously.

4. Maintaining catalyst stability over long periods of operation.

5. Addressing thermodynamic limitations of the reaction.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts (e.g., Pt-Zn) to improve activity and stability while reducing platinum usage.

2. Using high-surface-area supports like Al2O3, SiO2, or zeolites to disperse and stabilize active metal species.

3. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods to achieve better metal dispersion and stronger metal-support interactions.

4. Investigating the causes of catalyst deactivation (e.g., coke formation, metal sintering, loss of promoter species) to develop more robust catalysts.

5. Fine-tuning reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, feed composition) to maximize propylene yield while minimizing side reactions.

The development of zeolite-stabilized Pt-Zn catalysts, as described in the literature, represents a promising approach to addressing these challenges by offering high activity, selectivity, and stability at relatively low cost.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战包括：

1. 提高催化剂活性的同时降低成本，特别是对于铂等贵金属催化剂。

2. 防止高温反应过程中金属物种的团聚和催化剂失活。

3. 同时实现高丙烷转化率和高丙烯选择性。

4. 保持催化剂在长期运行中的稳定性。

5. 解决反应的热力学限制。

研究人员正通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 开发双金属催化剂（如Pt-Zn）以提高活性和稳定性，同时减少铂的使用。

2. 使用高比表面积的载体（如Al2O3、SiO2或沸石）来分散和稳定活性金属物种。

3. 优化催化剂制备方法，以实现更好的金属分散和更强的金属-载体相互作用。

4. 研究催化剂失活的原因（如积碳、金属烧结、助剂流失），以开发更稳定的催化剂。

5. 调整反应条件（温度、压力、进料组成）以最大化丙烯产率，同时最小化副反应。

文献中描述的沸石稳定的Pt-Zn催化剂的开发代表了一种有前景的方法来解决这些挑战，它能够以相对较低的成本提供高活性、高选择性和高稳定性。
