[1] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[2] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[3] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 or SiO2 are most widely used."

[4] "High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process."

[5] "Coke deposition is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation, while the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species under high temperatures are responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reaction."

The primary challenges in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Improving catalyst activity while reducing costs, particularly for precious metal catalysts like platinum.

2. Addressing catalyst deactivation due to metal species agglomeration during reaction and regeneration.

3. Developing catalysts with high-temperature stability.

4. Achieving high propylene selectivity and resistance to side reactions.

5. Operating within thermodynamic limitations of the reaction.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Zn, to improve activity and stability while reducing platinum usage.

2. Using high-surface-area supports like Al2O3, SiO2, and zeolites to disperse and stabilize active metal species.

3. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods to achieve better dispersion and interaction between metal components.

4. Investigating the causes of catalyst deactivation, such as metal species loss and aggregation, to develop more stable catalysts.

5. Fine-tuning reaction conditions and catalyst compositions to maximize propylene yield and selectivity within thermodynamic constraints.

The development of catalysts like Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite shows promise in addressing these challenges by offering high propane conversion, good stability, and low-cost potential for industrial PDH processes.
