          [1] "Propylene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates, is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes"

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[4] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 or SiO2 are most widely used."

[5] "High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process."

[6] "Coke deposition is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation, while the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species under high temperatures are responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reaction."

[7] "Although the introduction of a second component exhibits great potential to improve the catalytic performance and also suppress the undesired coke formation during PDH, it is still important and challenging to stabilize Pt species on the supports under the reaction conditions of high temperatures (723923 K, to reach reasonable propane conversion levels)."

[8] "Under optimized conditions, a high propylene production rate of 4.11 molC3H6·molPt-1·s-1, high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h-1 can be simultaneously achieved at 823 K."

          The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Developing alternatives to traditional energy-intensive and waste-producing methods like steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

2. Improving the activity and efficiency of Pt-based catalysts to reduce costs associated with using precious metals.

3. Addressing the issue of metal species agglomeration and catalytic deactivation during high-temperature reactions (723-923 K).

4. Stabilizing Pt species on supports at high temperatures required for reasonable propane conversion.

5. Suppressing undesired coke formation during the PDH process.

6. Achieving high propylene selectivity and production rates while maintaining catalyst stability.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Developing bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Zn, to improve catalytic performance and stability.

2. Using high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls (e.g., Al2O3, SiO2, zeolites) to disperse and stabilize active metal species.

3. Optimizing catalyst compositions and reaction parameters to achieve high propylene production rates, selectivity, and sustainability.

4. Investigating the causes of catalyst deactivation, such as loss of active species and metal aggregation, to develop more stable catalysts.

5. Fine-tuning reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing side reactions.

These efforts aim to create robust, low-cost catalysts suitable for industrial PDH processes that can operate at reasonable temperatures with high stability and selectivity, while considering thermodynamic limitations of the reaction.
