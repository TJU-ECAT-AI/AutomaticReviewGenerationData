[1] "Propylene, as an important organic intermediates of a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates, is mainly produced via the steam cracking of naphtha or the fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil. However, such routes suffer from high energy consumption and produces heavy wastes"

[2] "Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides an alternative route to petroleum-based propylene with significant industrial relevance"

[3] "It is highly desired to improve the activity of Pt-based catalysts so as to make better use of precious metal platinum and reduce the catalyst cost. On the other hand, the agglomeration of metal species during reaction or the regeneration process and the catalytic deactivation thereof should be well addressed considering potential industrial applications"

[4] "To disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species for PDH, high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls such as Al2O3 or SiO2 are most widely used."

[5] "High propane conversion and good stability could be simultaneously obtained at reasonable reaction temperatures, making Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite a robust low-cost catalyst for industrial PDH process."

The primary challenges and opportunities in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) for industrial propylene production include:

1. Developing alternatives to traditional propylene production methods: PDH offers an alternative to energy-intensive and waste-producing methods like steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking of heavy oil.

2. Improving catalyst performance: Researchers are working to enhance the activity of Pt-based catalysts to maximize the use of precious platinum and reduce costs. 

3. Addressing catalyst stability: The agglomeration of metal species during reaction or regeneration, and subsequent catalyst deactivation, need to be addressed for industrial applications.

4. Developing high-temperature stable catalysts: Catalysts that can maintain performance at the high temperatures required for PDH are needed.

5. Enhancing propylene selectivity: Catalysts that selectively produce propylene while minimizing side reactions are desirable.

Researchers are addressing these challenges by:

1. Using high-surface-area supports with abundant surface hydroxyls, such as Al2O3 or SiO2, to disperse and stabilize Pt-based bicomponent species.

2. Developing new catalyst formulations, such as Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite, which offer high propane conversion and good stability at reasonable reaction temperatures.

3. Optimizing catalyst preparation methods to ensure even distribution of active metal species and enhance their interaction with the support.

4. Investigating bimetallic catalysts to improve stability and selectivity.

5. Studying the deactivation mechanisms to develop strategies for prolonging catalyst lifetime.

While not explicitly mentioned in the given quotes, researchers are likely also considering thermodynamic limitations by optimizing reaction conditions and investigating ways to shift the equilibrium towards propylene production.

丙烷脱氢(PDH)用于工业丙烯生产的主要挑战和机遇包括：

1. 开发传统丙烯生产方法的替代品：PDH为能源密集型和产生大量废物的方法（如石脑油蒸汽裂解或重油流化催化裂解）提供了替代方案。

2. 提高催化剂性能：研究人员正在努力提高铂基催化剂的活性，以最大限度地利用贵金属铂并降低成本。

3. 解决催化剂稳定性问题：需要解决反应或再生过程中金属物种的团聚以及随之而来的催化剂失活问题，以适应工业应用。

4. 开发高温稳定的催化剂：需要能在PDH所需的高温下保持性能的催化剂。

5. 提高丙烯选择性：需要能选择性地生产丙烯同时最小化副反应的催化剂。

研究人员正通过以下方式应对这些挑战：

1. 使用具有丰富表面羟基的高比表面积载体，如Al2O3或SiO2，以分散和稳定铂基双组分物种。

2. 开发新的催化剂配方，如Pt-Zn/Si-Beta沸石，在合理的反应温度下提供高丙烷转化率和良好的稳定性。

3. 优化催化剂制备方法，以确保活性金属物种的均匀分布并增强它们与载体的相互作用。

4. 研究双金属催化剂以提高稳定性和选择性。

5. 研究失活机理，以开发延长催化剂寿命的策略。

虽然在给定的引用中没有明确提到，但研究人员可能还在考虑通过优化反应条件和研究将平衡向丙烯生产转移的方法来应对热力学限制。
