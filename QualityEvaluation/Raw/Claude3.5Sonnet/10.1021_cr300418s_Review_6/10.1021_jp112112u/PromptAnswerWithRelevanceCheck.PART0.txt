[1] "We use density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) and hybrid DFT (HSE06 functional) to study the defects formed when the ceria (110) surface is doped with a series of trivalent dopants, namely, Al3+, Sc3+, Y3+, and In3+."

[2] "Using the hybrid DFT HSE06 exchange-correlation functional as a benchmark, we show that doping the (110) surface with a single trivalent ion leads to formation of a localized MCe/ + OO• (M = the 3+ dopant), O hole state, confirming the description found with DFT+U."

[3] "Although DFT+U is well established in studying ceria, it is not without problems, in particular, the empiricism associated with a choice of U and the dependence of material properties on the value of U used in the calculation."

[4] "Hybrid DFT in a plane-wave basis set is now available and has been used in a number of papers over the last 2 years to study troublesome defect states in some metal oxides, including in ceria, (-26, 41, 42, 60-62) providing an excellent description of many properties."

[5] "Comparison of the hybrid DFT and DFT+U results confirm the DFT+U description so that for investigation of the anion vacancy compensation mechanism (which requires a larger surface supercell and a larger number of calculations), we can apply DFT+U."

4. Exploration of new materials: By simulating various dopants and their effects on the oxide structure and electronic properties, these methods facilitate the exploration of new catalytic materials.

However, there are challenges and considerations:

1. Parameter dependence: The choice of the U parameter in DFT+U can significantly affect the results, introducing an element of empiricism.

2. Computational cost: Hybrid DFT calculations are computationally expensive, limiting the size of systems that can be studied.

3. Validation: It's crucial to validate computational results against experimental data or higher-level calculations when possible.

Overall, these computational approaches provide valuable insights into the atomic-scale processes involved in catalysis, guiding experimental work and accelerating the discovery of new catalytic materials.
