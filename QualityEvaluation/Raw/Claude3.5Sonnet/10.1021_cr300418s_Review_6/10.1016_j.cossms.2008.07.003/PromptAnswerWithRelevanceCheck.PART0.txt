[1] "DFT calculations for some quantities, for some oxides having narrow d- or f- bands, might be in error. We do not know for which oxides this might be true, nor do we know which quantities might be calculated erroneously."

[2] "Given this situation, it is best to study trends, which depend on DFT being qualitatively correct."

[3] "In spite of the reservations expressed above it is reasonable to expect that most results of GGA-DFT are qualitatively correct. While the activation energies may not be accurate, the reaction mechanism is likely to be correct if the activation energy on the most likely pathway is substantially smaller than the activation energies on the discarded pathways."

[4] "Calculations show [55] that even low energy impact can displace surface atoms from their binding sites. If this happens, it is most likely that they will move on the surface and heal the damage (the damaged site is the best binding site)."

[5] "There is quite a bit of experimental [121,169,174,190220] and theoretical [108,188,221232] work exploring the possibility that doped oxides are a new class of catalysts in which doping improves the oxidative power of an oxide."

[1] "DFT can also be tested by comparison with numerically exact calculations. Such calculations are not possible for the systems of interest to catalysis, because they contain too many electrons."

[2] "In spite of the reservations expressed above it is reasonable to expect that most results of GGA-DFT are qualitatively correct. While the activation energies may not be accurate, the reaction mechanism is likely to be correct if the activation energy on the most likely pathway is substantially smaller than the activation energies on the discarded pathways."

[3] "Calculations show [247,248,256,257] that for Au clusters supported on rutile the oxidation reaction takes place with CO on the cluster and O2 adsorbed at the border between oxide and Au. This was first suggested by Haruta [258] who observed that the activity of an oxidation catalyst seems to be proportional to the perimeter of the cluster-oxide interface not with the surface."

[4] "There are, however, some common features. (a) All calculations agree that activating oxygen is the key to CO oxidation. (b) The presence of low coordination sites on the cluster is essential (in our opinion, it is the shape of HOMO that matters, see IV.1). (c) In most cases, the dissociation of oxygen is not the favored oxidation pathway if the clusters are sufficiently large (i.e. more than 10 atoms)."

Computational methods like DFT and cluster models enhance our ability to predict, analyze and understand catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in several key ways:

1. They allow exploration of reaction mechanisms and pathways that would be difficult or impossible to observe experimentally. While activation energies may not be perfectly accurate, DFT can identify the most likely reaction pathways.

2. They provide atomic-level insights into factors controlling catalytic activity, such as the importance of low-coordination sites and the shape of frontier orbitals like the HOMO.

3. They enable systematic study of how cluster size, composition, and support interactions affect reactivity. For example, calculations have shown how Au cluster size impacts oxygen activation and dissociation.

4. They can corroborate and explain experimental observations, as in the case of calculations supporting Haruta's proposal about the importance of the cluster-oxide interface perimeter.

Key considerations and challenges include:

1. Accuracy limitations, especially for quantitative energetics. Exact calculations are not feasible for catalytic systems.

2. The need to explore many possible structures, binding sites, and reaction pathways to avoid overlooking important mechanisms.

3. Accounting for effects like spin conservation, which adds complexity but is important for accuracy.

4. Balancing computational cost with system size and level of theory.

The key benefits are the ability to rapidly screen materials, propose and test mechanistic hypotheses, and gain fundamental understanding to guide catalyst design. While not perfect, computational methods provide invaluable complementary insights to experiments in exploring new catalytic materials.
