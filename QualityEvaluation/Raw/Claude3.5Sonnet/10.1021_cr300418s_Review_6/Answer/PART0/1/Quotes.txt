[1] "DFT (especially with the B3LYP functional5) offers improved accuracy but still lacks key physical interactions (e.g., dispersion). Often, DFT underestimates barrier heights by several kcalmol1, which cannot be systematically improved."

          [2] "Combining the ab initio results with thorough sampling, we predict activation enthalpies that approach chemical accuracy."

          [3] "These results indicate that a high-level electron correlation treatment, such as LCCSD(T0), is necessary to make quantitative predictions of barrier heights or other energetic properties in enzymes."

          [4] "Our high-level QM/MM calculations provide near-quantitative results for the activation enthalpies and free energies of the reactions catalyzed by CM and PHBH."

          [5] "Our results show that it is now possible to perform electronic structure calculations on large systems approaching chemical accuracy, thus allowing quantitative studies of reaction mechanisms in enzymes. This development opens new horizons for theoretical biochemistry and many other areas of computational chemistry."

[1] "By and large, density functional theory (DFT) has been found to give very good results in the study of inorganic and organometallic systems."

          [2] "After extensive calibration using accurate ab initio methods (CCSD(T) with large basis sets), it was concluded that the best description of this system is obtained using a modified form of the hybrid B3PW91 functional."

          [3] "This new functional, referred to as B3PW91*, is identical to B3PW91 except that the coefficient c3 describing the mixing of exact, HartreeFock, exchange is reduced to 0.15 (vs. 0.20 in B3PW91)."

          [4] "As well as considering anew the potential energy surfaces for addition of H2 to Fe(CO)4, our calculations were extended to derivatives containing two CO and two PH3 ligands, and to others containing four P-donor ligands."

          [5] "When studying chemical reactivity, it is essential to use a computational method which is as accurate as possible, and this can be very hard to achieve in transition metal chemistry given the delicate balance of exchange and correlation effects, the frequently poor performance of the simplest correlated ab initio methods such as MP2, and the need for very large basis sets."

[1] "DFT has become a popular approach throughout computational chemistry because it offers results that are in principle exact, at a cost similar to that of the Hartree-Fock method, and is thereby readily applicable to the field of transition metal chemistry."

          [2] "The problem is that the exact functional is unknown, and the many different approximate functionals tend to give different results."

          [3] "Benchmarking of DFT by ab initio calculations leads to uncertain results, because it is often not clear how accurate the benchmarks themselves are."

          [4] "To gain the detailed knowledge needed to unravel reactivity in some of these systems, the insight available from computational chemistry is particularly valuable, and this explains the importance of such studies in this area."

          [5] "DFT does give qualitatively useful predictions of state-splittings, but needs to be used with caution, as the current functionals tend to disagree and there is no general rule as to which functional or class of functionals performs best."

[1] "All geometry optimizations and force calculations were performed using QChem 3.0 (20) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The transition metals V and Ti were treated using the LANL2DZ basis sets and effective core potentials."

          [2] "The modified growing string method (GSM) was used with 11 nodes to determine an initial estimate of the transition state. (21) The hybrid strategy (21, 22) was used to determine the minimum energy pathway on the singlet potential energy surface."

          [3] "The SCF energy was considered converged when the energy of successive iterations differed by less than 107 hartrees. The threshold value was set to 1010 for neglecting two electron integrals. All final energies reported were determined by setting the SCF convergence to 108 and the threshold value to 1011 and by using the more refined SG-1 integration grid."

[1] "A recent theoretical study [19] has shown that a Au-only reaction pathway for a TiOx supported Au bilayer cluster is energetically competitive with alternative pathways requiring reactant-support interactions."

          [2] "Density functional calculations also are consistent with Au being electron-rich when supported on titania [18,39]."

[1] "A possibility, which we follow, is to look for situations in which knowledge of simple rules or trends can improve our ability of predicting whether a catalyst or a class of catalysts is promising for a particular reaction. For example, alkane activation catalyzed by doped oxides is fertile ground for this approach. The rate-limiting step is the breaking of the CH bond. One can compare the activity of different catalysts for this process by calculating the activation energy for CH bond breaking."

[2] "To do useful computations on a catalytic system, one has to deal with systems with a large number of electrons and perform a large number of calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths. In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements."

[3] "It is also possible to make small oxide cluster models, which allow the use of more accurate quantum chemistry methods. Experiments on gas-phase clusters (146) and on mass-selected clusters supported on solid surfaces (147-158) show that the catalytic activity of very small clusters depends strongly on their size."

[4] "The ordinary GGA-DFT (GGA stands for generalized-gradient approximation) does not give the correct electronic structure for most oxides of transition metals and rare-earth metals."

[5] "A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations."

[6] "An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186) Both methods add some HartreeFock exchange energy to the GGA functional. This removes some of the interaction of the electron with itself, a feature that plagues GGA-DFT."

[7] "Computations have the advantage that they can easily make new materials and explore their catalytic activity. If they are promising, the experimentalists might attempt to synthesize them."

[1] "We compare here results of many calculations: some are old, and some have not been published before. Some of the older calculations used GGA, which is known to give some artifacts in the electronic structure of the oxides of transition metals or rare-earth metals. The more recent calculations either used (5) GGA+U or showed that, for some oxides (e.g., La2O3), using the Hubbard U correction makes a minor difference in the results."

[2] "All calculations examined here have been performed on slabs that mimic large surfaces. They used the accepted standards of the field regarding the magnitude of the energy cut off, the thickness of the slabs, and the convergence criteria for geometry and energy optimization. Most calculations used spin-polarized DFT to find the lowest energy spin state."

[3] "In this article, we present qualitative rules that predict large energy changes. The magnitude of the energies cited here will depend on the functional used in the DFT calculations and on the value of the U parameter. However, the qualitative rules that we propose are likely to be valid for all functionals because they are based on large energy differences."

[4] "It is important to note that to capture the acid behavior of reducible oxides it is important to use GGA+U. The ability of an adsorbed atom to function as a Lewis base and reduce a cation in the oxide is predicated on the ability of the functional to create states localized on the cation."

[5] "Recently, Nolan (6-10) and Watson (11, 12) and Sanz (13) have advocated the use of a Hubbard correction for oxygen. Having two adjustable parameters, this method seems to improve the description of doped or reduced oxides."

[1] "Density-functional (DF) calculations on the oxidation of Ag surfaces were performed using the QuantumEspresso computational code [83], employing ultrasoft pseudopotentials [84] and the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [85] exchange-correlation functional."

[2] "The DF calculations for the partial oxidation of propylene were carried out using the DACAPO code [86], which also employs ultrasoft pseudopotentials. The set-up is slightly different: the PW91 functional [87] was used for exchange-correlation, and in order to keep the computational cost low (due to the large number of simulations which these type of studies of reaction pathways requires) the energy cut-off for the plane wave basis was slightly lower (25 Ryd)."

[3] "To obtain a relatively accurate model of this type of sites, at a reasonable computational cost, we employed a one-dimensional silver rod, which takes advantage of the periodic symmetry requirements introduced by our plane-wave-based DF approach."

[4] "Overall, the results from the DF simulations agree with the behavior observed in the experiments."

[1] "The study of catalysis by oxides benefits from calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to find possible intermediates, to help assign spectra, or to determine the activation energies and reaction mechanism."

[2] "In the past few years it has been repeatedly pointed out that DFT with the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), or with the local density approximation (LDA), has some shortcomings when used to calculate the properties of transition metals or rare-earth oxides"

[3] "A possible, practical cure may be provided by the GGA+U theory. This prevents the unwanted delocalization of the d- or f-electrons, by adding to the Hamiltonian a term that increases the total energy when two d- or f-electrons are located on the same cation."

[4] "Hybrid functionals are also an improvement over ordinary GGA-DFT, because they use some HartreeFock exchange for a partial cancellation of the self-interaction; unfortunately this gain in quality is at the expense of efficiency, and the hybrid functionals are of limited usefulness in heterogeneous catalysis research."

[5] "We find that a U value between 2 and 3 eV, used with the PW91 or the PBE functional but not with LDA, satisfies all these criteria. The hybrid functionals give remarkably accurate reaction energies and reasonable band gaps, as compared to GGA or GGA+U."

[6] "While the calculations are not highly accurate, many questions in catalysis can be settled reliably if the error in total energy differences are less than 0.2 eV."

[1] "We use density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) and hybrid DFT (HSE06 functional) to study the defects formed when the ceria (110) surface is doped with a series of trivalent dopants, namely, Al3+, Sc3+, Y3+, and In3+."

[2] "Using the hybrid DFT HSE06 exchange-correlation functional as a benchmark, we show that doping the (110) surface with a single trivalent ion leads to formation of a localized MCe/ + OO• (M = the 3+ dopant), O hole state, confirming the description found with DFT+U."

[3] "Although DFT+U is well established in studying ceria, it is not without problems, in particular, the empiricism associated with a choice of U and the dependence of material properties on the value of U used in the calculation."

[4] "Hybrid DFT in a plane-wave basis set is now available and has been used in a number of papers over the last 2 years to study troublesome defect states in some metal oxides, including in ceria, (-26, 41, 42, 60-62) providing an excellent description of many properties."

[5] "Comparison of the hybrid DFT and DFT+U results confirm the DFT+U description so that for investigation of the anion vacancy compensation mechanism (which requires a larger surface supercell and a larger number of calculations), we can apply DFT+U."

[1] "The difficulty in obtaining accurate property predictions for transition metal oxides from DFT calculations has been recognized for some time. Despite attempts to use hybrid functionals and dynamical mean-field theory to treat the problem, DFT with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals remains an economical choice, and therefore, corrections directed at specific drawbacks of the method are introduced."

[2] "It is generally understood that the main source of error in DFT for d and f electrons is their correlated nature. A commonly used ad hoc method for improving the description of d and f electrons is the DFT+U method, in which an on-site potential is added to introduce intra-atomic interactions between the strongly correlated electrons."

[3] "Application of the on-site interaction term to transition metal oxides has been recognized as necessary because of its strong influence on the orbital energies of the occupied d and f states and, as a consequence, on the formation energy of oxygen vacancies formed during reactions that proceed through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."

[4] "The oxides of transition and rare earth metals, such as Ti, V, Cu, La, and Ce, are often used as catalysts for industrially important reactions."

[5] "DFT is one of the tools commonly applied to such systems. The catalytic properties of these materials are attributed to their reducibility, (7-9) where lower oxidation states correspond to occupied d and f orbitals."

[1] "DFT calculations for some quantities, for some oxides having narrow d- or f- bands, might be in error. We do not know for which oxides this might be true, nor do we know which quantities might be calculated erroneously."

[2] "Given this situation, it is best to study trends, which depend on DFT being qualitatively correct."

[3] "In spite of the reservations expressed above it is reasonable to expect that most results of GGA-DFT are qualitatively correct. While the activation energies may not be accurate, the reaction mechanism is likely to be correct if the activation energy on the most likely pathway is substantially smaller than the activation energies on the discarded pathways."

[4] "Calculations show [55] that even low energy impact can displace surface atoms from their binding sites. If this happens, it is most likely that they will move on the surface and heal the damage (the damaged site is the best binding site)."

[5] "There is quite a bit of experimental [121,169,174,190220] and theoretical [108,188,221232] work exploring the possibility that doped oxides are a new class of catalysts in which doping improves the oxidative power of an oxide."

[6] "DFT can also be tested by comparison with numerically exact calculations. Such calculations are not possible for the systems of interest to catalysis, because they contain too many electrons."

[7] "Approximate theories can be tested by comparison with accurate experiments. Unfortunately, such comparisons are inconclusive for realistic catalysts, because we do not know the structure of their surfaces."

[8] "These systems are interesting to the scientist. They are new and very little is known about their chemistry. They are amenable for theoretical studies due to the small size of the clusters involved."

[9] "To describe the orbital roughness rules we introduce the following nomenclature. We call SOMO a single occupied KohnSham (KS) molecular orbital, LUMO1 the unoccupied KS orbital having the lowest energy and LUMO2 the unoccupied orbital having the second lowest energy. These orbitals control the binding site and the binding energy of those molecules (e.g. propene, propene oxide and CO) that bind to the clusters by donating electrons."

[1] "DFT (especially with the B3LYP functional5) offers improved accuracy but still lacks key physical interactions (e.g., dispersion). Often, DFT underestimates barrier heights by several kcalmol1, which cannot be systematically improved."
