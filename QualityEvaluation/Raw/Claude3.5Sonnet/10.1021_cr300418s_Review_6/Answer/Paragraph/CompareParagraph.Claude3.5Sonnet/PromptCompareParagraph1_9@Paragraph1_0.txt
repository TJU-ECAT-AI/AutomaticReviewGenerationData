5 Computational Methods
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Computing accurately the catalytic properties of doped oxides requires a detailed knowledge of the morphology and the composition of the surface under reaction conditions. At this time, the experiments are unable to provide this information. One could imagine trying to use computations to determine the state of the catalyst by creating a large number of models, calculating their free energy, and studying catalysis with the model having the lowest free energy. This is impractical: a lot of computer time is needed because we have little guidance from experiments, and too many possibilities will have to be considered. In addition, this will give the equilibrium state of the catalyst, which is of limited usefulness; we need the state of the catalyst under steady-state reaction conditions, and this is governed by kinetics. Trying to calculate activation energies and reaction rate for all possible structures and reactions in a given system is possible in principle, but it is far beyond the current computing capabilities.
Chemists have lived with uncertainty throughout their history, and the situation described above is not rare nor does it imply that we should abandon using computations. A possibility, which we follow, is to look for situations in which knowledge of simple rules or trends can improve our ability of predicting whether a catalyst or a class of catalysts is promising for a particular reaction. For example, alkane activation catalyzed by doped oxides is fertile ground for this approach. The rate-limiting step is the breaking of the C&ndash;H bond. One can compare the activity of different catalysts for this process by calculating the activation energy for C&ndash;H bond breaking. This makes the time needed for screening catalysts for this reaction comparable to the time of doing the experiments, which is an important practical consideration. In the case of doped oxide catalysts, there are a number of fundamental, qualitative questions. Among the many possible oxide&ndash;dopant combinations, which one has the lowest activation energy for breaking the C&ndash;H bond? Can we classify the dopant&ndash;oxide pairs in a useful way that might allow us to guess, without elaborate calculations, what catalyst to try for alkane activation? Is there a simple understanding of how a dopant affects catalytic activity? Finally, computations have the advantage that they can easily “make” new materials and explore their catalytic activity. If they are promising, the experimentalists might attempt to synthesize them.
To do useful computations on a catalytic system, one has to deal with systems with a large number of electrons and perform a large number of calculations for all possible adsorption sites and reaction paths. In practice, only density functional theory (DFT) is efficient enough to satisfy these requirements. In almost all cases, the surface is modeled by a slab of finite thickness in one direction and periodic in the other two. It is also possible to make small oxide cluster models, which allow the use of more accurate quantum chemistry methods. Experiments on gas-phase clusters (146) and on mass-selected clusters supported on solid surfaces (147-158) show that the catalytic activity of very small clusters depends strongly on their size. Therefore, a calculation using a cluster model has to increase the cluster size until its catalytic properties no longer change with size. If the size becomes too large, one has to resort to DFT. If it is too small, one can do accurate calculations, but the model is inaccurate.
The “ordinary” GGA-DFT (GGA stands for generalized-gradient approximation) does not give the correct electronic structure for most oxides of transition metals and rare-earth metals. Some objections to GGA-DFT have to do with the values of the orbital energies. The energy difference between LUMO and HOMO (the band gap) given by GGA-DFT is always substantially smaller than the measured value. Experiments (UPS, EELS) observe that filled states are present in the gap when oxygen vacancies are present, while in GGA-DFT calculations the vacancy-induced states are at the bottom of the conduction band. One could argue that orbital energies should not be compared to observable quantities. Strictly speaking this is true; however, one must be concerned when GGA-DFT calculations predict that Ti2O3 is a metal, while experiments show that it has a band gap of 1 eV. In addition to the above shortcomings, we add the fact that the d- or f-bands in these oxides are much wider than in experiments. This means that, in the calculations, the electrons in the d- or f-orbitals are delocalized instead of being localized on the cations as the experiments assert.
Because we have very few precise binding energy measurements on well-defined, clean oxide surfaces, (30, 159-164) it is not clear to what extent GGA-DFT makes errors when calculating total energy differences, which are the quantities most important to catalysis.
A temporary palliation is provided by the DFT+U method (165-167) in which a Hubbard-like correction is added to the DFT theory to prevent the delocalization of the d- or f-orbitals of the cations. Many versions of the theory have been published, (168-174) but the implementation available in the VASP programs is most widely used. Unfortunately, there is no agreement on how to pick the value of the Hubbard parameter U. Because catalysis is controlled by total energy differences, we prefer to chose the value of U that fits the energy of some reaction involving the oxide. (175, 176)
In principle, one expects U to depend on the cation&ndash;cation distance and on the positions and the nature of the surrounding anions. In practice, one assumes that U is a property of the cation, which is a ill-defined approximation. Despite these shortcomings, the consensus is that calculations on transition metal oxides or rare-earth oxides must use spin-polarized, DFT-GGA+U, not GGA. It is prudent, however, to test that the qualitative conclusions reached by the calculations do not change when the value of U changes within a reasonable range.
Watson and Nolan have suggested that a Hubbard correction ought to be used for the p-orbitals of oxygen. Because this is important in connection with low-valence dopants, we defer the discussion of this issue for that section.
An alternative to GGA+U is to use a hybrid functional such as B3LYP (177) or HSE. (178-186) Both methods add some Hartree&ndash;Fock exchange energy to the GGA functional. This removes some of the interaction of the electron with itself, a feature that plagues GGA-DFT. Both methods have been tested extensively for molecules and less so for oxides. The conclusion is that they are better than GGA and probably than GGA+U. Unfortunately, they require more computer time than GGA+U and are less practical (although possible) if one plans to perform all of the calculations needed when one studies adsorption and reactions on the surface of a slab. When possible, they should be used to test the key reaction steps in the GGA+U calculations. Some comparisons between GGA+U and HSE are available. (187-190) For example, the energy of oxygen vacancy formation obtained by HSE differs from that given by PBE+U by 0.3 eV for CeO2(110), by 0.4 eV for CeO2(100), and by 0.8 eV on CeO2(111). These results suggest again that one should use calculations mostly for qualitative results and trends. In the example above, the qualitative conclusion that CeO2(111) is not as good an oxidant as Ce(100) or CeO2(100) is likely to be safe.
Another shortcoming of GGA-DFT is its inability to describe van der Waals interactions. This is particularly important for binding of polarizable molecules to metals (which are very polarizable) (191-195) and less so for oxides that have a large band gap. However, in the case of alkane interactions with siliceous zeolites, for example, the van der Waals interactions are the only interactions, and obviously they cannot be ignored. In calculating reaction energies, some of the van der Waals interactions cancel out but not completely. It is therefore preferable to use versions of DFT that include the van der Waals interaction, but this has been done infrequently for oxides.
The quantum calculations performed on heterogeneous catalysts use a Hamiltonian that does not contain spin-dependent terms (such as the spin&ndash;orbit coupling). In this case, the exact wave function of the system must be an eigenstate of the square of the total spin operator, S2, of the electrons and of the projection Sz of the same operator on the z-axis. Quantum mechanics also tells us that if the Hamiltonian is truly spin independent, then the rate of transition between electronic states with different spin (e.g., from a singlet to a triplet) must be zero. We say that such transitions are spin-forbidden. (196, 197) Transitions that are spin-forbidden take place in practice because the correct Hamiltonian contains spin-dependent operators. However, these operators have small matrix elements, and therefore the rates of spin-forbidden transitions are small. The consequences of these statements are well understood by people who apply quantum chemistry to radicals, or to organometallic compounds, or to enzymes. (198-208) With few exceptions, (209-211) they have been ignored in surface science and catalysis.
Because the exact wave function must be an eigenstate of S2 and Sz, density functional should use only densities derived from wave functions satisfying this restriction. Unfortunately, we do not know how to impose this constraint. We have suggested (209) that, as a temporary solution, one should assume that reactions in which the spin polarization (i.e., the number of spins “up” minus the number of spins “down”) of the reactants is different from that of the products are slow. This is based on the observation that such reaction would require “flipping” one or more spins and there are no magnetic fields in the system strong enough to make this process fast. Of course a reaction that does not require spin-flipping but has a very high activation energy can be slower than a reaction in which the spin is flipped but the crossing of the states with different spins takes place at low energies. An example of this is provided by calculations done by Goodrow et al. (211) who showed that in the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde, the dehydrogenation of the methoxide is much slower than a spin-forbidden transition invoked in another step of the mechanism. Therefore, the spin-forbidden transition is not rate-limiting for that particular reaction.
A long-debated issue in quantum chemistry is how to assign electron charges to an atom that is part of a molecule. There is no perfect method for doing this, but we prefer the one proposed by Bader, (212) which was implemented efficiently by Henkelman, Jonsson et al. (213, 214) To the extent that this definition is accepted (and we find it logically satisfying), the Bader charges are the real charges of the atom in a solid or a molecule. We emphasize this because we also use formal charges in this Review, following the bad but useful habit of many people in the field. Formal charges do not exist. They are defined by deciding arbitrarily that oxygen in an oxide has the charge −2 and then determining the charge of the cation so that the oxide is electrically neutral.
6 Strong Acid&ndash;Base Interactions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Over the years, many people have attempted to correlate catalytic activity with the acidity or the basicity of oxides. (215-219) There is no doubt that in cases where hydrocarbon cations are intermediates, Bronsted acidity of a catalyst is essential. (220) In other cases, one constructs a basicity scale by using the binding energy of CO2. The stronger it binds CO2, the more basic is the oxide. The acidity is determined by measuring the binding energy of ammonia or pyridine or by measuring the shift in the vibrational frequency of CO. (137) One then attempts to correlate the catalytic activity of a variety of oxide catalysts, for a given reaction, with the basicity or the acidity of the surface. (216, 217)
In a recent article, (221) we have shown that a large number of computational results can be qualitatively rationalized by a simple rule: the interaction between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base coadsorbed on the surface is surprisingly strong. We will not repeat the arguments here, but we will make use of this rule to guide us.
While the definition and the classification of various aspects of Lewis acidity and basicity can become very complex, (222) we use here the simplest possible definition. If two compounds come in contact or react, the one that receives electrons is a Lewis acid and the one that donates them is a Lewis base. While the concept of Lewis acid and base is very old, (223) its use was limited by the fact that in most cases we did not know how the electrons flow when two compounds come in contact. Because of the work of Bader, (212) we now have the means of calculating (213, 214) how the electrons are distributed over each atom in a molecule and therefore determine which molecule is an acid and which is a base. We emphasize that acidity and basicity are properties of a pair: a compound can be acid when interacting with one molecule and a base when interacting with another. For physicists, the name of electron donor (base) or electron acceptor (acid) may be more familiar.
This concept is of interest here because the fragments formed by the dissociative adsorption of alkanes, the high-valence dopants, the oxygen vacancies, and the Ti3+ and Ce3+ cations, are bases and the low-valence dopants, the Ce4+ and Ti4+ cations, and O2, Br2, Cl2, and other electronegative adsorbates, are acids. The rule we found by examining the results of many calculations is that if we coadsorb on the surface of an oxide a Lewis base with a Lewis acid, the binding energy of the pair exceeds substantially the sum of the binding energy of the compounds alone on the same surface. Thus, the presence of a Lewis base on a surface (e.g., a hydroxyl, an adsorbed CH3 radical, a K atom) increases the binding energy of a Lewis acid (e.g., a Au atom or an oxygen molecule). The presence of a Lewis acid on the surface (e.g., a dopant having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes in the host oxide) lowers the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy because the oxygen vacancy is a base and its formation benefits by a large acid&ndash;base interaction. We will make use of this concept throughout this Review.
7 A Classification of Dopant&ndash;Oxide Pairs
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
As we have explained already, the role of a dopant is to disrupt the chemical bonds in the surface of the doped oxide to make either the dopant or the oxygen atoms near the dopant engage more readily (than the undoped oxide) in chemical reactions. By reviewing the existing DFT calculations, we have come up with a tentative classification of the dopant&ndash;oxide pairs.
We call a dopant a low-valence dopant (LVD) when its valence in its own stable oxide is lower than the valence of the cations it substitutes in the host oxide. For example, a La atom substituting a Ce atom in CeO2 is an LVD because lanthanum oxide has the formula La2O3. The chemistry of doped oxides in which the dopant’s valence is lower than that of the substituted cation by one is predictable. Their most interesting feature is that they activate the oxygen atoms near them and make them more reactive. The LVDs make the doped oxide a better oxidant than the undoped host oxide, and therefore they promote the first step in the Mars&ndash;van Krevelen catalytic oxidation mechanism.
We call a dopant a high-valence dopant (HVD) when its valence in its stable oxide exceeds that of the cation it substitutes. An example is La dopant in CaO, because La is trivalent in its own oxide. The HVD’s chemical properties depend on whether the host oxide is reducible or not. If the host oxide is irreducible (MgO, La2O3, Ta2O5, etc.) and the dopant’s valence is larger by one unit than the cation it substitutes, the dopant makes the oxygen atoms in the surface of the host less reducible and therefore less active. However, the dopant adsorbs O2 from the gas phase and activates it. A reductant can react with this oxygen and undergo oxidation. Unlike in the Mars&ndash;van Krevelen mechanism, the oxygen atom in the oxidation product originates from the gas phase, not from the surface. If the valence of the dopant is much higher than that of the replaced cation, complications arise, and we examine these in the section dedicated to HVDs.
If the host oxide is reducible (CeO2, TiO2, etc.), the dopant may donate electrons to the host cations (e.g., reducing Ce4+ to Ce3+), and this will affect the properties of the system. Because of this, we classify the HVDs in reducible oxides separately from those in the irreducible ones.
To decide a priori the valence of a dopant, we use the oxides the dopant forms. Mg is divalent because the only stable oxide is MgO, and Ta is pentavalent because Ta2O5 is its only stable oxide. On the other hand, Nb has three stable oxides, Nb2O3, NbO2, and Nb2O5. We cannot decide a priori whether Nb in Nb-doped ZrO2 is a low-valence or a high-valence dopant. Of course, one can analyze the results of the DFT calculations to assign a valence to Nb in Nb-doped zirconia. However, this defeats our purpose, which is to provide a classification that allows us to predict qualitatively the effect of a dopant without performing calculations.
There are of course the cases in which the dopant and the cation it substitutes have the same valence. We do not have sufficient computations on the chemistry of such systems, and our tentative suggestion is that they do not have a very large effect on the chemistry of the host oxide. An exception may be the case when the oxide of the dopant is much more stable than the host oxide and the oxygen&ndash;cation bond length in the two oxides are different. An example of this might be NiO doped with Mg.

Computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. These approaches offer several key benefits and face various challenges:

1. Predictive power and efficiency:
DFT calculations allow researchers to compare the activity of different catalysts by calculating activation energies for rate-limiting steps, such as CH bond breaking in alkane activation [10.1021/cr300418s\_6]. This enables the prediction of promising catalysts or classes of catalysts for specific reactions. DFT is the most practical method for handling systems with a large number of electrons and performing numerous calculations for various adsorption sites and reaction paths [10.1021/cr300418s\_6].

2. Accuracy and method selection:
While standard DFT (GGA or LDA) has shortcomings for transition metal and rare-earth oxides, methods like DFT+U and hybrid functionals offer improved accuracy [10.1021/jp111350u]. For instance, using a U value of 2-3 eV with PW91 or PBE functionals can provide satisfactory results for certain oxides [10.1021/jp111350u]. Hybrid DFT methods, such as the HSE06 functional, provide excellent descriptions of many properties, including troublesome defect states in metal oxides [10.1021/jp112112u].

3. Exploration of new materials:
Computational methods allow for systematic investigation of various dopants and oxide systems, facilitating the discovery and design of new catalytic materials [10.1021/jp301341]. They enable the easy creation and exploration of new materials' catalytic activity, potentially guiding experimental synthesis efforts [10.1021/cr300418s\_6].

4. Mechanistic insights:
DFT calculations can reveal detailed information about reaction mechanisms, transition states, and intermediate species involved in catalytic processes, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain through experimental methods alone [10.1021/jp301341].

Key challenges and considerations include:

1. Accuracy limitations:
DFT calculations for some quantities, for some oxides having narrow d- or f- bands, might be in error [10.1016/j.cossms.2008.07.003]. The exact DFT functional is unknown, and different approximate functionals can give varying results [10.1039/b200675h].

2. Parameter optimization:
For methods like GGA+U, determining the optimal U value is crucial for accurate results [10.1021/jp301341]. The choice of the U parameter in DFT+U can significantly affect the results, introducing an element of empiricism [10.1021/jp112112u].

3. Balancing accuracy and computational cost:
While more accurate methods exist, researchers must often balance computational accuracy with efficiency, especially when studying large systems or numerous reaction pathways [10.1021/cr300418s\_6].

4. Validation:
Results from computational studies should be validated against experimental data when possible to ensure reliability [10.1021/ct200202g]. However, such comparisons are often inconclusive for realistic catalysts due to uncertainties in surface structures [10.1016/j.cossms.2008.07.003].

Despite these challenges, computational methods have become indispensable tools in catalysis research. They provide valuable insights into catalyst behavior, guide experimental work, and accelerate the development of new and improved catalytic materials for alkane activation and other important chemical processes.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to further enhance the application of computational methods in studying doped oxide catalysts for alkane activation. Future research endeavors might focus on:

1. Developing more accurate and efficient hybrid functionals specifically tailored for transition metal and rare-earth oxide systems, balancing the need for accuracy with computational efficiency.

2. Integrating machine learning techniques with DFT calculations to accelerate the screening of potential catalysts and predict optimal dopant combinations.

3. Improving the modeling of realistic reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and dynamic surface restructuring effects, to bridge the gap between computational predictions and experimental observations.

4. Advancing multi-scale modeling approaches that combine atomic-level DFT calculations with meso- and macro-scale simulations to provide a more comprehensive understanding of catalytic processes.

5. Enhancing the synergy between computational and experimental studies, developing protocols for rapid feedback loops between theoretical predictions and experimental validations to accelerate catalyst discovery and optimization.

These future directions could significantly advance our ability to design and develop more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane activation and other critical industrial processes, potentially leading to more sustainable and economical chemical production methods.
