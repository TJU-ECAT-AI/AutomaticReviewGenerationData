We propose
an
energy
functional
for localized
electron
systems
that
corresponds
to the
constrained-local-density
approximation
(LDA) but includes
some corrections
for spin and orbital
polarization
to take Hund's first and second rules into account. The discontinuity
of the one-electron
potential
known
for an exact density
functional
can be easily incorporated
in LDA in the scope of
our formalism.
Applications
of the method to the electronic structure
and configurational
stability
of d impurities
in Rb are presented.
I. INTRODUCTION
It is well
know
now that
the local-spin-density
ap-
proximation
(LSDA) fails to describe properties
of sys-
tems with localized d and f electrons.
Typical examples
of such
failures
are Mott insulators
like 3d-transition-
metal oxides, where the LSDA cannot reproduce the well-
established
correlation
gaps
nor the antiferromagnetic
ground states. Several different attempts
[SIC-LSDA,i s
LDA+U
(Ref. 4)] have
been
undertaken
to overcome
these limitations
and repair
the LSDA by introducing
some corrections
for localized states.
On the other hand, there is a paradox that despite of
all limitations
of LSDA it gives reasonable
values for the
parameters
characterizing
the localized states.
Indeed,
the values
of the Coulomb
interaction
parameters
(U)
obtained
in the constrained-LSDA
calculations
for a va-
riety of strongly
correlated
systems
are surprisingly
accurate. This means that as long as we manipulate
with
total energies in constrained-LSDA,
we are quite success-
ful in describing
the behavior of localized electrons,
even
if we consider
excited-state
properties.
But as soon as
we start using single-particle
energies obtained
in LSDA
for the ground
state all deficiencies of such a treatment
become evident.
This is not very surprising
since LSDA-
eigenvalues
themselves
(at least for the ground state) do
not have a direct
physical
meaning.
Some other
rep-
resentations
for one-electron
spectra
which
would
bet-
ter re8ect the nature
of the localized
states
are more
prefered.
But, is the transformation
to another
set
of one-electron
states
very important
and what
is the
nature of the localized states? Let us consider a system
consisting
of two well-separated
atoms.
We will neglect
any hybridization
efFects between the wave functions
but
allow for charge transfer
&om one atom to the other.
If we still stay within the &amework of the one-electron
picture this process can be described
only as a transition
of an electron
&om a well-defined
one-electron
orbitcl
at one atom to the corresponding
one-electron
orbital at
the other atom and the physical origin of the one-electron
states involved
in such a process becomes very important
here. Perdew et al.
have shown that an attempt to use
one-electron
states like those of LSDA, which are simply
derivatives
of a smooth function
(total energy
in LSDA)
with respect to orbital populations,
to describe the be-
havior of two different
well-separated
atoms leads to a
paradox:
&actional electron
occupations
on each atom
of the considered
system
will minimize
the total energy.
The only possible choice to avoid this is to use such a set
of one-electron
orbitals on every site for which the energy
of the highest
occupied or lowest empty state (thus,
we
unavoidably
must introduce
some gap between these two
energies)
would exactly agree with the cost to remove or
to add one electron to the shell of localized states, i.e.,
with
the ionization
energy
or electron
aKnity,
respec-
tively.
Now, let us look again at the total energy functional
in
LSDA for isolated atoms to get some feeling of what one
should improve
and how it could be done. First, we note
that the values of the total energy obtained
in LSDA for
isolated
atoms
do not differ drastically
from those ob-
tained
in Hartree-Fock
(HF) calculations.
As the most
striking
example,
we can remind
ourselves of the X
ap-
proximation
proposed
by Slater, is where the parameter
a was chosen
&om the equality
between
total energies
in X
and HF approaches
for isolated
atoms.
It looks
like that we should not change LSDA total energy at all
except for some small
corrections
arising
&om orbital-
polarization
efFects.
This fact was intensively
used by
Eriksson et al. ,
Norman,
and Severin et al.
to in-
clude the orbital-polarization
effects
(which
are also a
consequence
of localized
states)
into density-functional
formalism.
But the localized nature of the states is also
omitted
in such a consideration.
What
else can we do
if we do not want to change
(drastically)
the total en-
ergy of LSDA? The answer
is very simple if we look at
the total energy
as an one-electron
part
minus
double-
counting term:

one possible choice is to introduce
some redefinition
both
for the one-electron
energies
e',
- = e,
-
+ + AV', and for
the double-counting
term Ez, 
Eq, + P, b,V,',n,
.
Of
course, the one-electron
states
e'; are then no longer re-
lated to the LSDA-total
energy
as its derivatives
with
respect to occupations
n, . However,
we will show that
this relation
can be still ful6lled
for our corrected-LDA
total energy functional,
the LDA+U energy.
The
derivation
of the
functional
will
be
given
in
Sec. II. A first description
of the method
and its ap-
plications
to the calculation
of the photoemission
and
Bremsstrahlung
isochromat
spectra
of NiO,
were
pre-
sented
in Ref. 19.
Very
recently,
this
functional
has
been successfully
applied to the investigation
of electronic
structure
and magneto-optical
effects in CeSb (Ref. 20)
and Gd (Ref. 21). The aim of this paper is to give a more
extended
analysis
of the LDA+U formalism
and
show
how it is related to the model HF and LDA approaches.
In particular,
we will show that it is simply a constrained
LDA with some additional
corrections
corresponding
to
the spin and orbital polarization.
We will also show that
the discontinuity
of the one-electron
potential
known
for
an "exact" density
functional
can be easily incorporated
in LSDA. Applications
of the method
to the electronic
structure
and configurational
stability
analysis
of d im-
purities
in Rb host will be presented
in Sec. III. Many
experimental
and theoretical
'
eKorts have been
concerned
with these systems in recent years mainly
due
to the discovery of a typically
localized behavior
for the d
states of transition-metal
atom impurities
in the sp hosts
leading to strong orbital moments
and possibly to mixed-
valence
behavior.
The conclusions
of our paper
will be
summarized
in Sec. IV.
II. METHOD
In general
we will follow the LDA+U scheme proposed
in Ref. 4. We will also call our present formalism LDA+U
since it is based on the same ideas as its original version
despite the fact that some dHFerences
between
these two
approaches
exist, especially
in the choice of a reference
point
between
the LDA and the model-HF
description
for the localized
states.
We start
with the normal
to-
tal energy
functional
in the framework
of LDA [in prin-
ciple, the choice of the (non-spin-polarized)
LDA as a
starting
point is not very important
and absolutely
the
same manipulations
can be performed
for the total en-
ergy functional
in LSDA]. Our main
idea is to modify
that part of the LDA-total energy which is responsible
for
the interaction
between localized electrons and present it
in the same way as it appears
in model
(Anderson2s
or
Hubbardl)
Hamiltonians.
As a first step, we will remove
the hybridization
between
the localized
states and the
rest of the system and consider the so-called atomic limit.
We allow only for charge transfer between these two sub-
systems
and assne
them to relax self-consistently
on
such Suctuations.
We will introduce a total energy func-
tional and show that for an integer
nmber
of localized
electrons this leads simply to a redefinition
of the single-
particle
energies
by splitting
them up into two parts for
occupied
and empty
states,
which represent
the energy
costs to remove
and to add one localized
electron, i.e.,
the ionization
energy and the electron
afFinity.
The total
energy itself is that of a constrained
LDA but including
some corrections
for spin and orbital polarization
to take
Hund's
first and second rules into account which are not
included
in LDA.
Thus, we introduce a correction for localized states and
write down a total energy functional
as
where
p is the total charge
density,
(n,) is the set of
orbital
occupancies
for the localized
states.
Then,
we
will look for the LE, , in the form
where
E&&
is the electron-electron
interaction
for the
localized states in LDA which depends
only on the total
number
of localized electrons
ng = P, n, (in the follow-
ing, we will refer to the localized states as d states). We
suppose
this dependence
to be unsatisfactory
and sub-
tract it &om the LDA-total
energy.
Instead,
we add the
Hartree
expression
for d-d interaction
with a renormal-
ized Coulomb
parameter
U (here, for a while,
we drop
the exchange
interaction
and nonspherical
terms):
E+[(n;)] = 
U)
n, n, .
iwj
Of course, the main question
of such a consideration
is what is the reference point between LDA and Hartree-
Fock description
for the localized states or in other words
what is a reasonable
explicit form for the d-d interaction
in LDAT To answer
this question
let us consider
more
thoroughly
the scheme for calculating
Coulomb
and ex-
change (J) parameters
based on the constrained-LSDA
formalism.
As a first step in such an approach,
the total
energy as a function of occupation
number
and spin mag-
netization
mg of localized states should be extracted from
LSDA by applying
a variety of constraints.
These results
can be mapped
then on an analytical
dependence
of the
total energy E(n, mg) known
for the considered
model.
For instance, if we will restrict ourselves to the Hartree-
Fock approximation
for the electron-electron
interaction
and neglect orbital polarization
effects, E(ng, mg) for the
integer occupations
mill be simply
given by
The parameters
of the electron-electron
interaction
(U
and J) can be considered
as those
which
give the best
6t to constrained-LSDA
results and the parametrization
(4).
Thus,
we come to the conclusion
that
despite
of
all limitations
of LSDA the parametrization
(4) works
quite well and gives reasonable
estimations
for U and J
parameters
in many
cases.
So, if me will return
to the
previous
consideration
for EE,it is quite reasonable
to define the energy of d-d interaction
in LDA as

From the first point of view this decision looks strange,
because
on the one hand,
we blame L(S)DA and state
that
this approach
describes
the behavior
of localized
electrons
much
worse than the model Hartree-Fock
ap-
proximation
with renormalized
parameters,
and on the
other hand,
we try to use for the interaction
between
lo-
calized electrons in LDA the same form as in the Hartree-
Fock method.
But it is not exactly the same since in
Hartree-Fock
approximation
equation
(4) is valid
only
for integer
occupation
nmbers
and since only for inte-
ger values n; equal 0 or 1 expression
(3) is identical to
(5) [the form of the Hartree
approximation
with
frac-
tional
number
of electrons
differs from (5) and will be
discussed
later] whereas
in LSDA, we suppose
that the
dependence
(5) is valid for arbitrary
values of ng and mg
and even numerical
differentiation
can be used to extract
the U and J parameters
Rom LSDA:
tional the only allowed
dependence
of the total energy
on the number of electrons has the form of Eq. (10), i.e.,
consists of series of straight-line
segments.
Thus, we see
that the Hartree
expression
for the interaction
of local-
ized electrons automatically
satisfies the property
of the
exact density-functional
formalism.
This is the key for
the successful
applications
of Anderson
9 or Hubbard
models for strongly
correlated
systems
and at the same
time the basic limitation
of LSDA being characterized
by a smooth
dependence
of total energy
on occupation
numbers.
If we subtract
from (9) the d-d interaction
energy
in
LDA parametrized
in the form (5), we find out that inside
the interval N & ng & N + 1, LE, , behaves as
b,E, ,[z] =

A few remarks
concerning
the new functional
are ap-
propriate.
If we will look at the energy of Hartree
inter-
action alone as a function of number of d electrons in the
interval N & ng & N + 1 (where N is integer) it is easy
to show
(we suppose
that the occupations
for lowest N
states in Eq. (3) are n.; = 1 and the last partially
occu-
pied state contains z = ng 
N electrons) that it can be
presented
as
1
E
[n&] =
UN(N 
1) +-UNz.

By taking into account the values at the edges of in-
terval,
we come to the following z dependence
of E,
E[N+ z] = (1 
z)E [N]+ zE [N+ 1].
(10)
This means that the curve E
versus
ng is a series
of straight-line
segments
and its derivative BE [ng]/Bng
has discontinuities
at the integer values of ng. This result
has very important
fundamental
consequences
concern-
ing the description
of a system
with &actional electron
nnbers
(for example,
a system
which
could exchange
electrons
with a reservoir).
In quantnm
mechanics,
an
open system with a Buctuating
numbers
of particles can-
not be described by a pure state. Instead of this, a statis-
tical mixture
or ensemble
of states with their respective
probabilities
must be used.

et al.,

(16)
If we compare
this expression
with Slater's transition
state formalism
one can see that the eigenvalues
for d
states in the LDA+U have the meaning of ionization
and
afBnity energies
for the occupied and empty orbitals,
re-
spectively.
Any deviations
of the total number
of local-
ized electrons
from the integer
values increase the total
energy in accordance with the parabolic dependence
(11).
Therefore,
the effect of the term AE, , can be also con-
sidered
as an additional
constraint
enforcing
an integer
population
of the localized states.
Thus, we have shown how the discontinuity
of the one-
electron potential
existing in an exact density-functional
formalism
can be incorporated
in LDA. Now let us turn
to a more realistic
treatment
of electron-electron
inter-
action in the atomic limit and explicitly
include
the ex-
change
and orbital polarization
terms
in the functional
(1). In the Hartree-Fock
approximation,
the d-d interac-
tion energy can be expressed
in the general case as
J 
(F2 + F4)
14
(19)
However,
in the
following,
we will exploit
the
well-
known
fact that usually
the ratios between F2, F4 (and
Fs) integrals
are reasonably
well-defined
constants.
For
example, HF calculations
for 3d ions give values for the
ratio F4/F2 varying between 0.621 and 0.629. Analytical
result
for this case obtained
with hydrogenlike
functions
yield the value F4/F2 = 0.6514.
With
all parameters
U,.
 and J,
.
 determined,
we can
perform
now the saxne manipulations
as in the simplified
scheme
developed
above
where
intra-atomic
exchange
and orbital-polarization
contributions
where
neglected.
We suppose that in LDA the interaction
energy between
the localized
electrons
can be expressed
in the form (4)
with m = 0 and replace it by (15). Finally,
we come to
the following
expression
for the total energy
correction
for localized states:
degrees of freedom for all possible constraints
(number of
electrons
and spin magnetization)
and since, therefore,
only two parameters
characterizing
the interaction
in the
system of localized electrons
can be extracted.
Usually,
these are the Coulomb
and exchange
interaction
param-
eters which can be related to Slater's integrals
as
Integration
in (16) assumes
also summation
over spin
variables.
The parameters
U, and J,
 can be expressed

and therefore
the potential
acting
on the ith localized
orbital is
V, (r) = V

(21)
and Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients (a concrete form of these
expressions
can be found, for example,
in Ref. 19). pg(r)
in (17) is the wave function
for localized states and r&
(r&) is the smaller
(larger)
of r and r'.
The index
k
takes the values 0, 2, 4 and 0, 2, 4, 6 for states of d and f
syxnmetry.
Thus, in fact only three and four independent
parameters,
respectively,
are needed to define all values of
U; and J; (16). The principal
question
here is the choice
of F. It is known that direct calculations
of Slater's in-
tegrals
[Eq. (17)] based
on the atomic
wave
functions
strongly
overestimate
them due to the neglect of renor-
malization
effects.
This is especially
important
for the
F
integral
being identical
with the Coulomb
U param-
eter.
Sometimes
the use of LDA wave
functions
gives
quite reasonable
values for F, F4, and F6 integrals,
because
the overestixnation
arising
&om the neglect
of
renormalization
effects is approxixnately
canceled by the
larger spatial extension
of the LDA wave functions
(due
to the improper
cancelation of self-interaction
in the LDA
potential)
in comparison
with HF ones.
But this
is a
rather accidental fact. This problem
cannot be straight-
forwardly
solved by mapping
results of constrained
LSDA
total energy calculations
on the model (15) (even with in-
teger occupation
numbers)
since, the former has only two

(22)
Both intra-atomic
exchange
and
orbital-polarization
terms are included
in expression
(20) in the framework
of the one-electron
approximation
[thus,
we do not pre-
tend here to describe properly
all atomic multiplet
struc-
ture which is based entirely on the many-determinant
ap-
proach. It is well known that, in general, a many-electron
wave function in the form of a single Slater's determinant
is not an eigenstate
of the operators 8
and I . There-
fore, the energy (20) cannot be presented
as a pure term
and has contributions
arising
from different
terms].
To
illustrate
the role of intra-atomic
exchange
and orbital
polarization
we list in the Table I the values of the cor-
rection (20) for the case of two d electrons, one of which
occupies the one-electron
orbital
with
azimuthal
quan-
tm number 
2 and the other one an arbitrary
orbital.
It is evident that the total energy now depends
on which
states are exactly
occupied
by the electrons
and takes

Moreover,
we can see now that the lowest
value of the
total energy
is obtained
for two difFerent
determinants
(
2 g, 
1 g) and (
2 $, 0 f). It is not surprising
be-
cause both belong to the same
many-electron
ground-
state term sF (for these determinants
there is no admix-
ture of the next
P term)
and,
therefore,
should
have
the same expectation
values
of the total energy
(equal
8/49F 
9/441E ). This efFect was omitted in the at-
tempts to include the orbital polarization
effects in LSDA
in the form of the anzatz

re B is Racah pa-
rameter)
undertaken
by Eriksson et al.s and Norman. r
Since the description
of electron-electron
interaction
in the LDA+U approach
is based
on a model
similar
to the Hartree-Fock
method
(with renormalized
parame-
ters), we inevitably
come to the necessity to handle state-
dependent
potentials
and problems
connected
with the
appropriate
choice of orbitals
for corrections
like (23).
Sometimes
this can be done starting
from some physical
assumptions
(for example,
the choice of real harmonics
is quite suitable
for transition-metal
oxides
due to the
strong crystal-field
efFects).
But unfortunately
this be-
comes practically
impossible
for more complicated
sys-
tems (as an example of this, we can refer to the problem
of the formation
of orbital
magnetic
moments
which
is
usually a result of the competition
between
the crystal-
field and spin-orbit
interactions
which have different sets
of eigenvectors)
and
some numerical
scheme
is needed
for these aims. We will divide this problem
in two steps.
First, we look for the subspace
of occupied states min-
irnising
the total energy
functional
(1). This problem
is very
close to the
one appearing
in the SIC-LSDA
formalism
and the steepest
descent
method

needed in the framework of the LDA+U method since the

(due to the well-known
prop-
erty of the Hartree-Fock
approximation)
under transfor-
mations of such kind. Thus, the one-electron
spectra for

The calculations
for the electronic structure of all d ixn-
purities
in Rb were performed

geometry
us-
ing the ASA-LMTO methods
s in the scalar-relativistic
approximation.
The bcc-based
super-ceQ T Rbs (T de-
notes a transition
metal
atom)
has been used where a
T impurity
atom
has only Rb atoms
as first and sec-
ond nearest
neighbors.
The impurity-impurity
distance
is d;; = 2a, corresponding
to a third neighbor
distance
in the bcc lattice (a - lattice constant).
We have found
this to be a quite reasonable
approximation.
For exam-
ple, test calculations
using
the larger
super
cell TRbr
with d,, = 3a led to small
changes
for the U and J
parameters
of about
3'%%uo (the values of U for an Fe impu-
rity in the configuration
d
calculated
using FeRbs and
FeRbr super cells are 0.309 and 0.319 Ry, respectively).
Thus, we might expect that the size of the super cell will
be important
only for such cases where a localized state
appears very close to the Fermi level, for exeple, in sys-
tems which are candidates
for a mixed-valence
behavior.
That is why in this paper we restrict ourselves
only to a
qualitative
description
of such processes.

presented
in the Figs. 2 and 3. The main result of these
calculations
is the strong
dependence
of the U parame-
ters on the valence
configuration
[in this work,
we have
considered
only T + and T + states which correspond to
the configurations
(sp)2d" and (sp) d"+ ] of the impu-
rities.
This eEect appears
to be most significant
for 3d
ixnpurities
where the difference between U parameters
for
both configurations
reaches
30'%%uo and can play a very im-
portant
role in the deterxnination
of the ground-states
configuration
for these systems.
The source of such an
unusual
behavior
is the relaxation
of the d wave
func-
tion which becomes more extended
when the number
of
d electrons
increases
(in more detail,
this effect is dis-
cussed elsewheresr).
Within
every
row the dependence
of the Coulomb
parameters
on the atomic numbers
can
be well interpolated
by the straight
lines.
The values of J parameters
also depend on the valence
configuration
of the d impurity
but this dependence
is
somewhat
less pronounced
than that of the U parameters
(for example,
in the 3d-impurity
case the efFect is less
than
20%%up). We also note that the J values are practically
the same for aQ 4d and Gd impurities
in Rb as was already
mentioned
in Ref. 28.

the impurity
site and all other electronic states and allow
only the charge transfer
between these two subsystems.
We will stick to this approximation
in the following.
Moreover,
we asse the following
order for the occupa-
tion of the one-electron
states: 6rst m = 
2, 
1,0, 1,2
for spin up and then m = 2, 1,0, 
1,
2 for spin dcnun,
which corresponds
to the Hund's
first and second rules.
Since in this work
we restrict
ourselves
to the atomie-
sphere approximation
in which the LDA part of potential
is spherically
symmetric
at the impurity
site, the condi-
tion (25) is automatically
satisfied for complex harmon-
ics and this choice of basis set is quite appropriate
for
the construction
of corrections in the LDA+U formalism
(22).
All calculations
were performed
in accordance with the
following
scheme.
We assumed
first some set of single-
particle
levels to be occupied
for a given configuration
(input).
Then,
using
the single-particle
LDA energies
for the d states and the calculated
U and J values
for
this configuration,
the positions of occupied
and empty
states
in LDA+U
w'ith
respect
to Fermi
level can be
found
(output).
Since the single-particle
eigenvalues
in
the LDA+U formalism
are directly
connected
with ion-
ization potential
and electron affinity,
only knowledge
of
the single-particle
energies is quite sufBcient to determine
the stability of the given con6guration.
The condition for
charge
equilibrium
between
the localized states and the
host (which appears here as a reservoir)
can be expressed
in the simple form:
s
(ng) ( Ep (ng) (s; (ng),
(29)
where
s
(s; )
is
the
highest
(lowest)
occupied
(empty)
one-electron
level
in LDA+U
and E is the
Fermi level.
Therefore,
the considered
configuration
is
only stable, if the output
eigenvalues
are consistent
with
the assumed
input
configuration.
Otherwise,
occupied
(empty) states are situated
above (below) the Fermi level
and the considered
trial con6guration
is evidently
not
stable
since
removal
(addition)
of one electron
would
lower the total energy.
Positions
of single-particle
d levels of all transition-
metal impurities
are presented
in Fig. 4 for both config-
urations.
One can see that most d impurities
in Rb have
the configuration
d"+i in the ground state (valence state
Ti+). Two exceptions to this rule are Mn and Re having
the configuration
ds. Moreover,
we also find that for the
Pd impurity
in Rb neither the ds nor the d
configuration
is stable since in the ground-state
it has a fully-occupied
d shell (di ). One comment
illustrating
the need for an
accurate
ehoiee of the U and J parameters
in LDA+U
calculations
should be added here. As it was mentioned
in the previous
section, the U and J parameters
for 3d
impurities
in Rb strongly
depend
on the configuration.
For example,
for the Mn impurity
in Rb the Coulomb
interaction
parameter
is 0.39 and 0.29 Ry for configura-
tions ds and d, respectively.
If we tried to apply LDA+U
scheme for this case but with the same values of U and J
(equal, for example, those for configuration
ds) we would
get the paradoxical
result that neither the ds nor the d
configuration
of Mn is stable
and that the addition
of
one electron to d
and removal
of one electron
&om d
would
lower the total energy.
This example
shows that
the values
of the electron-electron
interaction
parame-
ters for different
con6gurations
should
always be consis-
tent with the shift of LDA single-electron
energies
which
takes place during
such a transition.
On the other hand,
one can also look at the configu-
rational
stability
using a total energy analysis.
It would
be interesting
to see if in LDA+U this leads to the same
result as the above discussion of the single-particle
ener-
gies. The differences of total energies
between both con-
figurations
of d impurities
in Rb, AE = E(d"+i) 
E(d")
are shown
in Fig. 5. We can see that only two impuri-
ties are characterized
by a positive
difference AE, i.e.,
Mn and Re.
All other impurities
have a d +i ground-
state configuration.
Thus, in LDA+U both schemes, the
single-electron
levels and the total energy
analysis,
are
completely
consistent
and
give an identical
description
of the configurational
stability.
Thus,
in the 3d and Sd series both Cr and Mn, W,
and Re, respectively,
have a ds configuration.
This a
consequence
of the exchange
interaction
which
favors a
half-filled
d band. For both ds and ds configurations
the
total energy in LDA+U can be rewritten
as
E
ELDA
J

md

(30)
since in these cases the orbital polarization
effect gives no
contribution
to the total energy. This is quite obvious for
the configuration
ds where all spin up states are occupied
and all spin down ones are empty,
but it is also true for
the configuration
ds since it has only one electron
with
spin down interacting
with a spherically
symmetric
shell
of spin up electrons so that the total energy does not de-
pend on the orbital
quantm
number
of the spin down
electron.
The last term in Eq. (30), the intra-atomic
ex-
change term being responsible
for the Hund's
first rule,
evidently
prefers the configuration
with the highest
spin
magnetic
moment
and takes its minimal
value
for the
configuration
d
(mq = 5).
This is the driving
force
which can stabilize the configuration
ds instead of ds. In
Table III, we have plotted
the above two contributions,
i.e., LDA and intra-atomic
exchange, to the total energy
difference
b,E between the two configurations
ds and ds
for the isoelectronic
impurities
Mn, Tc, and Re.
The
exchange part LE is always positive since both the mo-
ment and the J value are larger for configuration
ds (see
Fig. 3). The continuous
decrease between
the third and
fifth series re8ects the decreasing J values of Fig. 3. On
the other hand, the LDA contributions
favor the d
con-
figuration,
signalizing
the usual tendency
of larger band
fillings with increasing
valence. The large value obtained
for Tc is an atomic effect. In the 4d series the Ss level is
shifted to higher energies with respect to the 4d levels, fa-
voring a somewhat
larger d population.
Therefore, for Tc
the d
configuration
is more stable.
For Re one expects
the same efFect to occur but in the 5d series relativistic
effects become important
in addition
and favor smaller
d
occupancies
so that in the end the ds con6guration
wins
for Re.
In all our calculations,
we have neglected
the lattice

relaxation
around
the impurities.
However,
due to the
large
volume
difFerences
between
the alkali
metals
and
the transition
metals,
large relaxations
are expected to
occur around
the impurities.
In order to illustrate
pos-
sible relaxation
effects, we have performed
calculations
for homogeneously
compressed
MnRb3 supercells,
assum-
ing equal Wigner-Seitz
spheres
for both the Mn and Rb
atoms
(see Fig. 6). The theoretical
values
for the equi-
librium
volume of the MnRb3 supercell
differ drastically
&om that of pure Rb metal: corresponding
Wigner-Seitz
radii are 4.5 for the MnRb3 supercell
and 5.04 for pure
Rb with a difference
of more than 10%. We also note
that both configurations
have about
the same
equilib-
rium volumes.
Due to the relaxation
the one-electron,
d
levels drop approximately
by 10 mRy with respect to the
Fermi level. Thus, we suspect that for several
d impuri-
ties in Rb the relaxation
eKects could change the ground-
state configurations.
As an example,
we might
consider
the Re-impurity
in Rb where the highest
occupied state
for the configuration
d
is located at 6.6 mRy above the
Fermi level. Therefore,
we have found this configuration
to be unstable
for the lattice parameter
of pure Rb, but
it might
be stabilized
by the relaxation.

transform
to the configurations
d
and d, respectively.
In addition
to lattice relaxations,
also, relativistic
ef-
fects can become
very important,
especially
for 5d im-
purities.
In this
work,
we used
the scalar-relativistic
formalism
which includes
the Darwin
and mass-velocity
terms
but
completely
neglects
the spin-orbit
coupling.
The importance
of spin-orbit
coupling
for 5d impurities
can be illustrated
by the following
example.
For a Re
impurity
in Rb,
we estimated
the spin-orbit
coupling
constant
(() as 13.3 and 11.

for the configura-
tions
d
and d, respectively.
In the first order of the
perturbation
theory
the spin-orbit

tion of Re the highest
occupied state will be located at
6.6 11.

and, therefore,
the spin-orbit

makes this con-
figuration
unstable.
Finally,
we note that in all our calculations,
we have
neglected the hybridization
between the localized d states
of the impurity
and the sp states of the Rb host. Within
the LDA+U approach
hybridization
leads to a resonance
broadening
of the d levels.
This has basically
two con-
sequences.
States close to the Fermi-energy
can become
partially
occupied.
In addition,
states
well
below
the
Fermi energy,
which are practically
fully occupied,
also
do not have an integer local occupation
number
since part
of the weight
resides on the neighboring
sites. Previous
calculations
based on an "older" LDA+U scheme, but
including
hybridization
clearly showed, that even for rela-
tively narrow resonances the local d charges and moments
show significant
deviations
&om integer
values.
We also
expect similar modifications
for our present results,
once
hybridization
is included.
Due to these approximations,
i.e., the neglect of lat-
tice relaxation,
hybridization,
and spin-orbit
coupling,
our present results have a more qualitative
character and
cannot
make reliable predictions
for the ionic configura-
tions of the impurities.
But, nevertheless
some qualita-
tive comparisons
with
available
experimental
data can
be done.
From the ionic-type
analysis
applied
to the
experimental
results
obtained
with the time-differential
perturbed
p-ray distribution
method,
Ni impurities
in Rb host were reported to have a ds configuration
(spin,
orbital, and total moments
are correspondingly
S = 1/2,
L = 2, and J = 5/2) which is in good agreement
with our
estimations.
Experimental
results for Fe impurities
in Rb
can be well understood
assuming
the Fe(ds) configuration
with 8 = 2, whereas
we found it to be Fe(d). These dis-
crepancies
probably
arise from the approximations
used
16 870
I. V. SOLOVYEV, P. H. DBDERICHS, AND V. I. ANISIMOV
50
in our calculations
as already
mentioned
above.
On the
other
hand,
interpretation
of the experimental
results
is often rather
ambiguous
and strongly
depends
on the
choice of used
model
parameters.
Both more realistic
calculations
of the electronic
structure
and more care-
ful analysis
of experimental
data are needed
to clarify
the ground-state
configuration
of Fe impurities
in Rb.
The magnetic
behavior
of Mo and Ru impurities
in Rb
and Cs has been explained
by assuming
predominant
d
and d
(8 = 5/2 and 8 = 3/2, respectively)
configu-
rations
for themz4 I which
is in good agreement
with
our findings.
Pd ions in Rb and Cs were predicted to be
nomagnetic.
It is consistent
with the fully-occupied
d
configuration
of Pd impurities
obtained
in present
work. Tc impurities
in Rb were reported
in Ref. 26 as an
example of d system with mixed-valence
behavior.
In our
calculations,
we found that Tc has the electronic
config-
uration
d6 in the ground-state
but the energy
difFerence
between
the d
and
d
configurations
for Tc impurity
in Rb is relatively
small (0.036 Ry/impurity
site). Other
candidates
for mixed-valence
behavior in accordance with
our calculations
could be some impurities
from the 5d
row (which were not investigated
experimentally
yet): Re
(b,E =0.022 Ry/impurity
site) and Ta (which has prac-
tically the same total energies
for the configurations
d3
and d4).
IV. SUMMA. RY
In conclusion,
we have derived a version of the LDA+U
formalism
which
allows
us to reproduce
the
"atomic
limit" in band structure
calculations
and is suitable
for
the description
of systems
with strongly
localized
elec-
trons.
We have
shown
that it can be considered
as a
constrained
LDA with additional
corrections
describing
the spin- and orbital-polarization
effects.
The disconti-
nuity of the one-electron
potential
known for an "exact"
density
functional
is also incorporated
in this formalism.
The method has been applied to the analysis of the elec-
tronic structure
and configurational
stability
of d impu-
rities in Rb. We have shown that in this formulation
of
the LDA+U method
the single-electron
levels and the
total energy
analysis
are completely
consistent
and give
an identical
description
of the configurational
stability.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
