Chemistly at the Universidad de Valencia (1967-1973), and received his 
Ph.D. at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 1976. The work 
was done under the direction of Professor Antonio Cones on the Catalytic 
Isomerization of Xylenes at the lnstituto de Catalisis y Petroleoquimica

catalysts is initiated with the older amorphous 
silica-alumina and aluminium phosphates and fol- 
lowed by catalysts with more interest at present 
which are discussed in order of increasing acid 
strength: zeolites, heteropoly acids, and sulfated 
metal oxides. The aim of this review is to present 
an extended summary of the state of the art and the 
current and the future tendencies in the field. 
1. Nature of Acid Sites on Solid Acid Catalysts 
The acidity of a material is defined relative to a 
base used in acid-base interaction. In this sense the 
solid acid may be understood as a solid which changes 
the color of a basic indicator or as a solid on which a 
base is chemically adsorbed. From the point of view 
of Bronsted acidity, the solid acid is able to donate, 
or at least partially transfer, a proton which becomes 
associated with surface anions. By taking into ac- 
count the Lewis definition, 
the solid acid must be able 
to accept an electron pair. Thus, when the acid 
surface reacts with a Lewis base molecule a coordi- 
nate bond is formed, and this is clearly different from 
oxidation-reduction reactions, in which a complete 
transfer of one or two electrons occurs. 
There is a large number of reactions which are 
catalyzed by acid sites, and their importance has 
surpassed the interest in the fundamental chemistry. 
It can be said that solid acids are the most important 
solid catalysts used today, considering both the total 
amount used and the final economical impact. Then, 
when a solid acid catalyst is to be designed and 
optimized in order to carry out a certain reaction, the 
following questions have to be necessarily an- 
swered: What type of acid sites are needed, either 
Bronsted or Lewis? What is the acid strength 
required to activate the reactant molecule, and 
finally, how are the number of the required acid sites 
in a given solid acid catalyst maximized? 
In order to answer these questions, different tech- 
niques have been developed to determine the surface 
acidity, and they will be briefly described in the next 
section. 
I/. Physicochemical Characterization of Surface 
Acidity 
A. Titration Methods 
Considering that the acidity of a solid catalyst is 
manifested by the conversion of an adsorbed neutral 
base into its conjugated acid, the simplest and most 
widespread method of the acid strength determina- 
tion for a solid catalyst involves a collaboration of 
suitable color indicator adsorbed on its surface. 
In order to apply this method it has to be accepted 
that the pH scale used to determine acid strength in 
dilute aqueous media can be extrapolated to very 
strong acid media by means of overlapping indicator 
comparison. By use of an appropriate series of 
indicators, the extrapolated pH scale is given by Ho 
which is the Hammett acidity functi0n.l Thus, when 
the indicator (B) 
reacts with a Bronsted acid (AH) 
to 
form the corresponding conjugated acid (HB+) 
and 
base (A-), the acid strength is expressed by the 
Hammett acidity function in the following way: 
In the case of the interaction with a Lewis acid site, 
HO 
is expressed by 
where [Bl is the concentration of the neutral base 
which reacted with the Lewis acid or electron pair 
acceptor, A. 
At this point, the acid strength of a solid catalyst 
can be estimated by noting which members of a series 
of Hammett indicators (Table 1)2 
are adsorbed in the 
acid form.3 Thus, provided that those indicators are 
chosen whose acid colors are intense enough to mask 
their basic  color, the determination can be carried 
out in the following way: each of a series of Hammett 
indicators in dilute benzene solution is added to 
separate samples of the dried solid and the resulting 
colors are noted. If the color is that of the acid form 
of the indicator, then the value of the HO 
function of 
the surface is the same or lower than the pKa of the 
Inorganic Solid Acids 
conjugate acid of the indicator. Then, the lower the 
pK, of the color changing indicator is, 
the greater the 
acid strength of the solid. Detailed information on 
the acid strength determination using colored indica- 
tors can be found in the literatre.-l 
Indicators of 
different pK, values and amine titration can give the 
number of acid sites at various acid strengths. The 
method consists, in practice, of titrating a solid acid 
suspended in benzene with n-butylamine using an 
indicator. In order to have reproducible values by 
this titration techniques, variables such as titration 
time, volume of added indicator, pore size, and 
moisture should be carefully onsidered. 
Even in the case when all experimental precautions 
have been taken, the above titration method suffers 
from a large number of limitations, starting from the 
fact that equilibrium is rarely achieved,14J5 
and 
therefore acidity data from indicator methods should 
not be used straightforward to predict catalytic 
behavior. Moreover it should be taken into account 
that this method gives the sum of the amount of 
Bronsted and Lewis acids, and only if arylcarbinols 
are used as indicators, Bronsted acid sites can be 
specifically 
measured.16 Another problem arises from 
the visual determination of the color change, which 
could be even more subjective when colored or dark 
catalyst samples are used. In order to alleviate this 
problem, spectrophotometric methods have been 
used,17J8 
and in some cases the spectroscopically 
measured titers are much lower than the visual 
titers, specially at high acid  t r e n g t h s .  J  J   
However, 
it has been found20-22 
that the traditional Hammett 
measurements based on determination of the position 
of the protonation equilibrium of an 
indicator by UV- 
visible spectroscopy are not applicable to reallife 
catalysts. Indeed, when indicator methods are used 
there is the possibility that the color or the bond 
arising from the acid form of the indicator may also 
be produced by surface sites which are not catalyti- 
cally active. It appears then that if a solid acid has 
a high acid strength, as measured with indicators, 
this does not necessarily imply that it is going to be 
catalytically active. This has been the case observed 
with sulfated zirconia catalysts23 
for which Hammett 
indicator technique showed that ZrOz is already in 
the superacid region, while it is inactive for n-butane 
isomerization. Moreover, even in the case of n- 
butylamine, quantitative measurements of band 
intensity can be misleading if there is considerable 
overlap of broadened absorption bands from both 
forms of the indicators. 
In order to overcome the above limitations, calori- 
metric titration of solid acids with amines has been 
developed.5J7,21,24,25 
However, Farcasiu and Ghen- 
ciu26,27 
have shown that, besides the uncertainties 
associated with the thermal effects due to interac- 
tions other than the acid-base, the transfer of more 
than one proton can be involved. Thus, some mol- 
ecules treated as simple bases in calorimetric stud- 
ies24,25 
were later proven by NMR to be at least in 
part deprotonated in the acid used for alorimetry., 
The solid acid titration can also be followed cata- 
lytically. Indeed, one can measure the catalytic 
activity for a given reaction after adding different 
amounts of basic reagents such as alkali metal ions 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, 
No. 3 561 
or volatile amines. A plot of the activity versus the 
amount of added base allows one to determine the 
minimum amount required for zero activity, and 
therefore the number of acid sites. The relative acid 
strength of solids for a given reaction can also be 
estimated from the slopes of the titration curves.67,29,30 
However, this method presents the limitation coming 
from the fact that the basic molecule used as poison 
can be adsorbed on both active and inactive acid 
sites.31 
Despite the disadvantages of the solution phase 
titration methods, they are still used and further 
work is being carried out. More recent studies have 
been devoted to determine the Bronsted and Lewis 
site concentration by means of a dual sample titration 
method.32 This method relies on the experimental 
observation that sterically hindered pyridines such 
as 2,6-dimethylpyridine or 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine 
bind much more strongly to Bronsted than to Lewis 
acid sites.33 Moreover, a sterically unhindered base 
such as pyridine or n-butylamine is able to displace 
the hindered base from the Lewis but not from the 
Bronsted acid site.34s35 
It is better to carry out the titration in a dry box 
to avoid interference from water and other atmo- 
spheric  contaminant, and also ultrasonic treat- 
ment of the amine-treated catalyst slurry is useful 
to establish an equilibrium between adsorbed and 
solution-phase amine.36 Nevertheless, it should be 
taken into account that ultrasonication can promote 
indicator decomposition and catalyst particle frag- 
mentation.37 
The dual sample titration method has been used 
in obtaining the number of Bronsted and Lewis acid 
sites and in the study of the influence of calcination 
temperature in amorphous silia-aluminas. 
De- 
spite the fact that this method represents a clear 
improvement over conventional amine titration with 
indicator methods, it still presents some limitations 
derived from the fact that 2,6-dimethylpyridine 
is not 
completely selective for adsorption on Bronsted acid 
sites,39 
and on top of that, it cannot be applied to 
molecular sieve catalysts because some of the amine 
titrants and indicators cannot access the acid sites 
located inside the channels and cavities. 
Overall, it has to be said that even though the use 
of indicators and the Hammett acidity function (eq 
1) 
is still used by many authors to measure the acid 
strength of solid acids, they should be aware that this 
is intrinsically inappropriate. Indeed, the use of the 
HO 
function is adequated for homogeneous aqueous 
solutions of acids, but in the case of heterogenous 
acids, neither CH+ 
nor the surface acidity function HO 
have an explicit physical meaning. Therefore, the 
application of Hammett indicators to characterize the 
catalytic properties of solid acids can be misleading. 
8. Adsorption and Temperature-Programmed 
Desorption of Base Molecules 
Adsorption of volatile amines such as NH3, pyri- 
dine, n-butylamine, quinoline, etc., can be used to 
determine the number of acid sites on solid catalysts. 
An excess of the base is adsorbed, and what is

considered physically adsorbed is removed by pro- 
longed evacuation. After this, whatever is left on the 
surface is accounted for as chemically adsorbed, and 
it measures the total amount of acid sites. The acid 
strength distribution can be found by direct calori- 
metric measurements giving the heat of adsorption 
at different base coverages, or by thermal desorption 
(TPD) 
of the preadsorbed base and calculation of the 
proportion of adsorbed base evacuated at various 
temperature.-O- 
The relationship between tem- 
perature of peak maximum (T,) and activation 
energy of chemisorbed base adsorption (Ed) is given 
by the following equation: 
2 log T
,
 - 
log p = 
Edl2.303 RT, + 
log (E&,IRK,) 
(3) 
where p is the linear heating rate, A, is the amount 
of base adsorbed at saturation, KO 
is the preexpo- 
nential factor in the desorption rate expression, and 
R is the gas constant. Although TPD method does 
not give directly a plot of acid strength distribution 
expressed by the Hammett (Ho) 
or arylcarbinol (HR) 
functions, a correlation has been establihed: 
Ho 
= 
a 
+ 
bIT, 
(4) 
where a and b are empirical constants specific for the 
acid solid. Figure 1 
shows for two systems, namely 
alumina and silica-alumina, this linear correlation 
between 1/T, and acid strength as related to the HO 
scale. 
In this sense, NH3 TPD has been extensively used 
to measure the acidity of solid catalysts.49 However, 
it has to be considered that this procedure may be 
misleading if ammonia dissociates giving NH2- and 
H+ 
species 
which are adsorbed on both acid and basic 
sites and this depends on the kind of solid and on 
the adsorption conditions. To this respect Juskelis 
et aL50 have shown that a nonacidic, but basic, solid 
such as calcium oxide does not only adsorb NH3 but 
also strongly retains the ammonia even at high 
temperatures. A m i n e   O -    
have been recommended 
as more appropriate adsorbates than NH3, for the

acidity measurements by TPD. It then appears that 
the choice of the basic probe molecule is critical for 
the adequate estimation of acidity from the TPD 
results. For example, tert-butylamine has been used 
for acidity measurements on solid acids,55 
but it 
decomposes to olefins on strong acid sites at high 
desorption  temperature. However on solids with 
medium acidity, alkylamines can be quite useful as 
the acidity probes.57 
Furthermore, it has to be considered that basic 
molecules are adsorbed on both Bronsted and Lewis 
acid sites, and in those cases when only one of the 
two types of acid sites is catalytically active, the TPD 
results will not correlate with catalytic activity, 
unless the adsorption on the two sites is differenti- 
ated by spectroscopic techniques. This is well il- 
lustrated by the adsorption of NH3 and desorption 
in the 100-400 "C range onto a series of amorphous 
silica-alumina catalysts containing various amounts 
(0-100%) of 
From the NH3 adsorption 
isotherms, free energies, entropies, and heats of 
adsorption were calculated. The results presented 
in Figure 2 show that the isosteric heat of adsorption 
drops rapidly with surface coverage. This could be 
interpreted by assuming that the strongest acid sites, 
i.e., those with a larger heat of adsorption are the 
first to adsorb NH3. Moreover, the isosteric heat of 
adsorption was maximum for the pure A 1 2 0 3  sample, 
and systematically decreases with the increase of the 
Si02 content. From these data one should conclude 
that the 100% 
A1203 sample has the largest number 
of the acid sites having the highest strength and 
consequently that this should be the most active 
catalyst for acid-catalyzed reactions. However it is 
known that a maximum in activity for reactions such 
as catalytic cracking or C g  alkylaromatic isomeriza- 
t i  n    
occurs on silica-aluminas with 25% wt &03. 
Then it appears that adsorption methods provide 
particularly misleading acidity values when a sub- 
stantial amount of base is strongly adsorbed on sites 
which are catalytically inactive. On top of that, the 
results of A u r o  x    
for various probe molecules on a 
medium-pore zeolite (ferrierite) show that the mea- 
Inorganic Solid Acids 
sured heat of adsorption is a function of the surface 
coverage, and therefore the acid strength population 
seems to be dependent on the nature of the basic 
probe molecule used for the calorimetric study. 
In the case of solid superacids, e.g. the sulfated 
metal oxides, the conventional TPD method using 
desorption temperature to measure the acid strength 
is inadequate because of the decomposition of the 
sorbate occurring before the desorption. In order to 
overcome this problem, an approach has been pre- 
 e n t e d    
that utilizes TPD to monitor the acidity, in 
which the observation of a TPD peak with a base 
indicating a certain level of acidity is similar to the 
observation of a Hammett indicator color change 
registering a certain level of acidity. This is achieved 
by using alkyl- and fluoro-substituted benzenes to 
measure the relative strength of metal halide and 
zeolite acid catalysts,60s61 
while the probe basicities 
are fine-tuned at the molecular level by changing the 
ring substituents. However, Jatia et a1.62 
have found 
no correlation between the TPD peak of adsorbed 
benzene and the catalytic activity for n-butane isomer- 
ization. These authors showed that the TPD peak 
at ca. 560 "C is from CO2, S02, 
and 0 2  
indicating that 
the adsorbed benzene is totally oxidized in the 
catalyst samples. TPD can be used to monitor 
selectively Lewis acid sites when suitable probe 
molecules are used.63 For instance the TPD of NO 
monitored by ESR gives a very specific 
measurement 
of the Lewis acid sites on solid catalysts.64 
In general, it is recommended to analyze the exit 
gases during the TPD measurements, as well as to 
couple TPD acidity determinations with spectroscopic 
techniques in order to determine the bonding of the 
probe molecules with the different type of acid sites. 
However if one is willing to use the TPD of bases for 
the determination of heats of adsorption and from 
these values to deduce acid site strength, one should 
be aware that while eq 2 assumes that reabsorption 
and diffusion of the desorbed base are negligible, 
this 
is very seldom true.65 Moreover the example de- 
scribed above50 
and which shows that CaO strongly 
retains NH3, clearly indicate the dangers of using 
temperature of peak maximum to discuss heats of 
adsorption and acid strengths, unless the nature of 
the adsorption sites are perfectly known.

C. Vibrational Spectroscopy Methods 
Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy have been 
used to determine acidity of solid catalysts by study- 
ing adsorbed probe  molecule.- The IR spectros- 
copy is a very powerful technique since it allows one 
to look directly at the hydroxyls present on a solid 
acid catalyst and consequently to see which of them 
can interact with basic molecules and therefore to 
find out which presents Bronsted acidity and which 
of them are, or are not, accessible to base molecules 
of different sizes. In principle, the concentration of 
hydroxyl groups, and therefore the concentration of 
potential Bronsted acid sites, could be obtained from 
the intensity of the corresponding 
IR band. However, 
for quantitative estimation the extinction coefficients 
of the different types of hydroxyls contributing the 
IR band are required, something which is very 
seldom possible.

Attempts have been made to measure the surface 
concentration of different hydroxyl groups on the 
basis of the assignment of 0-H stretching frequen- 
cies to specific types of hydroyls,6- 
with limited 
success in most of the cases. Then, it is not surpris- 
ing that most of the information on acidity of solid 
catalysts obtained by IR comes from spectroscopic 
studies of adsorbed molecules. From this point of 
view two main groups of probe molecules have been 
used. The first one involves the adsorption of rela- 
tively strong basic molecules such as pyridine, sub- 
stituted pyridines, quinoline, and diazines. Among 
them, 1,2- and 1,Cdiazines are less basic than 
pyridines and are more appropriate for the selective 
detection of very strong acid sites and for the semi- 
quantitative measurement of Lewis and Bronsted 
acid sites, but they are in general less informative 
than pyridine. The pioneering works of Parry,74 
Basila et al.,75 
and Hughes and White76 
showed that 
the pyridine molecule is able to simultaneously 
determine the concentration of Bronsted and Lewis 
acid sites. Moreover, when IR is combined with 
thermal desorption, it can provide estimation of acid 
strength distribution. In Table 2 the IR frequencies 
of the bands from pyridine adsorbed on solid acids 
are given. It can be seen there that the characteristic 
bands of pyridine protonated by Bronsted acid sites 
(pyridinium ions) appear at -1540 and 1640 cm-l, 
while the bands from pyridine coordinated to Lewis 
acid sites appear at -1450 and 1620 cm-'. Then, by 
measuring the intensity of those bands and from the 
values of the extinction coefficients given by several 
a  t h o r s   -    
it is possible to calculate the number of 
Bronsted and Lewis acid sites capable of retaining 
pyridine at certain desorption temperatures. When 
there are different types of hydroxyl groups on a solid 
acid, it is possible by looking at the stretching bands 
of the hydroxyl groups before and after the pyridine 
adsorption, as well as after desorption at different 
temperatures, to determine which hydroxyls are 
acidic and to characterize their relative acid strength. 
As an example, the results from Figure 3 show that 
in the ultrastable zeolite 
Y, the external and internal 
silanols (3746 and 3700 cm-l, respectively) and 
hydroxyl groups from extraframework alumina (3670 
cm-l) are not acidic toward pyridine. On the other 
hand, the Si-OH-Al-bridged hydroxyl groups are 
acidic and they are able to retain pyridine at T

Pa. It has been recently found79 
that at 
low pyridine coverages iminium ions can be formed 
on strong acid sites. They are produced at the 
expense of pyridinium ions and are characterized by 
a band at 1462 cm-l. 
Laser Raman spectroscopy can also be used to 
observe pyridine adsorbed on Bronsted and Lewis

acid sites and that H-bonded.80 However it has to 
be pointed out that since Raman bands arise from 
polarizability changes which accompany skeletal and 
stretching vibrations, the protonation of pyridine is 
difficult to detect. Therefore, Raman spectroscopy 
has a low sensitivity for measuring Bronsted acidity. 
The Raman study of pyridine adsorbed on cation 
exchanged zeolites have shown the capability of this 
technique for determining the Lewis acid strength 
of metal cations. It has been founds1 
that the band 
near 1000 cm-l, arising from the symmetric ring 
breathing mode of adsorbed pyridine, shifts linearly 
to a higher frequency as a function of the electrostatic 
potential of the zeolite cation. 
Quinoline is a more basic and larger molecule than 
pyridine and can also simultaneously distinguish 
between Bronsted and Lewis acids. The spectra 
given in Figure 482 show the characteristic bands 
associated with the presence of Bronsted and Lewis 
acid sites. Because of its larger size, quinoline can 
be used in some cases, and under controlled condi- 
tions, to measure the amount of external acid sites 
in microporous acid materials, with pores smaller 
than -6 A. 
NHB can also be used to distinguish between 
Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, since it gives charac- 
teristic IR bands associated with NH4+ and NH3 
coordinated to Lewis acid sites.83

Bronsted acid sites can be selectively measured by 
IR, using substituted pyridines (2,6-dimethylpyri- 
dine) as probe  molecule., 
Pyridine and NH3 have been widely used as probe 
molecules, because they are quite stable and the IR 
spectroscopy can differentiate and quantify the 
amounts adsorbed on Bronsted and Lewis sites. 
However, owing to their strong basicity they adsorb 
strongly, and therefore, unspecifically even on the 
weakest acid sites. Thus, weaker bases have been 
used as probe molecules for solid acid catalysts, and 
quantitative IR data for systems involving CO, SH2, 
acetone, benzene, olefins, acetonitrile, Hs, etc. have 
been r e p  r t e d .   -    
Adsorption of carbon monoxide at 
low temperatures 
(77 K) is largely used now, owing to the fact that this 
is a very weak soft base, which has a small molecular 
size which excludes steric hindrance, and CO is 
unreactive at low temperature. It specifically 
inter- 
acts with both hydroxyl acid groups and cationic 
Lewis acid sites. It has been demonstrated that 
CO interacts with surface hydroxyl groups via 
H - b  n d i n g .   -    
The H-bond donor strength is con- 
sidered as a qualitative measure of the acidity of the 
OH groups involved. Indeed, the H-bond formation 
will affect both the hydroxyl group and the CO 
molecule and this is reflected by the frequency shifts 
of the 0-H 
and CO stretching bands.90-92>95 
An 
empirical correlation between the heat of adsorption 
of CO and the experimental frequency shift AVOH, 
has 
been found:91

where Q is the heat of condensation (6.77 kJ mol-l) 
of CO at 77 K. Alternatively, the heat of adsorption 
can be determined from the temperature dependence 
of the equilibrium adsorption constant. 
When CO was applied as a probe molecule to 
determine the acidity of different hydroxyl groups 
such as silanols from silica and bridged hydroxyl 
groups from a HZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 51, a shift in 
the OH frequency of -90 cm-lgO

respectively, was found. This gives adsorption en- 
thalpies of 16 and 28 kJ mol-l for silica and HZSM- 
5, 
respectively, indicating the stronger interaction of 
CO with bridged hydroxyls, and therefore their 
stronger acidity. Figure 5 also shows a smaller 
interaction of CO with other hydroxyl groups on 
zeolite such as those associated with hydroxylated 
extraframework (3670 cm-l) or internal silanols 
(3500 cm-'). 
If Lewis acidity associated to metal cations is 
involved, a u bond becomes the dominating interac- 
tion. Comparably weak bond energies and higher 
carbonyl stretching frequencies than the gas phase 
are the consequences. For instance, in the case of 
y-Al2O3 which presents a large amount of Lewis acid 
sites, the carbonyl IR bands of CO adsorbed at 77 K 
and 20 Torr, after evacuation at 77 K,92 
appears as a 
strong band at 2152 cm-l with shoulders at 2140 and 
2188 cm-l. The 2152 and 2140 cm-' bands are 
associated to H-bonded and CO physically adsorbed 
C0,89,90 
while the 2188 cm-l band shifts to 2196 cm-l 
on evacuation and its intensity does not seem to 
change significantly indicating that it corresponds to 
a stable surface complex which has been identi- 
fied as a CO molecule held by a Lewis acid site 
A13+.89,90,92-102 
Therefore, together with the position, 
the stability of the various carbonyl bands has also 
to be considered in order to carry out the proper band 
assignation.

when Na+ is added. 
It appears then that carbon monoxide is a highly 
specific probe which allows the establishment of the 
range of acidities when different types of hydroxyls 
and Lewis sites are involved. 
The shifts of hydroxyl bands upon adsorption of 
aromatics and ethylene on solid acids indicate the 
strength of the Bronsted acid 
When using 
ethylene as a probe molecule, the adsorption should 
be carried out at temperatures as low as 210 K in 
order to avoid olefin polymerization on the acid sites. 
Hydrogen sulfide can also be used in a similar way 
as ethylene and has proved to be an excellent probe 
molecule to characterize strong acid sites in zeo- 
lites.l1 Finally, acetonitrile which is a small mol- 
ecule with low basicity, PKB 
= 24, and even better 
the deuterated acetonitrile which gives a less complex 
spectrum, is of great utility to measure strong acid 
sites. The formation of hydrogen bonds between CD3- 
CN and Bronsted acid sites gives, for instance, in the 
case of zeolites three IR bands at 2900, 2400, and 
1700 cm-1.111J12

D. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Methods 
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) 
is a powerful 
technique to study solid acid c a t a l y  t s .  l  -  '   
Ad- 
vanced NMR methods such as cross-polarization 
(CP), magic-angle spinning (MAS) of solids, high- 
resolution and pulse-field-gradient magnetic reso- 
nance, multinuclear spectroscopy, and variable- 
temperature MAS NMR120 
have increased the capa- 
bility of this technique to study acid sites in solid acid 
catalysts. Indeed, the total number of the acid sites 
and their relative strength can be measured by 
proton MAS NMR techniques in samples of solid 
acids containing as low as 10l8 
protons.121-128 
The 
dynamic character of Bronsted acidity has been 
established from the mean lifetime of protons calcu- 
lated from NMR, before and after contacting the OH 
groups with base acting molecules such as water, 
benzene, pyridine, etc. Following the work of Freude, 
the ratio between the number of protons involved in 
a particular process (n), 
and the mean residence time 
of the proton at a lattice oxygen ion (z), can be used 
as a relative measure of the acidity of OH groups. In 
a more direct way and by taking into account 
published quantum chemical  calculation,- a 
relationship between the acid strength of the differ- 
ent Bronsted acid sites and its chemical shift has

Band c corresponds to bridging OH groups, and the 
c resonance is due to steric modification of SiOHAl 
groups in, for example small cavities of ze01ites.l 
To determine the number of protons of each type, a 
Gaussian decomposition of the spectrum is carried 
out (Figure 7B), and the adsorption intensity is 
compared with a standard with a known concentra- 
tion of p r  t o n s . l   J    
Thus, it is possible to measure 
the influence of zeolite treatments on the final 
concentration of all OH groups, including the acidic 
bridged hydroxyls. This procedure gives a good 
correlation between acidity and catalytic activity of 
solid acid catalysts (Figure 8).134

is a selective base probe molecule for Lewis acid 
sites.143 13C NMR can also measure acidities from 
interaction of acid sites with weak bases such as 
alcohols, acetone, and acetnitrile.lJ 
The adsorp- 
tion of other weak bases such as propylene and SH2 
have also been studied by lH and 13C MAS NMR, 
giving additional information on the type of species 
formed as a function of the type and quantity of 
surface active sites.143J46 
In the last decade, phosphorous-containing probe 
molecules such as trialkylphosphines and trialkyl- 
phosphine 
have been used to quantify 
the number of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites on solid 
acids by means of 31P 
MAS NMR and CP/MAS NMR. 
These molecules can be very adequate to quantify the 
Bronsted and Lewis acid sites on the external surface 
of zeolite catalysts, since owing to their size they 
cannot penetrate the pores. Thus, the results could 
be correlated with catalyst activity when large or- 
ganic molecules are involved. So far, this has not 
been achieved by using base probe molecules coupled 
with IR techniques. There is no doubt to us that 
MAS NMR technique will become as useful as IR 
techniques, if not more, to determine surface acidity 
on solid catalysts. 
E. Photoelectron Spectroscopy Methods 
Since XPS measures the kinetic energy of photo- 
electrons emitted from the core levels of surface 
atoms upon X-ray irradiation of the uppermost 
atomic layers, it can be of use to characterize surface 
acid sites, in combination with base probe mol- 
e c u l e  .     
For instance, the two N1, lines arising from nitro- 
gen atoms in chemisorbed pyridine, one arising from 
protonated pyridine and the other from pyridine 
coordinated to Lewis acid sites, could be used to 
characterize both, Bronsted and Lewis acidity. How- 
ever, it can be easily understood that this technique 
cannot be as powerful as IR and NMR spectroscopy. 
Indeed, owing to the charging and contamination 
problems it is very difficult to obtain accurate mea- 
surements. Moreover, 
it cannot be used to determine 
the total acidity of microporous solid acids. On the 
other hand, it can be used to monitor acidity at 
external surfaces, and on solids which are opaque to 
IR radiation.

of the

A new method for measuring Bronsted acidity of 
solid acids has been presented by Batamack et al.136 
using wide-line lH NMR spectroscopy. This tech- 
nique is based on the interaction between one mol- 
ecule of water per one Bronsted site. Thus, samples 
with low acid strength give only hydrogen-bonded 
H20, while formation of H30+ 
occurs when acidity is 
stronger. 
The NMR technique can also be used to character- 
ize the interaction of amines with acid sites, provided 
that the spectra of the protonated and unprotonated 
forms are significantly different. Good amine probes, 
from the NMR point of view, should have, at least, 
one carbon atom that responds differently to Bron- 
sted and Lewis acid sites. Moreover, the lines should 
not overlap. When these conditions are fulfilled, the 
number and acid strength of OH acidic groups can 
be directly determined by the 13C shifts of the 
adsorbed molecules. In Table 4 13C MAS NMR 
results for several amines after protonation by HC1 
and coordination with BF3 are listed. It appears that 
better results are obtained when using symmetrically 
substituted pyridines, which have three, instead of 
five, lines in the ring carbon region. In the case of 
the probe molecules, 13C MAS NMR allows accurate 
calculation of the sum of Lewis and Bronsted acid 
sites; however, the shift measurements are not 
precise enough to separate both types of acid sites. 
Better results for the discrimination between Bron- 
sted and Lewis acid sites are obtained from 15N and 
31P 
NMR of N and P surface-bound c  m p l e x e s . l   - l    
In this way, 15N 
CP/MAS NMR in the displacement 
titration of chemisorbed pyridine on silica alumina 
with n-butylamine has shown the potential of this 
technique.137 However, the results are difficult to 
reproduce, and the presence of water strongly modi- 
fies the rate of the probe molecule exchange. 15Nz0 
F. Surface Acidity from the Analysis of the 
Positron Annihilation Line Shapes 
Positron annihilation spectroscopy 
(PAS) 
has been 
scarcely applied to the study of catalytic materials.151 
The method involves three techniques, ie., positron 
annihilation lifetime (PAL), one- and two-dimen- 
sional angular correlation of the annihilation radia- 
tion (1D- and 2D-ACAR), and Doppler-broadened 
annihilation radiation (DBAR) 
measurements.152 
Very 
recently,153 
an alternative new method to measure 
the specific acidity of catalytic samples with large 
surface areas using PAS has been presented. The 
authors have presented results together with 2D- 
ACAR and DBAR measurements on the NH4+-ZSM-5 
zeolite and have shown their utility by the line-shape 
measurements (parameter S) of PAS to monitor the 
specific acidity of the zeolite (Figure 9).

coordination number of a negative element (oxygen) 
of a major component oxide is retained for all the 
oxygens in a binary oxide. Indeed, if a silicon atom 
is replaced by a tetrahedral Al 
atom, the A104 part 
is unsatisfied by a whole valence unit and this can 
be compensated by a  r o t o n . l   J    
Molecular orbital 
calculations were done on silica-alumina cluster 
mode1s,159-160 
and it was concluded that the H in the 
hydroxyl group becomes protonic by coordination of 
Al to an oxygen atom (0,) 
bridging the Si. The 
coordination of the A

 atom to the 0, atom corre- 
sponds to a Lewis acid base interaction, and the 
stronger the interaction, the stronger the Bronsted 
acid strength of the 0, associated H. More recent 
quantum chemical ca1culationsl6l 
have summarized 
that the Bronsted acid sites of binary silica-alumina 
oxides are bridged hydroxyl groups and water mol- 
ecules coordinated on a trigonal aluminum atom. 
From all the above, one can conclude that the most 
important goal to be achieved in order to maximize 
the number of acid sites, is to prepare silica-alumina 
samples with the maximum amount of tetrahedrally 
coordinated Al. In this way, one proton would be 
generated by each Al atom. To do this, the formation

bonding should be avoided during the 
synthesis. 
The two most common methods for preparing 
amorphous silica-alumina are as follows: starting 
from a silica hydrogel with an aluminum sulfate 
solution, the aluminum salt is hydrolyzed and pre- 
cipitated by the addition of aqueous ammonia. An- 
other type of preparation involves the interaction of 
sodium silicate and sodium aluminate. In both cases 
the global preparation process involves drying, ex- 
change with NH4+, and calcination. 
In the case of silica-aluminas as solid catalysts it 
is desirable to maximize not only the number of acid 
sites but also their accessibility to the reactant 
molecules by producing a material with the appropri- 
ate surface area and porosity. This can be done by 
controlling the concentration of reactants in the 
initial mixture, and the pH and aging time of the 
Recently, it was found that if bulky organoammo- 
nium cations, such as tetraalkylammonium cations, 
are used during the synthesis of amorphous silica- 
alumina all the aluminum in a 13 wt % A 1 2 0 3  
containing silica-alumina is in tetrahedral coordina- 
tion and produces acid hydroxyl groups. Moreover, 
the pore size distribution could be controlled by 
selecting the size of the alkylammonium cation. 
165166 
However, when the material was calcined, 27Al 
MAS 
NMR showed that some octahedral Al is already 
formed.166 This was more so when the silica- 
alumina was subjected to calcination and/or steaming 
at temperatures above 650 C. Then, a strong 
reduction in tetrahedrally coordinated Al, acid hy- 
droxyl groups, and surface area was observed.166 
An improvement in the preparation of high surface 
area amorphous silica-alumina has been achieved167 
by using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, in an 
alkali-free reaction mixture. The material was pre- 
pared from a precursor of a ZSM-5 zeolite, and it

G. Conclusions 
In conclusion, it appears that the indicators can 
be used only to get approximate idea on the acid 
strength distribution of a given solid acid. When 
indicators are used together with titrating organic 
molecules the number of acid sites with different 
strengths could be determined. However, if those 
results are compared with catalytic activity, good 
correlations are not necessarily obtained. This is 
because of the overtitration since one uses more basic 
reagent than the stoichiometric equivalent of the 
catalytically active acid sites. Furthermore, only a 
small fraction of the total acid sites measured are 
usually active for a given reaction, and the low 
temperature at which acidity is measured favors 
indiscriminate adsorption of the basic molecules on 
all acidic sites. This can be partially overcome by 
using adsorption-desorption methods. Thermally 
programmed desorption of basic probe molecules, 
including sterically hindered ones, can be adequate 
measures of surface acidity, if coupled with spectro- 
scopic techniques and if the products are analyzed 
in order to detect any decomposition. In general, it 
appears that a single technique is not sufficient for 
the solid acid characterization and interpretation, 
and for the prediction of catalytic activity and selec- 
tivity. However, IR and NMR, including the use of 
15N MAS NMR are particularly useful to determine 
simultaneously both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites. 
When those are combined with TPD, the relative 
strength of the acid sites can also be determined and 
consequently catalyst performance could be, then, 
related to acidity. 
Ill. Solid Acid Catalysts

The first solid acid catalysts commercially 
used on 
a large scale were acid-leached natural aluminosili- 
cates such as clays. They were the first cracking 
catalysts in the Houdrys p r 0  e s s . l    
However the 
negative impact of the impurities (Fe) on selectivity 
moved the researchers to prepare amorphous-like 
synthetic aluminosilicates such as amorphous silica-

The acidity of these materials can be 
explained taking into account Tanabes postulates:

process it appears that silicate layers condensed to 
form 3D structure with pores of 30 A. The acidity of 
the material was reported to be similar to that of an 
amorphous silica-alumina. At the same time, Beck 
et al.169J70 
synthesized nanotubes of amorphous 
silica-alumina named as M41S, and from which 
MCM-41 is perhaps the most popular, by using 
tetramethylammonium and cetyltrimethyl- or hexa- 
decyltrimethylammonium as organics. The regular- 
ity of the pore structure has been illustrated by 
lattice images which show a honeycomb like struc-

is that the pore size can be varied in a wide range

It has recently been presented that when synthe- 
sized, all Al in the MCM-41 structure are in tetra- 
hedral positions. However, as soon as the material 
is calcined, octahedral Al is observed. If calcination-

then the pores collapse and the 800-1000 m2

The 29Si

indicate that MCM-41 
strongly resembles an amorphous silica-alumina 
with very regular tubes. 
Amorphous silica-aluminas have been used as 
catalysts for a large number of hydrocarbon trans- 
formations. Among them, they have been particu- 
larly useful in isomerization of olefins, paraffins, and 
alkyl aromatics; alkylation of aromatics with alcohols 
and olefins; olefin oligomerization; and catalytic 
cracking. All these reactions will be described in 
more detail in the next section. Here the potential 
catalytic applications of the new amorphous silica- 
aluminas with regular pores ("nanotubes") will be 
presented. In this case, the amorphous silica- 
alumina with controlled pore size: i.e., those pre- 
pared from ZSM-5 precursors and called MSA,167 
and 
MCM-41174J75 
have been successfully used to oligo- 
merize propylene to produce gasoline and middle 
distillate. When the results are compared with those 
obtained on regular amorphous silica-alumina and 
an 
H-ZSM-5 zeolite (Figure 
it can be seen that 
the largest conversions at the lowest temperatures 
are obtained on MSA and MCM-41 samples. In a 
similar way, MSA and MCM-41 samples show a very 
good activity and selectivity for benzene alkylation 
with propene (Table 
5).167

materials are in the field of catalytic  r a c k i n g , l   J

critical taking into account the limited thermal- 
hydrothermal stability of the catalysts.

Amorphous aluminum phosphates have been much 
less used than amorphous silica-alumina in acid- 
catalyzed hydrocarbon reactions. This is due to the 
lower acid strength of the formers which limits its 
real possibilities to easier reactions. It has been 
found by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 and 
pyridine that the acidity of stoichiometric 
amorphous 
aluminum phosphates (AVP

corresponds 
to both 
Bronsted and Lewis acid type.178 Hydroxyl groups

Acidic amorphous aluminum phosphates are usu- 
ally prepared from an aqueous mixture of aluminum 
salts and phosphoric acid by precipitation with aque- 
ous ammonia followed by calcination at 500 "C. The 
number of acid sites in the final material is controlled 
by the chemical composition (AVP 
ratio), and pre- 
cipitating agent (ammonia, ethylene oxide, and pro- 
pylene oxide). The maximum number of acid sites 
as well as those with stronger acidity are obtained 
in samples prepared with aqueous ammonia,179

makes them active for olefin isomerization and

manding reactions such as paraffin isomerization and 
cracking can hardly be catalyzed by these materials 
at low temperatures. 
If both silica- alumina and aluminum phosphate 
amorphous materials were of importance in the 1950s 
and 1960s, they found their natural evolution when 
crystalline aluminosilicates (zeolites), aluminophos-

phates (ALPOS), and silica-alumina phosphates 
(SAPOS) 
were synthesized. These are most versatile 
materials which add to the acid characteristics of 
their predecessors amorphous materials, the benefits 
of larger surface area and controlled pore size within 
the dimensions of molecular reactants and products. 
On top of that, they have by far a larger thermal and 
hydrothermal stability. Today, zeolite type materials 
have become the largest used and a more versatile 
type of acid catalysts, and their acid characteristics 
and catalytic activity for selected hydrocarbon reac- 
tions will be described in the following section.

6. Zeolites and Zeotypes as Solid Acid Catalysts 
1. Zeolites as Microreactors 
General Considerations. Zeolites are tridimen- 
sional crystalline aluminosilicates with the following 
formula in the as-synthesized form: xMunO. 
xA120&3i02*WH0 
where M is a cation which can 
belong to the group IA or IIA 
or can be an organic 
cation, while n is the cation valence, and W repre- 
sents water contained in the zeolite voids. Crystal- 
line structures of the zeolite type but containing 
tetrahedrally coordinated Si, Al, P, as well as transi- 
tion metals and many group elements with the 
valence ranging from I to V such as, B, Ga, Fe, Cr, 
Ti, 
V, Mn, Co, Zn, Cu, etc., have also been synthesized 
with the generic name of zeotypes, including AlPO4, 
SAPO, MeAPO, and MeAPSO type molecular 
sieves. 
lS1-la7 
The main characteristic of the zeolites and zeotypes 
is that the tetrahedral primary building blocks are 
linked through oxygens producing a three-dimen- 
sional network containing channels and cavities of 
molecular dimensions. 
Considering the channel size they are convention- 
ally defined as ultralarge (> 
12-1, 
large (12-), 
medium 
(lo-), or small (8-membered ring) pore materials 
depending on the smallest number of 0 or T atoms 
that limits the pore aperture of their largest channel, 
and whose diameter varies between 5 
and 20 A. A 
summary of zeolites and zeotypes with different pore 
size is given in Table 6. 
The system of channels of these molecular sieves 
produces solids with very high surface area and pore 
volume, which are capable of adsorbing 
great amounts 
of hydrocarbons. This fact combined with the pos- 
sibility to generate active sites inside of the channels 
and cavities of zeolites and zeotypes produces a very 
unique type of catalyst, which by itself can be 
considered as a catalytic microreactor. 
In a catalytic reaction the reactant follows a 
sequence of events before it becomes a desorbed 
product. In the case of a zeolite, the sequence is 
diffusion of reactant through the zeolite micropores 
to reach an active site, adsorption of reactant on the 
active site, chemical reaction to give the adsorbed 
product, desorption of the product, and, finally, 
diffusion of the product through the zeolite channels. 
DifFcsion Effects. In the case of hydrocarbon 
reactions on zeolites and zeotypes, where the size of 
a molecule closely matches the pore size, it is reason- 
able to think that the first step in the catalytic 
process, i.e. the diffusion of the reactant, can play

an important role in the overall rate of the reaction 
observed. Indeed, in such a case it is impossible to 
think in terms of molecular and Knudsen-type dif- 
fusion, so Weiszlss introduced the term configura- 
tional diffusion 
to denote intracrystalline migration. 
The configurational diffusion is strongly dependent 
on the site and nature of the reactant, the type of 
molecular sieve, and temperature. In practice, in- 
tracrystalline diffusivities (D,) 
in the range of 
to 
m2 s-l have been reported (Figure ll).la9 
However, concerning the pore diameter of zeolites 
and zeotypes one should bear in mind that due to 
lattice vibration the effective pore size is somewhat

3 571 
From a practical point of view, what should be done 
when the diffusion of reactant is slower than the 
chemical reaction is to decrease the diffusion main 
path by decreasing the crystallite size of the zeolite. 
This should increase the reaction rate. On the other 
hand, in those cases where the rate of the reaction 
is not dependent on the crystallite size, one can be 
sure that the process is not controlled by intrazeolitic 
diffusion, so all active sites are in use. 
Since diffusion of molecules within zeolites is 
thought to proceed by thermally activated jumps from 
one site to an adjacent site,lg5Jg6 
it is clear that the 
geometry of the zeolite pores will also play an 
important role. For instance, in the case of zeolites 
with unidirectional channels, diffusivities can be 
sharply reduced by small amounts of debris in the 
pores generated during zeolite synthesis or activation 
and also by small amounts of strongly adsorbed 
molecules. These problems are smaller in zeolites in 
which a bidirectional or tridirectional pore system 
exists. For instance, while counterdiffusion of ben- 
zene and cumene, which are reactant and product 
in propylene-benzene alkylation, exists in the rela- 
tively open tridirectional structure of Y zeolite,lg7 
it 
does not occur within the more restricted unidirec- 
tional channels of mordenite.lg8 In a similar way, the 
strong interaction of phenol with the zeolite surface 
strongly affects the counter diffusion rates even in 
the case of open tridirectional zeolites such as fau- 
jasite, where the ratio Dt&&Dphenol= 
1O4.Ig7 Finally, 
tortuosity of the channels also has an important effect 
on the diffusion of molecules close in size to the 
diameter of the pores; in this sense it has been 
foundlg9 
that diffusion is five times faster in the 
straight channels rather than in the sinusoidal 
channels of ZSM-5. 
This in turn bring us to the 
concept of "molecular traffic 
which as- 
sumes that in zeolites with channels of different pore 
diameter reactants and products of different size can 
preferentially diffuse through one or the other chan- 
nel. 
After the discussion on diffusion in zeolites one 
might have the idea that the relatively slow diffusion 
rates in zeolites are always a handicap. This is not 
however the case, and one should take into account 
that differences in diffusivities can be used to in- 
crease selectivity to a given product by adequate 
selection of the pore size of the zeolite catalyst. This 
comes into the field of shape-selective catalysiszo1 
which will be discussed later when studying the role 
of zeolite geometry on catalytic performance. 
Adsorption Erects. When a reactant molecule 
has diffused inside the zeolite channel, it becomes 
subjected to a series of interactions which involve the 
following energy terms:202 
dispersion energy ( 4  ) ,  
close-range 
repulsion energy (h), 
polarization energy 
(h), 
field-dipole energy (&N), field gradient-quad- 
rupole energy (  F Q ) ,  
dipole-dipole energy (C#INN), 
dipole-quadrupole energy (  N Q ) ,  
and quadrupole- 
quadrupole energy (  Q Q ) .  Thus, it can be easily 
understood that by changing the chemical composi- 
tion and structure of the zeolite the relative contribu- 
tion of these interaction energy terms will be changed 
and, consequently, the adsorption characteristics of 
a given molecule. This flexibility in changing the

larger than the crystallographic one. For instance, 
the difference can be 0.6 A for zeolite Y heated at 
several hundred degrees Celsius. In any case zeolites 
can act as real molecular sieves for reactants and a 
remarkable molecular discrimination can be attained, 
as shown in Figure 
From a practical point of 
view, it has been etimated'' 
that an effective 
conversion rate of 10-6-10-5 g mol of reactant(s) 
per 
cubic centimeter of reactor volume is needed for 
useful fuel or commodity chemical processes. These 
requirements set a lower limit to useful flow rates 
into and out of the zeolite crystals, and the rate of 
diffusion should be larger than the intrinsic chemical 
conversion rate if the inner surface area of a porous 
catalyst wants to be utilized to the full extent. 
In those cases, where the size of the molecule and 
pore dimensions allow the diffusion of the reactant, 
the temperature has an important effect on the rate 
since molecular diffusion is an activated process. 
Then, it is not uncommon to find that in processes 
in which intrazeolitic pore diffusion is the rate- 
limiting step, the experimental activation energy 
exceeds values of 15 kcal mol-'. This is because, as 
it was said above for the transport of molecules 
through zeolite cages and micropores, the traditional 
notion of diffusivity no longer applies. Thus, the 
activation energy of diffusion 
increases as the critical 
dimensions of the diffusing molecules approach the 
dimensions of the pores192-194 
(Figure 11). This in 
turn means that the energy of activation criteria 
cannot be used in the case of zeolites and zeotypes 
to find if diffusion through the pores is the reaction- 
controlling step.

kinetic study of the isomerization of m-xylene on a 
series of HY 
zeolites with different SUA1 ratios.206 
In 
that work, it was found that when the framework Si/ 
Al ratio was increased by postsynthesis dealumina- 
tion not only the total number of active sites has 
changed, but also the adsorption capacity of the 
zeolite measured from the values of the adsorption 
constants (M. 
In other words, it was established that 
the concentration of reactant molecules inside the 
pores was varied by modifying the chemical composi- 
tion of the zeolite. This, besides catalyst activity 
effects, has strong implications when uni- (xylene 
isomerization), and bimolecular (alkylaromatic dis- 
proportionation) reactions are competing. It was 
found206 
that the reduction of the adsorption capacity 
affected more strongly the rate of the bimolecular 
than unimolecular reaction, increasing therefore the 
selectivity to isomerization. 
Another example, in which the adsorption term in 
the kinetic equation can play an important role, is 
the alkylation of phenol by ethylene over acidic 
faujasite  catalyst. At reaction temperatures 
below 473 K phenol is strongly adsorbed on the acid 
sites avoiding the adsorption of ethylene to form the 
necessary C2Hs+ 
alkylating agents. This makes the 
adsorption constant for the reactant ethylene practi- 
cally zero and from the above kinetic equation, the 
rate of phenol alkylation should be zero. However, 
alkylation occurs when more polar alkylating agents, 
such as ethyl chloride or ethanol, are used, which can 
now compete quite favorably with phenol for adsorp- 
tion sites.207209-210 
At temperatures higher than 473 
K, and by taking into account the larger (negative) 
adsorption heat of phenol with respect to ethylene, 
some adsorption of ethylene already exists and the 
alkylation occurs. 
Changes in hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity can also 
influence the reactivity in systems where there are 
differences in polarity between reactants, or reac- 
tants and products. For instance, in esterification 
reactions, where water is formed as a product and 
the reaction is equilibrium limited unless H20 is 
continuously removed, conversions larger than those 
corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium 
were found when more hydrophobic zeolites were 
used as catalysts.211 
This was interpreted by assum- 
ing that in more hydrophobic catalysts, the concen- 
tration of water in the pores, and therefore inside of 
the microcatalytic reactors, is lower and allows the 
reaction to proceed further than expected from the 
thermodynamic data. In other words, the hydropho- 
bicity of the surface assists in the removal of HzO 
from the true reaction media. 
Finally, we give an example where modifications 
of the total and selective adsorption strongly affect 
the reaction selectivity. In the catalytic cracking of 
hydrocarbons on zeolites, together with the unimo- 
lecular cracking reaction, bimolecular hydride trans- 
fer reaction also occurs. When increasing the frame- 
work SUA1 ratio of USY zeolite the total adsorption 
decreases, while the ratio of alkane/olefin adsorbed 
 increase., Both features produce an increase in 
the ratio of cracking to hydride transfer when in- 
creasing the SUA1, with the corresponding increase 
in the olefinicity of products, and therefore in the 
adsorption capacity

adsorption characteristics of zeolites will also allow 
discrimination between competing reactants and 
products by modifying their relative adsorption in- 
teraction. Indeed, in the case of zeolites there are 
structures with low framework SUAl ratios, and 
therefore with a large number of compensating 
cations which will produce very high electrostatic 
fields (@FN) and field gradients (@FQ) in the channels 
and cavities. On the other hand, samples can be 
synthesized with high framework SUM ratios in 
which mainly dispersion forces (&J are present, while 
very little or no influence from electrostatic fields and 
polarization forces will exist. In other words one 
could prepare zeolites with a very strong hydrophilic 
character which would preferentially sorb polar 
molecules or, on the opposite, with strong hydropho- 
bic properties. In this way, one can change not only 
the total sorption capacity but also the relative 
adsorption, within the pores of the zeolite, of mol- 
ecules with different polarity. This can be achieved 
by simply changing the framework SUAl ratio by 
either synthesis or postsynthesis treatments. By 
following 
this, it has been found that highly siliceous 
ZSM-5 zeolites, which are highly hydrophobic, are 
able to selectively adsorb organic compounds such as 
n-butyl 
or phenol and cresols204 
from their 
water solutions. Changes in the total adsorption 
capacity, as well as in the relative adsorption of water 
and hydrocarbons, for various framework SUM ratio 
of a large-pore zeolite Beta are given in Table 7.205 
Modifications of adsorption properties of the cata- 
lyst can have a strong impact on the reactivity of 
zeolites and zeotypes. For instance, if one takes a 
general reaction such as 
R + S - P  
that follows a Langmuir-Hinselwood bimolecular 
type mechanism and the product competes for ad- 
sorption sites, the following kinetic rate expression 
for the process can be written: 
From this kinetic expression it can be deduced that 
the rate of the reaction can be varied by changing 
the intrinsic kinetic rate constant (KO) 
which could 
be done by altering the nature of the active sites, by 
modifying the total number of active sites (S,), and 
by changing the total adsorption capacity, or the 
adsorption capacity for a given reactant and product. 
This was illustrated by carrying out a complete 
Inorganic Solid Acids 
research octane number (RON) of the gasoline. 
From what has been said, it is clear that the 
crystalline structure and microporosity 
of zeolites and 
zeotypes introduce clear differences in reactants and 
product diffusion and adsorption behavior between 
these materials and their amorphous equivalents 
such as silica-alumina and aluminum phosphates. 
These facts, together with the stabilization and 
acidity gained because of the crystalline structure, 
make zeolites and zeotypes unique solid acid cata- 
lysts.

Nature of Acid Sites 
Zeolite structure containing only Si02 tetrahedra 
would be electrically neutral and no acidity would 
be developed on its surface. Bronsted acid sites are 
developed when Si4+ 
is isomorphically substituted by 
a trivalent metal cation, for instance A13+, 
and a 
negative charge is created in the lattice, which is 
compensated by a proton. The proton is attached to 
the oxygen atom connected to neighbor silicon and 
aluminum atoms, resulting in the so-called bridged 
hydroxyl group which is the site responsible for the 
Bronsted acidity of zeolites. 
A first description of the chemical structure of 
bridged hydroxyls in zeolites was proposed by Uyt- 
terhoeven et al.,214 who envisaged it as a Si-OH 
group strongly influenced by a tricoordinated neigh- 
boring A13+: 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 573 
The lengths of the bonds generated in a coordina- 
tion site increase when the coordination number 
increases. 
Following this, it becomes possible to explain some 
of the properties of the zeolite Bronsted sites. On 
one hand, the coordination 
of the bridging oxygen will 
increase the length of the OH bond in the bridging 
hydroxyl with respect to the terminal silanol, some- 
thing which is related with a stronger acidity of the 
bridged hydroxyL219 
On the other hand, an 
increase 
of the electronegativity in the neighborhood of the 
OH will induce a transfer of electronic density from 
the less electronegative atom (H) to the most elec- 
tronegative one (0). 
Then, and in agreement with 
Gutmanns second rule, an increase in the length of 
the OH bond should occur with the corresponding 
increase in acidity. We will return to these criteria 
to explain the influence of zeolite composition on acid 
strength. 
On these bases and taking into account Gutmanns 
first rule, Rabo et al.222p223 
have proposed an inter- 
pretation to explain the acid strength differences 
between crystalline and amorphous silica- alumina. 
The interpretation is based on the idea that the 
protonated Al-OH-Si group prefers to form covalent 
0-H bonds by forming relatively low Al-0-Si bond 
angles. It was suggested that the decrease of the 
angles in the Al-OH-Si units, without affecting the 
nonprotonated Si-0-Si linkages, is prevented (or at 
least minimized) by the zeolite crystal in order to 
maintain long-range order. Thus, if long-range order 
in the crystal prevails over the short-range bonding 
preference of the Al-OH-Si group, then the original, 
large bond angles, will be retained. It would appear 
then that model I showed above could be more 
representative of the situation in an amorphous 
silica-alumina in where no stabilization by long- 
range symmetry exists, while model I1 would be more 
representative of the situation of the acid site in a 
crystalline zeolite structure. 
While the above hypothesis explains a large num- 
ber of experimental observations, there are still some 
questions to be answered. Indeed, there are no 
physical principles which can ascertain that more 
symmetric structures should be more stable. Then, 
it is not possible, on formal bases, to explain the 
rearrangement of the bridged hydroxyls by effects 
due to crystal symmetry. Moreover, it appears that 
large-pore zeolites and zeotypes have very flexible 
structures which can be deformed with little en- 
Recent lH MAS NMR experimental results226 
have 
added more complexity to the modeling of acid sites 
in amorphous and crystalline aluminosilicates. In- 
deed, it has been observed that upon the removal of 
the hydration water the Si-0 bond is broken in the 
amorphous material and a strongly covalent OH bond 
is formed. However, this is not observed in zeolite 
HY 
which maintains its original Al-OH-Si linkages. 
The presence of the Al-OH-Si 
linkages in zeolites 
is also confirmed by neutron diffraction 
which have allowed the proposal of an averaged 
geometry for the protonic site which is in reasonable 
agreement with the geometry proposed on the bases 
of NMR228 
and theoretical229 
results (Table 8).

This is one extension of the model proposed to 
explain the formation of strong Bronsted acid sites 
on the surface of amorphous  aluminosilicate 
and was supported by the two following facts: the 
number of bridged hydroxyls is the same as the 
number of A13+, 
and the decrease in the frequency of 
vibration of the bridged OH with respect to a termi- 
nal silanol can be explained by the interaction with 
a neighbor A13+. 
The first model of acid sites in zeolites was im- 
proved by considering that the oxygen supporting the 
acidic hydrogen was chemically bonded to both A13+ 
and Si4+ 
making a real bridge between them:217-219

The increase in acidity of the bridged hydroxyl with 
respect to the silanol group was explained220 
on the 
bases of the following rules established by Gut- 
mann221 
to explain the interaction between atoms 
giving and accepting electron pairs: 
The length of the nearest bonds to the site in where 
the donor-acceptor interaction occurs increases when 
increasing the strength of this interaction. 
The bond length increases when its ionicity in- 
creases.

At this point of knowledge, it appears that there 
are strong pieces of evidence in favor of the covalent 
character of the bridged 
The proton 
splitting energy is directly related to the acid-base 
properties of the hydroxyl groups. Thus, the acid- 
base properties should be correlated both with elec- 
tronegativity of solids and with corresponding proton 
abstraction energies. The deprotonation energy is 
sensitive to lattice relaxation and depends on local 
geometric constraints due to the long-range ordered 
structure of the zeolites as well as the zeolite com- 
position.231 
This, not only could explain the stronger 
acidity of crystalline aluminosilicates with respect to 
their amorphous counterpart, but also indicates that 
the proper way to distinguish hydroxyl groups of 
different acid strengths is to use the energy of their 
heterolytic dissociation. This can be indirectly esti- 
mated from the response of surface hydroxyls to their 
interaction with adsorbed bases. 
3. lnfluence of Chemical Composition on Number and 
Strength of Acid Sites 
In as-synthesized zeolites the negative charge 
present on the Al-substituted framework is compen- 
sated by organic and inorganic alkaline cations, and 
such zeolites show no Bronsted acidity. This is 
generated upon decomposition of organic cations by 
thermal treatment and by ion exchange of the 
synthesis cations by protons, or by NH4+ and di- or 
trivalent cations, either by liquid or solid state 
exchange followed by c a l c i n a t i  n .    -     
Theoretically 
one proton should be introduced for each framework 
A13+, 
and therefore the larger the number of frame- 
work aluminum atoms, the higher the potential 
number of acid sites would be in a given zeolite. 
Thus, it is clear that the total number of Bronsted 
acid sites present in a zeolite catalyst will depend 
on the framework Si/Al ratio, or more generally 
speaking, on the ratio of framework M4+/M3+ 
cations. 
In the case of SAPO-type materials they can be 
considered to be derived from the corresponding 
ALP0 by introducing Si in the framework. The Alp0 
material is electrically neutral and therefore no 
charge-compensating Bronsted acid sites exist. The 
replacement of P5+ 
by Si4+ 
produces a negative charge 
in the framework which can be compensated by a 
proton in an Al-OH-Si 
center similar to that of 
zeolites. Therefore, in the case of SAPO the number 
of acid sites will be related to the presence of Si atoms 
but in this case, and owing to the different substitu- 
tion mechanisms,239 
it is not possible to establish a 
direct correlation between the number of Si and the 
number of H+, 
as could be done in the case of zeolites 
for the number of framework A13+. 
It has been shown that the stretching frequency 
of the bridged hydroxyl groups in high aluminum 
containing zeolites decreases when decreasing the Al 
content of a given zeolite up to reaching a given 
vOH/cm-'

framework Si/Al ratio (Figure 13).240 
This, together 
with the shift 
to lower field of the corresponding 
lines 
in the 'H MAS NMR spectra, suggests that Bronsted 
acid sites in HY 
zeolites increase in strength when 
decreasing the Al content.241 
A decreasing 
heterolytic 
proton bond dissociation energy with increasing Si/ 
Al ratio is also found from ab initio calculations on 
clusters with varying Si/Al content.242 
Thus, it is 
possible to conclude that the acid strength of a given 
site will increase when there is a decrease in the 
number of aluminum atoms in next nearest neighbor 
positions (NNN) of the aluminum atom which sup- 
ports the acid site.243 
A completely isolated alumi- 
num tetrahedron will have zero NNN (ON") 
and 
will support the strongest type of framework Bron- 
sted site. Figure 14 shows the distribution of poten- 
tial acid sites with different Al-NNN values in a 
Faujasite structure, that is, acid sites with different 
 strength.- The distribution shows that acid 
sites of different strengths can be found on the 
surface of HY zeolites, and it is possible to prepare a 
zeolite with the acid strength required for a given 
reaction, just by changing the framework SYAl ratio. 
For instance, if a given reaction requires the partici- 
pation of strong acid sites, a zeolite catalyst with less 
than five Al 
per unit cell should be used. On the 
other hand, for reactions demanding low acidity, 
better results from the point of view of activity and 
selectivity could be attained using zeolites with Si/ 
Al ratios lower than six. It is clear that for frame- 
work SVAl ratios '10 all tetrahedral Al should be 
isolated O

"
,
 
and all acid sites should be equiva- 
lent, at least from the point of view of the chemical 
composition. 
The influence of framework chemical composition 
on acid strength has been rationalized by noting that 
any change of the zeolite composition would modify 
the electronegativity of the framework, and the 
higher it is, the stronger is the acid strength. Thus, 
it has been f o  n d    ,     
that the mean Sanderson's 
electronegativy 
(s) correlates with different properties 
related to the acid strength of zeolites, such as the 
hydroxyl vibration frequencies in various protonated 
zeolites, the frequency shift of the high-frequency

benzene, and the turnover frequency for isopropyl 
alcohol dehydration on H-zeolites. 
However, the use of the Sandersons average elec- 
tronegativity as the only parameter is not the most 
adequate since, as was said above, the acid strength 
of a given zeolite depends not only on the electrone- 
gativity, but also on the proton abstraction energy; 
and the deprotonation energy depends not only on 
the zeolite composition but also on the zeolite struc- 
ture. Owing to this, the concept of effective 
elec- 
tronegativity, which includes both structural and 
compositional variables, has been i n t r o d  c e d .    -   l  
In this way, the highest values of effective electrone- 
gativity were calculated for zeolites with the most 
open frameworks (lower framework densities). 
The correlation between framework electronega- 
tivity and acid strength also applies to 
zeotypes183,252,253 
as it has been observed for zeotypes containing Ga3+, 
Ge4+, 
and B3+. 
Up to now, it has been evident that it should be 
possible to control the total number and strength of 
the acid sites in a zeolite by modifying the chemical 
composition of the framework. This offers the pos- 
sibility to prepare tailor-made catalysts by changing 
the electronegativity of the zeolite framework follow- 
ing the acidity required to carry out a given reaction, 
always of course within the limits of the acidity range 
achieved in zeolites, and which correspond to HO 
2 
- 
10. 
On the other hand, it is common that during zeolite 
activation, dealumination occurs to some extent and 
extraframework Al species can be generated. Indeed, 
it is known that the calcination of the NH4+ form of 
zeolites which is done in order to obtain the acid form, 
can produce some dealumination unless the decom- 
position of NH4+ is carried out in vacuum or, at least, 
in a shallow bed. This extraframework aluminum 
(EFAL) 
gives rise to the presence of Lewis acid sites 
as determined by pyridine adsorption.254 On top of 
that, it has been 
that the presence of 
EFAL can enhance the acidity of framework Bronsted 
sites due to a polarization effect. This EFAL- 
Bronsted site interaction can also increase the cata- 
lytic activity of medium and large-pore zeolites 
beyond what can be expected from the composition 
of the framework SYAl ratio.255,258-265 
Thus, it ap- 
pears that not only the framework chemical composi- 
tion, but the overall chemical composition which 
includes both framework and extraframework spe- 
cies, will affect acidity and therefore catalytic activity 
for carboniogenic 
reactions. According to this, there 
is no doubt that during dealumination of zeolites by 
post-synthesis treatment, the actual experimental 
procedure can have an important impact on the 
amount and type of EFAL formed. In this way, when 
dealumination is carried out on faujasites by steam 
treatment, the extracted framework Al remains as 
EFAL. Mild steaming (T 
< 600 C) produces less 
polymerized cationic 
EFAL which may be responsible 
for the enhancement of the Bronsted acidity of some 
bridged hydroxyl groups. Harder steaming (2 > 600 
C) 
forms pentacoordinated,266 
tetrahedrally coordi- 
nated,267 
and, in general, condensed alumina EFAL 
type species. 
Steaming followed by acid treatment can extract 
a part of EFAL and to restore some of the high 
frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) hydroxyl 
groups by removing cationic EFAL species which 
were in ion exchange positions.268 
Dealuminated samples free of EFAL can be pro- 
duced by using Al complexing agents such as ED- 
TA269 
and (NH4)2F6Si.270p271 
In the first case, the Al 
vacancies are partially left behind, while with the 
second reagent, the Al vacancies are healed by Si 
incorporation. 
Finally, Sic14 has also been used to dealuminate 
zeolites.272 This reagent removes some of the ex- 
tracted Al as AlC13, but some part still remains in 
the zeolite. 
By using one of the above dealumination proce- 
dures, or a combination of them, it should be possible 
to prepare zeolites, which can only be synthesized in 
a short range of SYAl compositions, 
with an expanded 
576 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No.

range of Si/Al ratios. Furthermore, one can control 
the presence or not of Lewis acid sites, as well as 
their nature and amount. 
4. Influence of Structural Effects 
It was said above that besides electronegativity, 
zeolite geometry also plays a role in determining the 
acidity of zeolites. In this way, it is claimed that the 
distances and bond angles in the Al-OH-Si 
group 
can affect the acidity of the hydroxyl 
and 
strongly acidic zeolites have a range of T-O-T 
angles (ZSM-5, 137-177; mordenite, 143-180) 
larger than other less acidic (HY, 138-147). 
The effect of the bond angle and bond distances in 
Al-OH-Si on the acidity of the hydroxyl group has 
been studied by means of molecular orbital calcu- 
l a t i o n  .    -     
Carson et al.278 
have calculated the 
energy required to deform the protonated and depro- 
tonated Si-0-AI bridge, and found that the depro- 
tonation energy decreases with the increase of the 
T-O-T 
bond angle, and consequently, the corre- 
sponding acidity increases. Other authors279 
arrive 
at similar conclusions since they found that in a 
cluster of the type (HO)3 
Si(0H) 
N(OH)3, the most 
stable T-O-T 
angles for the protonated and depro- 
tonated forms are 134.2 and 179.3, respectively. 
Experimental results seem to confirm this, and it can 
be illustrated with SAPO-37, 
which is isostructural 
with faujasite, and can be synthesized using tetra- 
propyl and tetramethylammonium as templates. In 
this structure the tetrapropylammonium cation is 
located in the supercavity, while tetramethylammo- 
nium cation is in the sodalite units.280 When both 
templates are removed by calcination, acid sites are 
formed which correspond to hydroxyls pointing to the 
supercavity (3639 cm-l) and to sodalite units (3573 
cm-l) and which are mildly acidic. However, if 
SAPO-37 is calcined at 400 C in vacuum then the 
tetrapropylammonium (TPA) is removed while tet- 
ramethylammonium (TMA) is still present in the 
sodalite cages. In this case it has been 
that 
the high-frequency band at 3639 cm-l was shifted 
at 3630 cm-l indicating an increase in the acidity of 
the corresponding hydroxy group, as was confirmed 
by pyridine adsorption-desorption. This was ex- 
plained by assuming that the presence of TMA in the 
sodalite cage can produce a deformation of the 
structure, opening 
the T-O-T 
angles and increasing 
the acidity of the associated protons.225 
The zeolite structure may also cause preferential 
location of acid sites, i.e. preferential location on some 
particular oxygens. It was found by XRD that in 
faujasite the preferred oxygens for forming the 
bridged hydroxyls are 0
1
 and 0 3 ,  and then 0 2 ,  versus 
O4 which are those with the lower T-O-T 
angles.281,282 
This has been confirmed by theoretical 
 calculation. 
Neutron diffraction (ND) studies were also used to 
explain the distribution of protons dependent on the 
large range of effects, i.e. electrostatic forces between 
protons, framework oxygens, and  a t i o n s .    ,     
ND 
has also confirmed that 0 2  are preferred than 0 4  
positions for proton localization. This observation 
has been explained by assuming that although the 
bond angles for TO2T and T04T 
are nearly the same, 
Cot 
the proton localized on 0 2  points to the 6-member 
ring window which communicates the supercavity 
with the sodalite unit, and is stabilized by four closely 
located oxygens. On the other hand, protons bonded 
to 0 4  
point to the supercage and are not stabilized 
by neighbor oxygens. 
In conclusion, nowadays it is clear that zeolite 
geometry has an influence on acidity due to long- 
range effects as well as on the local structure of the 
acid sites. While long-range 
interactions have a clear 
effect on the strength of the OH bond and on its 
electronic properties, as has been demonstrated by 
IR and NMR, respectively, their effects on proton 
distribution have to be systematically investigated. 
Besides its influence on acidity, the zeolite geom- 
etry plays an important role in the catalytic behavior 
of zeolites through the so-called shape selectivity 
effects. Zeolite shape selectivity has been thor- 
oughly discussed in the literature188201,284-295 
and 
here will only be outlined. 
The first type of shape selectivity is related to mass 
transport discrimination, and involves reactants and 
products selectivity. It occurs when the zeolite or 
zeotype acts as a true molecular sieve for potential 
reactants and products which, due to their different 
sizes, present significant differences in diffusivities 
through a given pore channel system. This type of 
selectivity is especially important for medium-pore 
zeolites and allows discrimination between linear and 
branched paraffins and olefins, as well as between 
different alkyl aromatic isomers. 
When reactants can diffuse inside the zeolite pores 
and the reaction occurs within the crystalline struc- 
ture, the size and shape of channels and cavities can 
also be used, in some cases, to select the desired 
reaction path by making use of the so-called transi- 
tion state shape selectivity. This occurs when the 
spacial configuration around a transition state lo- 
cated in the crystalline volume, is such that only 
certain configurations are possible. 
There are other geometry-related effects on the 
product selectivity: molecular traffic control 
200,295 
in multidimensional pore zeolites and channel tor- 
t  o s i t y  .     
The former originates from the preferred 
diffusion in the crystalline volume of zeolites of 
molecules with different shape or size within one of 
two independent systems of pores. In the latter, the 
reactants will be subjected to more secondary reac- 
tions. 
The more zeolite effects are discussed, the more 
and more similarities can be found between zeolites 
and enzymes. Although the zeolites are not as 
specific a catalysts as enzymes, they present some 
common features derived from their hydrophobicity- 
hydrophilicity, the response of their structure to the 
interactions of the reactant and the active site, and 
the shape selectivity effects. However, it is even 
more than that, and in the next chapter we will show 
that electronic confinement effects characteristic for 
molecular sieves, which are generally absent for 
amorphous mesopore catalysts, may introduce new 
effects which have an important impact on chemical 
reactivity. 
Inorganic Solid Acids 
5. Confinement Effecfs 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 577 
Theoretical calculations made with the molecule of 
ethylene confined into a microscopic cavity 
that there is an increase in the energy of the HOMO 
orbital, and therefore, the electron shift to form a 
covalent bond will be more favored. Furthermore, it 
is deduced that the basicity of a confined guest 
molecule should increase with respect to that in the 
gas phase, and this may assist in explaining the 
stronger than expected acidity of zeolites. It should 
be noticed that the electronic confinement exists 
independently of the presence of electric field gradi- 
ents, and as these, will contribute to the preactivation 
of molecules inside the pores of zeolites. 
When a reactant molecule diffuses through the 
micropores of a zeolite and starts to interact with its 
walls and acid sites, the sorption energy of the 
molecule will include, as was said above, the follow- 
ing energy terms: 
E 
= 
E
,
 + 
E, + 
E
,
 + 
E
,
 + 
E, +

where ED 
and ER 
are the attractive and repulsive 
contributions from the van der Waals interaction, 
respectively; Ep, 
EN, 
and EQ 
are the polar, field- 
dipole, and field gradient-quadrupole terms, respec- 
tively; E
1
 is the sorbate-sorbate intermolecular 
interaction energy; and finally, EAB 
is the energy of 
the intrinsic reactant-acid site (acid-base) chemical 
interaction. If one assumes that under reaction 
conditions the sorbate-sorbate intermolecular inter- 
action energy (Ed 
is smaller than the other energy 
contributions, the interactions in the confined space 
of the pores are characterized by ED, 
ER, 
Ep, 
EN, 
and 
EQ 
terms. The first two energy terms will be mostly 
determined by the geometry of the environment of 
the acid sites, while the other three will be more 
sensitive to the chemical composition of the environ- 
ment. D e r  u a n e     
has proposed that owing to the 
confinement effect sorbate molecules in zeolites and 
zeotypes tend to optimize their van der Waals inter- 
action with the surroundings and that the surface 
curvature of the pore walls interacting with the 
reactant amplifies the importance of van der Waals 
interactions. This effect makes zeolites even more 
similar to enzymes, since the confinement effect may 
lead to site recognition or molecular preorganization 
of specific sites of sorbates, reactants, and reaction 
intermediates or p r o d  c t s .    -     
Furthermore, be- 
cause of the close size of reactants and zeolite pores, 
it can be considered that the molecules are solvated 
by the framework and therefore the electric fields 
generated by the zeolite must strongly affect the 
properties of the solute 
molecule. 
Besides the confinement effect proposed by Der- 
ouane, when the size of a guest molecule approaches 
the size of the pores and cavities of the host, one must 
also consider an electronic confinement, which can 
strongly influence the energy levels of the reactant- 
guest molecule, making it more reactive. The elec- 
tronic confinement299 
or boxing effect implies that 
owing to the partial covalent character of the alumi- 
nosilicate crystals,300 
electrons are not localized on 
the framework atoms, but they are partially delocal- 
ized through the bulk. Taking this into account, and 
when the size of the channels approaches the size of 
the molecule, the density of the orbitals (i.e. the 
probability for finding the electrons) of the guest 
molecule has to drop suddenly to nearly zero when 
reaching the walls of the zeolite. This is the conse- 
quence of the short-range repulsion with the delo- 
calized electron clouds of the lattice. This implies 
that a contraction of the orbitals of the guest molecule 
will occur with the consequent changes in its energy 
levels. More specifically an increase in the energy, 
especially in the frontier orbitals, should be expected, 
something which may imply a preactivation of the 
molecule when residing in the pore of the mi- 
croporous material.

Soft-Hard Acidities in Zeolites 
In 1963, 
Pearson301 
introduced the concept of hard 
and soft acids and bases (HSAB) 
in order to explain 
affinities between acid and bases that do not depend 
on electronegativities or other related macroscopic 
properties. A simple rule was established saying that 
soft acids prefer to react with soft bases and hard 
acids prefer to react with hard bases. Hard acids are 
defined301-303 
as small-sized, 
highly positively charged, 
and not easily polarizable electron acceptor, while 
soft ones are defined as those possessing the reverse 
properties. The fact that the bridged hydroxyl groups 
as well as the zeolite crystal have a strong covalent 
character, as was described above, makes it necessary 
to discuss the acidity of zeolites not only from the 
point of view of their acid strength but also from the 
point of view of their HSAB properties. The zeolite 
acidity considered from the softness point of view 
allows one to understand better the reactivity and, 
therefore, to explain the zeolite selectivity in reac- 
tions in which orbital control may exist and product 
distribution is not affected by diffusion limitations. 
While the influence of zeolite composition and 
structure on acid strength has been thoroughly 
studied by theoretical calculations, as has been 
discussed above, only a few papers on the hardness 
of the acid sites have been published. Langemaeker 
et al.304 
have studied the variation of the Fukui 
function with changing electronegativity 
in the neigh- 
borhood of the zeolite acid site. The Fukuis function 
is related, by density functional theory,305 
to Fukuis 
frontier density306 
and can be interpreted as a local 
softness.307 
In a more recent work308 
the softness of 
zeolite structures was determined by semiempirical 
density functional methodology using the infinite 
solid model. Working with cluster structures, we 
have correlated the softness of the acid site and the 
softness of an adsorbed reagent on the basis of the 
LUMO energy obtained from both ab initio and 
semiempirical calculations.309-312 
In our work it was found that by increasing the 
SUAl ratio in the framework the acid softness in- 
creased. The effect on the energy of the LUMO 
orbital, and therefore on the softness, caused by 
replacement of Si by Al is due to long-range effects. 
The calculations show that the destabilization of the 
LUMO orbital is related to the spatial distribution 
of the negative charge in the Al-containing frame- 
work and the localization of the M+ countercations. 
578 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 
It is known that the acid strength is affected when 
the nature of the framework atoms in the vicinity of 
the acid site is changed. With respect to the HSAB 
concept we found that the softness increases in the 
order of Al > Ga > B. From these results one may 
be tempted to correlate softness and acid strength, 
since in these cases the same tendency between the 
two parameters is observed. However, this should 
not be done since both parameters are not equivalent. 
Indeed, the acid strength is related to the inductive 
effect of the framework cations, while the softness is 
determined by the charge distribution in the frame- 
work. An example which shows that in some cases 
acid strength and acid softness can follow opposite 
tendencies, comes from the isomorphic substitution 
of Si by Ge, in the site supporting the bridged 
hydroxyl 
Furthermore, it has been found 
with the Si-Ge system that the effect of the isomor- 
phic substitution can be different and dependent on 
whether the substitution occurs at the same site 
supporting the OH acid group (increases softness) 
or 
in the second coordination sphere (decreases soft- 
ness). 
The catalytic implications of changes in acid soft- 
ness-hardness 
have been observed for orbital- 
controlled reactions such as alkylation of toluene and 
m-xylene by methano1.310-312,314,315 
First, softness- 
hardness of the alkylating agent, i.e. the methoxy- 
zeolite complex was evaluated theoretically for vari- 
ous zeolite compositions, and it was found that the 
softness of the acid sites and the softness of the 
methoxyzeolite complex increase with the framework 
dealumination. It was also observed that the soft- 
ness of the alkylating agent is even larger due to the 
fact that during the activation of the electrophile- 
zeolite complex the energy of the LUMO orbital 
decreases and its density at the reaction site in- 
creases at the same time.312 All this was reflected 
in the alkylation of toluene and m-xylene by metha- 
nol, by an increase in the pardortho and 124/123 
ratios with the increase of the softness, i.e. the 
increase of the SUA1 ratio of the zeolite, and when 
going from B-, to Ga- and to Al-substituted large-pore 
zeolites.311 
The probability that orbital control exists in reac- 
tions occurring on zeolites is increased because when 
a molecule is introduced into a zeolite pore or cavity, 
the energy of the HOMO increases due to the pres- 
ence of the electric field gradients and electronic 
confinement.299 
Then, and taking the electrophilic 
alkylation of aromatics as an example, if the energy 
of the HOMO orbital of the aromatic molecule is 
increased in the zeolite cavity compared to its value 
in the gas phase, it is obvious that the energy gap 
between the LUMO orbital of the electrophile and 
the HOMO of the aromatic substrate should be 
smaller in the confined space of zeolite than in an 
unconfined space. Consequently, a larger effect of 
the orbital control could be expected when reactions 
are carried out in Zeolites. However, one should 
consider that the shape selectivity effects can be very 
important in zeolites, and they may lead to different 
results that the selectivity effects due to orbital 
control.311

7. Interaction between Hydrocarbons and Acid Sites: 
Carbocations as Intermediates in Acid-Catalyzed 
Reactions on Zeolites 
At the beginning, the catalytic behavior of acid 
zeolites was compared to that of superacids in solu- 
tion. It was supposed that as in the case of super- 
acids in homogeneous 
phase,316,317 
carbocations 
would 
be formed on the surface of acid zeolites by protona- 
tion of olefins, aromatics, and even alkanes, by 
protonation and dehydration of alcohols, or by ab- 
straction of hydride ions from saturated molecules. 
It was supposed that such carbocations would be the 
intermediate species in acid-catalyzed reactions of 
hydrocarbons. Since "free" carbocations were de- 
tected in a homogeneous solution of SbF5-HF, one 
may expect to be able to detect them on the surface 
of an acidic zeolite. However, most of the attempts 
have failed318 
and the only carbocation positively 
identified on the amorphous silica-alumina and the 
HY zeolite is the very stable triphenylcarbenium ion. 
In this case the observed chemical shift is practically 
the same as that reported for the "free" carbocation 
with superacids in liquid media. Xu and Haw319 
have 
reported the NMR observation of indanyl carbenium 
ion intermediates in the reactions of hydrocarbons 
on acidic zeolites. 
In the case of smaller potential carbocations pos- 
sibly derived from alcohols and olefins, 
there is some 
indirect evidence of their presence at the zeolite 
Unfortunately, the high reactivity of 
such intermediate species with olefins to form oligo- 
mers, makes uncertain the interpretations based on 
the NMR assignments. Then, due to the lack of 
experimental evidence one may conclude that it is 
difficult to accept a direct analogy between the acid 
catalysis in zeolites and that of superacids in liquid 
media. The principal difference between the two 
types of systems would be the much larger stabiliza- 
tion of the intermediate carbocations by solvatation 
in the superacid media. This is so, despite of the fact 
that the zeolitic media are also able to solvate 
charged species, especially in zeolites with a high 
framework Al 
content, where the strong field gradi- 
ents in the channels favor the polarization and 
ionization of guest molecules in a similar way as in 
highly polar 
Recently, it has been proposed230*325,326 
that the 
intermediate stable species in hydrocarbon reactions 
on acid zeolites must be alkoxy complexes. However, 
the species whose electronic structure and geometry 
could be assimilated to adsorbed carbenium ions 
would not be stable, but would correspond to acti- 
vated species: 
alkoxide (I)

species (

Quantum chemical calculations 
that the 
intermediate 11, which may represent the adsorbed 
carbenium ion is much less stable, even for small 
C-0 distances, than the complex I. In the latter a 
Inorganic Solid Acids 
covalent bond between carbon and oxygen is formed, 
so the structure I could be identified with the real, 
stable, adsorbed intermediate, while the ionic system 
I1 requires an additional energy in order to exist. The 
energy needed to form I1 comes from thermal activa- 
tion and/or from the stabilization achieved by its 
interaction with a basic oxygen (species 111): 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 579 
This type of intermediate I11 implies the existence 
and the important role of the acid-base pairs in 
zeolites. We have recently shown by detailed ab 
initio molecular orbital calculations327 
that in the case 
of C
3
 and C4 olefins this process is a concerted 
mechanism involving the proton transfer from the 
zeolite toward a carbon of the olefin double bond, and 
the simultaneous C-0 bond formation at the adja- 
cent oxygen on the zeolite structure. The reaction 
mechanism and the properties of the transition states 
are practically the same, irrespective of the frame- 
work TI1 atom and the increase in branching when 
going from propylene to isobutene. This suggests 
that the geometric conformation of the transition 
state and the flexibility of the zeolite structure are 
determinant for the formation of an intermediate 
complex of type 1

.
 
The same type of stabilization effects have been 
observed when the stability of NH4+ formed by 
protonation of NH3 by the acid sites of zeolites was 
compared with that of chemisorbed NH3 on OH acid 
sites.328 
It was concluded that if N&+ is coordinated 
to only one basic oxygen of the zeolite in its anionic 
form, the ionic pair type complex is less stable than 
that corresponding to the adsorption of NH3 in where 
the H atom is still covalently bonded to the oxygen 
of the acid center: 
ionic pair complex 
adsorption complex 
However, when the coordination of NH4+ is biden- 
tate or tridentate to other basic oxygens, the ionic 
pair complex is more stable than the adsorbed 
complex. It was also found that the geometry around 
the tetrahedra changes when the proton is trans- 
ferred. This would not be possible if the lattice was 
rigid. Consequently, proton transfer requires a flex- 
ible lattice that allows for local deformations.231 
In conclusion, 
it appears that no free 
carbocations 
are formed as intermediates on hydrocarbon reac- 
tions catalyzed by zeolites, 
but in this case carbenium 
ions represent unstable ion pairs or transition states. 
In the case of zeolites those intermediate species are 
formed on acid-base pairs, and the flexibility of the 
zeolite is vital to allow proton transfer. There is no 
doubt that the electric fields present in zeolites, 
which are specially intense in AI-rich zeolites, can 
help to stabilize ionic pair complexes. However, it 
should be noticed that exactly the same type of 
reactions and at the same, or even lower, reaction 
temperatures occurs also on high SUM ratio zeolites, 
in where the stabilizations due to the solvent 
effect 
of the zeolite should be much lower. 
8. Zeolites as Acid Catalysts for Hydrocarbon Reactions 
Owing to the special characteristics of zeolites and 
zeotypes as acid catalysts, they have interesting 
catalytic properties for carrying out reactions with 
organic c o m p o  n d s .    -     
Here, we are going to 
review a series of hydrocarbon reactions catalyzed by 
zeolites, wich are of fundamental and practical inter- 
est in the oil and chemical industry. 
Isomerizations. Alkenes. When olefins are in 
contact with acid catalysts they can easily isomerize 
the double bond and interconvert the cis and trans 
isomers. These reactions proceed by breaking and 
formation of carbon-hydrogen bonds, on or next to 
the double bond, and are catalyzed by the acid sites. 
In the case of catalysts with very strong acidity, 
proton addition to the double bond with the formation 
of a carbenium ion, followed by proton elimination 
has been observed in strong liquid acids:

A similar mechanism seems to work in the case of

when the catalyst is deuterated, the deuterium of the 
catalyst is incorporated i

In the case of zeolite catalysts, it is supposed230 
that 
free carbenium ions are not formed, but some 
carbenium ion-like intermediate does form. This 
would evolve through a reaction coordinate involving 
a concerted mechanism in which the C-0 bond 
stretching occurs at the same time as the proton of 
the carbenium ion-like intermediate is transferred 
to one of the vicinal basic oxygens:

By following the mechanism proposed by Kazan- 
sky, it is clear that the activation energy of the 
double-bond 
isomerization should be the same as the 
energy required for the decomposition 
of an alkoxide 
group. Indeed, the calculated values for the alkoxide 
decomposition, and the value of the activation energy 
for the double-bond 
isomerization on zeolite catalysts 
are very similar and in the order of 15-20 kcal mol-. 
In the case of the double-bond 
isomerization, weak 
acidity is required and NaHY zeolites with a HO 
I 
+1.5 can carry out the isomerization of double bond 
in long chain olefins with high activity and selectiv- 
 it.' Stronger acid zeolites are less adequate, since 
besides the double-bond isomerization they can also 
carry out undesired reactions such as oligomerization 
and even cracking. 
However in the case of olefins the most interesting 
type of isomerization, from the industrial point of 
view, is the production of branched olefins from 
n-olefins, especially in the C4 and C
5
 fraction. This 
is so because of the increasing interest in isobutene 
and isopentenes as starting materials for the produc- 
tion of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), 
and methyl 
tert-amyl ether (TAME) 
which are used as oxygen- 
ated octane booster additives in the new reformulated 
gasolines. 
The skeletal isomerization of olefins requires stron- 
ger acid sites than double-bond isomerization, and 
the activation energies involved are similar to those 
for olefin cracking, indicating that both reactions 
should share common steps. 
By following a carbenium ion formalism, branching 
can occur through a protonated cyclopropane ring, 
which can give after ring opening and back proton 
transfer to the catalyst, a branched olefin: 
Corma 
In this mechanism, and for hydrocarbons with less 
than five carbon atoms, a primary carbenium-like 
species is formed, and this would explain the need 
for stronger acidity for carrying out this reaction. 
From the practical point of view the skeletal 
isomerization of short-chain olefins should be carried 
out at temperatures as low as possible, since at low 
temperatures the equilibrium is shifted toward 
branched products (Figure 
However, at lower 
temperatures the selectivity is decreased due to olefin 
oligomerization reactions.343 
If the reaction temper- 
ature is increased in order to avoid olefin oligomer- 
ization, then other reactions such as cracking, hy- 
drogen transfer, and coke formation can compete, 
with the corresponding negative effect on selectivity 
and catalyst life. Thus, reaction temperature is an 
important variable which has to be adjusted together 
wich olefin partial pressure and catalyst acidity in 
order to optimize the process. 
Large- and medium-pore zeolite and zeotype cata- 
lysts have been studied. In the case of large-pore 
zeolites such as Y, beta, and ZSM-12344 
higher 
selectivity for isoolefins and longer catalyst life were

obtained if the acidity of the zeolites is made mild 
by exchanging 
protonic sites by alkaline earth cations 
which may act as Lewis acid sites. Since hydrogen 
transfer and coke formation are competing 
undesired 
reactions, the density of acid sites in the zeolite can 
have an important effect on selectivity. This effect 
was 
by means of two beta zeolites with Si/ 
Al ratios of 51 and 28. As expected, a slower catalyst 
decay was obtained on the sample with the largest 
Si/Al ratio. 
Since in alkene branching isomerization an ad- 
equate choice of the acid strength of the catalyst is 
important to control selectivity 
and catalyst deactiva- 
tion, and thus, zeotypes of the AlPO, SAPO, and 
MeAPO type, whose acidity can be modified by 
introducing different elements at different concentra- 
tions into the framework, have been used as olefin 
isomerization 
catalysts. They are active and selective 
for n-butene isomerization if used at temperatures 
higher than 300 0C.345-347 
The other factor which also plays a determinant 
role on the isomerization selectivity and the catalyst 
life, is the zeolite and zeotype pore size. In general, 
it can be said that medium-pore materials favor the 
skeletal isomerization with respect to double-bond 
isomerization and oligomerization. Moreover, geo- 
metrical restriction within the pores decreases the 
formation of coke precursors, and therefore increases 
the life of the catalyst. In this sense the adequate 
combination of acidity and pore size have made 
medium-pore Fe and Mn SAPO-11 and SAPO-31 
suitable catalysts for commercial isomerization of 
n-butene. Results from Table 9345 
show that while 
SAPO-31 is already active and selective catalyst if 
used at high reaction temperatures, the selectivity 
to isobutene is strongly increased when Mn is intro- 
duced into the framework. 
Another way to control acid strength is the syn- 
thesis of zeolites with TI1 other than Al. When B 
instead of Al was introduced into ZSM-5 it was found 
that activity decreased but selectivity to isobutene 
increased. Thus, an improvement was claimed when 
ZSM-5 containing B and Al were synthesized.348

out on acid zeolites, and this process requires very 
strong acid sites. However, the use of monofunc- 
tional acid zeolites gives low selectivity to branched 
isomers because of extensive recracking of branched 
alkanes, which are easier to be cracked than the 
n-paraffins. 
Conversion and selectivity is strongly increased 
when Pt 
or Pd are incorporated into the acidic zeolite, 
and the reaction is carried out in the presence of Hz. 
In this case, the proposed mechanism involves the 
formation of an intermediate olefin, which is pro- 
duced by dehydrogenation of the alkane on the 
metallic site.354 In the second step, the olefin diffises 
to an acid site, where it is protonated to form a 
carbenium ion-like transition state, which can isomer- 
ize or even crack, depending on the hydrocarbon 
chain length, reaction temperature, and the average 
lifetime the branched carbenium ion-like species 
on the catalyst surface, ms 
in turn depends on both 
the acid stren@h 
and on the good hydrogen transfer-

However, it should be taken into account that B can 
easily come out from the framework 
positions during 
the zeolite activation. If this happens, the B Al- 
ZSM-5 zeolites are equivalent to Al-ZSM-5 zeolites 
but with a higher SVAl ratio. Indeed, the results 
presented in Figure 16 show that by increasing the 
framework SVAl of MCM-22, which has 12 and 10 
MR channels, the selectivity to 
isobutene increases, 
while the selectivity to oligomerization and cracking 
decreaes.3 
Similarly, other medium-pore 
size zeo- 
lites with high SVAl ratio such as ZSM-22 and ZSM- 
23, if used at high temperature and WHSV, give high 
activity and electivities.3 
The best results reported on skeletal 
isomerization 
of n-butene on zeolites correspond to ferrierite. This 
has a structure formed by unidirectional 10 MR 
channels with loobs. When the zeolite is optimized 
from the point of view of the framework SUM ratio 
and the crystallite size, selectivity to isobutene close 
to 70% at -60% conversion is 0btained.3 
It has 
been claimed353 
that the special channel structure of 
ferrierite is responsible for the high isomerization 
selectivity, which is achieved because cracking of the 
branched dimeric CS olefin intermediates which 
produce isobutene and n-butenes rather than C
3
 and 
hydrogenation activity of the 
catalyst. An scheme 
of 
such a mechanism is as follows: 
-H2 
+ 
H+ 
n-paraffin ==== n-olefin 
sec-C+ 
metal 
In the bifunctional mechanism 
described above and 
if the adequate balance between the metal and the 
acid function is achieved (Pt 
atadacid site 2 
0.15),355 
the rearrangement of the carbenium 
like-ion 
becomes 
the controlling step. 
When shorter chain p a r a "  
c 4 - C   
are to be 
isomerized very strong 
acid sites are needed since the 
reaction will go through primary carbenium ions. 
Thus, zeolites with stronger acidity, such as morden- 
ite and ZSM-5, would appear as 
the most convenient. 
However, because of the small diameter of ZSM-5, 
the diffusion of branched isomers will be restricted 
in this zeolite, and therefore mordenite should be the 
preferred catalyst. When this is selected as the acid 
component, sites with maximum strength are pro- 
duced bv modifvine the framework SVAl ratio in post- 
C5 fragments. 
Alkanes. Skeletal 
isomerization of paraffins with 
carbon numbers between 5 and 10 is important to 
improve the octane number of the gasolines, while 
isomerization of larger n-paraffins (>Cia) is also 
useful to decrease the freezing point of the diesel fuel. 
The skeletal isomerization of paraffins can be carried 
synthesis treatments in order to obtain isorated 
tetrahedral 
Al 
Thus, maximum activity 
is found for framework SiAl ratios of ca. 10. How- 
ever, it was pointed out, when discussing the influ- 
ence of zeolite composition on acid strength, that an 
increase in the acid strength of bridged hydroxyl 
groups can be obtained by interaction with ex- 
582 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3

traframework species. This effect also occurs in 
mordenite, in which owing to the OH-EFAI, 
interac- 
tion an increase in the activity of a Pmordenite for 
isomerization of n-pentane and n-hexane was ob- 
served.263 
Other large-pore zeolites in which strong acidity 
can also be produced are omega and beta. Indeed, 
bifunctional catalysts based on these two zeolites 
show good activity and selectivity for n-pentane and 
n-hexane i s o m e r i z a t i  n .    '     
In the case of n-butane, zeolite catalysts can hardly 
work at temperatures below 270 "C and in this case 
most of the isobutane is formed by an alkylation- 
cracking mechanism, instead of by direct isomeriza- 
tion of n-butane. 
When long-chain 
n-paraffins have to be isomerized, 
milder acidities and larger pores are desired in order 
to minimize recracking of the branched products 
formed. Thus, bifunctional catalysts based on zeo- 
lites such as faujasite, ZSM-3, 
CSZ-1, and L, or even 
zeolite mixtures as well as SAPOS and MEMOS, 
show good selectivities for branching isomerization 
of long-chain p a r a f f i n  .   O -     
In the case of open 
structures in where no shape selectivity effects exist, 
the product distribution can be predicted by taking 
into account the protonated cycloprane (PCP) 
mech- 
a n i  m .   '  
It can be concluded that when using zeolites as 
catalysts for isomerization of n-paraffins, one has to 
take into account the size of the reactant and 
products, as well as the acid demands to form the 
corresponding intermediates. Then, a zeolite or 
zeotype with the adequate pore size and acid strength 
could be selected. However, even with the best 
optimized zeolite catalysts, it is not possible to carry 
out the isomerization of n-butane to isobutane with 
good yields and selectivity. This reaction requires 
stronger acid sites than those obtainable in zeolites, 
and the possibilities of solid catalyst with stronger 
acid sites to carry out this reaction will be described 
later when discussing the acidic properties of het- 
eropoly acids and sulfated metal oxides. 
Alkyl Aromatics. Aromatic ring positional isomer- 
izations are reactions of commercial interest where 
zeolites have demonstrated its superiority as cata- 
lysts. In Friedel-Crafts type of acid catalysts the 
isomerization of alkyl aromatics is always accompa- 
nied by the competitive transalkylation reaction. 
Zeolites have demonstrated that it is possible, by an 
adequate selection of the pore size and chemical 
composition, to optimize selectivity toward the pro- 
duction of the desired isomer. Taking the isomer- 
ization of xylenes as an example, the composition of 
the thermodynamic equilibrium at room temperature 
is approximately: 24, 60, and 16% for p-, m-, and 
o-xylene, 
respectively. Since the commercially most 
desired product is the para isomer, which is a raw 
material for production of terephthalic acid, there is 
a clear incentive for the selective isomerization of m- 
to p-xylene. 
On solid amorphous catalysts, as well as on large- 
pore zeolites and zeotypes, the isomerization of 
m-xylene is accompanied by transalkylation to pro- 
duce toluene and trimethylbenzenes: 
Furthermore, at high conversions, xylenes are 
produced with the thermodynamic equilibrium com- 
position. 
It is generally believed that isomerization of alkyl 
aromatics occurs by a 1,2 alkyl shift,368 
and the 
relative rate reflects the relative stability of the alkyl 
cation. However, when using large-pore zeolites, it 
has been found that even at low levels of conversion, 
isomers can also be formed through a bimolecular 
transalkylation mechanism from intermediate,-l 
as it occurs for the transalkylation of xylenes to give 
toluene and trimethylbenzenes. Since the bimolecu- 
lar transalkylation reactions should involve a bulkier 
transition state than that of the unimolecular 1,2 
methyl shift it could be expected that by reducing the 
space available inside the channels, a situation may 
be reached where transalkylation could be sup- 
pressed by transition-state shape selectivity. This is 
what is observed when the reaction is carried out on 
zeolites with different pore sizes.3712372 
Results pre- 
sented in Figure 17,373 
clearly show that transalky- 
lation is strongly decreased in 10 MR zeolites. 
Besides geometrical 
effects, the chemical composition 
of the zeolite also has an effect on the ratio of uni- to 
bimolecular reactions. In this way, it was found by 
means of kinetic and isotopic studies371 
that by 
increasing the framework SUAl ratio of a large pore 
HY zeolite, the ratio of uni to bimolecular reactions 
occurring during m-xylene isomerization increased. 
If the suppression of xylene transalkylation achieved 
by using medium-pore zeolites is already a big 
improvement in the xylene isomerization process, 
zeolites can go further than this, and they can also 
improve the selectivity to the para isomer by product 
diffusion shape selectivity. As was presented before, 
in ZSM-5 zeolite the diffusion coefficient 
for 
p-xylene 
is more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than for 
o-xylene. This difference allows p-xylene to escape 
more rapidly outside the zeolite crystallite than the 
ortho isomer. Then the characteristic diffusion time 
for o-xylene is much greater than its characteristic 
isomerization time, so the diffusion of ortho will be 
selectivelly retarded within the pores, allowing time 
for isomerization toward p -  y l e n e .     
Results from 
Figure 18373 
show the effect of pore dimensions on 
the para to ortho ratio obtained during isomerization 
of m-xylene on zeolites with different pore sizes, and 
it shows the increased para selectivity obtained on 
medium-pore zeolites. 
What has been said for xylene isomerization also 
applies to other alkyl aromatics such as ethyl-, 
methylbenene? 
diispropylbenzene? 
and l-meth- 
 l n a p h t a l e n e .   "     
The relative ratio of the size of 
the molecule and the pore size seems to be the most 
important factor controlling the result of the isomer- 
ization.

The isomerization-transalkylation of alkyl aro- 
matics is perhaps the best example to show the 
important role played by shape selectivity owing to 
the micropores of zeolites on hydrocarbon reactivity. 
This type of reaction is so determined by space 
restriction that they are widely used to test the pore 
topology of any new zeolite structure syntheized. 
Carbon-Carbon Rupture and Formation. 
Catalytic Cracking. Catalytic cracking of hydro- 
carbons is a field in which zeolites have been respon- 
sible for the largest revolution in oil refining in the 
last 30 years. Indeed, gasoil cracking is the basis for 
the production of more than 30% of the gasoline, 
while it also produces diesel, and olefins and isopar- 
affins for petrochemical uses. The substitution of 
amorphous silica-alumina catalysts by faujasite 
zeolites, toward end of the 1960s, allowed a strong 
increase in the production of gasoline. 
From the point of view of cracking mechanism, the 
acid sites of the zeolite are believed to be the catalytic 
active sites. If cracking of hydrocarbons on liquid 
superacids proceeds through the formation of free 
carbenium and carbonium ions,380,381 
in the case of 
hydrocarbon cracking on zeolites, the formation of 
free 
carbocations 
has not been observed. However, 
and after considering the product distribution ob- 
tained during cracking of alkanes, alkenes, cycloal- 
kanes, and alkyl aromatics, it appears obvious that

carbenium and carbonium ion-like intermediates 
must also be formed on zeolites during catalytic 
cracking of hydrocarbons. In this way it is believed 
that when carbenium ion-like species are formed on 
the surface of the zeolite, one way to stabilize the 
short-lived ion pair is by a /?-scission process which 
produces an olefin in the gas phase and a new alkoxy 
group which remains adsorbed:230

This reaction should involve a concerted mecha- 
nism that allows the compensation 
of the dissociating 
bonds by the new ones being formed. This, in turn, 
should produce a decrease in the activation energy 
with respect to a process involving the formation of 
free 
carbenium ions followed by cracking. 
Recently, 
it has been suggested that similar to the 
mechanism of cracking proposed by Olah in super- 
protolytic cracking could also occur on the 
surface of zeolites.3822383 
This mechanism started by 
protonation of a C-C bond by the acid site of the 
zeolite. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations 
584 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 
Corma 
have been carried out to visualize the transition state 
of the protolytic cracking.230 Even though the hy- 
drocarbon molecule was small (CzHs) 
and the zeolitic 
active site was simulated by a very simple cluster, 
some interesting qualitative conclusions could be 
reached: the transition state appears as a two-point 
interaction of ethane with the OH and a neighboring 
oxygen. The reaction coordinate of protolytic crack- 
ing represents the concerted stretching of the 0-H 
bond in the bridging hydroxyl group, combined with 
the heterolytic splitting of the carbon-carbon bond 
in the protonated ethane molecule. The final step is 
the formation of free methane and the formation of 
a methoxy group in the neighboring basic oxygen of 
the former acid site. 
While there is no doubt that the initiation step in 
the protolytic cracking of paraffins and cracking of 
olefins is the formation of a carbocation or a carbe- 
nium ion-like intermediate on a Bronsted acid site 
of the zeolite, it is still under discussion if paraffin 
cracking initiation via carbenium ions also occur and, 
if so, on what zeolite sites are the carbenium ions 
formed. 
Some authors have claimed that a carbenium ion 
can be formed on alkanes or cycloalkanes 
by abstrac- 
tion of a hydride ion from the hydrocarbon by either 
a Bronsted acid site, which gives H
2
 as a p r o d  d ,   -    
or by a Lewis acid site from the c a t a l y  t .    ,     
Another hypothesis to explain the paraffin-cracking 
initiation, supposes that the cracking chain is initi- 
ated by Bronsted-site protonation of olefins that are 
either present in the feed or formed by thermal 
cracking.391 
A comprehensive discussion of the dif- 
ferent initiation schemes can be found elsewhere.392 
The current situation in the cracking of alkanes 
on zeolites appears to be the following: when crack- 
ing n-alkanes, the reaction is initiated by formation 
of a carbocation-like intermediate which cracks and 
gives a shorter alkane in the gas phase and an 
adsorbed carbenium ion-like species on the zeolite. 
This carbenium can either desorb giving one olefin 
in the gas phase and restoring the zeolite Bronsted 
site, or it may follow a chain mechanism by abstract- 
ing a hydride ion from another reactant molecule, 
and desorbing from the catalyst as a paraffin, while 
leaving a carbenium ion of the reactant molecule on 
the zeolite surface: 
The adsorbed (C,H2,+1)+ can now crack following 
the p rule. 
In summary, in the case of n-alkanes, it could be 
said that the first molecules of reactant are cracked 
by protolytic cracking. Then, when the shorter 
carbenium species remain on the surface, cracking 
can continue by two routes: (1) 
protolytic cracking, 
if the carbenium ion desorbs and regenerates the 
original Bronsted site, and (2) p-scission, if hydride 
transfer from a reactant molecule to the adsorbed 
carbenium ion occurs. 
The relative extension of protolytic to /3-scission 
mechanism or, in other words, the length of the 
cracking chain and hydrogen transfer, has an impor- 
tant impact on the quality of the products formed 
during the commercial cracking of gasoil in fluid 
catalytic cracking (FCC) units. Indeed, protolytic 
cracking is believed to favor the formation of unde- 
sired dry gas with respect to p-scission. On the other 
hand, hydrogen transfer is believed to be responsible 
for saturation of olefins, with the corresponding 
increase on gasoline stability and selectivity, but 
producing a decrease in the research octane number 
(RON). 
Cycloalkanes, which are also present in FCC 
feedstocks,393 
play a determinant role in cracking 
chemistry for hydrogen transfer, and as precursors 
for aromatics and coke. They can also react on acid 
zeolites to give ring opening and cracking by pro- 
tolytic and p-scission, as well as isomerization, and 
hydrogen transfer  reaction.- 
Alkyl aromatics, which are also constituent of FCC 
feeds,397 
also crack on zeolites by the complete cleav- 
age of the side chain from the aromatic ring if that 
has less than five carbon atoms. Cracking can also 
take place along the side chain if this has more than 
five carbon  atom.,- 
Both, chemical composition and geometrical struc- 
ture of zeolites play an important role on determining 
the product distribution obtained during catalytic 
cracking. In this way it has been shown that the 
ratio of protolytic cracking to p-scission increases 
when increasing the SVAI ratio of the zeolite,401 
meanwhile hydrogen transfer and coke formation 
decrease. Thus, during gasoil cracking an increase 
in the framework SUAI ratio of the zeolite produces 
a decrease in the selectivity to gasoline owing to a 
larger recracking, which yields C1-C4 gases, while 
also produces a decrease in the hydrogen transfer and 
coke formation, with the corresponding increase in 
RON and throughput, respectively. 
The zeolite geometrical factors can be taken ad- 
vantage of to selectively crack n-paraffins and n- 
olefins with respect to their branched isomers when 
using medium-pore-size 
zeolites. This effect is based 
on zeolite shape selectivity by mass transport dis- 
crimination, which arises because there are signifi- 
cant differences in difisivities between branched and 
linear hydrocarbons within the pores of 10 MR 
zeolites, as for instance ZSM-5.402-408 However, 
spatial constraints of reaction intermediates can also 
play an important role in determining the different 
cracking rates of monobranched and linear paraffins 
on ZSM-5 zeolite. Evidence of this was given by 
Frilette et al.402 
when showing that the relative rate 
of cracking n-hexane to that of 3-methylpentane was 
independent of the size of the individual catalyst 
crystal (Figure 19h402 
The rate control by spatial constraints of reaction 
intermediates is due to the fact that a branched 
paraffin, by being a bulkier molecule than the un- 
branched isomer, requires more space to form the 
reaction intermediate, with possible limitations by 
the pore size of ZSM-5 zeolite. By carrying out this 
selective cracking of molecules in the gasoline range, 
the addition of ZSM-5 to FCC catalysts produces an 
increase in gasoline RON and also an increase in the 
production of propylene.

were candidates for this,414-416 
and zeolite Y, either 
in the protonic form or exchanged with di- or trivalent 
cations, has been studied for alkylation of isobutane 
and butene. On the basis of the products formed, it 
appears that the general reaction mechanism operat- 
ing on zeolites is the same as that on liquid acids.413 
This involves a chain mechanism in which the 
initiation step is the protonation of the olefin, fol- 
lowed by a hydride transfer from a molecule of 
isobutane to the sec-butyl carbocation:

Changes in the pore size of the zeolite additive, 
for 
instance by using beta or MCM-22 zeolites, allows 
one to keep a good gasoline selectivity while increas- 
ing the RON of the gasoline and shifting the C4 and 
Cg products to desirable isobutylene 
and isoamylene 
p r o d  c t s .    -     
It can be concluded that by taking advantage of the 
high cracking activity of zeolites combined with the 
fact that different pore size zeolites may perform 
different type of cracking on the different products, 
leaves open the possibility to optimize cracking 
products by using multizeolitic cracking catalysts. 
The effects shown by zeolites on catalytic 
cracking, 
also apply to hydrocracking of paraffins and gasoil. 
Thus, hydrocracking is slow for n-alkanes, but the 
rate strongly 
increases for branched isomers. It can 
be said that hydrocracking starts when the n-parafin 
has undergone, 
at least, two isomerization steps. 
This 
can be seen when hydrocracking 
n-decane 
on a large- 
pore Pt/USY zeolite (Figure 20).412 
As in the case of catalytic cracking, the channel 
structure of ZSM-5 has a strong effect on the relative 
rate of cracking and isomerization, 
as well as on the 
isomer distribution of n-decane, suppressing the 
formation of bulky di- and tribranched decanes and 
ethyl octane. The shape selectivity effect of me- 
dium- and small-pore zeolites for hydrocracking 
paraffins, has shown its practical utility in the 
selectoforming 
and catalytic dewaxing processes.

The chain is transferred by hydride transfer be-

 carbocation-like 
intermediate 
and the isobutane reactant. In this way a c

 branched 
alkane is desorbed while an adsorbed tert-butylcar- 
benium ion is formed. 
The chain is finished by desorption of a carbocation 
giving the corresponding olefin and restoring the 
Bronsted acid site. 
This simplified mechanism only applies in a first 
approximation. When the product distribution is 
analyzed in detail, it can be deduced that other 
isomerization and olefin oligomerization reactions 
also occur.413 
The most important pathway compet- 
ing with the desired alkylation is the dimerization 
of the olefin which in the case of 2-butene 
would give 
dimethylhexanes 
(DMH). This is a much less desired 
reaction owing to the much lower octane number of 
dimethyl derivatives with respect to trimethylpen- 
tanes (TMP). 
In the case of zeolites, high activity and selectivity 
to TMP are obtained in the first moments of the 
586 Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 
reaction. However, after a few minutes on stream 
the activity of the zeolite for hydrogen transfer, which 
is the reaction responsible for chain propagation, is 
lost, and then the reaction enters a critical stage in 
which product distribution is better explained in 
terms of olefin oligomerization 
instead of isobutane- 
butene alkylatin.',l* 
Since zeolite composition and structure have an 
influence on acidity as well as on hydrogen transfer 
activity, different REHY and USY preparations have 
been s t  d i e d .    ,     
It has been found that while 
maximum activities were obtained for framework Si/ 
Al ratios of -6, the ratio of TMPDMH, which can 
measure the ratio of alkylation to oligomerization, 
continuously increases when decreasing the frame- 
work Si/Al ratio.421 
This is not surprising since it is 
known that the concentration of reactants in the 
pores, the extent of hydrogen transfer, and the 
distribution of acid sites, strongly depend on the 
zeolite framework composition. The results obtained 
with steam dealuminated USY were compared to 
those on another large-pore high SUA1 ratio zeolite, 
such as beta, with different crystal sizes.421 
It has 
been seen that, at least in beta zeolite, limitations 
in the diffusion of branched products may exist at 
the relatively low reaction temperatures used, as can 
be deduced from the increase in conversion, 
observed 
when decreasing the crystal size of the zeolite. 
Moreover, the beta zeolite is less selective to TMP 
due to its lower hydrogen transfer activity. 
The pore size of the zeolite is critical for diffusion 
of the branched products as well as for allowing the 
bulky transition state involved in the hydrogen 
transfer reaction between TMP and isobutane. When 
zeolites with different structures were compared at 
the same level of total conversion, it was f

n

that 
alkylate yield increases from ZSM-5, which is formed 
by 10-member ring channels, to MCM-22 with 12- 
member ring cavities connected between them by 10- 
member ring windows, and an independent 10- 
member ring channel system,423 
and from this to 
large-pore zeolites such as mordenite, beta, and Y. 
In conclusion, it can be said that even though the 
zeolites are active and selective catalysts to carry out 
the alkylation of isobutane with olefins, their practi- 
cal use is limited, during to the fast catalyst deacti- 
vation if conventional reaction systems are used. In 
the next sections we will discuss the possibilities that 
offer stronger solid acid catalysts, such as heteropoly 
acids and sulfated metal oxides for this important 
reaction. 
Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation by Olefin 
Oligomerization. Olefins can easily oligomerize in 
the presence of acid catalysts, and they also do so on 
acidic zeolites. 13C "in situ" NMR studies indicate 
that the reaction may proceed via a carbenium-like 
type mechanism, and alkoxides were identified as 
 intermediate.- Together with oligomerization, 
other consecutive reactions such as transmutation 
and hydrogen transfer also occur and the oligomers 
may be converted to secondary olefinic and paraffinic 
products.429 Secondary reactions are so fast that a 
rapid equilibration of olefins to a composition deter- 
mined by the temperature and pressure of the system 
occurred. 
Coma 
It is clear that in a system involving several 
bimolecular and unimolecular reactions, as well as 
products with different sizes, the final product dis- 
tribution could be affected by the pore size of the 
zeolite. In general, and as it could be expected, the 
amount of branched products increases when in- 
creasing the pore size of the zeolite or zeotype 
The practical importance of olefin oligomerization 
is illustrated by the fact that this reaction, together 
with transmutation-disproportionation and aroma- 
tization of C
p
 to Clo olefins, are the basis of Mobil's 
olefin to gasoline, distillate process (MOGD).432-435 
The process is quite flexible and allows, on the one 
hand the production of isoolefins, when the reaction 
is carried out at high pressures and low tempera- 
tures, and the hydrogenation of the 165 "C+ olefins 
produces a premium quality low-pour-point 
jet fuel 
and distillate fuel. On the other hand, when the 
process is operated at higher reaction temperatures 
aromatics are produced.432 
Zeolite ZSM-5, either in 
its acid form, with supported Ni, or with supported 
Ga, and in combination with aluminum phosphate/ 
alumina are good catalysts for the oligomerization 
of Cp-C10 olefinic p r o d  c t s .    -     
Compositional 
(Si/ 
Al ratio), textural (crystal size), and catalyst confor- 
mational parameters (extrudation and pelletization) 
of the ZSM-5 zeolite play an important role on the 
final catalytic performance.442 
Diffusional problems 
are important in this reaction, and therefore, a 
decrease in crystallite size produces an increase in 
activity and catalyst life. In the same way, if inter- 
crystalline diffusion resistance is increased by high- 
pressure pelletization, a decrease in conversion and 
catalyst life is observed. 
New zeolitic structures containing 12- and 10- 
member ring channels (MCM-22) 
have been claimed 
as adequate olefin oligomerization catalysts,u,u and 
multifunctional catalysts involving MCM-41 plus 
MCM-22 have been claimed to carry out oligomer- 
ization plus cracking.445 
Reactions involving 
olefins or even paraffins which 
can be cracked andlor dehydrogenated to form olefins 
which then can react, is an open field where the 
structure of the zeolite pore plays a determinant role, 
and consequently the product composition can be 
controlled by using the adequate zeolite or zeotype 
structure. 
Alkylation of Aromatics. Electrophilic alkyla- 
tion of aromatics can be carried out by a variety of 
reactants such as olefins, alcohols, and halogenated 
hydrocarbons.330 
Commercial catalytic processes lead- 
ing to the formation of ethylbenzene, p-xylene, pro- 
pylbenzenes, 
ethyltoluene, and 4,4'-isopropylbiphenyl 
are based on alkylation of benzene, toluene, and 
biphenyl. 
Early studies on the alkylation of benzene and 
related aromatics with olefins on large-pore acid 
zeolites found that a Langmuir-Rideal-type mecha- 
nistic kinetic equation can adequately represent the 
chemical process. In such a scheme, it was supposed 
that an anionic lattice-associated carbenium ion was 
formed by attack of a proton on an olefin, and this is 
then attacked by a free or weakly adsorbed aro- 
ma ti.,- However it has to be taken into 
(SApO).426-428,430-432

reaction. Nevertheless, very little amounts of poly- 
alkylated products are observed unless total pressure 
is increased.453 
Long-chain alkyl aromatics are useful molecules 
for 
production of surfactants, and they are produced by 
alkylation of benzene with long-chain 
n-olefins on HF 
acid. The 12-member ring unidirectional ZSM-12 
zeolite gave unique product distribution in the alky- 
lation of benzene with long chain olefins, forming 
preferentially 2-phenylalkanes (Table 
owing 
to spatial restriction in the pores of this zeolite. 
Larger polyaromatic 
molecules have been alkylated 
on amorphous solid acids as well as on large-pore 
 zeolite.? An interesting example in which shape 
selectivity 
has been found in large-pore zeolites is the 
4,4' alkylation of biphenyl by propylene. Table 11457 
shows the isopropylation of biphenyl on large- and 
medium-pore zeolites, such as mcjrdenite (HM), HY, 
HL, and HZSM-5, as well as on amorphous silica- 
alumina (SA). Results show that mordenite gives the 
largest selectivity to 4-isopropylbiphenyl 
(IPBP), 
and 
to 4,4'-diisopropylbiphenyl (DIPBP). This last prod- 
uct has commercial interest for liquid crystals and 
high-performance polymers. When the mordenite 
was further dealuminated to SUA1 ratios of 2600, it 
gave biphenyl conversion of 98% with a selectivity 
to the 4,4' isomer of 73.5% at 523 K, propylene 
pressure of 8.43 kg cm-2, and 20 of reaction. Dealu- 
mination decreased polymerization and coke forma- 
tion, as well as reactions occurring on the external 
surface of the zeolite. The higher selectivity 
observed 
on H-mordenite with respect to other large-pore 
zeolites is believed to be due to the geometry of the 
channels in mordenite, which consist of 12-member 
ring crossed by 8-member ring channels. Then, the 
packed biphenyl molecules adsorbed in the 12- 
member ring channels would be alkylated by the 
propylene which would diffuse through the 8 MR 
channels.458 
Acid mordenite catalysts also show shape selectiv- 
ity for the alkylation of naphthalene, anthracene, 
dibenzofuran, and 
p-terphenyl with p r  p y l e n e ,    -  
due to steric restriction at the transition state in the 
pores and differences in diffusion rates of reactants 
and products. 
Alkylation of aromatics is a good example of reac- 
tions where the diffusion and transition shape selec- 
tivity play a predominant role in controlling the 
selectivity 
of zeolite catalysts. Furthermore, it shows 
that depending on the size of the reactant and 
product molecules, shape selectivity applies to either 
medium- or large-pore size zeolites, and selective

account that it is difficult in the case of zeolite 
catalysts to assume a Langmuir-Rideal-type mech- 
anism in the strict sense, i.e. adsorbed olefin and 
aromatic in the "gas phase", since any molecule 
within zeolite pores is going to be subjected to the 
electric field gradients and even to electronic 
confine- 
ment effects. Thus, one has to consider that at least 
some degree of weak chemical adsorption of the 
aromatic must occur. 
Zeolites in which no diffusional or transition state 
shape selectivity exist behave like liquid acids or 
mesoporous amorphous solid acids, i.e. there is a 
predominance of ortho-para orientation in electro- 
philic substitution reactions on aromatic rings con- 
taining ortho-para-directing substituents. Moreover 
the stronger the increased electron density at the 
ortho and para position generated by the ring sub- 
stituent, the easier will be the a l k y l a t i  n .    *    
How- 
ever, in the case of aromatics alkylation the concept 
of shape selectivity has been very useful in designing 
new improved alkylation catalysts based on zeolites. 
In this way, the Mobil-Badger ethylbenzene process 
is based on the use of a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst to 
produce ethylbenzene, for the production of styrene, 
by alkylation of benzene with ethylene.450 By an 
adequate choice of the benzene to ethylene ratio it is 
possible to limit the formation of diethylbenzene, and 
an overall yield of 99% of ethylbenzene is obtained. 
Due to pore constraints medium-pore zeolites 
strongly limit the formation of coke, allowing cycles 
of up to 60 days between regenerations. 
Product diffusion shape selectivity is responsible 
for the selective formation of p-ethyltoluene (97% 
of 
the three isomers formed) during the alkylation of 
toluene with ethene on modified ZSM-5 zeolites.451 
Production of p-xylene by alkylation of toluene by 
methanol (TAM Process)452 
is also based on the faster 
diffusion of the para isomer, with respect to 0- 
and 
m-xylenes, which enriches the product in the most 
desired p-xylene. 
Longer chain olefins have also been used for 
selective formation of monoalkyl products. In this 
way, isopropylbenzene is formed by alkylation of 
benzene with propylene on HZSM-5, with polymer- 
ization of propylene as the only serious competing

alkylation processes have been developed using both 
types of zeolites. 
From the results reported on zeolite reactivity for 
acid-catalyzed 
reactions, it is clear that the combina- 
tion of pore structure and acidities, which can be as 
strong as HO 
= -10, allows one to carry out a large 
number of catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons on 
these materials. However, zeolites are useless either 
to catalyze reactions at low temperatures or for 
processes requiring acidities stronger than Ha = 
-10. 
In those cases, other more acidic inorganic solid 
catalysts are needed, and the possibilities of het- 
eropoly acids and sulfated transition metal oxides 
will be discussed in the following sections. 
C. Heteropoly Acids 
1. Composition, Structure Preparation, and Textural 
Properties 
Heteropoly compounds involve a large class of 
coordination-type salts and free acids which are 
formed by the condensation of more than two differ- 
ent types of oxoanions as for instance: 
12W04'- + 
HPOt- + 23H' - 
PW,,04,3- + 12H'O 
In this section the terms heteropoly compounds and 
heteropoly anions will be used for heteropoly acids 
(acid forms) and their salts.463-465 
The anion contains a central atom, typically Si or 
P (Table 121, tetrahedrally coordinated to oxygens

peripheral metal atoms. These are usually Mo or W 
but can also be others such as V, Nb, Ta, single, or 
in combination. It is possible to prepare heteropoly 
anions with different structures. 
The structure of the fundamental units is called 
the primary structure. Secondary structures are 
formed when the primary units are joined to form a 
solid. For instance, for the heteropoly anion with a 
Keggin structure466 
the primary structure (Figure 
21a) is formed by a central Po4 tetrahedron sur- 
rounded by 12 WO6 octahedra which are arranged 
in four groups of three edge-shared octahedra W3013. 
These W3013 units linked by shared corners to each 
other and to the central PO4. In this case, the 
secondary structure is formed by packing the poly- 
anions into a bcc structure in which the protonated 
water dimer (HzO)zH+ 
is connected to four anions by 
hydrogen bonding at the terminal oxygen atoms of

the anions (Figure 21b). Then, depending on the 
amount of hydration water and on the countercation, 
several crystallographic arrangements exist. For 
instance, the Keggin heteropoly acid H3PW12040 
adopts different forms (Table 13), when hydration 
water content is changed from 5 to 29 molecules. In 
the case of heteropoly acids, the hydration water can 
be replaced by polar molecules, and as will be shown 
later this becomes crucial for the catalytic activity 
shown by solid heteropoly acids. 
It can be said463 
that the structures of the het- 
eropoly anions are governed by two general prin- 
ciples. Firstly each metal atom occupies a MO, 
coordination polyhedron in which the metal atoms 
are displaced, owing to the M-0 bonding, toward the 
polyhedral vertices that form the surface of the 
structure. The second principle establishes that 
structures with MO6 octahedra that contain three or 
more free vertices are in general not observed.467 
Different techniques have been used to characterize 
the primary and secondary structure of heteropoly 
anions, in solution, as solids 
or supported on different 
carriers. In this way, IR s p e c t r o s  o p p   -     
can 
distinguish different types of oxygen atoms present 
in typical heteropoly acids, i.e., oxygen connecting 
species that binds central to peripheral atoms (Oc), 
bridging oxygens which bind adjacent peripheral 
atoms (Ob), and terminal species attached to a single 
peripheral atom (OJ. The IR spectrum of a Keggin 
anion (Figure 22)471 
shows bands at 1064 
and 1079, 
963 and 983, and 900-700 cm-l, which correspond 
to P-0, Mo=O and W-0 stretching bond vibrations, 
and to M-0-M 
bridging bond vibration, respec- 
tively. Laser Raman spectroscopy 
has also been used 
to study the structure of heteropoly compounds in 
s o l  t i o n    ,         
as well as in the form of solids, and

cating that the primary structure is preserved in the 
solid. Surface Raman scattering, useful for the 
characterization of heteropoly anions, is also a pow- 
erful technique to determine reactive species in "in 
situ" performed catalytic reactions, using the second- 
ary structures, and individual anions in dilute sup- 
ported systems.477>478

suitable for the NMR spectroscopy. Therefore, it is 
not surprising that NMR has been extensively used 
for the characterization of heteropoly compounds by 
matching their NMR spectra to those of standards 
whose structures have been previously determined 
by other methods such as X-ray or neutron diffrac- 
tion. NMR is also used to characterize their acidity, 
the state of adsorbed molecules, reaction intermedi- 
ates, and even the m i c r o p o r  s i t y .    -     
Other spec- 
troscopic methods such as visible and UV absorption 
and ESR are also used for the structure characteriza- 
tion, since they give indirect information about the 
bonding in heteropoly  o m p o  n d s .

conditions by apparently simple inorganic reactions

Unwanted side reactions and the presence of 
complex equilibria are possible, so caution must be 
taken during preparation in order to avoid hydrolytic 
decomposition 
of polyanions and nonhomogeneity of 
the metal cation to polyanion ratio in the solid. For 
instance, failure to recognize the hydrolytic instabil- 
ity of 12 molybdophosphoric acid and the formation 
of heteropoly species containing atomic ratios lower 
than 12 to 1 
has led to the development of incorrect 
preparative procedures and misleading physicochem- 
ical results. Good results were obtained by either 
extraction of acidified solutions of sodium molybdate 
and sodium phosphate,512 
or by a non-ether route, by 
boiling molybdenum trioxide and phosphoric a  i d .    ,

acids and their salts in aqueous and non aqueous 
solutions, are given in a number of reviews and 
papers.515-526 
In order to introduce an element into the frame- 
work during the synthesis of the heteropoly acid, it 
has to have ability to rapidly exchange coordination 
in solution between tetrahedral and octahedral;527 
it 
should have a smaller size than that required for 
octahedral coordinated oxygen anions, and finally, 
elements supporting a high positive charge are 
required. The first characteristic indicates the ne- 
cessity of having soluble precursors for the synthesis 
of the heteropoly anions. The high positive charge 
is required to avoid an excess of negative charge on 
the anion, while the small size of the framework 
atoms allows the structure to achieve a stable form. 
Strong ion-induced dipole forces between terminal 
oxygens and metal ions cause the exterior oxygens 
to be highly polarized toward the center of the 
complex, and consequently the protons are loosely 
attached, giving strong acidities. Moreover, 
it causes 
the good solubility in various solvents, and prevents 
condensation of the oxyanion monomers into infinite 
oxide lattices, giving 
instead discrete polyanions with 
definitive structures. Then, those requirements could 
be made more specific by noting that the framework 
atoms must have an ionic radius between 53 and 70 
pm and a charge >4+. 
In Table 14 the elements 
which meet those criteria are given. 
With respect to the stability of heteropoly com- 
pounds, it can be said that the nature of the central 
atom is critical for the stabilization of the primary 
structure. The larger the central atom, the more 
stable the heteropoly anion structure is.52s In the 
case of the secondary structures, water molecules 
connect the individual heteropoly anions through 
weak hydrogen bonds. In the case of [PW12O40l3-, its 
radius is only 5-6 8, while the spacing between ions 
is -23 A, 
leaving therefore a considerable space 
between ions. From this arrangement it is not 
surprising that porous structures of considerable 
surface area can be formed by the loss of some 
crystallization water. In this way, it has been 
shown529 
that the surface area of 1-12 molybdophos- 
phate H3[PMo120401 
increases from 0.1 to 10 m2 g-l 
when subjected to a moderate heat treatment in a 
dry He stream. 
The amount of water and therefore the porosity 
and thermal stability can be controlled by formation 
of salts with different cations. In this way, Niiyama 
et al.530 
have classified the salts into two groups on

the basis of their solubility (group I and 11). The so 
called group I1 is hydrophobic and involves large 
monovalent cations (Table E), 
which interact strongly 
with the anions, and maintain a rigid structure, 
which resists solvation in water at high tempera- 
tures. Water associated with the cation is held 
strongly until the decomposition temperature is 
reached. Under these conditions zeolitic water is the 
only water lost from the structure, this giving surface 
area over 100 m2 
g-l. In the case of salts of group I, 
hydration water is relatively easy to remove and then 
heteropoly ions are maintained close resulting in the 
absence of open pores and this gives surface area 
under 10 m2 g-l. 
The effect of the ion-exchange procedure on the 
pore structure and morphology of the heteropoly salts 
has been studied by McGarvey and M  f f a t ,     
by 
means of N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and 
X-ray powder diffraction. They have demonstrated 
that the ion-exchanged salts have microporous struc- 
tures, and the structure is retained after ion ex- 
change, and quantitative aspects of the structure are, 
for a given anion, largely controlled by the size and 
nature of the cation. It has to be remarked that the 
microporosity found in heteropoly oxometalates can 
play an important role in shape-selective catalysis. 
However, considering the textural r e s  l t s    ,   
one 
should not expect to control pore size to the same 
extent as in zeolites since heteropoly oxometalates 
suffer from the disadvantage of having relatively 
broad pore size distributions, and consequently, the 
fraction of the surface area with potential shape 
selective effects will be considerably smaller than 
expected in a solid with pores of similar and uniform 
cross section.532 
However, Bonardet et a1.533 
have 
recently investigated the microporosity of 12 poly- 
oxometalate salts by the 129Xe 
NMR method proposed 
by Ito and F r a i  s a r d ,     
and they confirmed for NH4+, 
K+, 
and Cs+ salts the presence of microporosity, and 
found that it is homogeneous and organized. This is 
generated by the introduction of certain cations 
which leads to the translation or the rotation of the 
Inorganic Solid Acids 
Keggin anions in such a way that the interstitial 
volumes become interconnected, creating homoge- 
neous microporosity in which nonpolar molecules 
such as Xe can be adsorbed.533 
It appears then, that the heteropoly acids salts of 
group I1 may offer interesting properties as catalysts 
considering their favorable textural properties. The 
group I heteropoly acid salts having the low surface 
area can be of interest in those reactions in which 
consecutive steps are to be avoided. In any case if 
required in large surface area form, they can be 
prepared by supporting the heteropoly acids on large 
surface area carriers.505,535-539 
However solid sup- 
ports with surface basicity should not be used in 
order to avoid decomposition of polyanions. 
2. Nature of Acid Sites 
The pH values of aqueous solution of heteropoly 
acids indicate that they are strong acids, and their 
strong acidity is related to the large size of the 
polyanion having a low and delocalized surface 
charge density, causing a weak interaction between 
polyanion and proton. They present strong acidic 
properties also in the solid state and are very 
sensitive to countercations as well as the constituent 
elements of p o l y a n i o n  .    -     
The origin of the 
acidity in heteropoly oxyanions is multiple (Table 16). 
In the case of heteropoly acids, protons are directly 
compensating for the negative charge of the anions. 
The states of proton and crystallization water in the 
acid form were studied by high-resolution solid-state 
31P 
NMR and IR,543 
and by lH NMR.544 
In the free 
polyanions in solution, bond length-bond strength 
correlations and 1

NMR545,546 
indicate that the 
preferred protonation sites are the bridging oxygen 
atoms which have a larger electron density than the 
terminal atoms. In solid state, as was mentioned 
above, the protons are involved in the formation of 
the crystal structure of the heteropoly acid, and in 
the protonation of the more accessible terminal 
oxygens leading to the H502+ 
species 
which links four 
neighboring heteropoly anions by forming hydrogen 
bonds with terminal W=O  oxygen:' 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 591 
In the case of metal salts, different mechanisms 
have been proposed to explain the origin of their 
acidity. In this way, and based on the correlation 
between catalytic activity of metal salts of dodecamo- 
lybdophosphoric acid in an acid catalyzed reaction (2- 
propanol dehydration) and the electronegativities of 
the metal cations (except for alkaline-metal salts), 
Niiyama et a1.548,549 
have proposed that water coor- 
dinated to metal cations (Mn+) 
can become hydrolyzed 
generating H+: 
Mn+ + 
mH,O - 
[M(H,O),I"+ - 
[M(H20),-,(OH)1"-1 + 
H+ 
However, this mechanism, probably valid for cat- 
ions with a large charge to size ratio, i.e., relatively 
acidic cations, fails to explain the nature of acid sites 
generated when cations with low electronegativity, 
such as Ag+, are introduced. Nevertheless, it has 
been observed that in salts with reducible cations 
such as Ag+ and Cu2+, 
the presence of HZ 
enhances 
the carboniogenic 
activity. This was attributed to the 
formation of protons after the following cation reduc- 
tion:550,551 
In the case of bulk dehydrated heteropoly anions 
it has been recently observed by 170 
NMR of solid 
molybdophosphate, that the terminal oxygen atoms 
are the predominant protonation sites in the dehy- 
drated solid.536

This was later proved by pyridine adsorption on

Before the H

 treatment only 
the IR band at ca. 1445 
cm-l associated to Lewis acid 
sites was observed, indicating the interaction of 
adsorbed pyridine with Ag+ and Cu2+ 
cations. The 
salts were then exposed for 1 
h at 5.7 and 7.1 kPa, 
and at 300 "C to Hz and after that evacuated. The 
IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine gave a band at ca. 
1535 cm-l from pyridinium ions, thus indicating the 
presence of Bronsted acid sites formed in the reduc- 
tion reaction (see above). 
The acid characteristics of heteropoly acids and 
their salts have been studied by many of the methods 
described above. Note that the acid strength of 
heteropoly acids cannot be determined by the indica- 
tor method, except for heteropoly tungstates which 
have only a weak color. In the case of 1-12 tung- 
stophosphoric acid HO 
> 8.2 was determined.553 
At 
present, many efforts are devoted to the character- 
ization of the acidic properties of heteropoly acids by 
means of adsorption and thermal desorption of basic 
 molecule- as well as by NMR.505 
Stepwise thermal desorption of pyridine showed 
that a significant amount of protons from the bulk 
was still retained on H3PW1204 at 573 K. On the 
other hand, no pyridinium ions were detected on 
amorphous silica-alumina at this temperature.557 
In 
general, the amount of acid sites in heteropoly anions 
has been titrated by  y r i d i n e   * -   O  
and ammonia.561 
Figure 24562 
shows the acidic properties of a series 
of heteropoly compounds measured by thermal de- 
sorption of pyridine absorbed at 25 "C. In those cases 
only pyridinium ions were detected, and the amount 
of pyridine hold by the solid after evacuation at 130 
"C agrees with the number of protons present in the 
free acids. Moreover, the change in the amount of 
pyridine retained by the solid at different desorption

temperatures gives an indication of the relative acid 
strength of the different compounds. 
It appears that partial substitution of H+ by Na+ 
decreases both the number and strength of the acid 
sites. In general, the acidity increases with increas- 
ing cation electronegativity. However, caution must 
be paid when the acidity of salts is compared since 
they are sensitive to slight changes in stoichiometry, 
reduction of the metal ion, hydrolysis during prepa- 
ration and the degree of hydration.563 
It appears then that heteropoly compounds have 
a relatively large number of strong acid sites (mainly 
of Bronsted type), which are accessible to bases. 
More specifically, it has recently been presented564 
that CSH-PWIZOO 
is a superacid and its perfor- 
mance can be modified by changing the extent of Cs 
substitution. Figure 25 provides a comparison of the 
relative acid strength of some solid superacids. 
Therefore, especially the high surface area materials 
should provide new opportunities for using them as 
solid acid catalysts in hydrocarbon reactions.

type catalysis. The former occurs on those com- 
pounds which are able to adsorb reactants only on 
the external surface. In this way hydrocarbons are 
adsorbed in amounts lower than that corresponding 
to the monolayer. In the case of bulk type 
catalysis, 
the heteropoly compound can take up polar molecules 
in amounts which correspond to more than 100 
surface 
In case the uptake of polar 
molecules such as alcohols, ethers, and amines gave 
integral multiples of the number of protons, and the 
rate of their adsorption was primarily determined by 
the polarity and secondarily by the molecular size 
(Figure 26).565 
The amount adsorbed can be con- 
trolled by changing the cation in the salts.567 
Considering 
the bulk adsorption properties, it turns 
out that catalytic reactions involving 
polar molecules 
occur not only at the surface but also in the bulk solid 
of certain heteropoly acids. The practical effect of 
this is that the catalytic system behaves like a highly 
concentrated solution. This explains why these solids 
have been named pseudo liquid. Under such 
circumstances all the acid sites are available to the 
reactants and therefore high catalytic activity could 
be expected. A schematic diagram of the two types 
of catalysis is given in Figure 27. The pseudoliquid 
phase is characterized by uniformity, mobility, three- 
dimensional reaction field, and other qualities which 
are very convenient in the study of the catalytic 
phenomena by using in situ characterization tech- 
niques. In this way, Misono and O k  h a r a     
have 
detected by NMR and IR spectroscopies several 
reaction intermediates during the dehydration of 
ethanol in pseudoliquid. The comparison of the 
chemical shift of the hydroxyl proton of the dimer 
species (C2H50H)2Hf detected in H3PW12040 and in 
HS03F-SbF5, supports the idea that H3PW12040 is 
a superacid. 
After all this it is not surprising that heteropoly 
compounds have found large and practical applica- 
tions in olefin and acetylene hydration, as well as in 
dehydration of alcohols.

Olefins. The dehydration of alcohols to give ethers

their salts. On these materials the diffusivities of 
different alcohols have been measured in a series of 
heteropoly acids and the results are compared to 
those obtained in a ZSM-5 zeolite (Table 17).531 
It 
has been observed there that the diffusivity of n- 
alcohols decreases with the decrease of their molec- 
ular weight, and furthermore the hydrogen bonding 
has a substantial influence on diffusivity. Indeed, 
while in ZSM-5 the pore size restriction may be 
dominant it is apparent that in the large-pore het- 
eropoly compounds the electric field potential plays 
an important role. 
As was said before, owing to the flexible nature of 
the acid forms and of some salts, alcohols are readily 
absorbed into the bulk by substituting water mol- 
ecules and/or by expanding the distance between 
polyanions. Under such circumstances the system 
behaves like a concentrated solution ("pseudoliquid 
phase"), and corresponds to a bulk-type catal- 
ysis.5609563,569-571 
If this is so, the reaction should take 
place in the three-dimensional bulk solid, and a 
catalyst effectiveness factor close to unity should be 
expected. Therefore, the rate of reaction should be 
proportional to the catalyst weight regardless of its 
specific surface area. Indeed, a linear correlation 
between the catalytic activity of a series of heteropoly 
compounds and their bulk acidity has been found and 
the results are given in Figure 28.560

By using ethanol-& and

conditions, there is a large number of ethanol mol-

catalyst bulk phase.

anion and protonated ether. On this basis the 
following reaction mechanism has been proposed:574 
Corma 
This mechanism is not only consistent with the 
general knowledge and with the intermediate species 
detected, but can also explain the 
depen- 
dence of ethylene and ether selectivities on the 
partial pressure of C2H50H.577,578 
The activity of heteropoly compounds in the alcohol 
dehydration reaction is much higher than that of 
s i l i  a - a l u m i n a    *     
and their activity strongly de- 
pends on the temperature of the pretreatment,580 
on 
the amount and nature of the cations in the salts,567,568 
and, if supported, on the nature of the support 
Indeed, the type of cation, size, and 
its electronegativity does not only change the number 
of acid sites but also can dramatically change the 
absorption capability of the original heteropoly acid 
causing, in the limit, the alcohol dehydratior, reaction 
to occur at the surface of the salt instead of in the 
bulk phase. Besides being a source of protons, the 
interaction between the reactant and the heteropoly 
anion of the catalyst can be important for the overall 
process, as demonstrated by the catalytic action of 
the chiral 2- 18 molybdophosphate. Indeed, this 
catalyst has been shown to promote the acid- 
catalyzed reaction of nonchiral benzyl alcohol to 
chiral plybenzyl. 
The chirality of the products 
shows that the interaction between the reactant and 
the heteropoly anion plays an important role in the 
formation of the final product. It has been reported 
that when heteropoly acids are supported on silica, 
alumina, or activated carbon, they strongly interact 
with the support surface thus changing their be- 
havior505,581-584 
and acting as a condensed solution 
at the surface of the support.585 
Recently, 
Hashimoto 
et al.583 
have obtained a supported heteropoly acid 
PW, highly dispersed by intercalation into a Zn 
aluminum carbonate hydroxide by an anion-exchang- 
ing technique. This was a very active catalyst for 
the dehydration of n-butanol having the turnover 
numbers for the intercalated PW/Zn-AI catalyst twice 
of the unsupported PW12 heteropoly acid. 
In conclusion, it turns out that heteropoly acids are 
very adequate alcohol dehydration catalysts, owing 
to their very special absorption properties for polar 
molecules. Furthermore, their activity and selectiv- 
ity can be tailored by introduction of metal cations 
and by changing the partial pressure of the reactant. 
There is no doubt that if a catalyst is highly active 
for a given reaction (dehydration), it should also be 
very active for the opposite reaction (hydration of 
olefins to alcohols), 
provided that the reaction condi-

tions are adequate. This basic catalytic principle is 
clearly illustrated by the case of heteropoly acids, on 
which industrial hydration processes of C3-C4 olefins 
have been developed (Table 18).586 
Using this type 
of catalysts, isopropyl alcohol was produced by hy- 
dration of propylene (Tokuyama Soda) 
with a conver- 
sion of 70% and selectivity of 99%.587-590 
The use of 
heteropoly acids in this process avoids the use of 
sulfuric acid, with the corresponding advantage in 
waste stream disposal. 
The hydration of isobutene is carried out selectively 
in the presence of n-butene in a highly concentrated 
aqueous solution (0.05-0.8 M) of 12 heteropoly acids 
at 60-80 "C. The isobutene hydration is so selective 
that it allows separation of butenes present in the 
C
4
 streams produced by steam or catalytic cracking. 
When the process is carried out in a multistage 
reactor, isobutene is 100% 
converted, while less than 
1% 
of the n-butene is hydrated. In this case the 
heteropoly acid not only acts as a strong acid catalyst 
but is also capable of increasing the solubility of 
butenes while stabilizing the reaction intermediates 
by the coordination to the p  l y a n i o n .     
The competi- 
tive coordination of isobutene, n-butene, and water 
to polyanions promotes the high selectivity for 
isobutene hydration. 
The kinetic expression for hydration of isobutene 
when using heteropoly acids as catalysts continu- 
ously increases from first to second order: 
rate = 
K[polyanion][protonl[isobutenel = 
= 
K[polyacid12[isobutenel 
While in the case of mineral acids a first-order 
dependence is found. 
Finally, it should be remarked that in this process 
the decomposition of heteropoly acid was suppressed 
by partial reduction of Mo or W and by coexistence 
of organic base with phosphoric acid, rendering the 
catalyst life longer and decreasing corrosion. 
Another way of separation of isobutene from mixed 
C4 hydrocarbon streams, such as Raffinate-1, 
involves 
the use of heteropoly acids in the etherification of the 
C
4
 mixture with diols, such as ethylene glycol or 1,2- 
propylene glycol, to obtain the corresponding glycol 
mono-tert-butyl ethers. This is followed by deetheri- 
fication of monoether at higher temperatures to yield 
pure isobutene and the regenerated

Esterification and Hydrolysis. Esterification of 
alcohols with saturated and unsaturated acids is a 
reaction of industrial importance. Liquid-phase acid 
catalysts such as sulfuric acid, 
p-toluenesulfonic acid 
(PTSA), 
methanesulfonic (MSA), hydrochloric acid, 
etc. have been used. They however produce waste 
products as well as undesired byproducts such as 
ethers and olefins. For certain esterifications, non- 
acidic tetrabutyltitanates and -zirconates produce 
lower amounts of byproducts than the liquid acids, 
but their activity is much lower than that of the 
Bronsted acids.593 In this sense heteropoly acids 
performed well for simple esterifications with car- 
boxylic a  i d s .    -     
Izumi and Urabe594 
have ob- 
tained 95% 
of conversion and 100% 
selectivity for the 
esterification of acetic acid with ethanol to form ethyl 
acetate, at 150 "C and 1 
atm. 
Heteropoly acids may have the following advan- 
tages compared to other catalysts: the absence of 
byproducts produced in reactions of the conjugated 
base of the acid; the high activity which allows one 
to work at low temperature; the possibility to adjust 
their acidity by varying the counterion or by varying 
the heteroatoms or metal atoms; and the possibility 
to recycle the catalyst by acidifymg the alkaline wash 
water followed by extraction with the feed alcohol. 
The catalytic activity for esterification is similar 
to that of HzS04 and PTS, suggesting that these 
catalysts were equally strong in solution due to the 
leveling effect of the basic reactant (Table 19).598 
However, for the hydrolysis of isobutyl propionate the 
catalytic activities of heteropoly acids were 60- 100 
times higher than those of H2SO4 and PTSA.598 
The performance of the heteropoly acids for esteri- 
fication of alcohols can be improved by supporting 
the heteropoly acids on activated carbon. This not 
only increases the catalyst life, 
but also the formation 
of the corresponding ether is remarkably sup- 
pressed.594 
Heteropoly acids were used as catalyst for the 
production of phthalic acid diesters in the acid 
catalyzed diesterification of phthalic anhydride and 
the corresponding alcohols. The reaction proceeds in 
two stages. For instance, in the diesterification of 
phthalic anhydride with 2-ethylhexan01:

The first step is a fast and complete reaction of the 
anhydride with one molecule of alcohol, proceeding 
without the addition of catalyst. The second stage 
is the esterification of the resulting monocarboxylic 
acid with a second molecule of alcohol while forming 
one molecule of water. The equilibrium is shifted by 
the continuous removal of water. 
The kinetics of the esterification reaction on het- 
eropoly acids is given by the following equation: 
and the reaction shows a lower activation energy on 
heteropoly acids than on HzS04 or PTSA. This allows 
the reaction to be performed at lower temperatures 
(100-120 "C) using the heteropoly acids catalyst with 
the corresponding low rate of formation of ethers and 
olefins. Ether formation depends on the structure 
of the alcohol, being lower for bulkier alcohols in 
agreement with a S N   
mechanism. On the other 
hand the size of the alcohol has little effect on the 
rate of esterificatin. 
In order to achieve better 
catalyst recovery, the reaction has been carried out 
on heteropoly acid supported on carbon, silica, alu- 
mina, and titania,599fj00 
but in all cases leaching of 
the heteropoly acid was found, together with a 
decrease in the catalyst activity. 
In conclusion, it appears that heteropoly acids are 
active and selective catalysts for carrying out both, 
esterification and hydrolysis reactions providing that 
reaction temperature could be kept low in order to 
diminish dehydration 
reactions. When this is achieved 
then the removal of water in order to shift the 
equilibrium becomes difficult unless the reaction is 
carried out at very low pressure, or in the presence 
of a cosolvent forming 
an azeotrope with water, which 
has lower boiling temperature.599 
Finally, complete 
recovery of the catalyst will be required if these 
reactions are to be used in practice. 
Isomerization Reactions. Double-bond isomer- 
ization in olefins is a well-known acid-catalyzed 
reaction which involves the Bronsted sites of the 
catalyst. For instance, in the case the double-bond 
isomerization of n-butene a protonation of the double 
bond occurs in an initial step and a see-butyl cation 
is frmed.Ol-O 
The heteropoly acid will be in this 
case a supplier of the acid site, and any acidity 
modification may affect the catalytic activity. It has 
been found604 
that the nature of the central atom (Si 
or P) has little influence on the activity of heteropoly

In this area the pioneer work was 
done by Sebulsky et a1.,610 
who reported the alkyla- 
tion of benzene with 1-dodecene on a bench scale 
using a series of supported silicotungstic acid cata- 
lysts, with the purpose of producing a precursor of a 
biodegradable linear alkyl benzene sulfonate. The 
use of a solid catalyst such as the supported het- 
eropoly acid should have sound environmental and 
technical advantages over more conventional cata- 
lysts such as aluminum chloride or hydrogen fluoride. 
Kinetic studies show that the following reactions 
occurred on the silicotungstic acid supported on 
A l 2 0 3 ,  SiO2, and SiO2-Al203:

molybdates, but it does have (Si < P) in the case of 
heteropoly tungstates. Interestingly, the value of the 
first reduction potentials of these compounds cor- 
relates very well with their catalytic activity (Table 
20), 
which may indicate that for heteropoly acids with 
the same peripheral atom the reduction potential 
may be, at least in this case, correlated with acidity. 
The importance of the acidity of the heteropoly acid 
in the relation to the rate of olefin isomerization is 
proven by increasing the electronegativity of the 
cation. However, for the acidic salts, the correlation 
is not so direct.604 
A more acid-demanding type of isomerization, is 
the isomerization of n-paraffins, and specially n- 
butane and n-pentane. The isomerization of n- 
butane is an important reaction since it produces 
isobutane which is a desirable reactant for the 
production of alkylation gasoline, as well as for the 
production of isobutylene required for methyl tert- 
butyl ether formation. The skeletal isomerization of 
n-butane involves the formation of a primary car- 
bocation as intermediate. In order to do this very 
strong acid sites, whose conjugated anion can stabi- 
lize the unstable primary carbocations are needed. 
Thus, SbF5-HF and oxide supported SbF5605,606 
are 
used to carry out that reaction. Heteropoly acids, 
especially the strongly acidic CSZ.HO.PWIZOO 
salt,607 
have been proven to be selective catalysts for the 
formation of isobutane. However, temperatures as 
high as 300 "C are required to be of practical use. 
In analogy 
with commercial 
bifunctional Pt catalyst 
on fluorinated alumina, Pd salts of heteropoly acids 
or Pd-heteropoly acid systems have been used for 
isomerizing n-pentane and n-hexane, in the presence 
of H2.608,609 
The total conversion of hexane and the 
distribution of the products in hexane isomerization 
over Pd salts of H3PW12040 
were much higher on the 
Pd salt than on the parent acid. In the case of 
pentane isomerization, 40% of conversion with 97% 
selectivity was obtained on the Pd salt at 180 "C. 
When the reaction temperature was increased to 200 
"C, the conversion strongly increased (92%) 
but the 
isopentane selectivity appreciably decreased (58%). 
The results were improved when the Pd-H3PW12040 
catalyst was supported on active carbon. 
These results indicate that the isomerization of 
short-chain alkanes on bifunctional catalysts based 
on heteropoly acids deserves further attention. 
Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation and Break- 
ing. Alkylation-Dealkylation of Aromatics. As 
was said above, the conventional acid Friedel-Crafts 
catalysts involving proton donor-promoted Lewis 
acids such as aluminum chloride-hydrogen chloride, 
and proton containing molecular sieves are active 
catalysts for the alkylation of aromatics with alcohols, 
olefins, and alkyl halides. Heteropoly acids and their 
salts have also been used to alkylate aromatics by

In other words, together with benzene monoalky- 
lation other undesired reactions leading to the for- 
mation of dimers and heavy alkylates also occur. The 
kinetic rate constants for the different reactions were 
obtained610 
(Table 
21), 
and the results clearly 
indicate 
that a second dodecyl alkyl group adds to the 
aromatic ring as rapidly as the first. Thus, the steric 
hindrance for the second alkylation does not seem to 
operate. Moreover, since the activation energies are 
also the same for the two reactions, it appears that 
the only control of selectivity can be done from the 
benzene to 1-dodecene 
ratio in the feed. In this way, 
a conversion of 99% and selectivity of 91% was 
obtained at 150 "C, at 14 atm of total pressure and a 
benzene to 1-dodecene 
ratio of 9.0. This result was 
indeed very promising, but the presence of heavy 
alkylates in the products (8%) 
indicates that some 
catalyst deactivation has already occurred.

When HzS04, 
AlC13, and acidic clays are used 
as catalysts the insertion of tert-butyl group into the 
ortho position of the p-xylene was very slow, and 
meta position was preferred.614 Results from Table 
22,614 
show that high selectivities are obtained when 
using H3PW12040 as catalyst. Moreover, with in- 
creasing of the acid strength of the heteropoly acid 
by increasing the valency of the central atom, the 
selectivity to BPX significantly increases, while the 
conversions of 2-methylpropene are at similar levels. 
It was mentioned before that the acidic and ad- 
sorption properties of heteropoly compounds can be 
modified by synthesizing different salts. The results 
of these changes are reflected in the alkylation of 
1,3,54rimethylbenzene by cyclohexene. For this 
reaction a Cs2.5H0.5PW12040 
was remarkably more 
active than H  P W   O  O .    ,     
This activity difference 
cannot be explained only on the basis of total acidity 
and acid strength distribution, and the higher hy- 
drophobicity of Cs salts with respect to the heteropoly 
acid form, with the corresponding beneficial adsorp- 
tion of nonpolar molecules such as aromatic and 
cyclohexene has been claimed as an additional activ- 
ity factor.617 On top of that, the soft basicity of the 
heteropoly anion,596 
which can be changed by the 
presence of Cs+, 
gives the system a special acid-base 
bifunctionality which enhances the catalytic activity 
of the heteropoly acid salt. The following scheme 
shows the acid-base bifunctional mechanism where 
polyanion stabilizes the cyclohexyl cation and/or the 
cyclohexyl 1,3,5-trimethyl proton from the latter 
cation:617

Since heteropoly acids can catalyze the alkylation 
of aromatics, they should also catalyze dealkylation 
and transalkylation. Indeed, Nowinska et a1.618 
have 
shown that 12 tungstophosphoric acid supported on 
y-Al203 and Si02 was active for cumene cracking at

Isoparaffins and Olefins. The 
increasing demand for high-octane paraffinic gaso- 
lines has compelled the refiners to look for the 
appropriate isoparaffin alkylation process. However, 
in order to widely expand such process the actual acid 
mineral catalysts, i.e. HF and H2S04 have to be 
substituted by solid acid catalysts. Owing to their 
strong acidities, heteropoly acids have been explored 
as potential catalysts for alkylation of isobutane with 
butene but the literature on this subject is scarce.620,621 
In these cases, K+, Rb+, Cs+, and NH4+ salts of 
tungstophosphoric heteropoly acid were preferred as 
catalysts and they could form tribranched products 
in good yields at relatively low temperatures (Table 
23). Moreover, it appears that they give better 
results than superacid S042-/Zr02 catalysts. How- 
ever, little is known about an important feature of 
alkylation catalysts such as the catalyst deactiva- 
tion-regeneration. The preliminary results621 
indi- 
cate that a strong deactivation of the catalyst can 
occur with time on stream. 
Isobutane alkylation is a field of sufficient interest 
to justify further research on the application of 
heteropoly acids and their salts, 
as insoluble catalysts 
or supported on SiOz, y-Al203, carbon, etc. The 
special hydrophobic-hydrophilic properties of het- 
eropoly acids as well as the stabilizing character of 
the polyanions can give, if properly tuned, interesting 
results. 
D. Sulfated Metal Oxides 
About 15 
years ago, it was shown that by a sulfate 
treatment of oxides such as ZrO2, TiOz, SnO2, Fe203, 
HfOz, etc., a remarkable increase in the surface 
acidity and in the catalytic activity for carbenium 
ion reaction of the starting metal oxides was 
a c h i e  e d .    -     
These catalysts were claimed to 
present superacid sites with acid strengths, mea- 
sured by the indicator method, of up to HO 
< -16.04 
which have opened new perspectives in the use of 
friendly solid catalyst for carrying out, under mild 
conditions, reactions involving 
very strong acid sites. 
In this section the preparation, acid characteristics, 
and the carboniogenic catalytic activity for hydrocar- 
bon reactions will be reviewed.

1. Preparation of Sulfated Metal Oxides 
Different procedures for preparation of sulfated 
metal oxides have been reported.622-628 
The sulfated 
metal oxides are usually prepared by first precipitat- 
ing the hydroxides, and after washing and drying, 
they are treated with a solution of H2S04. The 
treatments with (NHJ2S04, S02, H2S, and SO3 also 
promote the catalytic activity.626 
In the case of sulfate-treated superacids of Fe, Ti, 
Zr, Hf, and Sn, superacid sites were not created by 
the treatment of sulfate ion on the crystallized oxides 
but on the amorphous hydroxide forms followed by 
calcination and crystallization. However, in the case 
of superacid of Al203, better catalysts were obtained 
when the crystallized oxide rather than the amor- 
phous one was treated with HzS04.630 Thus, it 
appears that the nature of the starting metal oxide 
hydroxide,631 
as well as each one of the posterior 
treatments, can be of importance for the final proper- 
ties of the acid catalyst632 
and they will be discussed 
here. 
After the dried hydroxide is impregnated with a 
solution of H2S04 or (NH4)2S04, 
the resulting solid 
is dried and calcined to temperatures of 500-650 "C. 
A variable to be considered during the preparation 
is the normality of the H2S04 solution. Indeed, it has 
been f o  n d    -     
that the amount of sulfate adsorbed 
by the solid increases rapidly with the concentration 
of sulfuric acid in contact with the solid (Figure 29) 
and higher sulfur contents are obtained, for any 
calcination temperature, for higher H2S04 normali- 
ties, in the case of S042-/Zr02 catalysts (Figure 30). 
After H2S04 
impregnation, the calcination temper- 
ature of the resulting material also plays an impor- 
tant role on the subsequent textural, acidity, and 
catalytic 
The sulfated materials show 
larger surface areas than the pure metal 
(Table 24). 
The XRD spectra of SnO2,ZrO2, 
and T i 0 2  show the 
degree of crystallization of the sulfated oxides to be 
much lower than that of SnO2 without the sulfate 
treatment. Furthermore, the presence of sulfate638 
retards the conversion of the tetragonal to the mono- 
clinic form in the case of ZrO2, and from anatase to 
rutile in the case of TiO2. For instance, the XRD 
pattern of S042-/Zr02 heated at 650 "C was com- 
pletely a tetragonal form, while the pure ZrOz was

almost completely converted in the monoclinic 
In the case of TiO2, it is found that the temperature 
of crystallization or phase transformation of the 
anatase to rutile form in S042-/Ti02 is -200 "C 
higher than that of pure Ti02.639,640 
The slow down of the crystallization rate and phase 
transformation, together with the observed fact that 
samples with the sulfate treatment were cracked into 
fine particles in comparison to those of the samples 
without the sulfate treatment, can be the reason why 
specific surface areas of the catalysts are much larger 
than those of the oxides which have not undergone 
the sulfate treatment. 
At calcination temperatures above 650 "C the 
sulfated species start to decompose probably follow- 
ing the reaction:636

Indeed, the formation of SO2 by sulfate decomposi- 
tion has been detected for sulfated ferric oxide.641 
It can be concluded that the preparation of cata- 
lytically active sulfated oxides is not trivial, and the 
different preparation steps need to be optimized for 
each oxide: the starting salt and the precipitation 
procedure, the selection of the sulfating agent and 
procedure of sulfation, and calcination conditions.

2. Nature of Acid Sites 
Chemical Reviews, 1995, Vol. 95, No. 3 599 
metal oxide surfaces. Sulfate-promoted ZrO2 exhibit 
a strong IR band at 1370 cm-l which has been 
assigned to an asymmetric stretching vibration of 
S=O. The adsorption of pyridine caused a large shift 
in the S=O band to 1330 cm-l, which was ex- 
 l a i n e d     
by assuming that the sulfur complex in the 
highly acidic catalysts has a strong tendency to 
reduce the bond order of SO from a highly covalent 
double-bond character to a lesser double-bond char- 
acter when a basic molecule is adsorbed on its central 
metal cation. The strong ability of the sulfur complex 
with structure I1 to accommodate electrons from a 
basic molecule, 
i.e. to act as a Lewis site, is a driving 
force in the generation of highly acidic properties. 
However, chelation of the metal would leave it 
8-coordinated and not a Lewis acid site.632 Thus, 
while this scheme provides an illustration on the 
formation of active sites, it does not permit SO2 or 
SO3 to be eliminated from structure I1 without 
introducing problems with the oxidation states of the 
elements and compounds involved in the reaction:634 
Arata and Hino630 
have proposed a different struc- 
ture for the active site, in where sulfate bridges 
across two zirconium atoms: 
It was said above that much better catalysts are 
obtained with sulfated samples obtained from zirco- 
nium hydroxide rather than from zirconium oxide. 
Then, it can be assumed, in a first approximation, 
that the formation of acid sites involves a two-step 
chemikal reaction between the superficial hydroxyl 
groups of zirconium hydroxide and adsorbed H2S04: 
636 
first step: impregnation-drying step 
Zr,(OH),, + 
xH,SO, - 
second step: calcination above 400 "C 
Several 
observations support this reaction scheme.636 
In this way, the presence of S042- anions in the 
zirconia framework may explain the sintering resis- 
tance and the stabilization of the tetragonal phase. 
The existence of an optimum for the catalytic and 
ionizing properties as a function of the sulfur content 
may be due to the maximum covering of the hydrox- 
ide surface. However, the nature of the high acidity 
of the sulfated metal oxides is still controversial. 
Thus, several authors627,631,642-645 
have proposed that 
the very strong acidity is due to an increase in the 
number and strength of Lewis acid sites, and Yamagu- 
chiu3 
has offered the following scheme to describe 
the 
formation of an active catalytic site:

This author proposed that whatever the starting 
sulfur materials are, once they are oxidized at the 
surface of metal oxides, they form structure 1
1
.
 Thus 
the structure I1 is essential for the acid-catalyzed 
reactions as a common active site on the sulfur- 
promoted oxidized samples, and it is suggested that 
structure I1 may develop at the edge or corner of 
Bronsted acid site 
I 
This model implies the formation of Bronsted acid 
sites, and it has been observed by IR that there is 
an easy conversion of Lewis to Bronsted acid sites 
by sorption of water molecules. The presence of those 
Bronsted acid sites would allow catalytic reactions 
to occur at much lower temperatures with the same 
rate as they occur at higher temperatures without 
the presence of Bronsted sites. 
While the above structure is widely used to discuss 
the catalytic activity of these materials since it 
illustrates the presence of Bronsted and Lewis acid 
sites in the active catalyst, Davis et al.634 
have shown 
that it does not appear possible to make it conform 
with the chemical bonding, due to the valence or 
structural changes that occur during catalyst prepa- 
ration and activation by heat treatment. Indeed, 
when losing sulfur upon heating above 650 "C, the 
following reaction will occur depending on whether 
SO3 or SO2 is lost: 
The loss of SO2 implies the reduction of S6+ 
to S4+ 
with a corresponding oxidation of some Zr or 0 
species, but the authors634 
were unable to offer a 
scheme to illustrate that. 
In order to deal with those difficulties Clearfield 
et al.632 
have proposed the following scheme:

The authors proposed that in sulfuric acid media the 
predominant species is bisulfate. This ion could 
displace a single bridge. On heating, an adjacent 
hydroxyl could interact with the bisulfate ion to split 
out water leading to structure 11. However, the 
hydroxyl group could also interact with an adjacent 
OH bridge to split out water and leave the bisulfate 
ion intact. Thus strong Bronsted and Lewis acid sites 
would be present on that structure. The presence of 
both type of sites have, indeed, been seen by IR and 
pyridine adsorption measurements,644 
and it has been 
proposed that Bronsted acid centers can be present 
only if sulfates, and possibly polysulfates, are present 
on the top terminations of the scale-like ZrO2 
crystallites, i.e., on regular patches of low index 
crystal planes. 
With respect to their acidity CO adsorption at room 
temperature led to an IR spectrum with a peak at 
2200 cm-l characteristic of CO adsorbed on strong 
acid sites.642,647,648 
Large H-1 
chemical shifts suggest 
that the sulfated zirconia catalyst presents protonic 
superacidity, this property being related to the 
structure of surface sulfated species.649 
Most of the 
measurement using indicators show that these ma- 
terials fall in the superacidity region. However, this 
has been contested by Hall et al.,650 
claiming that 
they have not observed superacidity on sulfated 
zirconia catalysts. The limitations of Hammett's 
indicators for measuring the acid strength of sulfated 
oxides have been presented by several a  t h o r s    ,     
who have shown that even the nonsulfated ZrO2 is 
already in the superacid region using the Hammett 
indicator technique, while it is inactive for butane 
isomerization. 
Recently, Lin and Hsd9 have proposed a new 
approach for detecting superacidity on these catalysts 
by means of temperature-programmed desorption of 
substituted benzenes. Using such a procedure it was 
shown that sulfated zirconium oxides present super- 
acid sites. However, the method has been contested 
by Jatia et a1.,62 
who have shown that the TPD peak 
used by the former authors59 
to claim superacidity 
comes from C02, S02, and 0 2  
formed by oxidation of 
adsorbed benzene on the samples. 
Very recently Vedrine et al.652 
introduced a new 
model for S042-/Zr02 
catalyst which indicates that 
the acidity does not fall in the superacidity range but 
corresponds to that of H2S04. The authors indicate 
that from the IR spectra of S042-/Zr02 activated at 
600 "C and 2 wt % sulfur content, one can see the 
SO3 species associated to 1387 and 1027 cm-' bands 
corresponding to a Lewis site with a band at 1459- 
1464 cm-l for adsorbed pyridine. This so3 species 
was reversibly transformed upon water adsorption 
into adsorbed H2S04 species associated to 1320,1200, 
and 1055 cm-l bands and to pyridinium species at 
1542 cm-l. On these bases, the authors have pro- 
posed the following equilibrium to occur: 
(SO3Iads 
+ H20

(H,SO,),d, 
H3O+ f 
(HSO,-),d, 
(HsO,-),d, + 
HzO 
H30+ f 
(sO:-),d, 
This is supported by theoretical calculations using 
molecular complex models which show that sulfated 
zirconia corresponds to HzS04 on ZrO2 with an acid 
strength about equal to that of HzS04, which is in 
the lower limit of s  p e r a c i d i t y .    .     
This model, 
while very suggestive, needs to take into account the 
role of the metal which undoubtedly indicates that 
there is a direct correlation between the acid strength 
of the S042-/M02 
catalyst and the electronegativity 
of the metal, in such a way that the following order 
of acid strength has been observed:639,654-656 
so42-/ 
ZrO2 > S042-/Sn02 > S042-/Ti02 > S042-/Fe203 > 
In order to increase both acidity and stability, 
complex oxides have been sulfated. In this way it 
has been shown that the introduction of a small 
amount of W03 
in S0d2-/Zr02 
not only enhances the 
acid strength of the catalyst but also introduces 
Bronsted acidity. This indicates that Bronsted acid- 
ity may result in this system from the OH groups 
bonded to tungsten atoms on the catalyst surface 
through the following structure:657

In this case, W03 
and S042- cooperate 
to enhance the 
acidity of ZrO2. 
One limitation of sulfated oxide solid acids is their 
lack of stability, and the improvement of this is of 
paramount interest for future catalytic applications. 
In this sense, a new class of solid superacids, sulfated 
metal oxides containing Fe, Mn, and Zr have been 
d e  e l o p e d ,    -   l  
which shows higher stability than 
sulfated ZrO2, while are able to isomerize n-butane 
at near room temperature with a rate 3 orders of 
magnitude greater than sulfated zirconia. These 
results have been reproduced by Jatia et a1.62 
who 
also found that the addition of either Fe or Mn 
Inorganic Solid Acids 
increases the catalytic activity with the Fe impreg- 
nated sample showing an order of magnitude greater 
activity than the Mn impregnated material. The 
combination of Fe and Mn enhances the catalytic 
activity over the singly impregnated solids and the 
sulfate concentration plays an important role in 
optimizing the activity of the doubly impregnated 
zirconia. 
In conclusion, it can be said that a new type of solid 
acid catalysts with relatively high surface areas and 
strong acidities are obtained by treating some transi- 
tion metal oxides by HzS04 or (NH4)2S04. The acid 
strength could be controlled by changing the elec- 
tronegativity of the metal as well as by introducing 
multimetal systems. Both types of acid sites, Bron- 
sted and Lewis, are present on these catalysts, and 
they remain stable at temperatures up to 600 "C. 
The 
acidity and surface area strongly depend on the 
preparation procedure, i.e. impregnation, and calci- 
nation. Finally, the exact nature of the acid sites is 
still controversial, and it even is questioned if super- 
acid sites, i.e. sites with acidity higher than 100% 
H2S04, are really formed. Nevertheless, they are 
very active catalysts for carboniogenic reactions and 
this aspect will be discussed below. 
Superacid Oxides. Another way to overcome the 
unstability of the sulfated oxide catalysts at high 
temperature is to try to develop strong acidity on 
nonsulfated promoted oxides. In this sense it has 
been 
h
o
n

,

 
that ZrO2 has weak acid sites which 
are able to catalyze carbenium ion reactions such as 
double-bond isomerization, dehydrations, etc., and 
the acidic characteristic of the oxide depends on 
preparation and calcination conditions. However, 
Arata and Hino664-667

ing Zr(OH)4

or molybdic acid 
(H2Mo04) dissolved in ammonia water followed by 
drying and calcination at 600-1000 "C. As it oc- 
curred in the case of sulfated ZrO2, it has to be 
avoided the crystallization of ZrO2 from Zr(OH)4. 
Consequently, the hydroxide should not be heated at 
temperatures above 300 "C. 
The interaction of W or Mo with ZrO2 during 
calcination retards the evolution of the tetragonal 
form, as occurred with the introduction of S042-. 
However, with W and Mo the crystallographic phase 
transformation of ZrO2 is completely a tetragonal 
form when calcining up to 900 "C and a monoclinic 
form after calcination at 1000 "C. It would appear 
then that tungsten and molybdenum oxides combine 
with zirconium oxides to create superacid sites at the

WOdZr02 and MoOJZrOz catalysts are larger then 
those of pure ZrO2 (Table 
Moreover the 
optimum amount of W (13 wt %) and Mo (6.6 wt %) 
which strongly interacts with ZrO2 is equivalent to 
the amount of S (2.2 wt %) that as the sulfate, 
strongly interacts with ZrO2 in monolayer. All these 
facts are a clear indication that the type of interac- 
tion, and species formed cannot be too different from 
those obtained on S042-/Zr02 catalysts. 
3. Hydrocarbon Reactions on Superacids Oxides and 
Sulfated Oxides 
Dehydration of Alcohols and Hydration of 
Olefins. Dehydration of alcohols is a reaction which 
does not need strong acid sites. In fact the relatively 
weak acid sites present in untreated ZrO2 are able 
to carry out this type of 
in a very 
selective way. Practical use has been made of the 
selectivity of ZrO2 and other pure oxides for dehydra- 
tion of alcohols; and for instance, Koei chemicals 
obtains allylamine by the selective dehydration of 
1-amino-2-propanol using ZrO2 as catalyst:676

H2NCH,CH=CH2 + 
H20 
As was said above, the Sod2- 
treatment of oxides 
produces a decrease in the amount of weak acid sites 
while new very strong acid sites are formed. Then, 
since in the case of alcohol dehydration all weak and 
strong acid sites can be active, it can be expected that 
the activity should correlate with the total number 
of acid sites better than only with the number of the 
very strong. For instance when the catalytic activity 
for 2-propanol dehydration of a series of TiO2, TiO2- 
Si02 and S042-pl'i02, 
and S042-/Ti02-Si02 
catalysts 
was compared it was found that although the acidity 
of so42-/Tio2 is the highest, its catalytic activity is 
relatively 
S042-/Fe203 catalysts have also 
been used to dehydrate ethanol, 2-propanol, and 
2-butanol at 170-250 0C,678-680 
showing a higher 
activity than amorphous silica-alumina, and much 
higher activity that the Fez03 in the absence of Sod2-. 
One advantage of S042-/metal oxide catalysts is that 
it is possible, in some cases, to combine the acidic 
properties of the sulfated catalyst with the oxidation 
activity of the metal oxides to carry out, in one pot, 
dehydration and oxidation reactions. For instance, 
cyclohexanol is dehydrated and oxidized on so42-/ 
SnO2 catalysts to give high yields of cyclohexanone 
(Table 26).678 
The results show that the amount of 
cyclohexanone formed was increased by the sulfate 
treatment and the addition of water, and selectivities 
to cyclohexanone higher than 95% 
could be obtained. 
If the strong acidities of sulfated oxides do not 
present any advantage with respect to dehydration

of alcohols, it can however be of interest to catalyze 
the hydration of olefins since at low reaction tem- 
peratures the equilibrium composition favors the 
formation of alcohol. Indeed, high activities and 
selectivities to ethanol were obtained during hydra- 
tion of ethylene on S042-/Zr02 and TiOz-ZnO con- 
taining small amount of S042- 
catalysts. The main 
inconvenience of sulfated oxides as hydration cata- 
lysts is their gradual deactivation owing to the loss 
of S042- 
by dissolution in water occurring during the 
reaction. The results given in Figure 31681 
indicate 
that higher yields and selectivities of ethanol are 
obtained at low temperatures, but oxidative dehy- 
drogenation of the alcohol occurred at higher tem- 
peratures on S042-/Sn02 catalysts. 
Esterification and Acylation Reactions. Es- 
terification of organic acids and alcohols is a type of 
reaction which is not highly demanding from the 
point of view of acid strength and can be catalyzed 
by relatively weak acid sites present in unsulfated 
Zr02.682 Sulfation of ZrO2 strongly decreases the 
activity for the esterification of acetic acid and 
methanol due to the decrease in total amount of acid 
sites. On the other hand, the formation of very 
strong acid sites during the sulfation can also cata- 
lyze the dehydration of the alcohol giving the corre- 
sponding olefin.683,684 
The extent of the side reaction 
will be decreased by diminishing the electronegativity 
of the metal to be sulfated. In Table 27685 
it is shown 
that the initial activity of S042-/Ti02 is the highest 
of any catalyst studied, but it decays rapidly with 
time. Indeed, after 2 h of use the activity of so42-/ 
Ti02 is already lower than that of niobic acid, which 
on the other hand remain unchanged after 60 h of 
use. The deactivation of S042-/Ti02 has also been 
observed during the esterification of phthalic acid 
with n-octyl alcohol, and the decay was associated 
to the elimination of sulfate ion on the surface. At

the same time if the calcination temperature of the 
S042-/Zr02 
catalyst was increased by 150 "C, the 
activity remained unchanged for the repeated opera- 
tion without observing sulfate elimination owing to 
a stronger sulfate-metal i n t e r a  t i o n .

esterification reactions studied using S042-/Ti02 
and 
S042-/Zr02 
as catalysts are ethanol and acrylic acid, 
and methanol and salicylic a  i d .    ,     
In conclusion, it appears that sulfated oxides are 
not the most adequated catalysts for esterification 
reactions since the most stable S042-/Zr02 
catalysts 
are less active and selective than others such as 
niobic acid and supported heteropoly acids, while 
other more active and selective such as S042-/Ti02 
are rapidly deactivated due to the loss of so42-. 
In the case of Friedel-Crafts acylations the reac- 
tion can be performed with an acid chloride, an 
anhydride, or an organic acid as acylating reagents 
and with AlC13 as catalyst but used in stoichiometric 
amounts. Thus, the disadvantages of this catalyst 
due to wastes and corrosion problems have been tried 
to be overcome by the use of S042-/Zr02, 
which has 
very strong acid sites needed for this reaction. A 
direct correlation between acylation activity and 
concentration of the very strong acid sites has been 
found on S042-/Zr02 catalysts. Indeed, the results 
from Figure 32686 
show that different calcination 
temperatures of 823 and 873 K for samples prepared

On the basis of the strong acidity of S042-/Zr02, 
it 
has been used as catalyst for acylation of o-chlo- 
robenzoyl chloride with chlorobenzene and its activity 
is superior to that of any other known inorganic solid 
oxide base catalyst, and H Z S O  :     
Indeed, results from Figure 33 clearly show that 
S042-/Zr02 is more active that either HzS04 acid or 
zeolites. 
The use carboxylic acids as acylating agents is of 
great interest, but it should be considered that in that 
case acid sites stronger than HO 
= -15 are needed 
for the formation of the acylium cation (RCO+). If 
one takes into account that acid sites of HO 
= -16 
have been found on S042-/Zr0 
it is not surprising 
that it has been found to be able to carry out 
acylations of toluene using anhydrides and carboxylic 
acids, with the order of r e a  t i v i t y   '     @   
(PhC0)ZO 
> PhCOzH > PhCOaEt > PhCOzMe. 
Contrary to what has been observed on FeS04, in 
the case of S042-/Zr0 
the acylation reaction com- 
pletely stopped when the solid catalyst was separated 
from the reaction mixture. Thus, it appears that 
S042-/Zr02 acts as a true heterogeneous acid cata- 
lyst.686 When the electronegativity of the metal 
changes, the activity of the sulfated catalyst for the 
acylation reaction also changes. In this sense while 
the sulfated A 1 2 0 3  is active for benzoylation of 
benzene with both benzoyl chloride and benzoic acid, 
its activity is smaller than that of S042-/Zr0.68s 
The 
authors suggest that the benzoyl cation (PhCO+) 
from 
a benzoyl chloride molecule is generated on a Bron- 
sted site created by adsorption of water on Lewis sites 
of the catalyst. 
In conclusion, sulfated zirconia appears as a very 
promising solid catalyst for carrying out acylation 
reactions. However, questions related to catalyst 
lifetimes remain unanswered. 
Isomerization Reactions. Cis-trans and double- 
bond isomerization of butenes are catalyzed by Bron- 
sted acid sites of relatively low acid strength, being 
the reaction intermediate a sec-butyl cation formed 
by the addition of the proton. The same intermediate 
is often involved in the case of Lewis solid acids, but 
in this case protonic acid is induced by the reaction 
of the olefin on the Lewis acid site. Due to the low 
acid demand of this reaction, it appears that sulfated 
oxides would not be the most adequate catalysts, and 
the studies of isomerization of olefins on them are 
scarce. In the case of S042-/Fe03 
the IR of adsorbed 
1-butene has provided information on the nature of 
interaction between the olefin and the sulfated 
catalyst.689 Thus, upon adsorption at room temper- 
ature, the presence of C=C stretching and CH3 
bending vibration in the 1400-1700 cm-l region 
indicate that 1-butene adsorbs molecularly, probably 
forming a n 
complex.690 
When increasing the tem- 
perature to 420-520 K, the original peak disappears 
and new broad peaks appear in 1550-1700 cm-' 
region which may indicate the formation of n-allyl 
intermediates. If this is so, it is then possible that 
1-butene adsorbs on Fe site (Lewis acid site) 
forming 
an allyl species between 420 and 520 K. When the 
sample is heated further in He flow some of the 
adsorbed 1-butene 
does not simply desorb but reacts 
with the sulfate ion to promote its decompositin. 
Hence an IR band at 1350 cm-l appears to be due to 
the following intermediate of the sulfate decomposi- 
tion: 
It appears then that if the olefin isomerization 
reaction is carried out at temperatures above 520 K 
there is the possibility that catalyst deactivates by 
chemical decomposition of sulfate groups. 
The cis-trans isomerization of 2-butene has been 
used as a test reaction to evaluate the acidity of NiO- 
Ti02 treated by different mineral 
based on 
the idea that the activity increases either with 
increasing acid strength and/or acid amount. In that 
case the high catalytic activities of modified catalysts 
were correlated with the increase of acid strength by 
the different inductive effects of the anions of the 
treating acids, which follow the order of acid strength 
and catalytic activity: s

If olefin isomerization is an uninteresting reaction 
to be catalyzed by sulfated superacid catalysts, the 
branching isomerization of short chain n-alkanes is 
of practical interest. Indeed, the reaction of isomer- 
ization of n-butane to isobutane, is carried out 
commercially 
on chlorinated aluminas. Due to ther- 
modynamic reasons, it is of interest to carry out the 
reaction at temperatures as low as possible, and this 
would be achieved by using superacids as catalysts. 
When n-butane is reacted in a liquid superacid, 
molecular H2, methane, and ethane are observed as 
reaction products. Their formation is explained by 
the attack of a H+ 
either to a C-H or a C-C bond to 
form a carbonium ion, in which the incorporated H+ 
forms a two-electron three-center intermediate, and 
this intermediate liberates one hydrogen or an alkane 
molecule and leaves a carbenium ion. This carbe- 
nium ion may undergo skeletal rearrangement and 
yield alkane isomers:692

In the case of solid superacids of the sulfated oxide 
type, n-butane is selectively isomerized to isobutane 
at reaction temperatures up to 150 "C. On the basis 
of the idea that intermediate carbenium, but no 
carbonium ions, can lead to branching isomerization, 
it has been proposed that it is an abstraction of 
hydride ion by a Lewis acid site which initiates the 
reaction to form a butyl carbenium ion, followed by 
the methyl migration to yield a 2-methylpropyl 
carbenium ion, and finally isobutane is formed by the 
addition of hydride ion to a carbenium ion.693 
These 
conclusions were confirmed by deuterium tracer 
 investigation. However, as was seen for zeolites, 
isobutane can also be formed through an oligomer- 
ization-cracking 
mechanism which can also be carried 
out on Bronsted acid sites. 
In the case of sulfated oxides, which can isomerize 
n-butane even at room temperature, both types of 
acid sites, i.e. Bronsted and Lewis acid sites, have 
been detected by pyridine adsorption. Even though 
there is still discussion on the type of active site 
involved in the isomerization of n-butane on these 
catalysts, it appears that the presence of both types 
of sites are necessary for the reaction to occur. In 
fact, it has been suggested that the superacidity may 
arise from the presence of Bronsted sites whose 
acidity is enhanced by the presence of strong neigh- 
boring Lewis acid sites.633,636 
These conclusions are 
supported by the correlation between acidity and 
catalytic activity, and the maximum rate for n-butane 
transformation is found to correspond to a Bronstedl 
Lewis ratio, measured from the intensity of pyridine 
IR bands, close to 1, 
hence to the monolayer of sulfur 
species. Moreover, it has been 
that in the 
presence of excess of water (e.g. 0.6 x lo3 
Pa partial 
pressure) the activity of a S042-/Zr02 
catalyst for 
n-butane isomerization dropped to zero. Further- 
more, if no water was present in the reaction media, 
by drying the n-butane by passing through a molec- 
ular sieve column, the activity was also shown to 
decrease by 20% to 30%. If the normal feed, contain- 
ing traces of water, was used again, the catalytic 
activity was recovered. On the other hand Pinna et 
al.'jg4 
have claimed on the basis of selective and 
reversible CO adsorption results that strong Lewis 
acid sites from S042-/Zr02 intervene in the isomer- 
ization of n-butane since CO selectively poisons Lewis 
acid sites and in parallel the activity drops to zero. 
Activity is recovered upon desorption of CO. 
After all these results, one is tempted to compare 
the behavior of S042-/Zr02 
with that of HF-SbF5 and 
A
c
1
3
.
 In the case of the HF-SbF5 superacid system, 
this also involves both Bronsted and Lewis acid sites 
with their ratio equal to one. In the case of MC13 
which is very active for n-paraffin isomerization, it 
requires the presence of low amounts of moisture to 
proceed as catalyst. When small amounts of H20 
are 
present in the reaction media, some of the AC13 
molecules become hydrolyzed and the final catalytic 
system consists of HC1-AlCl3, which again contains 
Bronsted-Lewis acid sites. 
Finally, it is worth pointing out that at high 
hydrogen pressures an inhibition of the rate of 
isomerization occurs. This property is consistent 
with a mechanism involving Bronsted sites.695 
Thus, it can be concluded that the variables in 
catalyst preparation which were shown above to 
control acidity of these systems are also going to 
control the catalytic activity for n-butane isomeriza- 
One of the important variables which controls 
acidity in sulfated oxides catalyst preparation is the 
nature of the oxide. In this sense, S042-/Zr02 
is more 
active than S042-/Ti02 catalyst.623 An increase in 
catalyst stability, surface acidity, and, therefore, 
catalytic activity for n-butane isomerization has been 
obtained by Hsu et al.658-660 
by using a sulfated oxide 
containing iron, manganese and zirconium. The 
sulfated zirconia promoted with iron and manganese 
is capable of isomerizing n-butane to isobutane at 
near room temperature with rates approximately 
2-3 orders of magnitude greater than sulfated zir- 
conia.62j660 
Unfortunately, the isomerization activity of sul- 
fated oxide catalysts decreased along the time on 
stream due to catalyst decay. It has been pre- 
sented696,697 
that catalyst deactivation occurs not only 
by coke deposition but by reduction of the oxidation 
state of sulfur in the surface complex. High H
2
 
pressures can inhibit coke deposition and prolong the 
life of the catalyst.698 
This was much prolonged by 
preparing a bifunctional catalyst by supporting Pt on 
S042-/Zr02, 
and introducing H
2
 in the reaction media. 
Bifunctional Sulfated Oxide Catalysts. The 
isomerization of n-butane, as well as n-pentane and 
n-hexane which form the light straight run (LSR) 
gasoline, are important reactions in the refinery. 
Those isomerizations are commercially carried out on 
bifunctional catalysts containing chlorinated alumina 
as the acid component and Pt as the dehydrogenat- 
ing-hydrogenating function. In the case of LSR Pt/ 
zeolites, 
they are also used commercially owing to the 
higher stability presented by zeolitic catalysts to the 
presence,of some water and sulfur in the feed. 
However, the lower acid strength of zeolites with 
respect to chlorinated alumina requires the use of 
-100 "C higher reaction temperatures in the former 
with the corresponding decrease in branched prod- 
ucts and therefore on the octane of the resulting 
product. Taking all this into account it could be 
expected that S042-/Zr02 
catalyst containing P
t
 
could 
act as an adequate isomerization catalyst for n- 
butane and LSR, since it can work at low tempera- 
tures and it is not poisoned by traces of water in the 
feed. Indeed, high conversions for isomerization of

CdCs have been reported using Pt-S042-/Zr02 cata-

The addition of Pt produces a strong in- 
crease in catalyst duration at 140 "C, 
20 kg cm-2 total 
pressure and a molar ratio of H
2
 to n-Cs equal to 1-5. 
On these catalysts, Pt exists in the metallic state in 
reasonable large crystals and no detectable change 
in the valence state of Pt occurs during catalyst 
use.7oo H2 also plays a role on keeping the activity 
since even in absence of Pt the catalyst deactivation 
is significantly reduced if the H
2
 pressure is high 
enough.698 
However the role of H
2
 may not be limited 
to avoid deactivation by hydrogenating hydrogen- 
deficient poison precursor,699 
and Ebitani et al.701 
have presented the possibility of H2 intervening in 
protonic acid sites generation. These authors claim 
that protonic acid sites can also be originated from 
molecular hydrogen. To explain this they suggest 
that molecular hydrogen dissociates on the Pt to 
hydrogen atoms which undergo spillover on the 
S0d2-/Zr02 and convert to an H+ and e- or H-, the 
H+ acting as catalytic site for acid catalyzed reac- 
tions. In this case the Lewis acid sites would act as 
acceptors of an H- or e-, and as a result of that the 
Lewis acid site is weakened. This suggestion was 
made on the basis of the observation that when 
n-pentane isomerization was carried out in a N2 
stream no conversion was obtained, while a conver- 
sion was obtained when the gas switched 
to hydrogen 
(Figure 34).701 
An 
important fact observed by Ebitani 
et al. is that the bifunctional catalysis, if any, is very 
small on Pt-S042-/Zr02 catalysts, and therefore the 
role of Pt will not be to carry out the dehydrogena- 
tion-hydrogenation of paraffins as it occurs in a 
conventional bifunctional catalyst. If this is so, we 
can oversee another mechanism to explain the role 
of H
2
 on these catalysts during alkane isomerization. 
Indeed, we have presented very recently702 
that on 
monofunctional acid catalysts, on the basis of zeolites, 
at lower reaction temperatures the controlling step 
can be the desorption of the carbocations. Then, 
under these circumstances, H
2
 can act as a hydrogen 
transfer agent which facilitates the desorption of 
organic cation while regenerating the acid site. The

The final result was also an increase on the ratio

When Pt was introduced on the catalyst, a much

ing the above reaction. The kinetic results obtained

zeolites which have weaker acid sites (shorter aver- 
age lifetime of carbocations) and good hydrogen 
transfer activity, one should expect it to occur even 
more so on the S042-/Zr02 type catalyst. 
Our model would also be supported by the result

the addition of small amounts of adamantane (which 
increases hydride transfer and carbenium ion termi- 
nation rates) to n-heptane increases isomerization 
rates by a factor of 3 and inhibits undesirable 
cracking reactions. In their case, dihydrogen also 
acts as a hydride source in alkane isomerization 
catalysis but it requires the additional presence of 
metals which can catalyze H2 dissociation. 
In conclusion, it could be postulated that when Pt 
is introduced in S042-/Zr02 superacid catalysts and 
H
2
 is used in the reaction, not only the life of catalyst 
is longer but also better activities and selectivities 
are achieved, by decreasing the average lifetime of 
the carbocations on the surface, due to the presence 
of activated H
2
 which acts as a hydride transfer 
agent. For practical applications, the catalyst should 
retain activity for at least a one year period and 
should be regenerated afterward. 
Reactions Involving Formation and Cracking 
of C-C Bonds. Owing to the strong acid sites 
present on sulfated oxides, they have been tested as 
possible alternatives of HF and H2S04 for alkylation 
of paraffins and olefins. In this way they have been 
used to react methane and ethylene to produce CB 
to 
C7 products705 
or, more importantly from a practical 
short-term point of view, to alkylate isobutane and 
butene to produce alkylation gaoline.O-O 
Calcina- 
tion temperature plays an important role on acid 
properties and therefore on alkylation activity. It 
was found (Figure 35)706 
that a maximum in alkyla- 
tion occurs at calcination temperatures of 650 "C 
for 
S042-/Zr02 and 550 "C for S 0 4 2 - / T i 0 2 .  
However, it has been f o  n d    t     
that on s0k2-/ 
Zr02, together with alkylation of isobutane and 
butene, oligomerization of butene and cracking of 
alkylate products also occur on these catalysts. The 
recracking of alkylates can be decreased by decreas- 
ing the reaction temperature (Figure 36), and high 
activity and selectivity to the desired trimethylpen- 
tanes is obtained on sulfated zirconia catalyst, with

deactivation were observed. 
In conclusion, superacid sulfated oxides are active 
and selective catalysts for performing alkylation of 
isobutanehutene 
at 
low temperatures. The behavior 
of S042-/Zr0z is not very different from that of Hz- 
SO4, with the indication that for this reaction the 
catalyst may be acting as "supported sulfuric acid". 
If sulfated oxides are able to carry out C-C bond 
formation, they should also catalyze the reverse 
reaction, i.e. C-C bond rupture. In this sense and 
as has been found for any of the reactions described 
up to now, a correlation exits between calcination 
temperature (acidity) and cumene cracking. Again, 
two different maxima were found for S04Z-/ZrO 
and 
S04z-/Ti0,

results better than those obtained on zeolite cata-

as an alkylation catalyst, and this is rapid deactiva- 
tion.?07 We have tried to change the product distri- 
bution and catalyst life by modifying reaction condi- 
tions, as well as the acid strength of the catalyst. The 
latter was done by changing the nature of the 
sulfated oxide. Results from Figure 37,109

of sulfated zirconia, titania, SnOz, Fez03, and

In the case of paraffin cracking, hexadecane has 
been used as a representative test molecule of the 
long-chain alkanes present in gasoil feeds. Practi- 
cally all the reported s t u d i e  '   J '   
conclude that 
sulfated zirconia was much less active than a similar 
material containing P

,
 
and cracking increased with 
both reaction temperature and reaction time. 
Two aspects on the behavior of Pt-S042-/ZrO 
catalysts for hydrocracking of long chain n-alkanes 
are worth pointing out. The first one is that despite 
the presence of very strong acid sites it is possible to 
obtain up to 70% of the hydroisomerized products 
with two or more alkyl substituents, 
provided that a 
low enough reaction temperature is used. When the 
reaction temperature is increased above 100 "C, 
hydrocracked products strongly increase with a very 
high selectivity for isoparaffin products. It appears, 
therefore, that on the catalysts n-hexadecane is first 
isomerized into multibranched products which are 
then cracked more easily: 
n-paraffin= 
n-paraffin+= 
branched paraffin's cracked products 
tl 
desorbed branched paraffins 
The second aspect to be noticed is that the cracked 
products are shifted on F't-S042-/ZrO 
toward long- 
chain products. The amount of long-chain cracked 
products (2'28) obtained on S042-/Zr0 
is much 
greater than on either amorphous silica-alumina or 
with the ratio of CJc16-n (n > 8) much 
larger on the former. This supports the idea that 
together with cracking, addition and, specially, oli- 
gomerization reactions also occur:634

In conclusion, it appears that it is worth investi- 
gating the possibilities of these catalysts for hydroi- 
somerization and hydrocracking of long-chain par- 
affins and waxy products, in the sense that they 
allowed the reaction to be performed at lower tem- 
peratures with the benefits in formation of branched 
products. In the case of catalytic cracking we do not 
oversee practical possibilities due to their relatively

low thermal and hydrothermal stability which do not 
allow regeneration by coke burning in the presence 
of steam. 
Other Reactions Requiring Superacids Sites 
Carried Out on Sulfated Oxides: Electrophilic 
Chlorination of Methane. Activation of methane 
is a subject of actual interest in many laboratories. 
Besides the extensive work carried out on the oxida- 
tive coupling of methane,713-715 
electrophilic conver- 
sions offer interesting posibilities. 
Thus, under 
superacidic conditions, methane reacts with SbFdC12 
in SOzClF at -78 "C to give methyl chloride in high 
selectivity, 
but with low levels of conversion.717 
TaFd 
Nafion-H, SbFdgraphite, and even zeolites have been 
used as catalyst for the chlorination of methane.718,719 
When the reaction was carried out on S042-/Zr02 
catalysts, it was found720 
that the conversion in- 
creases with reaction temperature from 200 to 235 
"C, while, in contrast to what occurs on zeolites, 
selectivity decreases. More specifically, at temper- 
atures below 225 "C S042-/Zr02 gives selectivities 
280% in methyl chloride. Above 225 "C chloroform 
is formed, but no C

 is observed. Addition of Fe 
and Mn to sulfated zirconia improves methyl chloride 
selectivity but decreases conversion. However, it 
should be considered that in order to discuss selectiv- 
ity effects the results should be compared at the same 
level of conversion. It has been proposed720 
that the 
mechanism of the reaction on S042-/Zr02 might be 
the same as that the proposed over oxyhalide or 
supported Lewis superacid catalysts:

Cl2 is polarized at the Lewis centers of the catalyst 
and chlorination of methane takes place under elec- 
trophilic conditions. 
One important limitation of the sulfated oxide 
catalysts is that leaching of the metal by HCl occurs 
with the corresponding loss of catalyst with time on 
stream.

 It was presented above that zirconia- 
tungsten and zirconia-molybdena oxides, calcined at 
temperatures between 600 and 1000 "C, show strong 
acid sites. When used as catalysts, they are able to 
carry out the benzoylation of toluene with benzoic 
anhydride, isomerization of n-heptane, and oligomer- 
ization of l - d e  e n e .     
In these cases the maximum 
in activity was obtained for very high temperatures, 
close to 800 "C, but in all cases and as occurred 
before, their catalytic activity follows the trend of 
acidity. This type of oxide will offer new opportuni- 
ties in catalysis, especially for reactions which require 
highly thermally stable catalysts. 
IV. General Conclusions 
It appears today that a large variety of solid acids 
within a large scale of acidities +3.5 I 
HO 
I 
-16 and 
with high surface areas can be prepared. This offers 
the possibility for selecting a catalyst with the 
adequate acid strength for almost any particular 
acid-catalyzed reaction. This situation has been 
made possible by the large amount of work performed 
by researchers from different areas. In this way 
NMR, IR, EPR, Raman, and XPS spectroscopists 
have characterized the nature and different types of 
acid sites, which have been modeled by a specialist 
in quantum chemistry. On the basis of those as well 
as on adsorption studies, researchers in Material 
Sciences have made possible the preparation of solid 
acids, based on inorganic oxides, within different 
range of acid strengths. On top of that and in 
collaboration with catalytic specialists, acidity has 
been coupled with adequate surface and pore size 
properties in order to optimize catalytic activity and 
selectivity in a large variety of reactions with organic 
compounds. In this sense, zeolites and zeotypes have 
represented a revolution in the field of acid catalysis, 
not only because of the rationalization on the nature 
of the acid sites achieved, but also because of the 
practical catalytic results achieved with these mate- 
rials. Their use has completely changed the scheme 
in refining and petrochemistry and, now, is opening 
new possibilities in the field of fine chemicals. 
However, their practical use is still limited to reac- 
tions requiring acidities lower than HO 
= 
-10 (unless 
high reaction temperatures can be used). Owing to 
this, there is strong incentive to develop new solid 
acid catalysts based on inorganic solids, with very 
strong acid sites. In this sense, heteropoly acids and 
their acid salts offer new possibilities for carrying out 
more demanding reactions at lower temperatures. 
Their possibilities 
will be expanded in the near future 
if structures with controlled, stable micropores with 
sizes in the range of reactant molecules could be 
prepared. In this case there is no doubt that a 
combination of acidity, molecular sieve properties, 
and chirality can open new and exciting possibilities 
to these materials. 
Finally, when stable stronger acidities are re- 
quired, activated oxides and sulfated oxides can offer 
clear advantages. These materials, make available 
superacid sites on the surface of solid catalysts. 
However, their performance has to be improved in 
order to avoid undesired parallel reactions and 
catalyst deactivation. Efforts should be made to 
decrease the acid strength heterogeneity of these 
materials, which involve the presence of acid sites of 
weak, medium, strong, and very strong acid sites. 
Their possibilities as a real counterpart of unfriendly 
HF and H2 SO4 acid catalysts would strongly be 
increased if they could be prepared with only very 
strong acid sites on the surface.
