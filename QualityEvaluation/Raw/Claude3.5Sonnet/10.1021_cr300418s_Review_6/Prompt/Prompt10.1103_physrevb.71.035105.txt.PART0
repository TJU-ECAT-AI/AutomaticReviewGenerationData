In this work we reexamine the LDA+U method of Anisimov and co-workers in the framework of a
plane-wave pseudopotential approach. A simplified rotational-invariant formulation is adopted. The calculation
of the Hubbard U entering the expression of the functional is discussed and a linear response approach is
proposed that is internally consistent with the chosen definition for the occupation matrix of the relevant
localized orbitals. In this way we obtain a scheme whose functionality should not depend strongly on the
particular implementation of the model in ab initio calculations. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method,
computing structural and electronic properties of a few systems including transition and rare-earth correlated
metals, transition metal monoxides, and iron silicate.

I. INTRODUCTION
The description and understanding of electronic properties
of strongly correlated materials is a very important and long
standing problem for ab initio calculations. Widely used ap-
proximations for the exchange and correlation energy in den-
sity functional theory sDFTd, mainly based on parametriza-
tion of snearlyd homogeneous electron gas, miss important
features of their physical behavior. For instance, both the
local spin-density approximation sLSDAd and spin-polarized
generalized gradient approximation ss-GGAd, in their sev-
eral flavors, fail in predicting the insulating behavior of
many simple transition metal oxides sTMOd, not only by
severely underestimating their electronic band gap but, in
most cases, producing a qualitatively wrong metallic ground
state.
TMOs have for a long time represented the most notable
failure of DFT. When the high-Tc superconductors entered
the scene stheir parent materials are also strongly correlated
systemsd the quest for new approaches that could describe
accurately these systems by first principles received new in-
terest, and in the last fifteen years many methods were pro-
posed. Among these, the LDA+U approach, first introduced
by Anisimov and co-workers,13 has allowed to study a large
variety of strongly correlated compounds with considerable
improvement with respect to LSDA or s-GGA results. The
successes of the method have led to further developments
during the last decade which have produced very sophisti-
cated theoretical approaches4 and efficient numerical tech-
niques.
The formal expression of LDA+U energy functional is
adapted from model Hamiltonians sthe Hubbard model in
particulard that represent the natural theoretical framework
to deal with strongly correlated materials. As in these mod-
els, a small number of localized orbitals is selected and the
electronic correlation associated to them is treated in a spe-
cial way. The obtained results strongly depend on the defini-
tion of the localized orbitals and on the choice of the inter-
action parameters used in the calculation, that should be
determined in an internally consistent way. This is not al-
ways done and a widespread but, in our opinion, unsatisfac-
tory approach is to determine the value of the electronic cou-
plings by seeking a good agreement of the calculated
properties with the experimental results in a semiempirical
way.
In this work a critical reexamination of the LDA+U ap-
proach is proposed, which starts from the formulation of
Anisimov and co-workers13 and its further improvements57
and develops a simpler approximation. This is, in our opin-
ion, the minimal extension of the usual approximate DFT
sLDA or GGAd schemes needed when atomiclike features
are persistent in the solid environment.
In the central part of this work we describe a method,
based on a linear response approach, to calculate in an inter-
nally consistent waywithout aprioristic assumption about
screening and/or basis set employed in the calculationthe
interaction parameters entering the LDA+U functional used.
In this context our plane-wave pseudopotential sPWPPd
implementation of the LDA+U approach is presented and
discussed in some details. We stress however that the pro-
posed method is basis-set independent. Our methodology is
then applied to the study of the electronic properties of some
real materials, chosen as representative of normal sbulk
irond and correlated sbulk ceriumd metals, as well as a few
examples of strongly correlated systems siron oxide, nickel
oxide, and fayalited.
II. STANDARD LDA+U IMPLEMENTATION
In order to account explicitly for the on-site Coulomb
interaction responsible for the correlation gap in Mott insu-
lators and not treated faithfully within LDA, Anisimov and
co-workers13 correct the standard functional adding an on-
site Hubbard-like interaction EHub:
ELDA+Ufnsrdg = ELDAfnsrdg + EHubfhnm

orbital occupations for the atom I experiencing the Hub-

bard term. The last term in the above equation is then sub-
tracted in order to avoid double counting of the interactions
contained both in EHub and, in some average way, in ELDA. In
this term the total, spin-projected, occupation of the localized
manifold is used: nIs=omnm
Is.
In its original definition the functional defined in Eq. s1d
was not invariant under rotation of the atomic-orbital basis
set used to define the occupancies nm
Is. A rotationally invari-
ant formulation has then been introduced5,6 where the orbital
dependence of EHub is borrowed from atomic Hartree-Fock
with renormalized slater integrals:

by assuming atomic values for F4/F2 and F6/F4 ratios.
To obtain U and J, Anisimov and co-workers3,8 propose to
perform LMTO calculations in supercells in which the occu-
pation of the localized orbitals of one atom is constrained.
The localized orbitals of all atoms in the supercell are decou-
pled from the remainder of the basis set. This makes the
treatment of the local orbitals an atomiclike problem
making it easy to fix their occupation numbersand allows
them to use Janak theorem9 to identify the shift in the corre-
sponding eigenvalue with the second-order derivative of the
LDA total energy with respect to orbital occupation. It has,
however, the effect of leaving a rather artificial system to
perform the screening, in particular when it is not completely
intra-atomic. In elemental metallic iron, for instance, Anisi-
mov and Gunnarsson8 showed that only half of the screening
charge is contained in the Wigner-Seitz cell. This fact, in
addition to a sizable error due to the atomic sphere approxi-
mation used,8 could be at the origin of the severe overesti-
mation of the computed on-site Coulomb interaction with
respect to estimates based on comparison of spectroscopic
data and model calculations.10,11
III. BASIS SET INDEPENDENT FORMULATION
OF LDA+U METHOD
Some aspects of currently used LDA+U formulation and,
in particular, of the determination of the parameters entering
the model, have been so far tied to the LMTO approach. This
is not a very pleasant situation and some effort has been
made recently7,12 to reformulate the method for different ba-
sis sets. Here we want to elaborate further on these attempts
and provide an internally consistent, basis-set independent,
method for the calculation of the needed parameters.
A. Localized orbital occupations
In order to fully define how the approach works the first
thing to do is to select the degrees of freedom on which
Hubbard U will operate and define the corresponding oc-
cupation matrix nmm8
Is . Although it is usually straightforward
to identify in a given system the atomic levels to be treated
in a special way sthe d electrons in transition metals and the
f ones in the rare earths and actinides seriesd there is no
unique or rigorous way to define occupation of localized
atomic levels in a multiatom system. Equally legitimate
choices for nmm8
Is
are sid projections on normalized atomic
orbitals, siid projections on Wannier functions whenever the
relevant orbitals give raise to isolated band manifolds, siiid
Mulliken population, or sivd integrated values in ssphericald
regions
around
the
atoms
of
the
angular-momentum-
decomposed charge densities. Taking into account the arbi-
trariness in the definition of nmm8
Is
no particular significance
should be attached to any of them sor other that could be
introducedd and the usefulness and reliability of an approxi-
mate DFT+U method sADFT+Ud, and of its more recent
and involved evolutions such as the ADFT+DMFT method,
should be judged from its ability to provide a correct physi-
cal picture of the systems under study irrespective of the
details of the formulation, once all ingredients entering the
calculation are determined consistently.
All the abovementioned definitions for the occupation
matrices can be put in the generic form

eralized projection operators on the localized-electron mani-
fold that satisfy the following properties:

is the total localized-states occupation for site I. Orthogonal-

In the applications discussed in this work we will define
localized-level occupation matrices projecting on atomic

therefore simply

where uwm
I l is the valence atomic orbital with angular mo-
mentum component ulml of the atom sitting at site I sthe
same wave functions are used for both spinsd. Since we will
be using ultrasoft pseudopotentials to describe valence-core
interaction, all scalar products between crystal and atomic
pseudo-wave-functions are intended to include the usual S
matrix describing orthogonality in presence of charge
augmentation.13
As already mentioned, other choices could be used as well
and different definitions for the occupation matrices will re-
quire, in general, different values of the parameter entering
the ADFT+U functional, as it has been pointed out recently
also by Pickett et al.,7 where, for instance, the value of Hub-
bard U in FeO shifts from 4.6 to 7.8 eV when atomic d or-
bitals for Fe2+ ionic configuration are used instead of those of
the neutral atom. In an early study19 the U parameter in
La2CuO4 varies from 6.8 to 7.7 eV upon variation of the
atomic sphere radius employed in the LMTO calculation. As
pointed out in these works it is not fruitful to compare nu-
merical values of U obtained by different methods but rather
comparison should be made between results of complete cal-
culations.
B. A simplified rotationally invariant scheme
and the meaning of U
In order to simplify our analysis and gaining a more trans-
parent physical interpretation of the 1U correction to stan-
dard ADFT functionals we concentrate on the main effect
associated to on-site Coulomb repulsion fthe F0 term in Eq.
s4dg. We thus neglect the important but somehow secondary
effects associated to higher-multipolar terms in the Coulomb
interaction sF2,F4, ...d and the proper treatment of magnetic
interaction, that in the currently used rotational invariant
method is dealt with by assuming a renormalized spherical
Hartree-Fock form fEq. s2d and Ref. 5g.
We are therefore going to assume in the following that
parameter J describing these effects can be set to zero, or
alternatively that its effects can be mimicked redefining the
U parameter as Ueff=UJ, a practice that have been some-
time used in the literature.14 The Hubbard correction to the
energy functional, Eqs. s2d and s3d, greatly simplifies and
reads

from where it appears clearly that the energy correction in-
troduces a penalty, tuned by the value of the U parameter, for
partial occupation of the localized orbitals and thus favors
disproportionation in fully occupied sl<1d or completely
empty sl<0d orbitals. This is the basic physical effect built
in the ADFT+U functional and its meaning can be traced
back to known deficiencies of LDA or GGA for atomic sys-
tems.
An atom in contact with a reservoir of electrons can ex-
change integer numbers of particles with its environment.
The intermediate situation with fractional number of elec-
trons in this open atomic system is described not by a pure
state wave function, but rather by a statistical mixture so
that, for instance, the total energy of a system with N+v
electrons swhere N is an integer and 0v1d is given by
En = s1 vdEN + vEN+1,
s12d
where EN and EN+1 are the energies of the system corre-
sponding to states with N and N+1 particles, respectively,
while v represents the statistical weight of the state with
N+1 electrons. The total energy of this open atomic system
is thus represented by a series of straight-line segments join-
ing states corresponding to integer occupations of the atomic
orbitals as depicted in Fig. 1. The slope of the energy vs
electron-number curve is instead piecewise constant, with
discontinuity for integer number of electrons, and corre-
sponds to the electron affinity sionization potentiald of the
N sN+1d electron system.
Exact DFT correctly reproduce this behavior,15,16 which is
instead not well described by the LDA or GGA approach,
which produces total energy with unphysical curvatures for
noninteger occupation and spurious minima in correspon-
dence of fractional occupation of the orbital of the atomic
system. This leads to serious problems when one consider
the dissociation limit of heteropolar molecules or an open-
shell atom in front of a metallic surface,15,16 and is at the
heart of the LDA/GGA failure in the description of strongly
correlated systems.1 The unphysical curvature is associated

basically to the incorrect treatment by LDA or GGA of the
self-interaction of the partially occupied Kohn-Sham orbital
that gives a nonlinear contribution to the total energy with
respect to orbital occupation swith mainly a quadratic term
coming from the Hartree energy not canceled properly in the
exchange-correlation termd.
Nevertheless, it is well known17 that total energy differ-
ences between different states can be reproduced quite accu-
rately by the LDA sor GGAd approach, if the occupation of
the orbitals is constrained to assume integer values. As an
alternative, we can recover the physical situation san ap-
proximately piecewise linear total energy curved by adding a
correction to the LDA total energy which vanishes for inte-
ger number of electrons and eliminates the curvature of the
LDA energy profile in every interval with fractional occupa-
tion sbottom curve of Fig. 1d. But this is exactly the kind of
correction that is provided by Eq. s9d if the numerical value
of the parameter U is set equal to the curvature of the LDA
sGGAd energy profile.
This clarifies the meaning of the interaction parameter U
as the sunphysicald curvature of the LDA energy as a func-
tion of N which is associated with the spurious self-
interaction of the fractional electron injected into the system.
From this analysis it is clear that the numerical value of U
will depend in general not only, as noted in the preceding
section, on the definition adopted for the occupation matrices
but also on the particular approximate exchange-correlation
functional to be corrected, and should vanish if the exact
DFT functional were used.
The situation is of course more complicated in solids
where fractional occupations of the atomic orbitals can occur
due to hybridization of the localized atomiclike orbitals with
the crystal environment and the unphysical part of the cur-
vature has to be extracted from the total LDA/GGA energy,
which contains also hybridization effects. In the next section
this problem is discussed and a linear response approach to
evaluate Hubbard U is proposed.
C. Internally consistent calculation of U
Following previous seminal works8,18,19 we compute U by
means of constrained-density-functional calculations.20 What
we need is the total energy as a function of the localized-
level occupations of the Hubbard sites:
EfhqIjg = min
nsrd,aIHEfnsrdg + o
I
aIsnI qIdJ,
s13d
where the constraints on the site occupations, nIs from Eq.
s7d, are applied employing the Lagrange multipliers aIs.
From this dependence we can compute numerically the cur-
vature of the total energy with respect to the variation,
around the unconstrained values hnI
s0dj, of the occupation of
one isolated site. A supercell approach is adopted in which
occupation of one representative site in a sufficiently large
supercell is changed leaving unchanged all other site occu-
pations. This curvature contains the energy cost associated to
the localization of an electron on the chosen site including all
screening effects from the crystal environment, but it is not
yet the Hubbard U we want to compute. In fact, had we
computed the same quantity from the total energy of the
noninteracting Kohn-Sham problem associated to the same
system
EKSfhqIjg = min
nsrd,aIHEKSfnsrdg + o
I
aI

we would have obtained nonvanishing results as well be-
cause by varying the site occupation a rehybridization of the
localized orbitals with the other degrees of freedom is in-
duced that gives rise to a nonlinear change in the energy of
the system. This curvature coming from rehybridization,
originating from the noninteracting band structure but
present also in the interacting case, has clearly nothing to do
with the Hubbard U of the interacting system and should be
subtracted from the total curvature
U = ]2EfhqIjg

.
s15d
In Ref. 8 Anisimov and Gunnarsson, in order to avoid
dealing with the abovementioned noninteracting curvature,
exploited the peculiarities of the LMTO method, used in
their calculation, and decoupled the chosen localized orbitals
from the remainder of the crystal by suppressing in the
LMTO Hamiltonian the corresponding hopping terms. This
reduced the problem to the one of an isolated atom embed-
ded in an artificially disconnected charge background.
Thanks to Janak theorem9 the second order derivative of the
total energy in Eq. s13d can then be recast as a first order
derivative of the localized-level eigenvalue. In our approach
the role played in Refs. 3 and 8 by the eigenvalue of the
artificially isolated atom is taken by the Lagrange multiplier,
used to enforce level occupation20

At variance with the original method of Refs. 3 and 8, in our
approach we need to compute and subtract the band-structure
contribution ]aI
KS/]qI from the total curvature but, in re-
turn, Hubbard U is computed in exactly the same system to
which it is going to be applied and the screening from the
environment is more realistically included. The present
method was inspired by the linear response scheme proposed
by Pickett and co-workers7 where, however, the role of the
noninteracting curvature was not appreciated.
In actual calculations constraining the localized orbital
occupations is not very practical and it is easier to pass, via a
Legendre transform, to a representation where the indepen-
dent variables are the aIs

Variation of these functionals with respect to wavefunctions
shows that the effect of the aIs is to add to the single particle
potential a term DV=oIaIPI sor DV=oIaI

teracting cased, where localized potential shifts of strength aI

approximation21 in linear response theory giving the interact-
ing density response in terms of the noninteracting one and
the Coulomb kernel. A similar result is obtained within DFT
linear response22 where the interaction kernel also contains
an exchange-correlation part.
The response functions s18d needed in Eq. s19d are com-
puted taking numerical derivatives. We perform a well con-
verged LDA calculation for the unconstrained system saI
=0 for all sites in the supercelld andstarting from its self-
consistent potentialwe add small spositive and negatived
potential shifts on each nonequivalent Hubbard site J and
compute the variation of the occupations nIs for all sites in
the supercell in two ways: sid letting the Kohn-Sham poten-
tial of the system readjust self-consistently to optimally
screen the localized perturbation DV=aJPJ and siid without
allowing this screening. This latter result is nothing but the
variation computed from the first iteration in the self-
consistent cycle leading eventually to the former sscreenedd
results. The site-occupation derivatives calculated according
to sid and siid give the matrices xIJ and xIJ
0 , respectively.
D. Further considerations
Before moving to examine some specific examples in the
next section, let us end the present one by discussing a few
additional technical points. As mentioned earlier, Hubbard U
is computed, ideally, from variation of the site occupation of
a single site in an infinite crystal and in practice adopting a
supercell approach where periodically repeated sites are per-
turbed coherently. In order to speed up the convergence of
the computed U with supercell size it may result useful to
enforce explicitly charge neutrality for the perturbation, that
is to be introduced in the response functions, thus enhancing
its local character and reduce the interaction with its periodic
images. In this procedure we introduce in the response func-
tions x and x0in addition to the degrees of freedom asso-
ciated to the localized sitesalso a delocalized back-
ground representing all other degrees of freedom in the
system. This translates in one more column and row in the
response matrices, whose elements are determined imposing
overall charge neutrality of the perturbed system for all lo-
calized perturbations soIxIJ=0, oIxIJ
0 =0, Jd and absence of
any charge density variation upon perturbing the system with
a constant potential soJxIJ=0, oJxIJ
0 =0, Id. From a math-
ematical point of view both x and x0 acquire a null eigen-
value, corresponding to a constant potential shift, and the
needed inversions in Eq. s19d must be taken with care. It can
be shown that their singularities cancel out when computing
the difference x0
1x1 and the final result is well defined.
We stress that in the limit of infinitely large supercell the
coupling with the background gives no contribution to the
computed U, but we found that this limit is approached more
rapidly when this additional degree of freedom is included.
In the same spirit we found that the spatial locality of the
response matrices can be rather different from the one of
their inverse and a supercell sufficient to decouple the peri-
odically repeated response may be too small to describe cor-
rectly the inverse in Eq. s19d. As a practical procedure, there-
fore, after evaluating the response function matrices in a
given supercell, we extrapolate the result to much larger su-
percells assuming that the most important matrix elements in
x0 and x involve the atoms in the few nearest coordination
shells accessible in the original supercell. The corresponding
matrix elements of the larger supercell are filled with the
values extracted from the smaller one while all other, more
distant, interactions are neglected. Again, when a sufficiently
large supercell to extract the matrix elements of the response
functions is considered, the effect of this extrapolation van-
ishes but, as we will see in the following, this scheme cap-
ture a large fraction of the system-size dependence of the
calculated U and it may allow to reach more rapidly the
converged result.
LINEAR RESPONSE APPROACH TO THE CALCULATION
PHYSICAL REVIEW B 71, 035105 s2005d
035105-5
As a final remark we notice that the electronic structure of
a system described within the LDA+U approach may largely
differ from the one obtained within the LDA used to compute
U. In a more refined approach one might seek internal con-
sistency between the band structure used in the calculation of
U and the one obtained using it. We have not addressed this
issue here, but one can imagine performing the same type of
analysis leading to the U determination for a functional al-
ready containing an LDA+U correction. The computed U
would in that case be a correction to be added to the original
U and internal consistency would be reached when the cor-
rection vanishes.
A generalization of the argument described above to ob-
tain not only U but also the exchange parameter J is possible
and easy. It would consist in studying the linear response of
the system to more general projectors son the up and down
populations separately, for instanced or in determining the
full curvature of the total energy Efhnm,m8
s
jg through the cou-
pling of the external perturbation to the generalized projec-
tors introduced in Eqs. s6d and s8d. These extensions were,
however, not examined in detail in the present work and their
analysis remain for further studies.
IV. EXAMPLES
A. Metals: Iron and cerium
In their seminal paper Anisimov and Gunnarsson8 com-
puted the effective on site Coulomb interaction between the
localized electrons in metallic Fe and Ce. For Ce the calcu-
lated Coulomb interaction was about 6 eV in good agree-
ment with empirical and experimental estimates ranging
from 5 to 7 eV,20,23,24 while the result for Fe salso about
6 eVd was surprisingly high since U was expected to be in
the range of 12 eV for elemental transition metals, with the
exception of Ni.10,11 Let us apply the present approach to
these two systems, starting with iron.
In its ground state elemental iron has a ferromagnetic
sFMd spin arrangement and a body-centered cubic sbccd
structure. Gradient corrected exchange-correlation functional
are needed in order to stabilize the experimental structure as
compared with nonmagnetic face-centered cubic sfccd struc-
ture
preferred
by
LDA.
The
Perdew-Burke-Ernzherof
sPBEd25 GGA functional was employed here. Iron ions were
represented by ultrasoft pseudopotential and kinetic energy
cutoffs of 35 and 420 Ry were adopted for wave function
and charge density Fourier expansion. Brillouin Zone inte-
grations where performed using 83838 Monkhorst and
Pack special point grids26 using Methfessel and Paxton
smearing technique27 with a smearing width of 0.005 Ry in
order to smooth the Fermi distribution.
The calculation of the effective Hubbard U followed the
procedure outlined in preceding section: a supercell was se-
lected containing a number of inequivalent iron atoms. Then,
after a well converged self-consistent calculation, we applied
to one of these atoms small, positive and negative, potential
shifts DV=aPd swith a= 0.20.5 eVd, where Pd is the pro-
jector on the localized d electron of the selected atom. From
the variation of the d-level occupations of all iron atoms in
the cell one column of x and x0 response functions was
extracted and all other matrix elements were reconstructed
by symmetry, including the background as explained previ-
ously. Hubbard U was then calculated from Eq. s19d.
In order to describe response for an isolated perturbation
four supercells were considered. sid A simple cubic sscd cell
containing two inequivalent iron atoms, the perturbed atom,
and one of its nearest neighbors. siid A 23232 bcc super-
cell containing eight inequivalent iron atoms, four in the
nearest-neighbor shell of the perturbed atom and three be-
longing to the second shell of neighbors. siiid A 23232 sc
cell containing 16 atoms, including also some third-nearest-
neighbor atoms. sivd A 43434 bcc supercell containing 64
inequivalent iron atoms; we used this largest cell just to ex-
trapolate the results from the smaller ones. The convergence
properties of the effective U of bulk iron with the size of the
used supercell are shown in Fig. 2.
The Hubbard U obtained from the sc two-atom cell, once
inserted in the 64-atom supercell, captures most of the effec-
tive interaction. The second-nearest-neighbor shell brings
some significant corrections to the final extrapolated result,
while third-nearest-neighbor shell has a smaller effect. We
believe that contributions from further neighbor rapidly van-
ish and that an accurate value of U can be extracted from the
sc supercell containing 16 atoms. The extrapolation from this
cell to larger cells brings only minor variations which are
within the finite numerical accuracy that we estimate within
a fraction of an eV. From this analysis our estimate for the
Hubbard U in elemental iron at the experimental lattice pa-
rameter is therefore 2.20.2 eV.
This results is in very good agreement with the experi-
mental estimates,10,11 but disagrees with the Anisimov and
Gunnarsson result.8 We can only recall here that many tech-
nical details differ in the two approaches. In particular sid in
the original approach the perturbed atom is disconnected
from the rest of the crystal by removing all hopping terms,
thus leaving a rather unphysical environment to perform the
screening, while in our approach the actual system is allowed
to screen the perturbation and siid the atomic sphere approxi-

mation sASAd was employed in the original LMTO calcula-
tion while no shape approximation is made in our case.
In order to further test our approach on this element we
investigate the dependence of the Hubbard parameter on
crystal structure. The dependence of the calculated interac-
tion parameter on the lattice spacing of the unit cell is shown
in Fig. 3 where a marked increase of the Hubbard U can be
observed when the lattice parameter is squeezed below its
experimental value. Despite this may appear counterintui-
tive, as correlation effects are expected to become less im-
portant when atoms gets closer, one should actually compare
the increasing value of U with the much steeper increase of
bandwidth when reducing the interatomic distance. Upon in-
crease of the lattice parameter the Hubbard parameter should
approach the atomic limit that can be estimated from all-
electron atomic calculations where the local neutrality of the
metallic
system
is
maintained:
U=Esd8s0d+Esd6s2d2
3Esd7s1d=2.1 eV, in reasonable agreement with the results
of Fig. 3.
Using the calculated volume dependent Hubbard U pa-
rameter we have studied the effect of the LDA+U approxi-
mation on the structural properties of iron. Results are re-
ported in Table I where they are compared with results
obtained within LSDA and s-GGAsPBEd approximation and
with experimental data. From these data it appears that, al-
though simple s-GGAsPBEd approximation appears to be
superior in this case, LDA+U provides a reasonable descrip-
tion of the data, of the same quality as LSDA. In weakly
correlated metals it has been suggested29 that a formulation
of LDA+U in terms of occupancy fluctuations around the
uniform occupancy of the localized level could be more ap-
propriate than the standard one. This around mean field
sAMFd LDA+U approach has recently been revisited30,31
and an optimally mixed scheme has also been proposed.31
We do not want to enter in this discussion here, but we
mention that by following the AMF recipe the description of
structural and magnetic properties of metallic iron improves
as it is evident from Table I.
Using the calculated value of U we have obtained the
electronic structure of iron at the experimental lattice spac-
ing. The theoretical band structure obtained using the AMF
version of LDA+U is reported in Fig. 4 together with some
experimental results.32 The overall agreement is rather good
for this scheme. However, when using the standard LDA
+U scheme a somehow worse agreement with experimental
data was obtained, mainly due to a rigid downward shift of
the majority spin bands of about 1 eV. This is an indication
that LDA+U approximation may still require some fine tun-
ing in order to describe accurately both strongly and weakly
correlated systems.31
Let us proceed to examine the cerium case. Elemental
cerium presents a very interesting phase diagram with a pe-
culiar isostructural a-g phase transition between a low vol-
ume sad and a high volume sgd phase, both fcc. This phase
transition has attracted much experimental and theoretical
interest and in the last 20 years33 many interpretations have
been put forward to explain its occurrence. It is clear now
that standard LDA or GGA approximations do not describe
the transition and it appears that a treatment of the correla-
tion at the DMFT level might be required,34 however, a full
understanding of the nature of the transition is still under
debate.35 Here, we do not want to address this delicate topics
but we simply want to follow Anisimov and Gunnarsson8 by
computing the Hubbard U parameter for elemental cerium in
the high volume g phase.

pseudopotential13 generated in the 5s25p65d14f1 electronic
configuration. Kinetic cutoffs of 30 and 240 Ry were
adopted for the wave function and charge density Fourier
expansion. The LSDA approximation was adopted for the
exchange and correlation functional. Brillouin zone integra-
tions where performed using 83838 Monkhorst and Pack
special point grids26 using the Methfessel and Paxton smear-
ing technique27 with a smearing width of 0.05 Ry.
To obtain the response to an isolated perturbation we have
perturbed a cerium atom in three different cells. sid The fun-
damental face-centered cubic sfccd cell containing just one
inequivalent atom. siid A simple-cubic sscd cell containing
four atoms sgiving access to the first-nearest-neighbor re-
sponsed. siiid A 23232 fcc cell seight inequivalent atomsd
including also the response of second-nearest neighbor at-
oms. The result of these calculations and their extrapolation
to very large sc cells is reported in Fig. 5 where it can be
seen that the converged value for U approaches 4.5 eV.
The screening in metallic cerium is extremely localized,
as can be seen from the fact that inclusion of the first-
nearest-neighbor response is all that is needed to reach con-
verged results. This is at variance with what we found in
metallic iron where the third-nearest-neighbor response was
still significant ssee Fig. 2d. The calculated value is not far
from the value s57 eVd expected from empirical and ex-
perimental estimates,20,23,24 especially if we consider that the
parameter U we compute plays the role of U-J in the sim-
plified rotational invariant LDA+U scheme adopted.14
As a check, we performed all-electron atomic calculations
for Ce+ ions where localized 4f electrons were promoted to
more delocalized 6s or 5d states and obtained U=Esf3s0d
+Esf1s2d23Esf2s1d=4.4 eV, or U=Esf2s0d1d+Esf0s2d1d
23Esf1s1d1d=6.4 eV, depending on the selected atomic
configurations. This confirms the correct order of magnitude
of our calculated value in the metal.
The present formulation is therefore able to provide rea-
sonable values for the on-site Coulomb parameter both in
iron and cerium, at variance with the original scheme of Ref.
8 where only the latter was satisfactorily described. We be-
lieve that a proper description of the interatomic screening,
rather unphysical in the original scheme where atoms were
artificially disconnected from the environment, is important
to obtain a correct value for Hubbard U parameter, especially
in iron where this response is more long ranged.
B. Transition metal monoxides: FeO and NiO
The use of the LDA+U method for studying FeO is
mainly motivated by the attempt to reproduce the observed
insulating behavior. In fact, as for other transition metal ox-
ides sTMOsd, standard DFT methods, such as LDA or GGA,
produce an unphysical metallic character due to the fact that
crystal field and electronic structure effects are not sufficient
in this case to open a gap in the threefold minority-spin t2g
levels that host one electron per Fe2+ atom. As already ad-
dressed in quite abundant literature on TMOs sand FeO in
particulard, a better description of the electronic correlations
is necessary to obtain the observed insulating behavior and
the
structural
properties
of
this
compound
at
low
pressure.3639 The application of our approach to this mate-
rial will thus allow us to check its validity by comparison of
our results with the ones from experiments and other theo-
retical works.
The unit cell of this compound is of rock-salt type, with a
rhombohedral symmetry introduced by a type-II antiferro-
magnetic sAFd order ssee Fig. 6d which sets in along the
f111g direction below a Nel temperature of 198 K, at ambi-
ent pressure.
The calculations on this materials were all performed in
the antiferromagnetic phase starting from the cubic sundis-
tortedd unit cell of Fig. 6 with the experimental lattice spac-
ing. We used a 40 Ry energy cutoff for the electronic wave
functions s400 Ry for the charge density due to the use of

ultrasoft pseudopotentials13 both for Fe and Od and a small
smearing width of 0.005 Ry which required a 43434
k-point mesh.
To compute the Hubbard effective interactions, we per-
formed GGA calculations with potential shifts on one Hub-
bard site in larger and larger unit cells, that we named C1,
C4, and C16, containing 2, 8, and 32 iron ions, respectively,
and extrapolated their results up to a supercell containing
256 magnetic ions scalled C128d. The result for the undis-
torted cubic cell at the experimental lattice spacing is re-
ported in Fig. 7. We can observe that the effective interaction
obtained from C4 is already very well converged, when ex-
trapolated to the largest cell, with respect to inclusion of
screening from additional shells of neighbors.
The final result for the Hubbard U is 4.3 eV which is
smaller than most of the values obtained sor simply assumedd
in other works.3739 If we use this value in a LDA+U calcu-
lation we can obtain the observed insulating behavior as
shown in the band structure plot of Fig. 8 where a compari-
son is made with GGA smetallicd results.
A gap opens around the Fermi level whose minimal width
is about 2 eV. The band gap is direct and located at the G
point.
The
corresponding
transition
of
3dsFed2psOd
4ssFed character, should be quite weak due to the vanish-
ing weight of iron s states at the bottom of the valence band
sFig. 9, bottom pictured. We can expect that a stronger ab-
sorption line will appear instead around 2.6 eV due to the
transition of 3dsFed2psOd3dsFed character among two
pronounced peaks of the density of states around the Fermi
level. This picture is in very good agreement with experi-
ments sand other theoretical results39,40d where a first weak
absorption is reported between 0.5 and 2 eV and a stronger
line appears around 2.4 eV.41 The large mixing between
majority-spin iron 3d states and the oxygen 2p manifold over
a wide region of energy and the finite contribution of the
oxygen states at the top of the valence banda feature not
present within s-GGA ssee top panel in Fig. 9dare also in
good agreement with experiments, which indicate for FeO a
moderate charge transfer character of the insulating state.
Despite the fact that our U is smaller than the ones used in
the literature, we find a good agreement of our results about
the electronic structure of the system with experiments and
other theoretical works. These findings confirm the validity
of our internally consistent method to compute U. We now
want to extend its application to the study of structural prop-
erties. This is indeed a very important test because a good
ab initio method should be able to describe the true ground
state of a system and provide a complete description of both
electronic and structural properties. Furthermore the plane-
wave implementation we use allows a straightforward calcu-
lation of Hellmann-Feynman forces and stresses, thus giving
easily access to equilibrium crystal structure.
As observed in experiments,42 the cubic rock salt structure
of FeO shown in Fig. 6 becomes unstable under a pressure of
16 GPa sat room temperatured toward a rhombohedral distor-
tion. In the distorted phase the unit cell is elongated along
the f111g direction with a consequent shrinking of the interi-
onic distances on the s111d planes. This transition is driven
by the onset of the AFII magnetic order42 sthe Nel tempera-
ture reaches room value at about 16 GPad which imposes a
rhombohedral symmetry even in the cubic phase. Upon in-
creasing pressure above the threshold value the distortion of
the unit cell is observed to increase producing more elon-
gated structures.42
We have computed the Hubbard U on a grid of possible
values for the rhombohedral distortion and cell parameter
and then from the corresponding total energy calculations we
determined the rhombohedral distortion and the enthalpy of

the system as a function of the pressure up to 250 Kbar. As
evident from Fig. 10, while GGA overestimates the rhombo-
hedral distortion and its pressure dependence, the LDA+U
methodin the standard electronic configuration examined
so farovercorrects the GGA results and introduces even
larger errors with respect to experimental results. In fact not
only we obtain a distortion with the wrong sign sof compres-
sive character along the f111g directiond, but also the wrong
pressure dependence. The reason for this failure can be
traced back to the different occupation of the orbitals around
the gap/Fermi level in the two cases. Even in the undistorted
cell, the rhombohedral symmetry, induced by the antiferro-
magnetic order, lifts the degeneracy of the minority spin t2g
states of iron and split them in one state of A1g character
which is essentially the m=0 sz2d state along the f111g quan-
tization axisand two states of eg symmetry localized on the
iron s111d planes. Within GGA, the iron minority-spin 3d
electrons partially occupy the two equivalent eg orbitals giv-
ing rise to two half filled bands and a swrongd metallic state
which is delocalized on the s111d plane. The system gains
energy by filling the lowest half of the eg states and tends to
elongate in the f111g direction, shrinking in the plane, be-
cause this increases the overlap of the eg states and their
bandwidth. Within LDA+U, fractional occupation of orbitals
is energetically disfavored and the system would like to have
completely filled or empty 3d states. In the standard unit cell
considered so far in the literatureand used by us in the
calculation abovethis can be accomplished only by filling
the nondegenerate A1g level, corresponding to wave func-
tions elongated along f111g, and pushing upward in energy
the in-plane eg states, leaving them empty. As a consequence,
the system tends to pull apart the ions on the same s111d
plane, so that the bandwidth of the state in the plane is re-
duced, and increases instead the interplane overlap of the A1g
states. This simple picture gives an explanation of the fact
that GGA overestimates the elongation of the unit cell in the
f111g direction, as well as the swrongd compressive behavior
of the standard LDA+U solution. We are thus left with the
paradoxical situation that a correct pressure dependence of
the structural properties can be obtained from the wrong
band structure and vice versa.
We have found that it is possible to solve this paradox by
allowing the possibility that the system partially occupies, as
within GGA, the eg levels, thus maintaining the driving force
for the right rhombohedral deformation, and still opens a
gap, as in standard LDA+U, by some orbital ordering that
breaks the equivalence of the iron ions in the s111d plane.
This possibility has been sometimes proposed in the
literature39,44 but has never been clearly addressed.
From a simple tight-binding picture one finds that the op-
timal broken symmetry phase would be the one where occu-
pied eg orbitals have the highest possible hopping term with
unoccupied eg orbitals in nearest-neighbor atoms in the
plane, in order to maximize the kinetic energy gain coming
from delocalization, and the lowest possible hopping term
with neighboring occupied eg orbitals, in order to minimize
bandwidth that tends to destroy the insulating state. In bipar-
tite lattice this is simply achieved by making occupied orbit-
als in nearest-neighbor sites orthogonal but, in the triangular
lattice, formed by iron atoms in s111d planes, this is not
exactly possible, the system is topologically frustrated and
some compromise is necessary.
It is generally believed45 that Heisenberg model in the
triangular lattice, to which our system resemble in some
sense, displays a three-sublattice 120 Nel long-range order.
We thus imposed a symmetry breaking to the system where
three nearest-neighbor atoms in the s111d plane were made
inequivalent by slightly displacing them from the ideal posi-
tions in the way shown in Fig. 11. This induced the desired

symmetry breaking of the electronic structure and opened a
gap that was robust and persisted when the atoms were
brought back into the ideal positions. We found, quite satis-
factorily, that the new broken symmetry phase sBSPd corre-
sponds to a lower energy minimum than the standard
LDA+U solution and that therefore it is, to say the least, a
more consistent description of the ground state of FeO. The
one depicted in Fig. 11 is, of course, only one of three
equivalent distortions we could have imposed to the elec-
tronic structure of the system and three symmetry related
BSPs could be defined. In the actual system an effective
equivalence of the ions in the s111d planes is probably re-
stored by a sdynamicald switching among equivalent states
but considering the atoms as strictly equivalent, as in the
standard solution, leads to incorrect results.
The comparison of the projected density of state in the
standard LDA+U solution and in the novel BSP phase is
shown in Fig. 12 where also a pictorial representation of the
occupied minority-spin orbitals in the two cases is shown. As
we can observe, no remarkable qualitative difference in the
DOS appears apart from the different ordering of the d states
around the gap. In fact the minority-spin d electron is now
accommodated on a state lying on the s111d plane sshown on
the right paneld while the one with A1g sz2d character has
been pushed above the energy gap. The gap width and the
charge transfer character of the system do not change signifi-
cantly and are still in very good agreement with the experi-
ments.
We repeated the structural calculations saccording to the
same procedure described aboved in the BSP, and obtained
the LDA+U sBSPd curve reported in Fig. 10. The agreement
with experiments is much improved with respect to both
GGA and LDA+U standard ground states. The mechanism
leading to the pressure behavior in the BSP case is basically
the same already producing the correct evolution of distor-
tion in the GGA calculations. When the unit cell elongates
along the cubic diagonal the iron ions in the s111d plane get
closer and the hopping between nearest-neighbor orbitals in-
creased with a consequent lowering of the electronic kinetic
energy. We therefore conclude that LDA+U, not only im-
proves the description of the structural and electronic prop-
erties with respect to GGA, but that a close examination of
both electronic and structural properties is in this case nec-
essary in order to describe the correct ground state of the
system.
Another classical example of TMO we want to study in
order to test the present implementation of LDA+U is nickel
oxide. It is a very well studied material and there are a good
number of theoretical12 and experimental works, including
some photoemission experiments,46,47 our results can be
compared with. At variance with FeO, no compositional in-
stability is observed for NiO so that the stoichiometric com-

pound is easy to study and is much better characterized than
iron oxide. It has cubic structure with the same AF spin
arrangements of rhombohedral symmetry as FeO, but does
not show tendencies toward geometrical distortions of any
kind and is therefore easier to study.
In this case we did not perform any structural relaxation
and calculated the value of U at the experimental lattice
spacing for the cubic unit cell imposing the rhombohedral
AF magnetic order which is the ground state spin arrange-
ment for this compound. The GGA approximation sin the
PBE prescriptiond was used in the calculation. US pseudopo-
tentials for nickel and oxygen sthe same as in FeOd were
used with the same energy cutoffs sof 40 and 400 Ry, respec-
tivelyd for both the electronic wave functions and the charge
density as for FeO and also the same 43434 k-point grid
for reciprocal space integrations.
In the calculation of the Hubbard U of NiO we did not
study the convergence properties of U with system size as
we did in FeO but, assuming a similar convergence also in
this case, we performed a constrained calculation only in the
C4 cell and then extrapolated the obtained result to the C128
supercell. The calculated value of the U parameter is 4.6 eV.
This value is smaller than the values found in the literature
for the same parameter that are rather in the range of
78 eV,1 however, it has been recently pointed out12,14 that
in obtaining these values self-screening of d electrons is ne-
glected and that better agreement with experimental results is
obtained using an effective Hubbard U of the order of
56 eV.
The magnetic moment of the Ni ions is correctly de-
scribed within the present GGA+U approach which gives a
value of 1.7mB well within the experimental range of values
ranging from 1.64 and 1.9mB,48,49 better than the value of
1.55mB obtained within GGA.
In Figs. 13 and 14 the band structure and atomic-state
projected density of states of NiO obtained with this value of
U is shown, along with the results of standard GGA, and
compared with the photoemission data in the GX direction
extracted from Refs. 46 and 47. Despite the fact that the
agreement with the experimental band dispersion is not
excellentthe valence band width is somehow overesti-
mated by both GGA and GGA+U calculationsGGA+U
band structure reproduces some features of the photoemis-
sion spectrum well for this compound and gives a much
larger band gap than the one obtained within GGA approxi-
mation. A very important feature to be noticed in the density
of states reported in Fig. 14 is the fact that GGA+U quali-
tatively modifies the nature of the states at the top of the
valence band, and hence the nature of the band gap: in the
GGA approximation the top of valence band is dominated by
nickel d states while in the GGA+U calculation the oxygen
p states give the most important contribution. In both ap-
proaches the bottom of the conduction band is mainly nickel-
d-like and therefore the predicted band gap is primarily of
charge-transfer type within GGA+U, in agreement with ex-
perimental
and
theoretical
evidence,40,50,51
while
it
is
wrongly described as Mott-Hubbard type according to the
GGA approximation.
Our GGA+U value for the optical gap is <2.7 eV around
the T point, smaller than the commonly accepted experimen-
tal values that range from 3.7 to 4.3 eV.5255 More recently,
however, a reexamination56 of the best available optical ab-

sorption data52 pointed out that optical absorption in NiO
starts at photon energy as low as 3.1 eV, not far from our
theoretical result. Indeed, Bengone and co-workers12 recently
reported an LDA+U calculation in NiO where different em-
pirical values of U were employed. When U=5 eV was
useda value close to our present first-principles result
they obtained an optical gap of 2.8 eV, very close to our
results, and an excellent agreement between the calculated
and experimental52 optical absorption spectra. The same cal-
culation with the literature value of U=8 eV gave a larger
value for the optical gap but a very poor agreement with the
experimental absorption spectrum.

olivine sorthorhombic structured, one of the most abundant
minerals in Earths upper mantle. Recently57 we showed that,
although good structural and magnetic properties could be
obtained for this mineral within LDA or GGA, its electronic
properties were incorrectly described as metallic, confirming
the correlated origin of the observed insulating behavior.
From x-ray diffraction studies it is known that fayalite has
an orthorhombic cell, whose experimental lattice parameters
are sin atomic unitsd a=19.79, b=11.50, c=9.11. The unit
cell sdepicted in Fig. 15d contains four formula units and 28
atoms: 8 iron, 4 silicon, and 16 oxygen. Silicon ions are
tetrahedrally coordinated to oxygens, whereas iron ions oc-
cupy the centers of distorted oxygen octahedra. The point
group symmetry of the nonmagnetic crystal is mmm sD2h in
the Schoenflies notationd and the space group is Pnma. The
magnetization of iron reduces the original symmetry and
only half of the symmetry operations survive. The general
expression for the internal structural degrees of freedom is
given in Table II in the Wyckoff notation.58
Iron sites can be divided into two classes ssee Fig. 15 and
Table IId: Fe1 centers which are structured in chains running
parallel to the b, f010g, side of the orthorhombic cell, and
Fe2 sites which belong to mirror planes for the nonmagnetic
crystal structure perpendicular to the b side and cutting it at
1/4 and 3/4 of its length. The main structural units are the
iron centered oxygen octahedra which are distorted from the
cubic symmetry and tilted with respect to each other both
along the chains and on nearest Fe2 sites. Fayalite is known
to be an antiferromagnetic sAFd compound with slightly non-
collinear arrangement of spin on Fe1 iron site sthis noncol-
linearity will not be addressed hered. Magnetic moments
along the central and the edge Fe1 chains are antiferromag-
netically oriented and from our previous work57 the most
stable spin configuration is the one in which the magnetiza-
tion of Fe2 ion is parallel to the one of the closest Fe1 iron.
This magnetic structure is consistent with an iron-iron mag-
netic interaction via a superexchange mechanism through
oxygen p orbitals.
The calculation of U was performed for the experimental
geometry, in the abovementioned spin configuration. As the
primitive unit cell of fayalite is already quite large, we per-
formed the constrained calculation only in this cell and used
larger supercells only to extrapolate the results. We consid-
ered three supercells in addition to the primitive one: sid a
cell duplicated in the f0,1,0g chain direction sa 13231 su-
percelld, containing 16 iron atoms, siid a cell, containing 64
iron ions, obtained by duplicating the primitive structure in
all directions sa 23232 supercelld, and siiid a 43432 su-
percell s256 iron ionsd. Other computational details where
similar to those used in our previous work.57 As the GGA
approximation provided a slightly better description of the
system than LDA, we assumed this functional as the starting
point to be improved; the same pseudopotentials used in Ref.
57 for Fe, O, and Si were adopted here; somehow larger
energy cutoff for the electronic wave functions and charge
density s36 and 288 Ry, respectivelyd and a small smearing
width of 0.005 Ry were used. A 23434 Monkhorst-Pack
grid of k points in the primitive cell was found sufficient for
the BZ integration.
The results of the U calculation for the two different fami-
lies of iron sites sFe1 and Fe2d are reported in Fig. 16 where
the rapid convergence with respect to supercell dimension
can be seen. The final results for the on-site Coulomb param-
eters are U1=4.9 eV for Fe1 ions and U2=4.6 eV for Fe2,
which are in fairly good agreement with the approximate

saveraged value of 4.5 eV obtained in Ref. 57 from a rather
crude estimate.
The GGA+U band structure of fayalite is shown in Fig.
17 while in Fig. 18 some atomic-projected density of states
are reported. At variance with the GGA results reported in
Ref. 57 a band gap of about 3 eV now separates the valence
manifold from the conduction one, in reasonable agreement
with the experimental result of about 2 eV sRef. 59d at zero
pressure.
The minority spin t2g manifold of iron ions, that within
GGA crosses the Fermi energy, is split into two subgroups by
the gap opening. The conduction-band states are shrunk to a
narrow energy range and moved above the bottom of the iron
s states band which remains almost unaffected; the lower-
energy minority-spin d states, instead, merge in the group of
states below the Fermi level where they mix strongly with
states originating from oxygen p orbitals: the two sets of
states, well separated in the GGA results, collapse into a
unique block. The most evident consequence of the gap
opening consists in a pronounced shrinking of the d states of
iron which become flatter than in the GGA case. This is
evident on the top of the valence band, but also for states
well below this energy level, which thus reveal a more pro-
nounced atomiclike behavior. In addition to the gap opening
between the two groups of the minority-spin states, a strong
mixing occurs among the oxygen p states and the iron d
levels over a rather large region extending down to 8 eV
below the top of the valence band. A finite contribution of
the oxygen states is present close to the top of the valence
manifold showing that the gap is mainly of Mott-Hubbard
type with a partial charge-transfer character.

We have then relaxed the geometric structure of the sys-
tem sboth internal and cell degrees of freedomd assuming no
dependence of U1 and U2 on the atomic configuration. The
resulting structural parameters sa=20.18, b=11.75, c=9.29
atomic unitd as well as the internal coordinates reported in
Table III are in very good agreement with the experimental
results, even better than the already satisfactory agreement
obtained in Ref. 57 within GGA.
Although we did not study other spin configurations,
magnetic properties seem to improve slightly in the GGA
+U approximation. The magnetic moment on each iron sboth
Fe1 and Fe2d was found to be 3.9mB, in closer agreement
with the spin-only value s4mBd of the experimental result
s4.4mBd than the one obtained by GGA only s3.8mBd. This
improvement is probably due to the enhanced atomiclike
character of iron d states, which is a consequence of the gap
opening. In conclusion, the GGA+U provides quite a good
description of structural, magnetic, and electronic properties
of fayalite, reproducing the observed insulating behavior
with a reasonable value for its fundamental band gap.
V. SUMMARY
In this work we have reexamined the LDA+U approxi-
mation to DFT and a simplified rotational-invariant form of
the functional was adopted. We then developed a method,
based on a linear response approach, to calculate in an inter-
nally consistent way the interaction parameters entering the
LDA+U functional, without making an aprioristic assump-
tion about the screening and/or basis set employed in the
calculation. Our methodology was then successfully tested
on a few systems representative of normal and correlated
metals, simple transition metal oxides, and iron silicates. In
all cases we obtained rather accurate results indicating that
our scheme allows us to study both electronic and structural
properties of strongly correlated material on equal footing,
without resorting to any empirical parameter adjustment.
