The spin-forbidden oxidative addition of H2 to Fe(CO)4, Fe(PH3)4, Fe(dpe)2 and Fe(dmpe)2 [dpe = H2PCH2CH2PH2,
dmpe = (CH3)2PCH2CH2P(CH3)2] has been investigated by density functional theory using a modified B3PW91
functional. All 16-electron fragments are found to adopt a spin triplet ground state. The H2 addition involves a spin
crossover in the reagents region of configurational space, at a significantly higher energy relative to the triplet
dissociation asymptote and, for the case of Fe(CO)4H2, even higher than the singlet dissociation asymptote. After
crossing to the singlet surface, the addition proceeds directly to the classical cis-dihydride product. Only for the
Fe(CO)4 was it possible to locate a stable energy minimum for the non-classical tautomer (dihydrogen complex), but
the energy difference between this minimum and the tautomerisation transition state inverts when taking into
account the zero-point energy correction. The geometries at the crossing points indicate a side-on approach of the
H2 molecule to the metal for the Fe(CO)4, Fe(CO)2(PH3)2 and Fe(PH3)4 systems. These geometries are more
reactants-like for the Fe(CO)4 system and more product-like for the Fe(PH3)4 system. The crossing point geometry for
the Fe(dpe)2 system, on the other hand, is nearly C2-symmetric. The presence of an energy barrier on going from
3FeL4H2 to the crossing point is in agreement with the slow observed rates for addition of H2 to these unsaturated
organometallic fragments.
Introduction
It has recently been shown that thermal reactions implicating
more than one spin surface are common in different areas of
transition metal chemistry, including oxo-transfer, CH activ-
ation, metal-catalysed polymerisation, and bioinorganic chem-
istry.15 Besides the obvious situations where reactants and
products have different spin, it is also possible that reagents in a
particular spin state are transformed into products of the same
spin, via one or more intermediates of different spin and an
even number of spin crossovers. This event was shown to have
profound effects on reaction rates 6 and on product distri-
butions.7 In many cases, however, the very short lifetime of the
intermediates does not allow their direct identification by
experimental methods. The correct interpretation of reaction
rates and mechanisms, therefore, requires the explicit compu-
tation of the point in configuration space at which the system
crosses from one spin surface to another. This is the point at
minimum energy within the seam of crossing between the two
surfaces, or Minimum Energy Crossing Point (MECP).812 The
ability to locate and characterise MECPs between potential
energy surfaces of different spin for realistic transition-metal
containing systems, first demonstrated in ref. 6, is key to
understanding spin-forbidden reactions.13
Among organometallic reaction intermediates, Fe(CO)4 has
attracted considerable attention. Its ground state triplet is now
solidly established both at the experimental 1422 and theoretical
levels.2333 The experimental observation that the spin-forbidden
CO addition to yield singlet Fe(CO)5 is ca. 400 times slower
than the spin-allowed addition to Fe(CO)3 has prompted the
proposition 15 that this extra barrier is related to the need to

achieve a suitable geometry for the spin crossing to occur,
i.e. the need to reach a MECP. The explicit calculation of the
MECP for this reaction has only recently been carried out 33 and
a good agreement was obtained between the computed and the
experimental activation barriers, in support of the mechanistic
proposition. This observation is relevant because the spin-
forbidden CO additions to other 16-electron triplet complexes
have been shown to be limited by a normal steric barrier while
the crossing point resides on the down-slope leading to the
product.34,35
The oxidative addition of dihydrogen to unsaturated transi-
tion metal complexes is another reaction of fundamental
importance to organometallic chemistry and homogeneous
catalysis. The H2 oxidative addition to Fe(CO)4 has been
investigated experimentally 16 and theoretically.28 The experi-
mental study has shown that the reaction rate is three orders of
magnitude slower than the H2 addition to related electronically
unsaturated complexes, a phenomenon tentatively attributed to
the spin-forbidden character of the process. The theoretical
study, however, did not include the explicit calculation of the
MECP. A related process is the H2 oxidative addition to
M(dmpe)2 (M = Fe and Ru; dmpe = Me2PCH2CH2PMe2).36,37
Interestingly, the rate constant for H2 addition is 7500 times
smaller for Fe(dmpe)2 than for Ru(dmpe)2, whereas the CO
addition is diffusion-controlled for both complexes. A theoreti-
cal study on model M(PH3)4 (M = Fe, Ru) compounds shows
that the Ru species adopts a singlet ground state, whereas the Fe
species adopts a triplet ground state. The study, however, did
not include a thorough analysis of the spin crossover region.38
In this contribution, we intend to examine in more detail (i.e.
including the explicit MECP computation) the reaction co-
ordinate for the spin-forbidden H2 oxidative addition to the
already investigated Fe(CO)4 and Fe(PH3)4 systems, and to
extend the study to the mixed-ligand Fe(CO)2(PH3)2 system, to
the less approximate Fe(dpe)2 model (dpe = PH2CH2CH2PH2)
of the real Fe(dmpe)2 complex, as well as to the real complex
itself.

Results and discussion
Singlet and triplet 16-electron Fe(0) complexes
When studying chemical reactivity, it is essential to use a com-
putational method which is as accurate as possible, and this can
be very hard to achieve in transition metal chemistry given the
delicate balance of exchange and correlation effects, the fre-
quently poor performance of the simplest correlated ab initio
methods such as MP2, and the need for very large basis sets. By
and large, density functional theory (DFT) has been found to
give very good results in the study of inorganic and organo-
metallic systems. However, in a previous study,33 different dens-
ity functionals were found to predict very different energetic
properties for the Fe(CO)4CO system, both for the spin-state
splitting between triplet and singlet Fe(CO)4, and for the bond
energy. After extensive calibration using accurate ab initio
methods (CCSD(T) with large basis sets), it was concluded that
the best description of this system is obtained using a modified
form of the hybrid B3PW91 functional. This new functional,
referred to as B3PW91*, is identical to B3PW91 except that the
coefficient c3 describing the mixing of exact, HartreeFock,
exchange is reduced to 0.15 (vs. 0.20 in B3PW91). This reduced
mixing of exact exchange has been found by others to give
better agreement for spin-state splittings in other iron com-
pounds.39 In our present calculations, we have used this
B3PW91* functional throughout, together with the same type
of flexible, polarised basis set also used in ref. 33, so that the
results should be directly comparable.
As well as considering anew the potential energy surfaces for
addition of H2 to Fe(CO)4, our calculations were extended to
derivatives containing two CO and two PH3 ligands, and to
others containing four P-donor ligands. All systems investi-
gated, and relevant bond distances and angles, are shown in
Fig. 1. The Fe(CO)2(PH3)2 system can exist as three possible
isomers, identified as A, B and C in Fig. 1. Among these, only
isomer A gave a stable minimum in both spin states. Isomer B
only gave a triplet minimum, while isomer C only gave a singlet
minimum. Singlet B reverted to singlet A during the optimis-
ation, whereas triplet C reverted to triplet A. The most stable
isomer is A for both spin states.
All 16-electron Fe(0) complexes were found to adopt a triplet
ground state, the tripletsinglet gap being higher for the tetra-
kis(phosphine) complexes, intermediate for the bis(phosphine)-
dicarbonyl complex, and lowest for the tetracarbonyl com-
plex. This trend agrees with that obtained at the BP86 level
by Macgregor et al.38 on going from Fe(CO)4 to Fe(PH3)4.
Amongst the phosphine derivatives, the tripletsinglet gap var-
ies in the order Fe(PH3)4 > Fe(dpe)2 > Fe(dmpe)2, so that the
dpe complex is a better model than the PH3 complex for the real
dmpe system. Alkyl substitution makes dpe and especially
dmpe a better σ-donor, as confirmed by the greater negative
Mulliken charge on iron in the order Fe(PH3)4 < Fe(dpe)2
< Fe(dmpe)2, for both spin states. The consequent stronger
donating power in the dpe and dmpe complexes is consistent
with the lower tripletsinglet energy gap, although this com-
parison cannot be extended to CO because of π bonding effects.
The geometries are essentially identical in their gross features
for all systems. Both the LaxFeLax and LeqFeLeq angles are
wider for the singlet geometries relative to the corresponding
triplets, whereas all bond distances are slightly shorter in the
singlet structures. The distance to any given ligand is system-
atically longer when this is located in the axial position, no
matter the spin state. The distances obtained for Fe(PH3)4 are
only marginally but systematically longer than those obtained
for the same molecule at the BP86 level,38 for both spin states.
For singlet Fe(CO)4, whose geometry has recently been deter-
mined experimentally by ultrafast electron diffraction methods,
the optimized geometry is in excellent agreement with the
experiment (FeCax 1.81(3) Å; FeCeq 1.77(3) Å; CaxFeCax
169(2); CeqFeCeq 125(3)).22 Substitution effects give the
expected trends. Thus, replacement of two CO ligands with as
many PH3 ligands leads to a FeC bond shortening for the two
residual CO ligands in Fe(CO)2(PH3)2 (independently on the
spin state and stereochemistry), a phenomenon attributable to
the increase of FeCO π back-bonding. Analogously, the fur-
ther replacement of the two residual CO ligands, leading to
Fe(PH3)4, is accompanied by a FePH3 bond shortening, again
independently on the spin state and stereochemistry. This effect
may be attributed to an analogous increase of FePH3 π back-
bonding. The effect of changing the nature of the phosphorus
donor on going from Fe(PH3)4 through Fe(dpe)2 to Fe(dmpe)2
is only marginal on the FeP bond lengths.

associated to the oxidative addition processes are shown in
Table 1 for all systems. Relative to the 16-electron singlet pre-
cursor, the exothermicity increases as the number of P-donor
ligands increases. This correlates with the better ability of the
P-donor ligands to stabilise the formally higher oxidation state.
For the mixed CO/PH3 system, the most stable oxidative addi-
tion product is again derived from isomer A. The energy of the
other isomers increases as the σ-donating power of the ligands
trans to H increases (CO < PH3  H), in agreement with well
known arguments of σ competition and trans labilisation.40,41
Therefore, all further investigations along the H2 oxidative addi-
tion coordinate (see next section) were carried out on this iso-
mer only. The dpe model is worse than the PH3 model for the
dmpe complex in terms of reproducing the energy gain of the
H2 oxidative addition from the singlet state. Both models are
equally inappropriate, on the other hand, for what concerns the
energy gain from the triplet state. The only experimental
data available to compare our results with concerns the tetra-
carbonyl series. From the activation energies for H2 dissociation
from Fe(CO)4(H)2 and for H2 addition to triplet Fe(CO)4, H
for dissociation was determined to be 88  8 kJ mol1.16 Our
computed value of H, 89.5 kJ mol1 is in excellent agreement
with this value. Previous calculations 28 at the BP86 level also
gave good agreement for H, but with a very low singlet/triplet
energy splitting, whereas the B3LYP and BLYP functionals
gave a poor H. These observations are consistent with our
survey of many different functionals 33 and confirm our
impression that B3PW91* gives accurate results for these
iron-containing systems.
Only in the case of Fe(CO)4 was it possible to identify an
intermediate dihydrogen complex as a stable local minimum.
This is 27.1 kJ mol1 less stable than the dihydride product
(cf. 25.9 kJ mol1 at the BP86 level).28 Its geometry and selected
parameters are shown in Fig. 2, together with those of all
classical dihydride products. The transition state (TS) between
the non-classical and classical products has also been opti-
mised. The nature of the resulting geometry as a first-order
saddle point is confirmed by the frequency analysis, which
shows a single imaginary frequency corresponding to the H2
stretch, see Table 1. Its energy is only slightly higher than
the non-classical minimum (1.2 kJ mol1, cf. 1.7 kJ mol1 at the
BP86 level 28), in agreement with a very facile conversion to the
final product. Thus, there is good agreement between the results
obtained with the BP86 and B3PW91* functionals. However,
we note that the energy difference between the non-classical
isomer and the TS is reversed upon adding the zero-point
energy correction and further addition of the thermal and
entropy contributions maintains this reversal. This would seem
to suggest that this non-classical isomer is probably not a true
intermediate in the H2 oxidative addition process.
For the Fe(PH3)4 and Fe(dpe)2 systems, partial geometry
optimisations were carried out with a frozen Fe(H2) unit, keep-
ing the FeH and HFeH parameters fixed at the values found
for the Fe(CO)4(H2) complex. The resulting structures, which
were 56.1 and 44.4 kJ mol1 higher in energy than the corre-
sponding dihydride products, were then further refined freely
and collapsed back to the dihydride products. Given the greater
donor ability of phosphine ligands relative to CO and the
doubtful intermediacy of the non-classical isomer even for the
tetracarbonyl system (vide supra), this is not an unexpected
result. In fact, using Hammonds postulate arguments, it is easy
to accept that the greater exothermicity of the insertion for the
mixed CO/PH3 and for the all-phosphine systems would make
the small barrier to insertion present in the Fe(CO)4 system
completely disappear.
The structures of the products obtained from Fe(CO)4 have
already been extensively discussed previously.28 In particular,
the calculations reproduced the experimental preference for
a cis-dihydride structure relative to the trans isomer. There-
fore, we did not consider the trans structure in our calculations.
Relative to that study, which used the BP86, BLYP and B3LYP
functionals, all distances are slightly shorter and angles are
approximately identical. All these parameters are quite close
to those experimentally determined for cis-FeH2(CO)4.42 The

geometry of the FeH2 moiety is approximately identical in all
dihydride products. On going from the singlet FeL4 to the corre-
sponding cis-FeH2L4 species, all FeLax bonds (trans to each
other) shorten, a phenomenon which may be due to going from
effective Fe(0) to Fe(), whereas all FeLeq bonds (trans to H
ligands) lengthen, a phenomenon which can be attributed to the
strong trans-influence of the hydride ligand. There appears to
be only one structural determination for a cis-FeH2L4 complex
having L = P-donor ligand, i.e. with L = PPh(OEt)2.43 An
appropriate check of the computational accuracy is prevented
by the high uncertainly on the FeH distance [1.50(5) Å], due to
the determination by X-ray diffraction, and by the electronic
difference between the phosphonite ligands [FePax 2.128(7) Å;
Peq 2.149(3) Å] and the phosphines used in our models. There is
a rather good agreement, however, between the computed
values and those observed in this structure. Other related struc-
turally characterised compounds, e.g. FeH2(dppm)2,44 FeH2-
(dppe)2
45 and FeH(HBH3)(dppe)2,46 adopt the alternative trans
geometry.
The computed FeH stretching frequencies follow a clear
trend, being lower when the coordination sphere is more
donating/less π-accepting [e.g. Fe(CO)4H2  Fe(PH3)4H2 >
Fe(dpe)2H2 > Fe(dmpe)2H2]. This trend cannot be attributed to
π competition effects, since the FeH bonds do not have a
π-bonding component. A similar trend has been noted pre-
viously for hydride ligand when the metal is oxidised and the
reasons for this trend have been critically discussed.47 For
instance, the FeH stretching vibrations in a series of Fe()
complex Cp*FeH(LL) are found at lower frequencies than
the corresponding vibrations in the related Fe() complexes
[Cp*FeH(LL)],48,49 and the same trend is observed for
[Cp*WH3(dppe)]n on going from n = 0 to = 1.50 We can there-
fore associate the computed trend of FeH stretching frequen-
cies in compounds Fe(L)4H2 to a similar tuning of the metal
electron density by the nature of the ancillary ligands. For the
series of Fe(CO)2(PH3)4H2 isomers, the frequencies clearly
respond to the influence of the trans ligands and correlate with
the FeH distances.
Minimum energy crossing points
To study the reactivity in these systems, it is of course also
necessary to locate the critical point for H2 addition to the trip-
let reactant. In all the systems studied here, this is the MECP
between the triplet and singlet surfaces in the reactant region of
both potential energy surfaces. At first sight, it may appear
inadequate to consider only the energetics of the MECP. In the
language of transition state theory, the need to cross from one
surface to another adds an extra transmission factor, usually
smaller than unity, to the overall rate coefficient. This explains
why two reactions with an identical MECP energy, but with
much stronger spinorbit coupling in one case than in the
other, will occur at different rates. However, non-adiabatic
versions of transition state theory show that the transmission
factor only varies quadratically with the strength of spin
orbit coupling.51 Furthermore, spinorbit coupling constants
between the singlet and triplet wavefunctions are probably
rather similar at all the MECPs discussed here. In contrast, the
MECP energies described here are significantly different from
system to system, and the rate coefficient varies exponentially

with MECP energy.51 To an excellent first approximation, there-
fore, we focus on the energetics of the MECPs only in this work.
We have located the MECP for approach of dihydrogen to
Fe(CO)4, to isomer A of Fe(CO)2(PH3)2, and to the all-
phosphine systems Fe(PH3)4 and Fe(dpe)2, and the optimised
structures are shown in Fig. 3, with the corresponding energet-
ics in Table 1 and in Fig. 4. In the carbonyl, mixed CO/PH3 and
PH3 systems, the optimized MECP has the incoming H2 mole-
cule lying side-on to the metal, in the plane formed by the two
equatorial ligands, and roughly trans to one of them. In other
words, H2 does not approach along the C2 axis of symmetry of
the unsaturated fragment, which would be the least-motion
pathway for addition to the singlet. The approach of H2 from
the side of the Fe(L)4 moiety is similar to the MECP struc-
ture found for the COFe(CO)4 system, where this mode of
approach was found to give rise to a lower energy MECP as
compared to approach along the C2 axis.33 This preference for
not approaching along the C2 axis may be due to the fact that in
the triplet state, the a1 singly-occupied orbital in 3Fe(CO)4 has
some 4s character and is more repulsive at longer range than the
other, b1 symmetric singly-occupied orbital, which does not
have any 4s character. The MECP for the Fe(dpe)2 system is the
latest and most product-like, and this may explain why it
adopts C2 symmetry, as the singlet state is more attractive with
this type of approach, especially at short MH distances.
In a simple one-dimensional model, the geometry of the
crossing point between the repulsive triplet and attractive sing-
let states would be correlated with the singlettriplet energy gap
of the fragment M(L)4. For the tetracarbonyl, mixed CO/PH3
and tetra-PH3 systems, for which the tripletsinglet energy split-
ting increases in this order, this expected correlation is indeed
observed, as can be seen in Fig. 3: the Fe(CO)4H2 MECP is
earliest, with r(FeH) = ca. 2.2 Å, whereas the other two
systems have r(FeH) = ca. 2.0 and 1.8 Å, respectively. For the
Fe(dpe)2 system, however, the correlation breaks down, since
this has a smaller singlettriplet gap than the Fe(PH3)4 system,
yet the MECP is as noted previously the latest of all those
systems studied, with r(FeH) = 1.71 Å, and a symmetric, C2,
H2 bonding geometry as in the final adduct. This is probably
due to the fact that as noted previously (see e.g. ref. 6) the one-
dimensional model for crossing is inadequate: all the geometric
coordinates need to be the same at the MECP, whereas the
geometries of the metallic fragment in its two spin states are not
the same. In the present case, the geometry of the MECP is
determined not only by the singlettriplet gap, the degree of
FeH2 repulsion in the triplet and of attraction in the singlet,
but also by issues relating to the extent to which the structure of
the singlet and the triplet need to distort so as to reach a com-
mon geometry. Clearly, the latter factor must explain why the
Fe(dpe)2H2 MECP is later than the Fe(PH3)4H2 one, despite
the larger energy splitting in the latter. Related to this issue, it is
also interesting to note that the internal geometry of the FeL4
core in the MECP geometries is closer to the free triplet FeL4
molecule for the first three systems, and closer to the free singlet
FeL4 molecule for the dpe system (cf. Fig. 1 and Fig. 3).
The energy for the MECPs is also of interest. As can be
seen in Fig. 4, all of the MECPs lie higher in energy than the
corresponding 3FeL4H2 dissociation asympote. In fact, the
1,3Fe(CO)4H2 MECP even lies higher in energy than the singlet
dissociation asymptote, and the MECP in the Fe(CO)2(PH3)2
system is very close in energy to the singlet asymptote. This
situation is impossible to explain in the one-dimensional pic-
ture, given that the 1Fe(CO)4H2 interaction is almost purely
attractive, but this is again due to the need to bring both frag-
ments to a common geometry. The relatively high energy of the
MECPs in all cases suggests that the rate of addition of H2 to
unsaturated fragments FeL4 should proceed significantly more
slowly than the collisional or diffusion rate, and this has indeed
been observed experimentally. Gas-phase addition to Fe(CO)4
(under high-pressure limiting conditions) 16 is ca. three orders
of magnitude slower than is typical for addition of H2 to other
coordinatively unsaturated species, and Fe(dmpe)2 reacts with
dihydrogen roughly 7500 times slower than does Ru(dmpe)2
36,37
 the reaction in the latter case involves only singlet states and,
based on calculations carried out for the Ru(PH3)4 model, does
not involve an energy barrier. In this sense, our predictions are
in very good agreement with experiment: the slow observed
rates for addition of H2 to these unsaturated organometallic
fragments are due to the existence of a barrier on the adiabatic
potential energy surface, due to the need to cross from one spin
state to another. In previous work, we have shown that the
height of such barriers can be related to reactivity for CO addi-
tion to Fe(CO)4
33 and for CO and N2 addition to Cp*Mo-
(Cl)(PMe3)2.34,35 In future work, we plan to use a non-adiabatic

version of transition-state theory 33 to evaluate whether our
calculated barrier heights lead to correct prediction of rates for
addition of H2 and other small molecules to Fe(CO)4 and
Fe(dmpe)2. At present, it appears that the fairly large energy
barriers required to reach the MECPs may lead to predicted
rates which are too low, which suggests that further refinement
of the level of theory may be necessary to achieve quantitative
accuracy.
Conclusions
The present computational investigation explores for the first
time the details of the spin crossing region for the H2 oxidative
addition to a spin triplet 16-electron fragment. The approach of
the H2 molecule, a weak ligand, to spin triplet FeL4 is initially
repulsive and necessitates significant molecular rearrangement
before reaching the crossover region, leading to a significant
energy barrier for the reaction. This situation is analogous to
that observed for the oxidative addition of CH bonds to spin
triplet CpIr(PH3) 7 and to Cp2W, Cp*2W and CH2(C5H4)2W,52
whereas the addition of stronger ligands such as CO may occur
without the presence of a spin crossover barrier.1,2
Computational details
All calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 98 pro-
gram code,53 together with a modified form of the B3PW91
functional, and flexible polarized basis sets. Specifically, the c3
coefficient in Beckes original three-parameter fit to thermo-
chemical data 54 was changed to 0.15, to give the B3PW91*
functional. For Fe, C and O and P, the triple-zeta basis sets of
Schfer et al.55 were used. These basis sets were augmented with
two diffuse, 4p-like functions (α = 0.134915 and 0.041843) 56 and
an f polarisation function (α = 1) on iron; and by one d polaris-
ation function on C, O and P (α = 0.8, 1.2 and 0.55, respect-
ively). The hydrogen atoms of the incoming H2 molecule also
used the triple-zeta basis,55 with one p polarisation function (α =
0.75), whereas the hydrogen atoms on the phosphine ligands
were treated with a split-valence basis set.55 All minima and
transition states were fully optimised and characterised by
computing vibrational frequencies at the same level of theory.
MECPs were optimised using the code developed by one of the
authors 12 together with Gaussian98.53 The MECP optimisation
procedure is based on minimising a generalised gradient found
at any geometry by combining the computed energies and
gradients at that point on the two potential energy surfaces. The
gradient contains one term pointing towards the hyperspace in
which the two surfaces intersect, and one term pointing towards
lower energies within this hypersurface. The mixed Fortran/
shell script code (ref. 12, this program is available upon request)
creates Gaussian input files for both spin states at a given geom-
etry, calls Gaussian, extracts energies and gradients from the
output files, tests for convergence, and cycles.
