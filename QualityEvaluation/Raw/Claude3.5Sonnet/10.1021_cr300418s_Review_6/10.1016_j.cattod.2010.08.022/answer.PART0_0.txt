[1] "Density-functional (DF) calculations on the oxidation of Ag surfaces were performed using the QuantumEspresso computational code [83], employing ultrasoft pseudopotentials [84] and the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [85] exchange-correlation functional."

[2] "The DF calculations for the partial oxidation of propylene were carried out using the DACAPO code [86], which also employs ultrasoft pseudopotentials. The set-up is slightly different: the PW91 functional [87] was used for exchange-correlation, and in order to keep the computational cost low (due to the large number of simulations which these type of studies of reaction pathways requires) the energy cut-off for the plane wave basis was slightly lower (25 Ryd)."

[3] "To obtain a relatively accurate model of this type of sites, at a reasonable computational cost, we employed a one-dimensional silver rod, which takes advantage of the periodic symmetry requirements introduced by our plane-wave-based DF approach."

[4] "Overall, the results from the DF simulations agree with the behavior observed in the experiments."

Computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models significantly enhance our ability to predict, analyze, and understand catalytic activity in several ways:

1. Accuracy: DFT calculations can provide accurate predictions of energetics, electronic structures, and reaction pathways at the atomic scale. Different functionals (like PBE and PW91) can be used to balance accuracy and computational cost.

2. Efficiency: Plane-wave based approaches and pseudopotentials allow for efficient calculations on periodic systems. Simplified models (like one-dimensional rods) can be used to study specific features at reduced computational cost.

3. Exploration of new materials: These methods allow for systematic investigation of different catalyst compositions, structures, and reaction conditions without the need for extensive experimental work.

4. Understanding mechanisms: DFT can provide detailed insights into reaction intermediates, transition states, and energetics that are difficult to probe experimentally.

5. Bridging experiment and theory: Computational results can be directly compared to experimental observations to validate models and provide explanations for observed trends.

Key considerations and challenges include:

1. Model selection: Choosing appropriate models that balance accuracy and computational cost is crucial.

2. Functional selection: Different functionals may perform better for different systems or properties.

3. Size effects: Accurately modeling larger nanoparticles or extended surfaces can be computationally demanding.

4. Dynamic effects: Accounting for temperature and pressure effects in static calculations can be challenging.

5. Complex environments: Modeling realistic reaction conditions, including solvent effects or multiple reactants, can be difficult.

Despite these challenges, computational methods provide invaluable insights into catalytic systems, allowing for rational design of new catalysts and deeper understanding of experimental results.

计算方法如密度泛函理论(DFT)和簇模型在多个方面显著增强了我们预测、分析和理解催化活性的能力：

1. 准确性：DFT计算可以在原子尺度上准确预测能量学、电子结构和反应路径。可以使用不同的泛函（如PBE和PW91）来平衡准确性和计算成本。

2. 效率：基于平面波的方法和赝势允许对周期系统进行高效计算。简化模型（如一维棒）可以用于以较低的计算成本研究特定特征。

3. 探索新材料：这些方法允许系统地研究不同的催化剂成分、结构和反应条件，而无需进行大量实验工作。

4. 理解机理：DFT可以提供关于反应中间体、过渡态和能量学的详细见解，这些在实验中难以探测。

5. 连接实验和理论：计算结果可以直接与实验观察进行比较，以验证模型并为观察到的趋势提供解释。

主要考虑因素和挑战包括：

1. 模型选择：选择适当的模型以平衡准确性和计算成本至关重要。

2. 泛函选择：不同的泛函可能对不同的系统或性质表现更好。

3. 尺寸效应：准确建模更大的纳米粒子或扩展表面可能在计算上具有挑战性。

4. 动态效应：在静态计算中考虑温度和压力效应可能具有挑战性。

5. 复杂环境：建模真实反应条件，包括溶剂效应或多种反应物，可能很困难。

尽管存在这些挑战，计算方法仍为催化系统提供了宝贵的见解，允许理性设计新的催化剂并更深入地理解实验结果。
