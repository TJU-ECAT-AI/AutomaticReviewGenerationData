[1] "Density-functional (DF) calculations on the oxidation of Ag surfaces were performed using the QuantumEspresso computational code [83], employing ultrasoft pseudopotentials [84] and the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) [85] exchange-correlation functional."

[2] "The DF calculations for the partial oxidation of propylene were carried out using the DACAPO code [86], which also employs ultrasoft pseudopotentials. The set-up is slightly different: the PW91 functional [87] was used for exchange-correlation, and in order to keep the computational cost low (due to the large number of simulations which these type of studies of reaction pathways requires) the energy cut-off for the plane wave basis was slightly lower (25 Ryd)."

[3] "To obtain a relatively accurate model of this type of sites, at a reasonable computational cost, we employed a one-dimensional silver rod, which takes advantage of the periodic symmetry requirements introduced by our plane-wave-based DF approach."

[4] "Overall, the results from the DF simulations agree with the behavior observed in the experiments."

Computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) enhance our ability to predict, analyze and understand catalytic activity in several key ways:

1. Accuracy: DFT calculations can provide detailed information about electronic structure, adsorption energies, and reaction barriers that agree well with experimental observations. Different functionals (like PBE or PW91) can be used to balance accuracy and computational cost.

2. Efficiency: Plane-wave DFT codes like QuantumEspresso and DACAPO, along with pseudopotentials, allow for efficient calculations on periodic systems. Simplified models (like 1D rods for edge sites) can be used to reduce computational costs while maintaining key features.

3. Exploration of new materials: DFT allows for systematic investigation of different surfaces, facets, and defect sites that may be difficult to isolate experimentally. This can guide the design of new catalytic materials.

4. Mechanistic insights: Calculations can reveal reaction intermediates, transition states, and competing pathways, providing a molecular-level understanding of catalytic processes.

Key challenges include:
- Balancing accuracy and computational cost
- Modeling realistic reaction conditions and complex oxide surfaces
- Accounting for dynamic effects and restructuring under reaction conditions

Despite these challenges, DFT and cluster models have proven to be powerful tools for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior, complementing experimental studies and guiding catalyst development.

计算方法如密度泛函理论(DFT)通过以下几种关键方式增强了我们预测、分析和理解催化活性的能力:

1. 准确性:DFT计算可以提供关于电子结构、吸附能和反应势垒的详细信息,这些信息与实验观察结果吻合良好。可以使用不同的泛函(如PBE或PW91)来平衡准确性和计算成本。

2. 效率:像QuantumEspresso和DACAPO这样的平面波DFT代码,加上赝势,允许对周期性系统进行高效计算。可以使用简化模型(如用于边缘位点的一维棒)来降低计算成本,同时保留关键特征。

3. 新材料探索:DFT允许系统地研究不同的表面、晶面和缺陷位点,这些在实验中可能难以分离。这可以指导新催化材料的设计。

4. 机理洞察:计算可以揭示反应中间体、过渡态和竞争路径,提供对催化过程的分子水平理解。

主要挑战包括:
- 平衡准确性和计算成本
- 模拟真实反应条件和复杂的氧化物表面
- 考虑反应条件下的动态效应和重构

尽管存在这些挑战,DFT和团簇模型已被证明是理解和预测催化行为的强大工具,可以补充实验研究并指导催化剂开发。
