The catalytic activity of oxide-supported metal nanoclusters strongly depends on their size and
support. In this study, the origin of morphology transformation and chemical state changes
during the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene was investigated in terms of metal-support
interactions. Model catalyst systems were prepared by deposition of size selected subnanometer
Co274 clusters on various metal oxide supports (Al2O3, ZnO and TiO2 and MgO). The oxidation
state and reactivity of the supported cobalt clusters were investigated by temperature programmed
reaction (TPRx) and in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption (GIXAS) during oxidative
dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, while the sintering resistance monitored with grazing incidence
small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). The activity and selectivity of cobalt clusters shows
strong dependence on the support. GIXAS reveals that metal-support interaction plays a key role
in the reaction. The most pronounced support effect is observed for MgO, where during the
course of the reaction in its activity, composition and size dynamically evolving nanoassembly is
formed from subnanometer cobalt clusters.
Introduction
Cyclic hydrocarbon conversion to benzene is important in
petroleum refining and reforming processes.1 To develop a
new catalyst for cyclohexane conversion, it would be greatly
helpful to understand support and size effects in the conversion
of the cyclohexene intermediate since the rate determining step
in the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene is the
dehydrogenation of the cyclohexene intermediate. This step
requires specific orientation of the adsorbed cyclohexene
relative to the catalyst surface, thus a catalytic particle with
optimal size and morphology.2,3 Therefore, dehydrogenation
of cyclohexene has been used for key kinetic and structure-
function studies for cyclohexane dehydrogenation.46 A reaction
mechanism is proposed where the s-adsorption is followed by
a stepwise elimination of H2 from cyclohexane to cyclohexene
and cyclohexadiene intermediates, and the ps shift of the
adsorbed cyclohexene is identified as a rate determining step.7
Adsorption and reaction studies carried out using cyclohexane,
cyclohexene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, and benzene on the Pt(111)
surface also suggest that cyclohexane conversion to cyclohexene
and dehydrogenation of 1,3-cyclohexadiene to benzene proceeds
rapidly to completion.2
Because of its high activity and selectivity, most of the
studies have concentrated on Pt810 and its alloys5,8,11 as
catalysts, however, non-precious metal catalysts have drawn
more attention recently.1,4,1113 Cobalt is one of the promising
candidates for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of cyclohexane.
In addition, cobalt is known as a good oxidation catalyst such as in
the transformation of cyclohexane to KA oil (cyclohexanone
cyclohexanol mixture).1416 Only very few studies have been
reported on cobalt based cyclohexene dehydrogenation catalysis.17
In addition, oxidative dehydrogenations1,13,17,18 by cobalt catalyst
can overcome a thermodynamic limitation of dehydrogenation of
cyclohexane (endothermic, DH = 49.3 kcal mol1)12 and
coking issues which cause deactivation of catalyst.
A logical pathway to the development of such non-precious
metal catalyst is the tailoring of the catalyst size control and of
support properties.4,15,19 To develop in size and composition,
well defined tailored catalyst, it is essential to combine sophisticated
high-fidelity materials fabrication with atomic precision and in situ
characterization tools to understand the behavior and nature of the
catalyst under realistic reaction conditions. Thus, the activity of
catalysts needs to be followed along with the evolution of catalysts

size/shape, its sintering-resistance and chemical state during
the course of the reaction.
Here we report catalytic cyclohexene conversion to benzene,
which is the rate determining step in cyclohexane to benzene
conversion reaction, in the oxidative dehydrogenation on
supported, size selected cobalt clusters. The correlation
between catalytic properties and support-metal interactions
is discussed using in situ grazing incidence X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (GIXAS) and grazing incidence small angle
X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data collected on these systems,
coupled with temperature-programmed reaction (TPRx). The
high surface sensitivity of grazing incidence techniques,
including GISAXS and GIXAS enables the study the chemical
state and morphology of metal nanoparticles deposited on flat
substrate with less than one tenth of monolayer coverage.
GISAXS has been proven to be a very powerful tool to
study morphological transformations of nanoparticles under
a reactive gas environment under atmospheric pressure.1925
Recently published series of reports show successful employ-
ments of various combinations of the GISAXS, GIXAS and
TPRx techniques.19,2123,26
1.
Experimental
For catalyst support materials, 3 ML thick amorphous MgO,
Al2O3, ZnO, and TiO2 films were prepared by atomic layer
deposition (ALD) on the top of a naturally oxidized silicon
wafers (SiO2/Si(100))13,19,21,23 using a custom viscous flow
ALD reactor. The size-selected cobalt cluster catalysts were
prepared by depositing a narrow size-distribution of cobalt
clusters generated in a laser vaporization cluster source. The
size-selected cluster deposition method was described in detail
elsewhere.19,21,23,25,27,28 In brief, a molecular beam of cobalt
clusters was prepared by laser vaporization of a cobalt target
with helium as carrier gas. Then, the beam was guided through
an ion optics and quadrupole assembly, and the mass-selected,
positively charged clusters soft-landed (o1 eV/atom) on the
support.25 The amount of deposited cobalt metal was deter-
mined by real-time monitoring of the deposition flux.25 The
surface coverage at the deposition spots was 0.1 ML equivalent
of Co metal; the corresponding Co loading, 11.6 ng was kept
identical in each sample. The uncertainty in the determination
of the metal loading was 10% or better.25,26
The X-ray experiments were performed using a unique setup
developed at the Sector 12-ID-C at the Advanced Photon
Source of the Argonne National Laboratory.29 The schematic
of the combined TPRx/GISAXS/GIXAS experiment is shown
in Fig. 1. GISAXS was performed with 8 keV X-rays in a
home built reaction cell with an internal volume of 25 cm3.29
The cluster sample was placed on the top of the ceramic heater
center in the cell. The cell was sealed with Kapton windows
and mounted on a computer controlled goniometer. A 1024 
1024 pixel two-dimensional CCD detector (MarCCD) was
used for recording the GISAXS images from the sample.
GISAXS data were collected as a function of reaction
temperature and time. The collected data were processed
and analyzed by FitGISAXS package.30 GIXAS data were
collected by a 4-element fluorescence detector (Vortex 4
element SDD) mounted perpendicular to the X-ray beam
and parallel to the sample surface as a function of reaction
temperature and time. The collected data were analyzed using
the IFEFFIT interactive software package (with ATHENA
and ARTEMIS graphical interfaces).31
During the GISAXS/GIXAS characterization, simulta-
neous reactivity measurements were also conducted. The gas
reactants used were 4000 ppm cyclohexene in helium and
99.9% oxygen (AirGas), and the ratio for cyclohexene and
O2 was kept at 1 : 10 by preparing the mixture in a remotely
controlled gas-mixing unit consisting of calibrated mass flow
controllers (Brooks model SLA5850). The reaction cell was
operated in a 30 cm3 min1 continuous flow mode at 800 torr.
The products were analyzed using a differentially pumped
mass-spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum Prisma Plus QMS 220 M2).
The reaction temperature was controlled by heating the sample
placed on the top of the ceramic heater (Momentive Performance
Materials Inc.) with a K-type thermocouple attached to the edge
of the heater surface and a temperature controller (Lakeshore
model 340) for precision temperature control (o  0.5 1C). To
achieve thermal equilibrium between the heater and sample
during the application of a temperature ramp, a low heating
rate (o10 1C min1.) was used between temperature steps.
15 min were spent at each temperature, to provide sufficient
time for the collection of GISAXS and GIXAS data.
For the on-line analysis of the gas mixture which was
extracted from the reaction cell during the course of the
reaction, the mass spectrometer was operated in continuous
mass scanning mode (1 scan/min.) which allows for a simulta-
neous monitoring of the ion current corresponding to a mass
range of up to 100 amu for the reactants and all possible
reaction products. The fragment patterns from the standard
gases were also compared with the NIST mass spectra of
benzene, carbon dioxide and water as well as other possible
reaction products. To quantify the reactants and products, the
sensitivity factors of the mass spectrometer for individual
molecules were calculated using calibrated gas mixtures
(certified analytical grade mixed gas, Air Gas Inc.). The
uncertainty was estimated to be B2% of the ion current.
The TPRx data collected for the cluster samples were
backround corrected by using TPRx background signals
obtained by using a blank support (i.e. identical wafer without
deposited clusters) with identical temperature ramp and
reaction conditions as applied for the cluster samples. The
calculation of the turn-over rates (TOR) was based on the
Fig. 1
Schematic of system setup for combined in situ GISAXS,
GIXAS and TPRx experiment.

tion an estimated 10% uncertainty in the determination of the
number of deposited atoms, the error in determination of the
turn-over rates was estimated to be about 10%.26

Results and discussion
The normalized XANES spectra (Co-K edge) of Co clusters
supported on MgO and Al2O3 are presented in Fig. 2 as
a function of reaction temperature. The Co samples are
first measured in helium background at room temperature
and then in cyclohexene and oxygen mixture at indicated
temperatures. The XANES spectra (Co-K) of the as prepared
sample and the spectra in reaction gas environment up to
200 1C are similar to each other and show a broad XAS
feature. Based on comparison with bulk standards, up to 200 1C,
the main part of cobalt species in the samples is present as a CoO
dominant phase mixed with Co3O4 under applied reaction
conditions. A sudden change occurs at 250 1C in the Co/MgO
sample, which includes forming a sharper peak at 7727 eV and
distinct two shoulder feature at lower energy. The changes are
more pronounced at 300 1C, and no further change are observed
within the 45 min time interval at this temperature, which
indicates this form is stable at the temperature. The well
developed new features are clearly observed in Co/MgO
sample starting at 250 1C, while the Al2O3 supported cobalt
shows only a broadening in white line feature and slight
change in near the edge region, which further develops with
increasing temperature. The change in Co/MgO sample
indicates transformation to a higher oxidation state, Co3O4,
or surface alloy like CoxMg1xO with the MgO support.3234
Presumably, at high temperature cobalt and MgO form a
mixed oxide which drives oxidation state and structural
changes. MgO is known to be a non-reducible oxide, and
our concurrent study shows that ZnO, TiO2, and Al2O3
supported cobalt catalysts do not show similar change in
cobalt oxidation state under identical reaction conditions.
A subtle change occurs during the cooling ramp, the lower
energy shoulder feature diminished, and the cobalt feature
returns close to Co3O4, which indicates that CoxMg1xO
formed at 300 1C may be stable only at high temperature.
The Co-K edge feature of CoxMg1xO has been reported to be
very sensitive to the stoichiometry in CoxMg1xO.32 It is
well known that CoMgO solid solution can be formed at
relatively low temperatures (o100 1C)34,35,41 and that high
concentration of weakly chemisorbed oxygen species result in
CoMgO solid solution as a good catalyst for hydrolysis of
glycerol,34 N2O catalytic decomposition,35,41 CO2 reforming of
CH4
33 and ethanol steam reforming,42 although the reducibility
of cobalt oxides is greatly decreased in the Co3O4/MgO
precursor.35 The temperature-dependent change in XANES
feature of the Co/MgO cluster sample can be well correlated
with the reported spectra of CoxMg1xO which change with Mg
content.32 The spectrum of the Co/MgO sample at 250 1C
closely resembles the spectrum of CoxMg1xO with Co fraction
of x = 0.67, while the spectrum of clusters at 300 1C indicates a
dramatic increase in the Mg content, with the fraction of Co as
low as x = 0.10. The differences between the spectral features of
Co/MgO and CoxMg1xO at energies above B7.73 keV
presumably arise from a Co3O4 fraction present in the
cluster sample, however an (additional) contribution from
subnanometer effects cannot be entirely excluded at this point.
Quantitative determination of the fraction of each mixed oxide
state is greatly complicated since CoO, Co3O4 and Co, as well as
with a temperature evolving distribution of CoxMg1xO
compositions can coexist, and the bulk reference spectra do
not necessary represent subnanometer clusters due to: (a)
intrinsic electronic structure difference between subnanometer
clusters and bulk state and (b) strong interaction between small
clusters and support oxides.
In situ GISAXS shows a clear difference between the Co
sample evolution depending of the support. GISAXS data
collected on cobalt clusters supported on Al2O3 (Fig. 3a), TiO2
and ZnO do not reveal any changes in particle size under
reaction conditions, thus providing evidence about the sintering-
resistance of the cobalt clusters during two hours of reaction.
Fig. 3 shows temperature dependent line cut (horizontal) profiles
and typical 2D-GISAXS image of Co/MgO sample. The 2-D
linecut data has been fitted to particle size and distribution as
shown in Fig. 3c. At room temperature, GISAXS represent
dominant substrate scattering with a little contribution from
cobalt nanoparticles, which indicates that the clusters are in
subnanometer size range, as-prepared. At the applied surface
coverage and photon energy used a quantitative analysis of
particles smaller than 1 nm is rather difficult, because of the
roughness of metal oxide supports prepared by ALD method,
which have a r1 nm of surface roughness. Moreover, the
roughness of the MgO surface is expected to change because
during the reaction a fraction of the surface Mg(O) dissolves in
the supported clusters, forming CoMgO particles. Since
such changes in the support roughness are not possible to
deconvolute from the total scattering, the interpretation of the
data is limited to particle sizes larger than 1nm. A slight
change in the GISAXS pattern is noticeable in the small q
range (B1 nm1) at 250 1C, followed by the most significant
change observed at 300 1C, which indicates the formation of
nanostructure with very sharp size distribution. For the GISAXS
data fitting, supported island model with log normal distribution

has been used with FitGISAXS program.30 At 300 1C, the nano-
clusters transform into B2.5 nm  1.6 nm (diameter  height)
nanostructures with a narrow size distribution. More interesting
features appeared when the sample was cooled down to room
temperature. The average particle size shrank to B1.8 nm with a
B2 nm broad size distribution. This sequence of changes cannot
be simply interpreted by thermal sintering because of reversible
change during the cooling cycle and unique feature development
only on Co/MgO system. Since MgO is a non-reducible support,
there is no strong electronic effect between cobalt and MgO,
which could facilitate chemical transformation from CoO to
other form of oxides. Presumably, well dispersed subnan-
ometer cobalt clusters can be transformed to CoMgO solid
solution rather easily in oxidation environment at high
temperature,3335 and the preformed metastable CoMgO
cluster solid solution can be in good part reversibly transformed
to CoOxMgO system at low temperature. Also, we note that
the increased final B1.8 nm lateral diameter of the clusters after
reaction could arise from the combination of altered shape of
the building cluster blocks, as well as from larger clusters that
retained a fraction of Mg(O) from the solid CoMgO solution
formed at 300 1C.
As discussed in the Introduction, the dehydrogenation of
cyclohexene is structure sensitive and it is essential to provide
well accessible two or three fold binding sites for cyclohexene
to transform to benzene.46 Unlike the other metal oxides
supported clusters, Co/MgO has a highly dynamically evolving
structure and forms 23 nm size particles at 300 1C during the
reaction, which presumably adapts to provide the needed
binding sites for cyclohexene and other reaction intermediates
during dehydrogenation to benzene. The size effect on cyclo-
hexene dehydrogenation on Pt nanoparticles has been reported
with various particle sizes. It shows that the rate of dehydro-
genation of cyclohexene to benzene decreases monotonically
over the particle size range from 1 to 9 nm.4 It clearly shows
that the size is critical for the reaction rate while the optimum
size and structure of the active site could be strongly dependent
on the system.
Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show the TPRx profile of oxidative dehydro-
genation of cyclohexene on Co/MgO and Co/Al2O3 systems,
respectively. Major reaction products are CO2, water and benzene.
There are no KA oil related products observed during the
reaction in any of the subnanometer cobalt cluster based
catalysts. Most of side products are CO2 and water from the
total oxidation of cyclohexene. At 300 1C, the cyclohexene
signal decreases at 300 1C by B18% for the Co/MgO system
and by B10% for the Co/Al2O3, Co/ZnO and Co/TiO2
systems from the initial signal level at room temperature. In
addition to main reaction products (benzene, CO2 and water),
a trace amount of cyclohexadiene is also observed at B250 1C, but
disappears at higher temperatures at which benzene formation
becomes more dominant. Presumably, electronically localized
nature of small size cobalt cluster suppresses formation of radical
intermediates for oxidation of cyclohexene. Also, the relatively
stable adsorption complex which is formed between cyclohexene
and cobalt catalyst may be less favorable for radical formation
than one from cyclohexane and cobalt.
With the in situ GISAXS data, it is possible to unambiguously
distinguish between support and size effects in the systems
studied. Up to temperatures of 200 1C, the clusters retain their
subnanometer size on all four supports, thus their catalytic
performance can be discussed as function of the support. The
support effects for the Co/ZnO, Co/TiO2, and Co/Al2O3 systems
can be also compared up to 300 1C. However, in the case of the
Co/MgO system, above 200 1C the performance is assigned to
nanometer size structures assembled from subnanometer Co
cluster building blocks, moreover with evolving complex
composition/oxidation state as indicated by in situ GIXAS.
The Co/Al2O3, Co/TiO2 and Co/ZnO systems show similar
activity (Fig. 4c) and selectivity (Fig. 4d), with Co/ZnO possessing
the highest activity and selectivity towards benzene production in
the entire temperature region among the Co/Al2O3, Co/TiO2

and Co/ZnO trio. However, in the subnm size region (i.e. up to
200 1C), the Co/MgO system clearly outperforms all the other
systems (Fig. 4c and d). Especially, at low temperature ben-
zene selectivity of MgO at 150 and 200 1C is about order of
magnitude higher than the ones from Co/Al2O3, Co/TiO2 and
Co/ZnO. This indicates that the Co/MgO cluster has an
intrinsic difference in electronic structure even before to form
a Co-Mg-O solid solution.
In extended time of reaction at 300 1C the Co/Al2O3,
Co/ZnO and Co/TiO2 systems show oscillatory behavior in
their activity (Fig. 4c). Since during the time window of the
measurement at 300 1C only two cycles could be observed,
based on the limited data we can only hypothesize that
the observed oscillations strongly resemble oscillations in
reactivity induced by cyclic adsorptiondesorption of reactants,
products or intermediates during the oxidation of CO
oxidation3638 or benzaldehyde.39 Unfortunately, the current
XANES setup is not optimized for quick XAS to track the
changes in chemical state change of the catalyst on this
timescale. Even more interestingly, the formation of CO2
and benzene seems competing with each other during the
oscillatory isothermal reaction, with a lowered fraction of
benzene produced at points of lowered activity (see activity
and selectivity at 100 and 120 min in Fig. 4c and d,
respectively).
Per cobalt atom temperature-dependent turnover rates of
benzene formation on Co/MgO, Co/Al2O3, Co/TiO2 and
Co/ZnO systems reveal significantly increased activity at 250 1C
for all four systems, however the by a factor of B23 higher
activity of the Co/MgO correlates with the change of
the oxidation state/composition of the catalytic particles
(cf. XANES in Fig. 2) and the assembly of subnanometer
clusters into a nanostructure (see GISAXS, Fig. 3c). At
250 1C, the B1.5 nm assembly formed in the Co/MgO system
outperforms Co/Al2O3, Co/TiO2 and Co/ZnO in both activity
and selectivity. However at 300 1C, though the B2.5 nm
structure of the Co/MgO system still exhibits the highest
activity, the Co/Al2O3, Co/ZnO and Co/TiO2 systems have
somewhat higher selectivity towards benzene formation. Onset
of product formation on subnanometer cobalt clusters is observed
at 150 1C, which demonstrates the capability of sub-nm (oxidized)
cobalt clusters to activate O2 at low temperatures.

Oxidative dehydrogenation studies on cyclohexene are
scarce.1,40 Recently published results based on TiO2 supported
Au, Pd and AuPd catalyst show high activity at relatively low
temperatures; 99% benzene selectivity and 100% conversion
at 150 1C.1 On the contrary, under the same conditions over
Co-ZSM5, the cyclohexane conversion becomes significant
only at temperatures above 430 1C and increases to 45% by
increasing the temperature to 610 1C.1 The main products
at low conversion are COx whereas at higher temperature
benzene becomes the most important product.18 For comparison,
vanadia based catalyst has been reported for ODH of cyclohexane
with relatively high reaction temperature (4400 1C).13,18 These
examples on cyclohexane dehydrogenation (since cyclohexene
dehydrogenation the rate limiting step) demonstrate that (bulkier)
cobalt and vanadia based ODH catalysts have a considerably
higher light offtemperature than their subnanometer size cobalt
counterparts.
3.
Conclusions
The presented results show that oxide-supported catalysts made
of subnanometer cobalt clusters have a light up temperature
around 150 1C and maintain high reactivity up to 300 1C in the
oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexene, while their activity
and selectivity towards benzene formation strongly depends
on the support used and on the size and oxidation state/
composition of the active particles. The low light offtempera-
ture and observed turnover rates can make such materials
attractive alternatives to precious metal based dehydrogena-
tion catalysts, but also for other oxidative processes.
The most interesting finding behind the high activity of
MgO supported catalyst is the dynamic formation of a cluster-
based nanoassembly composed of a solid oxide CoxMg1xO
and Co3O4 like mixture during the reaction. These highly
dynamic nanostructures seem to adapt their size and morphology
to offer optimal active sites for the reaction.
Summing it up, the presented study demonstrats that the
performance of subnanometer cobalt catalysts can be tuned by
the size and composition of the catalyst as well as support
used, and that in situ GISAXS/GIXAS are instrumental at the
identification of the size and nature of the working catalysts
under realistic reaction conditions.
