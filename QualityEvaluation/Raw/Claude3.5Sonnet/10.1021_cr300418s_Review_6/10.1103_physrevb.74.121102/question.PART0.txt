Nearly quantitative agreement between density functional theory DFT and diffusion Monte Carlo DMC
calculations is shown for the prediction of defect properties using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof HSE
screened-exchange hybrid functional. The HSE functional enables accurate computations on complex systems,
such as defects, where traditional DFT may be inadequate and DMC calculation computationally unfeasible.
The screened-exchange hybrid functional retains the benefits of earlier hybrid functionals in terms of treating
strongly correlated insulators but unlike them it can be applied to metallic phases. This study concentrates on
the DFT energetic predictions of point defects in silicon and on phase energy differences between the diamond
and metallic -tin phases.

The prediction of energy landscapes from density func-
tional theory DFT has often lacked the predictive power
necessary to quantitatively anticipate experimental results
such as phase diagrams and properties of point defects. This
predictive capability is most needed when experiments are
unable to measure desired properties directly, for example
indirect probes of the existence and behavior of point defects
has led to disagreements regarding the individual contribu-
tions of interstitial and vacancy defects to self-diffusion.1,2
The first two generations of DFT functionals, the local den-
sity approximation LDA and the generalized gradient ap-
proximations GGA,35 yield structural properties in reason-
able agreement with experiments, but the energetics of
defects have been known to be poorly reproduced. For ex-
ample, for both Si and Ge, two group-IV semiconductors, the
LDA and GGA predict self-diffusion activation energies that
are about 1.5 and 1 eV lower, respectively, than experimental
measurements.6 This is also true for the diffusion of dopants
in these materials.6 For nearly every case considered for
these materials, the predicted activation energy is roughly
1 eV lower than that found by experiment. In addition, DFT
with the GGA predicts the semiconductor Ge to be metallic.
Without quantitative predictions of point defect properties,
the modeling of larger-scale phenomena, such as dopant pro-
files in Si or microstructure in an irradiated material, will be
inadequate.
Higher computational accuracy can be achieved with the
diffusion Monte Carlo DMC approach, although at a
greater computational expense. DMC calculations have been
performed on key structures, and past work7 has shown that
DMC calculations on interstitial defects in Si find formation
energies that are significantly higher than those from DFT
with the GGA and thus closer to experimental estimates. A
computational method that combines the relative ease of
DFT computations with the accuracy of DMC simulation is
certainly needed in order to obtain quantitative predictive
power of what would be very difficult experiments. In this
vein, third- and fourth-generation density functionals have
recently been developed but as yet remain untested in this
energetic context. In this work two of the latest generation of
DFT functionals are compared to highly converged DMC
calculations of point defects in solid silicon, and the relative
energy between two phases of silicon, the diamond phase
and -tin, which is metallic. The functionals to be examined
are the meta-GGAs, which extend the expansion of the
exchange-correlation energy8 to include the kinetic energy
density, and a hybrid functional, which contains a portion
of the full, nonlocal, Hartree-Fock-type exchange. We find a
steady improvement in the quality of the results as we
progress along the rungs of Perdews Jacobs ladder to
DFT heaven.9 In fact, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid
functional10 is found to give results in excellent agreement
with our DMC benchmark. In addition, the HSE functional
has the advantage over previous hybrid functionals of being
applicable for systems with a metallic band structure.
As the focus of this paper is an evaluation of functionals,
as opposed to direct comparison with experiment, diffusion
Monte Carlo calculations provide our standard of accuracy.
The DMC simulation is a many-body method based on cor-
related wave functions and stochastic computational tech-
niques that solves the full many-body Schrdinger equation
to high accuracy. It involves only two essential approxima-
tions, namely, the fixed-node approximation and, for heavy
atoms, the pseudopotential approximation. It typically recov-
ers over 95% of the correlation energy, provided that well-
optimized wave functions are employed. Calculations for pe-
riodic systems also include a finite-size extrapolation.

Ernzerhof.10 For completeness the results for the LDA and
GGA Perdew and Wang 1991 Refs. 3 and 4 PW91 and
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof Ref. 5 PBE functionals are also
reported. The TPSS functional augments the GGA with
kinetic-energy-density-dependent terms. The HSE functional
mixes in a fraction 25% of exact screened Hartree-Fock
exchange as done in the PBE hybrid11 PBEh functional.23
The key difference in the HSE, relative to the PBEh func-
tional, is that the exact exchange term is screened at large
distances, effectively giving a hybrid functional only at short
range and GGA behavior at long range. The optimal screen-
ing length of 3.5 Å was chosen to best reproduce molecular
formation enthalpies on a training set of molecules.10 As a
result the HSE functional delivers the same accuracy in mo-
lecular energies already reported for hybrid functionals.
Somewhat surprisingly, we have recently demonstrated that
it provides band gaps in good agreement with experiment for
a benchmark set of 40 semiconductors.12 In this regard the
HSE functional is similar in spirit to the screened exchange
methodology of Bylander and Kleinman.13 Most importantly,
since the radius of convergence of the exact exchange inter-
action scales inversely proportionally to the band gap of the
solid, previous hybrid functionals are more computationally
demanding than the HSE and are even unusable for metallic
systems. This problem is eliminated with the screening intro-
duced in the HSE functional, allowing us to simulate not
only the semiconductor phases of silicon but also the -tin
phase, which is metallic, and point defects, which introduce
energy levels in the gap region.
Identical atomic configurations are used for all the meth-
odologies explored. For the volume of the diamond phase we
use 20 Å3 per atom and for the -tin phase we chose a value
of 15 Å3 per atom and a c/a ratio of 0.55 close to the ex-
perimental values. The structure of the point defects is cal-
culated using the PW91 functional,3,4 which in periodic sys-
tems usually results in geometries close to those found in
experiment. These calculations are performed with VASP,14
using an ultrasoft Vanderbilt-type pseudopotential15,16 with a
cutoff energy of 250 eV and an 888 k-point mesh. The
HSE calculations are carried out using the development ver-
sion of the GAUSSIAN suite of programs17 with a modified
6-311G2d basis set with a sampling of 800 k points. To
avoid redundancies in the description of the electron density
of the solid state, the smallest Gaussian exponent is set to
0.12 a.u.
The DMC calculations are performed using the CHAMP
code developed by Umrigar and Filippi. The 1s, 2s, and 2p
electrons
of
Si
are

using
a
Hartree-Fock
pseudopotential.18 A Slater-Jastrow-type wave function is
used as the trial wave function. The orbitals of the Slater
determinant are taken from a DFT calculation with the
CPW2000 code of Martins using the PBE functional. The pa-
rameters of the Jastrow function describing electron-electron
and electron-nuclear correlations are optimized using a re-
cently developed energy minimization method.19
The relative energy of the SiI diamond and SiII
-tin phases assesses the accuracy of our functional for
predicting bulk energies. The diamond phase is the ground
state of silicon; it is a semiconductor with a band gap of
1.12 eV. At a pressure of about 10 GPa the diamond phase
transforms into the metallic -tin phase. The atomic arrange-
ments of these two phases are shown in Fig. 1.
We calculate the energy difference between the diamond
and the -tin phases of Si using the DMC method. For these
crystal phases the finite-size error is significant. Extrapolat-
ing the energy from calculations for simulation cells of 16
250 atoms results in an energy difference of 48050 meV.
The total error of the energy difference between the diamond
and -tin phases includes a finite-size error of about
30 meV/atom and a combined statistical, time-step and
population control error of about 10 meV/atom. We estimate
the fixed-node and pseudopotential error to be of the order of
10 meV/atom,
resulting
in
the
total
error
of
about
50 meV/atom. Earlier DMC calculations18 predicted an en-
ergy difference between the diamond and -tin phase of
50510 meV/atom. Our error estimate of 50 meV/atom is
larger than their estimate because we also include estimates
of systematic errors in addition to the statistical error. Our
slightly lower energy for the -tin phase might be related to
the use of the improved energy optimization method for the
trial wave function.19
The energies found with the LDA, GGA, and HSE func-
tionals of density functional theory are compared relative to
the DMC value of 48050 meV/atom. The pure density
functionals underestimate the energy difference by 55% for
the LDA 216 meV/atom, 29% for the GGA PW91
339 meV/atom, 38% for the GGA PBE 299 meV/atom,
and 45% for the meta-GGA TPSS 266 meV/atom. We
choose to report the calculations with both these GGA pa-
rametrizations because they do not predict the same energy
difference between the two phases; in fact they differ from
each other by 12%. The hybrid HSE functional is within the

lar bond energies, this result shows the excellent applicabil-
ity of this functional to the solid phase.
The behavior of the pure density functionals LDA,
PW91, and TPSS can be understood by the slowly varying
density expansion.8 The metallic -tin phase exhibits a more
homogeneous electron density than the covalently bound
semiconducting diamond phase. The LDA does not account
for the effect of density gradients on the exchange and cor-
relation energy and has a tendency to favor more homoge-
neous systems. Hence it describes the -tin better, being a
fairly homogeneous charge distribution, but diamond not so
well, since it is not so homogeneous. Since -tin lies above
diamond in energy, the difference is smaller than it should
be. The GGA PW91 functional3,4 has the correct slowly
varying density expansion to second order in the density gra-
dients and the meta-GGA to fourth order.9 In contrast to the
LDA, GGA PBE, and meta-GGA TPSS, the GGA PW91
functional does not correctly reproduce the linear response of
the uniform electron gas. Both the GGA and meta-GGA im-
prove the description of the relative energy of the Si phases
over the LDA with the meta-GGA TPSS falling between the
LDA and GGA results. In contrast, the HSE screened hybrid
functional agrees very closely with the DMC results. The
origin of this is likely the improved description of covalent
bonds by the HSE functional which results in a more accu-
rate energy for the covalently bound diamond phase.
After establishing the accuracy of the HSE functional for
crystalline solids, we examine the different density function-
als on interstitial defect configurations in the diamond phase.
Figure 2 shows the structure of the three lowest-energy in-
terstitial defects in Si: X split, H hexagonal site, and T
tetrahedral site. The interstitial defect structures are ob-
tained by relaxing the atomic configurations using the GGA
PW91 functional at fixed volume with a lattice constant of
5.432 Å. The defects are placed in a 16-atom simulation cell,
which results in energies converged to about 0.1 eV.7 Calcu-
lations for larger cells with up to 64 atoms show that the
DMC finite-size error is small for these defects.
Figure 2 compares the DMC and DFT energies of the X,
H, and T interstitial defects.24 The discrepancies between
DFT calculations at the LDA and GGA levels and experi-
mental data and DMC results are already well documented in
the literature. The 16-atom cell formation energies for X, H,
and T defects predicted by the DMC method are 4.94, 5.13,
and 5.05 eV, respectively, with a statistical error of 0.05 eV.
Relative to the DMC result, the LDA underestimates the for-
mation energy of the defects by about 1.5 eV, the GGAs by
0.9 eV PW91 and 1.0 eV PBE, and the meta-GGA
TPSS by roughly 0.95 eV. The HSE hybrid functional im-
proves the agreement dramatically, with an average discrep-
ancy of 0.25 eV.25 In spite of the differences in the predicted
formation energies, all the DFT functionals and the DMC
method predict that the X interstitial defect has the lowest
formation energy. The energy difference between the X and
H defects is insensitive to the choice of the functional and is
about 0.2 eV. The H and T defects are nearly degenerate for
all the functionals and their energy difference is within the
error of the calculations. The formation energy of the T de-
fect is more sensitive than that of the H defect to the lattice
constant and the supercell size.
The HSE functional yields interstitial formation energies
that agree significantly better with both DMC and experi-
mental results than do the energies obtained from the LDA,
GGA, and meta-GGA. The experimental overall diffusion
activation energy defect formation + migration barrier for
defects in silicon is 4.75 eV.1,2 This includes contributions
from interstitials and vacancies. Upon deconvolution, differ-
ent experimental groups estimate diffusion activation energy
for interstitials of 4.680.15
+0.12 Ref. 2 and 4.95 eV.1 Assuming
an energy barrier of 0.10.3 eV,20 the results of the HSE
functional fall within the range of experimental values and
the DMC method slightly overestimates the formation en-
ergy. Part of this overestimation could be attributed to using
the GGA geometry. In spite of this, both methods provide a
much better agreement with experiment than the predictions
from the pure density functionals.
The results presented above show that, for a set of repre-
sentative problems in silicon, the screened-exchange hybrid
DFT HSE functional significantly improves the agreement
between DFT and DMC calculations over the highly used
LDA and GGA functionals. Compared to other hybrid func-
tionals, such as the B3LYP or PBEh functional, the HSE
functional has the advantage of being applicable to metallic
phases, such as silicon -tin, and the point defects. While
these conclusions must be verified more thoroughly in sub-
sequent research, it appears that this opens up the possibility
of pursuing more complex calculations involving larger
simulation cells. Problems within the range of semiquantita-
tive understanding may include activation barriers of diffu-
sion, interactions among point defects, and the properties of
point defect clusters.21 It also opens the possibility of studies
of other systems where pure DFT methods have failed to

energy single interstitials in silicon X, H, and T. Diffusion Monte
Carlo calculations provide benchmarks for the accuracy of current
density functionals based on the local density approximation, the
generalized gradient PW91, the kinetic energy density TPSS,
and hybrid HSE techniques. The DFT formation energies vary by
as much as 2 eV between different approximations of the exchange-
correlation functional. Comparison to the DMC results demonstrate
a steady improvement of the accuracy of the functionals as the
order of density expansion increases, with quantitative agreement
for the hybrid HSE functional.

LDA and GGA predict to be metallic, but where the HSE
functional accurately describes the gap.22 Our results on de-
fects are especially noteworthy as radiation damage and the

ties of these technologically important materials.
