Received 13 February 1998!
We present a local orbital approach to the evaluation of the on-site repulsion energy U for use in the
LDA1U method of Anisimov and co-workers. Our objectives are to make the method more firmly based, to
concentrate primarily on ground-state properties rather than spectra, and to test the method in cases where only
modest changes in orbital occupations are expected, as well as for highly correlated materials. Because of these
objectives, we employ a differential definition of U. We also define a matrix U, which we find is very
dependent on the environment of the atom in question. The formulation is applied to evaluate U for transition-
metal monoxides from VO to NiO using a local-orbital basis set. The resulting values of U are typically only
4065 % as large as values currently in use. We evaluate the U matrix for the eg and t2g subshells in
paramagnetic FeO, and illustrate the very different charge responses of the eg and t2g states. The sensitivity of
the method to the choice of the d orbitals, and to the basis set in general, is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The understanding and evaluation of the electronic struc-
ture of strongly correlated materials is a long-standing prob-
lem. For weakly correlated materials such as nearly-free-
electron-like metals, covalent semiconductors, ionic solids,
and even rather complex intermetallic transition metal com-
pounds, the local-density approximation the LDA, which we
understand to include the spin degree of freedom as well! to
the exchange-correlation functional that occurs in density-
functional theory gives very reasonable ground-state proper-
ties and even band structures which are excited-state fea-
tures!. For correlated materials, however, LDA can be
completely wrong: the now-classic example is the canonical
cuprate La2CuO4, which LDA predicts to be a nonmagnetic
metal1,2 whereas it is actually an antiferromagnetic insulator.
Model many-body Hamiltonian treatments, such as the Hub-
bard model,3 can readily explain the observed type of ground
state, but do so in terms of adjustable parameters and the
neglect of many aspects of the crystal that may influence
most of its properties. Evaluation of the dynamic self-energy,
which gives the description of excitations, is appropriate for
comparing with many experiments, but even low-order ap-
proximations can be very tedious to evaluate.4
Within the past few years Anisimov and co-workers have
proposed an extension of the LDA approach now called
LDA1U) based on lessons learned from Hubbard model
studies3 that single out a particular local orbital and the as-
sociated on-site repulsive interaction U as the fundamental
characteristic to be addressed.58 They proposed that the
LDA treats the effects of U reasonably well in some average
sense, even in highly correlated systems, but that one must
allow a deviation from this average behavior by including a
correction to the total energy, including a term like

where J is the exchange constant and nms is the new charge
that includes a local charge redistribution relative to the
LDA value n
 ms) obtained by solving the LDA1U equations
self-consistently. The local-orbital and -spin indices are m
and s, respectively. It is assumed in the method that one can
identify the orbitals to be treated (d orbitals of Cu in
La2CuO4 for the example mentioned above!.
The LDA1U method achieves some spectacular suc-
cesses, such as leading to an antiferromagnetic insulating
state of La2CuO4 with band gap and atomic moment in rea-
sonable correspondence with observed values9, and leading
to similarly impressive descriptions of the transition-metal
monoxides. There remain questions, however, such as the
proper way to specify the orbitals, the correct way to obtain
the interaction constants (U and J), and how, if possible, to
extend the method to give an improved treatment of the me-
tallic phase when the insulator is heavily doped. In this paper
we address these questions. A primary feature is that, since
the method is perforce focused on an atomic orbital, it is
natural to use a local-orbital basis set. We will refer to the
local orbital of interest as the d orbital, although in some
applications it may be an f or, rarely, an s or p orbital.
II. DESCRIPTION OF LDA1U
AS CURRENTLY PRACTICED
In extending the LDA method to account for correlations
resulting from strong on-site interactions, there are several
criteria that one might hope to satisfy, such as 1! it should
reduce to LDA when LDA is known to be good; 2! the
energy is given by a functional of the density; 3! the method
specifies how to obtain the local orbital in question perhaps

through a self-consistency procedure!; 4! the definition of U
and J are provided unambiguously; 5! the method predicts
antiferromagnetic insulators when appropriate; and 6! the
description of highly correlated metals is improved over the
LDA description. This list, although perhaps still incomplete,
is already very ambitious, and only certain of these desires
have been addressed seriously.
Anisimov, Zaanen, and Andersen AZA! Ref. 6! chose to
refine the LDA by including an orbital-dependent one-
electron potential to account explicitly for the important
Coulomb repulsions not treated fully in the LDA. This was
accomplished in analogy with Hartree-Fock theory by cor-
recting the mean-field contribution of the d-d on-site inter-
action with an intra-atomic correction. This correction has
been applied in slightly varying forms, but a representative
example of the functional to be solved is

Here i denotes the lattice site, and terms involving J have
been neglected because we do not need to specify the com-
plete form of the functional for this paper. Ni is the site sum
of the d charges, evaluated for the self-consistent LDA1U
densities. The second term is presumed to be a reasonable
description of the direct Coulomb interaction energy in-
cluded in the LDA expression.
Equation 2! reveals that, in the LDA1U approach, one
singles out beforehand the atomic orbitals to be treated, and
decides how to specify them. Implementations to date use
orbitals arising in the linearized muffin-tin orbital LMTO!
method. The d orbitals to which the U correction is applied
are numerical solutions to a Schro
dinger equation inside an
atomic sphere, and are zero outside this sphere. In addition,
LDA1U is clearly no longer a straightforward density func-
tional because it depends on parameters U and J that depend
on the LDA density rather than the LDA1U density.
The one-electron potential is the conventional LDA form
of potential, plus an orbital-dependent shift of energy given

if Umm8U is orbital independent. The changes in the elec-
tronic structure are proportional to U, and the definition and
calculation of U is the next topic to address.
To obtain U and J, AZA performed LMTO calculations
for a supercell in which the d charge on one atom is con-
strained and the eigenvalue is obtained.10 The d orbitals on
all atoms in the supercell are decoupled entirely from the
remaining part of the basis set. This makes the treatment of
the local orbitals an atomiclike problem, which greatly
reduces the difficulty associated with constraining the occu-
pation numbers. It also has the effect of leaving a rather
artificial system to perform the screening. For example, in
NiO the screening system consists of oxygen p orbitals that
cannot hybridize with the Ni d orbitals, plus whatever other
virtual orbitals are included in the basis set.
The discreteness of the d eigenvalues makes it simple to
specify the charge in the spin-orbitals in the supercell, and U
and J are determined from the relations

which is a straightforward difference between up and down
eigenvalues for unit spin polarization. Here 3d(n,n)
@3d(n,n)# is the spin-up spin-down! 3d eigenvalue for
occupancies nand n.
While it is widely recognized that the on-site repulsion U
is a screened quantity, the manner in which the screening
should be done is not precisely specified. An early study by
Cox, Coulthard, and Lloyd11 for 3d metals used a renormal-
ized neutral atom approach, although it was recognized that
screening processes might extend over a somewhat larger
region. Anisimov and co-workers chose the method pre-
sented in this section, but in this paper we pursue a different
approach, with a somewhat different objective.
III. REFORMULATION OF LDA1U
FOR A LOCAL ORBITAL BASIS
We specify in following subsections the various ways in
which our approach differs from that in current use.
A. LCAO basis set
We begin with a basis set of local orbitals $f%, whose
lattice sums lead to the standard linear combination of
atomic orbitals LCAO! Bloch basis functions for the one-
electron Hamiltonian.12 To represent an occupied atomic or-
bital including core states!, we use a contracted set of
Gaussian functions, multiplied by appropriate angular func-
tions for s, p, or d behavior. In particular, at the beginning
we choose from a neutral atom or an ion! the d orbitals of
central interest. Although we have no indication of any better
choice than the d orbital of the corresponding atom e.g.,
neutral Cu in La2CuO4), our method allows the ability to
check how sensitive the results are to the form chosen for the
orbital. In addition to basis functions describing filled atomic
or ionic! orbitals, we add other Gaussian functions to the
basis to provide a more nearly complete basis for the valence
and conduction states than a minimal basis set would pro-
vide. This feature is an advantage of our local-orbital repre-
sentation, as the ability to include self-consistent screening
by a crystalline density of general form in the calculations is
important.
This LCAO basis set brings up an important feature. As a
sum of squares of wave functions, the charge density con-
tains two types of terms. One consists of atom-centered con-
tributions containing the coordinate dependence flm
2 (r
W2R
W ),
and is clearly identified as a contribution to the charge from
angular momentum l of the atom located at R
W . The other
1202

contribution has a coordinate dependence given by flm(r
W
2R
W )fl8m8(r
W2R
W 8), R
W R
W 8, which at a particular point may
be positive or negative and cannot be assigned uniquely to
any atom. The Mulliken decomposition,13 which assigns half
of each such term to charge component l,m on the atom at R
W
and the other half to charge l8m8 of the atom at R
W 8, is widely
used when atomic decomposition of the charge is desired.
Mulliken population is well understood to be not only arbi-
trary, but also dependent on the flexibility of the basis set,
and therefore should not be endowed with any important
physical meaning.
A central fact that must be addressed is that the total
charge density cannot be decomposed, precisely or meaning-
fully, into simple atomic contributions alone. This fact
means that the orbital occupations that are the centerpiece of
the LDA1U approach unfortunately are not particularly
well defined. For our LCAO basis set we will use for nms
charge contributions solely of the first type, which will be
called on-site charges to distinguish them from Mulliken
charges. These on-site quantities also cannot properly be
called occupation numbers since there is no sum rule for
their total, and it is not impossible that for a given orbital the
value can exceed unity.
B. On the specification of the functional
Although we do not carry out LDA1U calculations in
this paper, we are thinking in terms of a generalized LDA
1U functional that is consistent with our philosophy behind
the correction. Without more formal justification than is nor-
mally done in the LDA1U approach and which we do not
address seriously here!, any change must simply be tested to
see if it produces better results. The form that we envision
has affected our study of how to define and evaluate the
interaction constants that arise in the method. We suppose
that the correction is to provide adjustment to full-potential
LDA results, and therefore includes both a suborbital index
and a spin index on the reference charges n
n
 ms . These
numbers will differ, sometimes greatly, for different irreduc-
ible representations of the point group of the atom. The cor-
rection then might be written suggestively as

6!
This change may affect the types of orbitally ordered so-
lutions that will be obtained. This form ensures that the LDA
solution is an exact stationary solution of the LDA1U func-
tional for which the correction vanishes identically!, which
is not the case for Eq. 2!, i.e., if shell-averaged values of n
are used. Aside from strongly correlated solids, another in-
terest of ours is to ascertain whether LDA1U can provide a
useful improvement of the description of simpler systems
such as the transition metals Fe and V, where anisotropy
relative amounts of t2g and eg character! is not reproduced
accurately in LDA, or in correlated metals where no bandgap
occurs but charge rearrangement might be appropriate.
C. Procedure for determining U and J
We take as our ansatz that the constant U (J) occurring in
the LDA1U functional should describe the cost in potential
energy of charge spin! fluctuations in the actual crystal, i.e.,
with all normal interactions and degrees of freedom available
to the electrons. Thus we do not decouple the d states from
surrounding states. The U and J terms are applied in pre-
cisely the same system from which they are determined. We
comment below on the question of dealing with the associ-
ated cost in kinetic energy due to charge fluctuations. For the
remainder of this paper we concentrate solely on U, postpon-
ing a related treatment of J such as suggested in Ref. 14 for
the future.
We also take the point of view that the main purpose of
LDA1U theory, as in density-functional theory, is to obtain
ground-state properties, rather than to approximate excita-
tions with the eigenvalues. Describing the ground state may
require small rearrangements of occupation numbers away
from their LDA values, and usually less than one-half, so we
employ a differential definition of U also used by Solovyev,
Dederichs, and Anisimov14! rather than one employing occu-
pation numbers differing by unity. We will see that this in-
troduces extra richness into the charge rearrangements de-
scribed by the LDA1U method, because a small change in
say! t2g population can be strongly compensated by a
change in eg population.
We employ then a generalized constrained density func-
tional approach as proposed by Dederichs et al.10 to calculate
the change in energy due to constraints on local-orbital den-
sities. We minimize the local-density functional subject to
the constraint that on-site local orbital charges na,s be equal
to designated values Qa,s , where a labels an irreducible
representation of the point group of the atom in question
e.g., t2g or eg), and that total charge N be conserved:

The Lagrange multipliers are the usual chemical potential m
and the potential shifts wa,s necessary to satisfy the con-
straint na,s5Qa,s . Dependence on the total number N of

Variation with respect to the spin orbitals leads to a one-
electron Schro
dinger equation in which the potential is the
LDA potential, supplemented by local orbital shifts wa,s on
the orbitals in the irreducible representation a having spin s.
These additional shifts of potential can be represented as a
nonlocal potential

where $f% are normalized atomic orbitals.
Evaluation of the constrained energy in Eq. 7! deserves
comment. Solution for the constrained energy involves gen-
erating the Kohn-Sham equations, which have an additional
potential of the form of Eq. 8! that effectively constrains the
density as desired. The conventional method of evaluating
PRB 58

the energy is to sum the resulting eigenvalues and correct for
double counting of the Hartree energy and the miscounting
of exchange-correlation energy. That cannot be done di-
rectly, because the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues contain the ef-
fects of the additional potential of Eq. 8! and one does not
obtain ELDA. The additional term that has been included by
summing the LDA1U eigenvalues, however, contains only
the additional one-body term (a,swa,sna,s , and this term
can be subtracted to obtain ELDA evaluated for the con-
strained density.
D. Constrained energy

occupations, the constraining values, and the Lagrange pa-

we can generalize the constrained density-functional theory

arise. Then the energy shift is given by

and cancellation between the two contributions may occur.
In a self-consistent calculation, any change in local orbital
charge results in an accompanying change in kinetic energy
as well as a potential energy change. Since the U term in
the LDA1U energy functional is a potential energy term,
one might argue that it should be UP that goes into the
LDA1U calculation, and the kinetic-energy change in the
constrained LDA calculation should be removed: UUP
5U2UK is the appropriate U in LDA1U. It was a re-
lated correction, to avoid double counting of kinetic terms,
that Anisimov and Gunnarsson5 expected to account for by
disconnecting their local orbitals from all other basis func-
tions in their prescription for the determination of U. The
constrained LDA procedure we propose is in some respects
closer to that of Hybertsen, Schlu
ter, and Christensen16 than
to that of Anisimov and co-workers. However, Hybertsen,
Schu
lter, and Christensen were specifically interested in ob-
taining parameters for the Hubbard model, and their proce-
dure was tied to the form of extended Hubbard model they
wished to consider.
Using the Hellmann-Feynman relation @Eq. 10!# to obtain
w
W (q
W), it is straightforward to obtain U of Eq. 12! numeri-
cally: one applies a shift in potential w
W and calculates the
change in charge q
W, and forms the finite-difference derivative
in Eq. 14!. To calculate the separate contributions there is
no alternative to evaluating a finite difference second
derivative.17 We have carried out this calculation methods
are described below! for FeO. We obtain the provocative
result UK /U
 '210, which leaves UP /U
 '11, i.e., each con-
tribution is an order of magnitude larger than the net result,
and they have opposite sign. Clearly these individual contri-
butions are not directly useful, nor in fact is this directly
related to the kinetic-energy contribution that Gunnarsson
and Anisimov treated by disconnecting d orbitals when cal-
culating U. In the context of the Hubbard model, the term
kinetic energy really denotes all of the energy except the
potential energy related to U, and is very different than the
kinetic energy we have evaluated. We leave the question of
potential vs kinetic contributions to U for further study. The
value of U that we evaluate and report below is the total
net! value U5UK1UP .
F. Change in independent variable
It will be instructive to consider the potential shifts w

be the independent variables in an associated energy func-

tional leading to q
W(w
W ) rather than w
W (q
W). This is also in keep-
ing with the practice in the constrained density approach of
choosing the shifts w

sponse q
W. This change of variable is done by a Legendre

This formalism brings in the matrix U21 implicit in Eq.
12!, relating the charge shifts in various suborbitals to po-
tential shifts applied to other suborbitals, e.g., a decomposi-
tion of the Hubbard U for d orbitals into eg and t2g contri-
butions for cubic site symmetry. This result is reminiscent of
the extension of the definitions of U and J @Eqs. 4! and 5!#
by Solovyev, Hamada, and Terakura15 to give different val-
ues Ueg and Ut2g, but their procedure did not provide off-
diagonal terms. The effects of differing charge response in
the eg and t2g channels will be quantified in Sec. V. The
concept can be extended to non-site-diagonal interactions,
viz. d orbitals interacting with neighboring oxygen p orbit-
als.
We now establish a sum rule relating the matrix elements
of U to the conventional scalar U, which for clarity we de-
note Udd 5 ]wd /]Qd , where Qd is the total d charge and
wd is a shift in potential applied to all d orbitals. Since a
change in potential wt2g acting on the t2g orbitals followed
by a change in potential weg acting on only the eg orbitals is
equivalent to a potential wd of the same magnitude acting on
all d orbitals, we have, in the linear regime

IV. METHOD OF CALCULATION
For the metallic constituents of the compounds we con-
sidered, a basis set representing six s-, four p-, and three
d-type functions is expanded on a set of 16 Gaussian func-
tions. The O basis set is expanded on a set of 12 Gaussian
exponents contracted into four s- and three p-type functions.
The Coulomb and exchange-correlation potentials comprise
the effective potential Veff, which is also described by a
superposition of atom-centered Gaussian-type functions. By
choosing this expansion, the matrix elements of the Hamil-
tonian are analytic. Details of the method, and comparison to
results of the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave
LAPW! method, have been published elsewhere.12,18
For this work it is important to obtain sufficiently well
converged values of orbital densities. Tests using special
point meshes in the irreducible

cated that ten or 20 k
W points in the IBZ gave the necessary
accuracy. A temperature broadening of 0.07 eV was used to
facilitate convergence to self-consistency, and it was verified
that this size of broadening did not change the results.
V. EVALUATION FOR TRANSITION-METAL
MONOXIDES
We have applied this approach to evaluate U for the tran-
sitions metal monoxides MO, M5V, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, in
the paramagnetic state and for the cubic rocksalt structure.
The experimental! lattice constants used were VO, 4.093 Å;
MnO, 4.444 Å; FeO, 4.332 Å; CoO, 4.260 Å; and NiO,
4.193 Å.
A. Suborbital independent U
First, applying a potential shift wd equally to all d subor-
bitals analogously to LMTO treatments, the derived value of
U is shown in Table I. Comparison is provided with values
obtained by the method of AZA, and it is seen that the values

obtained are 4065 % of the values obtained by AZA. That
our values are smaller is no surprise, since our approach of
not disconnecting d orbitals from other orbitals! naturally
allows additional screening to occur, by including hybridiza-
tion between d orbitals and neighboring oxygen p orbitals.
Moreover, charge rearrangement between eg and t2g sub-
shells reveals that there is some intra-d-shell screening in the
current approach. In addition, our definition of the d orbital
is not identical with that of AZA.
Figures 13 for MnO, FeO, and NiO illustrate the change
in subshell charge with wd as well as the total change, which
is what determines U. Taking MnO, for example, it is seen in
Fig. 1 that the effect of positive wd is to decrease nt2g as
expected, but neg instead increases. Clearly charge rear-
rangement within the d shell is leading to a reduction in U
i.e., additional screening!. A similar behavior occurs for
FeO Fig. 2!, while for NiO the eg charge remains almost
unchanged as wd is varied. Note that, besides the differences
in approach and in basis sets, the values obtained in the AZA
approach are evaluated for differences in d charge of unity.
Empirically determined values obtained by comparing to
excited state data! lie in nearly all cases between our values
and those of AZA.
The values of U in Table I are obtained as the first de-
rivative of polynomial fits to the wd vs Qd curve Eq. 12!.
Figures 13 indicate the DQd vs wd curve for shifts wd up to
60.8 eV for MnO, FeO, and NiO. The change in total d
charge is linear up to this size of shift ('20230 % of U).
Even for this size shift, however, the individual t2g and eg
contributions are beginning to become nonlinear, as seen
most clearly for MnO in Fig. 1.
On-site charges and Mulliken charges within the LDA,
for our basis set, are compared in Table II. The charges are
less ionic than their formal dipositive! charge, as experience
would suggest. Although atomic charge within a crystal
cannot be defined uniquely, it is widely accepted that ef-
fective ionic charges are nearly always reduced by hybrid-
ization from their formal, full ionic values.! Although VO is
somewhat of an exception, the Mulliken charge does not
differ more than 4% from the on-site charge for these ex-
amples. The response of Mulliken and on-site charges are
very different, however, with Mulliken charges varying more
slowly. If one uses Mulliken charges rather than on-site
charges to obtain U, the resulting values are much larger: 3.8
eV for VO, 6.2 eV for MnO, and 11.1 eV for NiO.
B. Suborbital dependent U
We have studied FeO charge redistribution when eg and
t2g subshells are treated separately. In Fig. 4, we present the
change in subshell charge when a shift in potential is applied
individually to the subshells. In both cases, charge forced out
of one subshell by an upward shift in potential goes prima-

Thus the behavior that looks rather peculiar in Fig. 4, and the
negative off-diagonal elements in Eq. 21!, do not lead to
pathological behavior in the direct matrix U.
C. Dependence of local orbital shape
The LDA1U procedure is built around some choice of
local orbital. In a LCAO basis, this orbital is specified at the
beginning, and we have used neutral atom d orbitals from
atomic LDA calculations. Another possible choice might be,
say, the d orbital from a positive ion. For FeO we have
checked the effect of using the Fe21 d orbital obtained from
an atomic calculation on an isolated ion. The difference in
radial density is shown in Fig. 5. For the FeO paramagnetic!
solid, the on-site charge of 6.22 electrons Table II! changes
to the rather peculiar value of 4.85 electrons, and the calcu-
lated value of U increases from 4.6 to 7.8 eV. The total
energy, however, changes only by 10.12 eV/FeO, which is a
very modest change adding f functions in a LCAO or
LMTO calculation, or increasing the number of basis func-
tions in a LAPW calculation, can result even larger changes,
which are unimportant for most purposes!.
This result makes it clear that the choice of d orbital can
affect the calculated value of U, certainly in the LCAO
method but most likely in any calculational approach. In our
calculation it is the result of the density being represented in
a different fashion, that is, the separation between local or-
bital charges and the overlap Mulliken! contributions is a
rather sensitive function of the basis set choice. As a result
the values of nms that arise in the LDA1U functional de-
pend on the choice of d orbital. We are investigating meth-
ods of minimizing this effect, by normalizing the sum of the
d occupation numbers over the full d band region to ten.
VI. DISCUSSION
The results presented in Sec. V reflect a strong difference
in response of the eg and t2g electrons, at least to potentials
of moderate strength. Such differences have been noted sev-
eral times in the literature. In the context of the LDA1U
method, Solovyev, Hamada, and Terakura15 have advocated
using using separate values of U for the two subshells in
perovskite structure transition-metal oxides. Their method of
obtaining Ua was a generalization of the standard method

REFORMULATION OF THE LDA1U METHOD FOR A . . .
described in Sec. II. We, on the other hand, have adopted the
differential definition of U that leads to a matrix Uab .
To begin to understand the response of the separate sub-
shells, in Fig. 6 we show the on-site eg and t2g densities of
states DOS! on a Ni atom in an eight-atom supercell of NiO,
both before and after a downward shift of all d states by
20.54 eV. The t2g states in the rocksalt structure are weakly
dpp bonding and form a narrow band, whereas the eg states
form dps bonds that produce wider eg bands. From Fig. 3 it
is seen that such shifts produce negligible change in the on-
site eg charge, with all the difference coming entirely from
the on-site t2g subshell. This result is counterintuitive, since
the t2g DOS is full, and pulling it down seemingly cannot
increase its occupation. The eg DOS is open shell and could
accept charge, but does not do so.
The resolution of this paradox lies in the change in the
representation of charge of the system by the LCAO basis
functions as a shift in potential is applied. By looking at
other local DOSs, for both on-site and Mulliken charge de-
compositions, we have found that a downward shift of d
states, which changes the degree and character of hybridiza-
tion as well as the probability of occupation, results in a
more active participation of the virtual orbitals in represent-
ing the charge density. To some extent this is a real effect:
d-p hybridization increases as the d states are pulled down
nearer the p bands, and what one calls the d function, or the
d charge, becomes less well defined. The definition be-
comes clear for well-separated atoms, and perhaps for states
well separated in energy from any other states.! The effect is
present with other basis sets as well, but is more difficult to
identify.
It is important to understand clearly the source of this
paradox. It arises because the d charge density is not a
precisely and objectively defined quantity. Although we are
accustomed to thinking in terms of five d bands in a
transition-metal oxide that can be identified and whose DOS
integrates to five electrons per spin, this is a fiction that be-
comes apparent as soon as orbital overlap becomes appre-
ciable. This difficulty has the same origin as the difficulty in
defining the d orbital to be used in the LDA1U method.
These ambiguities are problems that must be lived with until
a better prescription can be formulated.
VII. SUMMARY
We have presented a reformulation of the method of ob-
taining U for a LDA1U calculation. The approach is based
on a local-orbital expansion, which is a natural one consid-
ering that the d orbital is to be singled out and specified in
any case. We aim specifically to improve ground-state prop-
erties rather than to account for spectroscopic data.
Values of U using this approach are found to be only
4065 % of the values of Anisimov and co-workers. Most of
this difference is understood in terms of the definitions and
procedures that are used in each case. A generalization pre-
sented here is the identification of an interaction matrix that
describes interactions that are nondiagonal in the suborbital
index, e.g., the change in energy of t2g states due to a change
in eg charge. The off-diagonal parts of this interaction are
expected to be strongly dependent on the environment of the
ion, and this expectation is borne out in our study of FeO.
There are important aspects of our approach that require
further work. The contribution to U from the kinetic energy,
and how it should be dealt with, is one loose end. The most
appropriate choice of d orbital is another question that may
require some experience to answer. Carrying out LDA1U
studies to compare with results using the previous LDA
1U method, and ascertaining the effect of off-diagonal in-
teractions, are, however, the main priority, and this work is
in progress.
