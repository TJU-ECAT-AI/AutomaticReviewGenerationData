<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain information directly relevant to the question about computational methods for predicting and analyzing catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. The text focuses on hybrid density functional theory calculations of bulk cerium oxides (CeO2 and Ce2O3), comparing different computational approaches like LDA, PBE, and hybrid functionals. It does not discuss catalytic reactions, doped oxides, or alkane activation. Therefore, this specific question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the provided document.

To properly answer this question would require information from other sources about computational modeling of catalytic systems, which is not provided in the given text. The document does highlight some general challenges in accurately modeling f-electron systems like cerium oxides using different DFT approaches, but does not extend this to catalytic applications or doped systems.

要正确回答这个问题需要其他来源关于催化系统计算建模的信息,而这在给定的文本中没有提供。该文档确实强调了使用不同DFT方法准确模拟像氧化铈这样的f电子系统的一些一般性挑战,但没有将其扩展到催化应用或掺杂系统。
