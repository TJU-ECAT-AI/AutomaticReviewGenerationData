Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

This document does not contain information relevant to answering the question about computational methods for studying doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. The literature provided focuses on energy band gaps and lattice parameters calculated using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof screened hybrid functional, which is not directly related to catalytic activity of doped oxides or alkane activation. The question cannot be adequately answered based solely on the content of this document.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given scientific literature does not contain any information directly relevant to the question about computational methods for predicting and analyzing catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. The paper appears to focus on energy band gaps and lattice parameters evaluated using a specific hybrid functional method, which is not related to the topic of the question. Therefore, this document cannot be used to answer the question about DFT and cluster models for studying doped oxide catalysts.
