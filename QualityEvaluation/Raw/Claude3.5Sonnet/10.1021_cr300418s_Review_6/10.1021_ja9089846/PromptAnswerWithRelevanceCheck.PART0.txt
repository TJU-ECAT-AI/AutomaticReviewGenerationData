Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The given literature does not contain any information related to computational methods, density functional theory (DFT), cluster models, or their application in predicting and analyzing catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts for alkane activation. The text appears to be a brief citation of a scientific article about inverse CeO2/CuO catalysts for preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich streams. It does not discuss the computational methods or considerations mentioned in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be answered based on the provided literature.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献不包含任何关于计算方法、密度泛函理论(DFT)、簇模型或它们在预测和分析掺杂氧化物催化剂对烷烃活化的催化活性方面的应用的信息。这段文字似乎是一篇关于反向CeO2/CuO催化剂用于富氢流中CO优先氧化的科学文章的简短引用。它没有讨论问题中提到的计算方法或考虑因素。因此，基于所提供的文献无法回答这个问题。
