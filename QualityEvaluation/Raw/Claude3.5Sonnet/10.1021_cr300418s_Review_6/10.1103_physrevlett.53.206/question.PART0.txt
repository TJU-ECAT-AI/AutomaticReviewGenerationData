(Received 9 January
1984)
The majority-
and minority-spin
states of the exchange-split
virtual
bound state of Mn im-
purities
in Cu and Ag are studied
with
high-resolution
photoemission
and bremsstrahlung
isochromat
spectroscopy.
The exchange
splitting
is found
to be close to the atomic value.
The majority-spin
state is strongly
hybridized
with the host-metal
d band resulting
in its delo-
calization.
The minority-spin
states
are localized
but close to the Fermi
level
so that
a
description
of the physical
properties
in terms of a spin Hamiltonian
is not appropriate.

During
the
past
decades
the
alloys
of 31
transition-metal
impurities
dissolved
in
a noble-
metal
matrix
have
attracted
considerable
attention
of theoreticians
and experimentalists.
Much
work
has been done on the Kondo' and spin-glass
proper-
ties,
the
latest
theoretical
developments
being
the solution
of the Kondo
and Anderson5
Hamil-
tonians
and
the
development
of fast-converging
perturbation
theories.
Although
these
theories
treat the many-body
effects on a high
level of so-
phistication,
they use model
Hamiltonians,
the va-
lidity of which
depends
on the relative
magnitudes
of the various
parameters.
They also lack a proper
description
of the band-structure
details,
especially
the occurrence of the strong d resonance
in the no-
ble
metals.
In
recent
embedded-cluster7
and
coherent-potential-approximation
ab initio calcula-
tions these band-structure
details are included,
but
exchange
correlation
is treated
in the local density
approximation.
The Mn atom is known to have an effective mag-
netic moment of about 5p, z even in solid solution
in
noble
metals.
'
Therefore
it is probably
one of
the most
beautiful
examples
of a transition-metal
atom
with a spin-split
state consisting
qualitatively
of a full
majority-
and
an empty
minority-spin
d
shell.
The alloys
AgMn
and
CuMn
have been investi-
gated extensively
by means of a large variety of ex-
perimental
techniques.
For the
interpretation
of
the experimental
results one has resorted to the use
of a Kondo Hamiltonian
for which one implicitly
as-
sumes
that
the
impurity
has only
spin
degrees
of
freedom.
Or, in other words, one has assumed
that
the Schrieffer-Wolff"
transformation
of the Ander-
son
Hamiltonian
is valid.
This
transformation
is
valid
if r+ 
b, +/e+  1, where
15, is the
half-
width of the virtual
bound
state and e+ is its posi-
tion relative
to the Fermi level;
+ here denote the
majority-
and minority-spin
states.
Although
several
photoemission
studies
have
been reported, '
'
we present
the first direct mea-
surement
of the unoccupied
impurity-induced
den-
sity of states for AgMn
and CuMn
as well as high-
resolution
photoemission
data
for
the
occupied
states. %e obtain
values for the above-mentioned
parameters
and compare
these to theoretical
calcu-
lations.
We
conclude
that
the
validity
of
the
Schrieffer-Wolff
transformation
is highly
question-
able
and
that
the
majority
states
are delocalized,
whereas
the minority
states are localized as found in
Heusler alloys. '
The polycrystalline
AgMn samples
(5% and 10%)
were obtained from the melt and examined
metallo-
graphically
for the
presence
of secondary
phases.
The polycrystalline
CuMn samples (1.5%, 5%, 10%,
and 15%) were supplied
by the University
of Leiden
group. '6
The
bremsstrahlung-isochromat
spectroscopy
(BIS)
and
ultraviolet-photoelectron
spectroscopy
(UPS)
equipment
is described
elsewhere' '
and
was operated
at resolutions
of 0.85 eV and 90 meV,
respectively.
The base pressure
in both chambers
was
less
than 5x10 " Torr.
The
samples
were
treated
with either
Ar-ion
etching
or scraping,
and
surface
composition
was checked
with
x-ray
pho-
toelectron
spectroscopy
and
Auger-electron
spec-
troscopy.
The UPS spectra were corrected for the He I satel-
lite of 23.09 eV and an intensity
of 0.017 relative to
the main
line at 21.22 eV. The energy
grids were
0.02 and 0.1 eV for UPS and BIS. The UPS differ-
ence spectra were obtained
by subtracting
the scaled
spectra. '
The BIS difference
spectra were obtained

The
structure
in the
pure-metal
BIS spectra
has been
discussed elsewhere.
In the alloy spectra addition-
al structures
are observed,
the intensity
of which
is
proportional
to the Mn concentration.

interpret
these

as
the
Mn-
impurity-induced

bution.

and
was
determined
from
the
Fermi-level-
cutoff part of the spectrum
of the pure metals. The
minority-spin
peak
position
and
Lorentzian
broadening
are given in Table I.
The UPS difference
spectra
show
in addition
to
structure just below the Ag d band in AgMn a lot of
structure
within
this band.
The positive
contribu-
tion
at
about
3
eV
in
AgMn
is
due
to
the
majority-spin
Mn d states.
The strong
structure
in
the Ag d band
is due to two effects:
firstly a dilu-
tion effect (i.e., removal of Ag)2a and secondly
the
presence of Mn d density of states in the Ag d band
due to hybridization.
For the CuMn alloys the situ-
ation
is even
more
complicated
because
no extra
structure
outside of the Cu d band is observed.
The
majority-spin
Mn d state must
therefore
lie inside
the Cu d band.
This is not surprising
since we ex-
pect the majority-spin
state in Cu and Ag hosts to
be at approximately
the same position,
which,
with
use of the AgMn value, would put it in the center of
the Cu d band.
This is also suggested
by compar-
ison of the positions of the minority-spin
d states in
CuMn and AgMn.
