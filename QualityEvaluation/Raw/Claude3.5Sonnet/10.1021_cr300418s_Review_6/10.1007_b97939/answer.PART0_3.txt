The provided literature does not contain information specifically addressing the use of computational methods, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and cluster models, for predicting, analyzing, and understanding the catalytic activity of doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. The text primarily focuses on DFT computation of relative spin-state energetics of transition metal compounds, which is not directly related to the question asked. Therefore, this question cannot be accurately answered based solely on the given literature.
