[1] "A recent theoretical study [19] has shown that a Au-only reaction pathway for a TiOx supported Au bilayer cluster is energetically competitive with alternative pathways requiring reactant-support interactions."

[2] "Density functional calculations also are consistent with Au being electron-rich when supported on titania [18,39]."

The literature does not directly address the use of computational methods for studying doped oxide catalysts in alkane activation. However, it does mention the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study gold catalysts supported on titania. These computational methods have been used to investigate the electronic properties of gold clusters and their interaction with the support, as well as to explore reaction pathways. While the text doesn't explicitly discuss the benefits and challenges of these approaches, it suggests that computational methods can provide valuable insights into the energetics of catalytic processes and the electronic structure of supported catalysts.

这篇文献没有直接讨论计算方法在研究掺杂氧化物催化剂用于烷烃活化方面的应用。然而，它确实提到了使用密度泛函理论(DFT)计算来研究钛氧化物支撑的金催化剂。这些计算方法被用来研究金簇的电子性质及其与载体的相互作用，以及探索反应途径。虽然文本没有明确讨论这些方法的优点和挑战，但它表明计算方法可以为催化过程的能量学和负载型催化剂的电子结构提供有价值的见解。
