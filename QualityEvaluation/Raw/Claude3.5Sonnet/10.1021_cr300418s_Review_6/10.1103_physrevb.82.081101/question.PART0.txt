We propose a second version of the van der Waals density functional of Dion et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 92,
246401 2004, employing a more accurate semilocal exchange functional and the use of a large-N asymptote
gradient correction in determining the vdW kernel. The predicted binding energy, equilibrium separation, and
potential-energy curve shape are close to those of accurate quantum chemical calculations on 22 duplexes. We
anticipate the enabling of chemically accurate calculations in sparse materials of importance for condensed
matter, surface, chemical, and biological physics.

The van der Waals vdW attraction is a quantum-
mechanical phenomenon with charge fluctuations in one part
of an atomic system that are electrodynamically correlated
with charge fluctuations in another. The vdW force at one
point thus depends on charge events at another region and is
a truly nonlocal correlation effect.
Methods for accurately calculating the vdW interactions
are critical to understanding sparse matter, including bulk
solids e.g., layered materials, molecular crystals, and poly-
mers, surface phenomena e.g., adsorption, water overlay-
ers, and gas separation and storage, and biostructures e.g.,
DNA and protein structure.
The exact density functional contains the vdW forces. Un-
fortunately, we do not have access to it but approximate ver-
sions are abundant. Commonly, the local-density approxima-
tion LDA and generalized gradient approximation are used
with quite some success for dense matter, including hard
materials and covalently bound molecules. They depend on
the density in local and semilocal ways, respectively, how-
ever, and give no account of the fully nonlocal vdW interac-
tion.
First-principles approaches for how vdW can be treated in
DFT were first proposed for the asymptotic interaction
between fragments.13 These ultimately evolved into the van
der
Waals
density
functional
vdW-DF
for
arbitrary
geometries.46 Despite its success for describing dispersion

empirical
method,7

In this Rapid Communication, we propose a second ver-
sion of the van der Waals density functional vdW-DF2 em-
ploying a more accurate semilocal exchange functional
PW86 Refs. 15 and 16 and the use of a large-N asymptote
gradient correction17 in determining the vdW kernel. By
making a full comparison of potential-energy curves PECs
with accurate quantum chemistry QC results for 22 mo-
lecular duplexes, we show that vdW-DF2 substantially im-
proves
i
equilibrium
separations,
ii
hydrogen-bond
strengths, and iii vdW attractions at intermediate separa-
tions longer than the equilibrium ones. The improvement in
iii, found via a full PEC comparison, is most critical for
important real-life applications to sparse matter and bio-
logical matter where it is impossible for basic structural units
to assume the same separations they would have as binary
units in vacuo.
First, we replace Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof revPBE ex-
change functional18 with PW86,15,16 because revPBE is gen-
erally too repulsive near the equilibrium separation,8 and can
bind spuriously by exchange alone, although less so than
most other local or semilocal functionals. Hence, other ex-
change functionals19,20 have been proposed. Recent perfor-
mance studies of various exchange functionals for weakly
interacting atoms21 and molecules,22 however, show PW86,
with an enhancement factor proportional to s2/5 at large re-
duced density gradient s, to give the most consistent agree-
ment with Hartree-Fock HF results, without spurious ex-
change binding. It also is a good match23 for the vdW-DF2
correlation kernel, introduced below, although no others
were tried.
The key to the vdW-DF method is the inclusion of a long-
range piece of the correlation energy, Ec
nln, a fully nonlocal
functional of the density n. This piece is evaluated using a
plasmon pole approximation for the inverse dielectric
function, which satisfies known conservation laws, limits,
sum rules, and invariances.4 A single parameter model for the
pole position was adopted, with the pole residue set by the
law of charge-current continuity f-sum rule, and the pole
position at large wave vector set by the constraint that there
be no self-Coulomb interaction. The single parameter is de-
termined locally from electron-gas energy input via gradient
corrected LDA.4
The nonlocal piece of the correlation energy in both
vdW-DF and vdW-DF2 is of the form
Ec
nln = d3r d3rnrr,rnr.
1
The kernel  is given as a function of Rfr and Rfr,
where R=rr and fr is a function of nr and its gradi-
ent. In fact fr is proportional to the exchange-correlation
energy density xc of a gradient corrected LDA at the point r.

This arose from the approximately implemented requirement
that the dielectric function implied by the plasmon pole
model should give an exchange-correlation energy semilo-
cally consistent with a gradient corrected electron gas. We
call the semilocal functional that fixes fr in Eq. 1 the
internal functional.
The above is easier to understand for two separate mol-
ecules, although the arguments apply equally well to a pair
of high-density regions of a sparse material. The long-range
vdW attraction implied by Eq. 1 occurs from the contribu-
tion where r is on one molecule and r on the other. The
definition of fr and fr varies continuously and indepen-
dently at each point according to xcr and xcr. The
quantity xc is taken to consist of a gradient corrected LDA.
In the first version of vdW-DF,4 the gradient correction was
obtained from a gradient expansion24 for the slowly varying
electron gas.25,26 More appropriate is a functional that gives
accurate energies for molecules, however. When r and r are
each in a separate moleculelike region, with exponentially
decaying tails between them, fr and fr can both be large
and give key contributions to a vdW attraction. For this case
including perhaps even a molecule near a surface the
large-N asymptote27,28 and the exchange energy asymptotic
series for neutral atoms provide a more accurate approxima-
tion. In fact, the exchange parameter26  of the B88 ex-
change functional,29 successfully used in the vast majority of
DFT calculations on molecules, can be derived from first
principles using the large-N asymptote,17 as can the LDA
exchange. It seems obvious, then, that vdW-DF results
should be improved if the second-order expansion of the
exchange in gradients is replaced by the second-order
large-N expansion. Interestingly, PW86R functional, selected
as the overall exchange functional for different reasons, also
follows the large-N behavior for small reduced gradient s
values down to 0.1, where it reverts to the form of slowly
varying electron-gas limit.
Thus we use 2.222 times larger exchange gradient coeffi-
cient, a value based on agreement between derived17,27,28 and
empirical29 criteria a 6% smaller derived value of Ref. 17
only gives a marginal improvement. Assuming that the
screened exchange term30increases in the same proportion as
gradient exchange itself, finally we get the appropriate gra-
dient coefficient in the Z notation26 which is multiplied by
2.222. Summarizing: while Zab=0.8491 in vdW-DF, Zab=
1.887 in vdW-DF2, implying changes in the internal func-
tional.
The performance of our energy functional is assessed via
comparisons with the accurate S22 reference data set31,32 and
PECs Ref. 33 based on QC calculations at the level of
coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative
triple excitations CCSDT with extrapolation to the com-
plete basis set limit. These 22 small molecular duplexes for
the noncovalent interactions typical in biological molecules
include hydrogen-bonded, dispersion-dominated, and mixed
duplexes. Recent evaluation13 of the performance of the
vdW-DF for S22 shows it to be quite good, except for
H-bonded duplexes, where vdW-DF underestimates the bind-
ing energy by about 15%.
Calculations are performed by a plane-wave code and an
efficient vdW algorithm34 with Troullier-Martins-type norm-
conserving pseudopotentials. Spot comparison with all elec-
tron calculations using large basis sets indicates a calcula-
tional accuracy of 1%, actually better than that of most of
PAW potentials supplied in various standard codes. Large
box sizes were used to control spurious electrostatic interac-
tions between replicas. See supplementary material35 for fur-
ther details.
Figure 1 shows a typical PEC for each kind of interaction.
To make a direct comparison to the QC results, the PECs are
calculated at the same geometry of those of the CCSDT
PEC calculations33 shown as dashed-dotted lines with
circles, where each molecule is kept in its S22 geometry31
and moved along the line defined by the center-of-mass co-
ordinates of two molecules without any rotation. Overall, the
vdW-DF2 PECs solid lines show a remarkable agreement
with QC ones for all separations and for all three types of
interactions. The shapes of the PECs near the minima, im-
portant for vibrational frequencies, are greatly improved see
inset figures where PECs are aligned to have the common
minimum point. More importantly the strength of vdW at-

traction at larger distances is weakened in agreement with
QC, especially for vdW-bonded duplexes Fig. 1b. In other
words, the original vdW-DF overestimates vdW attraction at
intermediate separations beyond the equilibrium separation,
although its minimum energy is accurate. This has special
importance in sparse condensed matter. An example will be
given below.
The PECs tend to turn up slightly earlier when approach-
ing the repulsion regime at small separations. This quite uni-
versal feature might be due to PW86 exchange functional
which is slightly more repulsive than HF at short distances.22
For duplexes whose large distance asymptote is dominated
by dispersion here methane dimer, ethene dimer, and
benzene-methane, vdW-DF2 will have weaker attraction in
the asymptotic region and smaller C6 coefficients than vdW-
DF, which at least for the methane dimer already gives a C6
coefficient close to experiment.6 Recently, this prediction
was verified in detail for various duplexes.36 However, in the
region of our calculations, such deterioration is not perva-
sive. In any case, neither the vdW-DF curves nor the QC
curve have reached their asymptotic limit for any of the
above three cases. The remainder of the 22 duplexes have
asymptotic forms dominated by electrostatics.
In Fig. 2, we summarize the calculated binding energies at
equilibrium separation, at equilibrium separation plus 1 Å,
and the equilibrium separations themselves, with each quan-
tity given as a deviation from that implied by the reference
calculations.3133 Each subfigure clearly shows one of the
three major improvements. i Hydrogen-bond strengths. The
mean absolute deviation MAD of binding energy for
hydrogen-bonded duplexes is decreased from 91 to 40 meV.
ii Interaction at intermediate separations. The MAD of
binding energy at a separation 1 Å larger than the equilib-
rium one is reduced from 35 to 8 meV for the dispersion-
dominated group and also substantially for the mixed group.
iii Equilibrium separations. MAD is reduced from 0.23 to
0.13 Å. Overall, the vdW-DF2 binding energies are within
50 meV of the reference except for duplexes 5 and 7. The
MAD of binding energy is decreased from 41 to 22 meV
13% to 7.6%. As a final tidbit, we note that in vdW-DF2
the MAD for the equilibrium energy of the dispersion-
dominated complexes has been reduced to 11 meV, which is
equal to the MAD of the work of Jurecka et al.,31 which until
very recently32 was considered the gold standard for accu-
racy in quantum chemical calculations on this group.
The higher accuracy of vdW-DF2 persists in the extended
systems we tested. As such applications, we calculated: i
the graphite interlayer binding energy and spacing. The bind-
ing energy is on a par with that of vdW-DF which is already
good. Interlayer spacing is about 2% shorter than that by
vdW-DF, in better agreement with experiment. ii H2 ad-
sorption within two different metal-organic frameworks
MOFs, Zn2BDC2TED and MOF-74. In the former, the
binding at the highest binding site 57 meV including zero
point is in good agreement with heat of adsorption measure-
ment 52 meV, whereas vdW-DF overestimates it by 60%.
This demonstrates the importance of accurate intermediate-
range interaction. For comparison, the binding energy of
hydrogen
to
benzene,
one
of
building
blocks
of
Zn2BDC2TED, is almost the same for both functionals at
the equilibrium separation. At larger separations, however,
vdW-DF substantially overestimates the binding. In case of
MOF-74, H2 positions are experimentally known. VdW-DF2
shows its higher accuracy in predicting separations between
hydrogens and nearby atoms improved by 0.10.2 Å. The
strongest binding comes from an unsaturated metal atom,
rather than more distant structures, and the binding energy,
already accurate in vdW-DF, is little changed in vdW-DF2.
We also tested vdW-DF2 on the internal structure of a water
molecule, as an example of strong chemical bonds in mol-
ecules. We find that vdW-DF2 is on par with PBE. For de-
tails of all tests, see supplementary material.
In summary, we have presented an enhanced version of
vdW-DF, denoted by vdW-DF2, which can be implemented
via simple modifications of existing codes. It results in sig-
nificant improvements in equilibrium spacings between non-
covalently bound complexes, as well as in binding energy,
especially when hydrogen bonding plays a role. We make a
full comparison of PECs of both functionals with accurately
known results for a set of 22 complexes and also apply it to
extended solid systems, finding favorable results for the new
functional. Thus, we expect our method to have important
applications in a wide range of fields, including condensed
matter and materials physics, chemical physics, and the
physics of biological materials.

30This screening term is considerably smaller than the gradient
exchange term. We expect that as an estimate, we can without
major overall error simply assume that it increases in the same
proportion as gradient exchange itself. This ansatz, unlike other
simple approaches we might have taken, also assures that the
effect of the 10/7 factor enhancing Sham exchange continues to
cancel out of exchange and correlation together as it should
