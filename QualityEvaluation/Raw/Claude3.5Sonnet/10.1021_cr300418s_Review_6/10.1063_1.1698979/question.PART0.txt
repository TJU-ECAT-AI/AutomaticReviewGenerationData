Adiabatic Correlation Rules for Reactions Involving Polyatomic Intermediate Complexes 
and their Application to the Formation of OH(2 :E+) in the H 2-02 Flame

Adiabatic orbital and spin correlation rules applicable to a 
detailed study of elementary chemical reactions involving non-
linear polyatomic intermediate complexes have been formulated 
and are presented together with some pertinent correlation tables. 
These correlation rules and tables permit the determination of the 
adiabatically allowed term manifold of reaction products from the 
states of the separated reactants without reference to their de-
tailed electronic configurations. The formulation presented here 
utilizes group theoretical arguments relating to the symmetry 
properties of the reactants, the intermediate reaction complex, and 
the products and is based principally upon the results obtained 
previously by Mulliken for the resolution of species into those of 
point groups of lower symmetry. The effects of the change of the 
(geometrical) configuration of the intermediate reaction complex 
during reaction and of the electronic-vibrational coupling on these 
correlations have been considered in detail. It 
is concluded that 
strict orbital electronic correlation rules are operative only for 
reactions where neither the reactants nor the products are poly-
atomic. For reactions involving polyatomic reactants and/or 
products, the vibrational-electronic coupling weakens the simple 
orbital electronic correlations so that detailed uibronic correlations 
will be necessary. The spin correlation rules, however, are not

HE mechanisms of elementary reactions can best 
be studied in detail by constructing the relevant 
potential energy surfaces and investigating their proper-
ties and interactions.l To carry out such a program it is 
necessary to know the adiabatic correlations between 
the electronic states of reactants, intermediate reaction 
complexes, and products so that the resulting term 
manifold of the products can be determined from the 
states of the separated reactants. Such a knowledge is 
essential if the problems to be studied concern the 
formation of products in some specific electronic states 
from reactants in some specific electronic states. This 
is a topic which is of great importance in flame and 
photochemical reactions.

which may be of importance in the production of electronically 
excited OH[OH(I+)] 
in the hydrogen-oxygen flame. The mechan-
ism of these reactions is investigated with special reference to the 
predissociating OH(2-) state discussed recently by Gaydon and 
Wolfhard. It is suggested that the interaction of and the conse-
quent radiationless transition between HOI intermediate reaction 
complexes is primarily responsible for the formation of OH(2+) in 
its observed vibrational nonequilibrium distribution with the 
specific enhancement of the levels v'=2 and 3. 
The adiabatic correlations for the special case of association 
(and dissociation) reactions involving linear polyatomic inter-
mediate complexes and products are considered briefly in the 
Appendix. It is concluded that vibronic correlations are required 
for the determination of the product term manifold for these 
reactions. 
The correlation rules for the case atom+atomdi
atomic molecule (via a diatomic intermediate complex) 
have been worked out by Wigner and Witmer2 and dis-
cussed since in detail by several authors.',4 These corre-
lation rules can readily be extended to the case of linear 
polyatomic molecules and linear intermediate com-
plexes. A short discussion of these extended rules, to-
gether with the pertinent correlation tables, is pre-
sented in the Appendix. 
In the main body of this paper (Sec. II) an attempt 
will be made to formulate adiabatic orbital and spin 
correlation rules for the more important case of non-
linear polyatomic molecules and reaction complexes

n. CORRELATION RULES FOR NONLINEAR 
INTERMEDIATE REACTION COMPLEXES 
A. General Formulation 
The electronic states in which atoms and molecules 
may be produced in chemical reactions are determined 
by the adiabatic correlations which relate the states of 
reactants and products via those of the intermediate 
complex. In all reactions except those involving only 
two atoms the intermediate reaction complex will be 
polayatomic and most probably nonlinear, especially 
in reactions involving electrons in higher than s orbitals. 
In order for reactants and products to correlate, it will 
be necessary that the nonlinear intermediate complex 
(hereafter referred to as NLC) formed during the 
reaction have at least one electronic species in its term 
manifold which arises from the combination both of the 
reactants and of the products. In order to obtain the 
desired correlation rules, it is therefore necessary to 
relate adiabatically the states of the separated reactants 
with those of the products via the states of the NLC 
formed during the reaction. 
The classification, designation, and correlation of the 
electronic states of nonlinear polyatomic molecules is 
based upon the symmetry properties of their electronic 
wave functions 
.•. 
6.7 Making use of group theoretical 
methods, which are particularly suited to such systems, 
Mullikens,s has worked out correlations between sepa-
rated atomic and/or molecular components and non-
linear polayatomic molecules from a detailed considera-
tion of the possible electron configurations of the vari-
ous components. For application to chemical kinetics 
and for the study of reaction mechanisms it would, 
however, be more advantageous if these adiabatic 
correlations between reactants and products could be 
determined without any such detailed analysis of the 
electron configurations. Such a formulation, involving 
only a prior knowledge of the electronic states of the 
reactants can readily be carried through by utilizing the 
results obtained by Mulliken in the paper cited above.s.9 
The spin correlation rules for linear and nonlinear 
polyatomic molecules are identical with those for 
diatomic molecules formed from separated atoms. This 
is due to the fact that the electron spin is not affected 
by the electric field arising from the interaction of the

combining molecules.1o The principal problem thus 
centers in the formulation of the orbital correlation 
rules. 
These orbital correlation rules may be obtained in 
the following manner.n The reaction A + 
BC---J.AB+C 
may be written "configurationally" as 
.j}-.", 
i.----:;e  
A + t 
(1) 
x 
To correlate the states of the reactants A and BC and 
products AB and C via those of NLC (ABC) one sets up 
resolution tables which show the change of representa-
tions (species) in going from spherical symmetry (atoms) 
and linear symmetry (diatomic molecule) to the sym-
metry group X of the NLC. The allowed representa-
tions (i.e., electronic states) of the NLC (ABC) of sym-
metry group X are then obtained by forming the direct 
products of the representations found from the resolu-
tion tables A---tX and BC---tX. This correlates the states 
of the reactants with those of the NLC. To obtain the 
correlation between the NLC and the products of the 
reaction, one forms the direct products of the representa-
tions of the resolutions C---tX and AB---t.X. Given states 
of reactants and products will then correlate if, and only 
if, the NLC has at least one species which arises both 
from the combination of these reactant and of these 
product states. 
For a reaction between two diatomic molecules such as 
AB+

COl. C" v 
which proceeds via a NLC belonging to symmetry 
group Y, one again follows the procedure outlined above 
except that one now needs resolution tables only for 
C 
"v---t Y. The adiabatically allowed representations of 
the NLC are then obtained by forming the direct 
products of the representations of the C 
"v---t Y tables. 
This procedure could readily be extended to reactions 
involving reactants, intermediate complexes, and prod-
ucts of higher and higher atomicity. However, as will 
be shown below, the orbital correlation rules impose 
only very weak restrictions (or none at all) on the 
adiabatically allowed product term manifold for re-
actions involving polyatomic reactants and products. 
10 These spin correlation rules are, just as for the case of diatomic 
molecules, strictly valid only for weak. spin-orbit coupling in the 
polyatomic molecules, i.e., to the approximation that the spin 
part of the wave,function can be separated from he.oritlpart. 
The spin correlation rules thus should not be used mdlscrunmately 
for molecules containing very heavy atoms. 
11 In the author's original formulation, the orbital correlations 
were established via linear intermediate complexes whose trans-
formation to the actual NLC was analyzed by means of species 
resolution tables for linear to nonlinear point groups. The more 
elegant and direct method presented here was kindly pointed out 
to me by Professor R. S. Mulliken. I am very much indebted to 
Professor Mulliken for this and several other valuable contribu-
tions to this paper.

The discussion and tables to follow will thus be limited 
in the main to reactions between diatomic molecules 
and between atoms and diatomic molecules proceeding 
via a tri- or tetratomic NLC. 
Nonlinear complexes containing 3 or 4 atoms will 
usually belong to one of the symmetry groups Cr, C., 
C2., and C3v ,!2 where molecules of point group C1 have 
no symmetry elements at all. Resolution tables which 
show the change of atomic and diatomic species into 
those of the above (and other) point groups have been 
worked out by Mulliken.1i For ready reference the 
pertinent tables are given below. The direct product 
of the species of Tables I and II which give the allowed 
species of the NLC can be obtained from the tables 
given by Sponer and Teller.13 
Since the NLC will quite often be of symmetry C. the 
complete correlation tables for that point group will be 
given here. These tables are obtained by combining 
Tables I and II and using the direct product rules for C., 
viz., A'XA'=A', A"XA"=A', A'XA"=A"XA'=A". 
The entries in Tables III and IV are the allowed states 
of the NLC of symmetry C. arising from the combina-
tion of atomic and/or diatomic reactants in their 
various electronic states. 
To give a concrete example which illustrates the 
above-described procedure, we shall consider briefly the 
reaction CH+OCO+OH* 
suggested by Gaydon14 
to account for the appearance of some of the electroni-
cally excited OH*(2+) in hydrocarbon flames. lli Writing 
CH(X2II)+02(.xa;:}--t02· 
CH[C.}---t 
CO(I+)+OH(2+) (3) 
where it is assumed, somewhat arbitrarily, that the 
intermediate complex 02·CH is of symmetry C., i.e., 
planar, one finds from Table IV and the spin correlation 
rules that the reactants give rise to a NLC [C.] of 
species 2,4A' and 2,4A" and the products give rise to a 
NLC [C.] of species 2A'. Reactants and products thus 
correlate adiabatically via a surface of designation 2A', 
so that reaction (3) as written above is an allowed one 
as regards both spin and orbital correlations. For 
12 In view of the discussion to follow, point group DSh may be 
ruled out as being of no importance. 
13 See reference 7. The direct products for CJ, C., and C,v can be 
obtained from Tables III and IV, those for C,. from Tables VII 
and VIII of that paper. 
J4 See, e.g., A. G. Gaydon, Quart. Revs. 4, 1 (1950). 
J6 The superscript star here as in the equations to follow denotes 
the electronically excited species. 
CH*(A2,:l) and CH*(B2-) reaction (3) also corre-
lates with the above products via a 2A' surface. For 
CH*(C2+), however, reaction (3) cannot proceed via 
a NCL of symmetry C. since the reactants now give 
rise to a NLC of species 2,4A" whereas the NLC ob-
tained from the products CO(I+) and OH(2+) is of 
species 2A'. The same analysis can also be undertaken 
for various other electronic states of O2 with a fixed 
CH(X2II) with the result that all the (stable) electronic 
states of O2 correlate, both spin and orbital wise, with 
the products of reaction (3) via a NLC of symmetry C 
•. 
B. The Least Symmetrical Complex 
In tracing the detailed configurational course of a 
chemical reaction, it will in general be an oversimplifica-
tion to consider the NLC as being of the same symmetry 
throughout the reaction. A reaction such as A+B2 
AB+B may proceed configurationally by

more than three atoms, the NLC may change from a 
planar to a nonplanar configuration as the reaction 
proceeds toward the product side. A sequence of non-
linear complexes of different symmetry may thus be 
formed during the course of a chemical reaction. 
It can, however, readily be shown that the totality 
of adiabatically allowed correlations between reactants 
and products is obtained via the least symmetrical com-
plex (LSC)16 formed during the reaction and that it will 
not be necessary to consider explicitly the intermediate 
complexes of higher symmetry in arriving at the corre-
lations. The least symmetrical complex, owing to its 
low symmetry, will impose the least number of sym-
metry conditions upon the orbital electronic wave 
functions of reactants and products which have to be 
met in order for correlations to be possible. The maxi-

mum number of correlations between the states of the 
reactants and products for a given reaction is thus ob-
tained via this complex of least symmetry. It can 
furthermore readily be verified from Tables I and II 
and from the resolution tables given by Mulliken5 
(and can also readily be shown by simple group theo-
retical arguments) that the species obtained for point 
groups of lower symmetry by resolution from point 
groups of higher symmetry are independent of the path 
of the resolution; the correlating species of the LSC 
obtained by the direct resolution of the separated re-
actants (or products) are thus identical with those that 
would be obtained by a gradual resolution via point 
groups of lower and lower symmetry. Since the correla-
tions between the reactants (or the products) and the 
LSC are thus independent of the detailed mode of 
formation of this LSC during the reaction, the allowed 
correlations can be obtained via the LSC without any 
further consideration of the intervening complexes of 
higher symmetry.

the discussion given above, the restrictions imposed on

the allowed term manifold of the products of a chemical 
reaction by the necessity for adiabatic correlations 
between reactants and products become less important 
for LSC of lower symmetry groups. If, for instance, the 
LSC formed during a reaction is of symmetry group 
C1 (which has no symmetry elements), there are no 
restrictions on the orbital correlations between reactants 
and products at all and the products may be formed in 
any and all orbital electronic states irrespective of the 
particular states of the reactants. Since the LSC for 
reactions involving nonlinear complexes will in general 
be of a rather low symmetry,'7 it is evident that the 
orbital electronic correlation rules do not playas im-
portant a role in reactions involving nonlinear inter-
mediate complexes as they do for atomic association 
reactions and for the dissociation of diatomic molecules.ls 
17 The most stable intermediate complex in a reaction is prob-
ably highly symmetric [see, e.g., J. L. Magee, J. Chern. Phys. 8, 
677 (194O)J and it is thus likely on energetic grounds that a NLC 
of high symmetry is formed initially during a reaction. As the 
reaction proceeds this NLC will, however, be distorted as it 
begins to break up into the products (see e.g., reaction 4 above) 
and it is this distorted NLC which will in general be of a low 
symmetry. 
18 The spin correlation rules are of course still operative and 
applicable to within the degree of validity discussed in footnote 10.

For reactions of the type ABCD+EFGH-products, 
where the reactants (or products) are n atomic mole-
cules with n3 it seems unlikely that the LSC will 
have any symmetry elements at all. One would thus 
expect that the orbital correlation rules would impose no 
restrictions on the allowed product term manifold. If, 
however, one of the reactants has very high symmetry 
such as D6h, the LSC formed during such reactions 
may, owing to the rather localized attack of the other 
reactant, not be distorted too much from the original 
symmetry of the highly symmetric reactant. In that 
case one may then have "weak" correlations rather than 
no correlation restrictions at all. This would be an-
alogous to the "weak" selection rules for optical transi-
tions of highly symmetrical polyatomic molecules which 
may have been distorted from their original symmetry 
by substituents or small side chains but which still 
retain a sufficient approximation to their former sym-
metry for the initially forbidden transitions to be weakly 
allowed in their new configuration. While there appears 
to be at present no experimental evidence bearing on 
this question of "weak" correlation rules, it would be 
of interest to see this point followed up in more detail. 
C. The Influence of Vibrations 
The discussion so far has been confined entirely to 
the electronic states of the reactants, intermediate com-
plexes, and products and has neglected the influence of 
the molecular vibrations on the orbital correlations.19 ,2o 
This is certainly valid for diatomic molecules where the 
vibrations cannot alter the molecular symmetry. For 
polyatomic molecules, however, where (non 
totally 
symmetrical) vibrations can change the symmetry of 
the nuclear skeleton and thus alter the potential field 
in which the electrons move, this coupling of vibrational 
and electronic motion will have to be taken into account. 
This is particularly true for chemical reactions where a 
strong vibrational-electronic mixing is to be expected 
owing to the considerable vibrational excitation which 
accompanies the formation and breakup of the inter-
mediate reaction complex. 
19 Within the approximation that the spin part of the wave 
function is separable from the orbital part, the vibration of the 
nuclear skeleton will not affect the spin correlations. 
20 This discussion will be limited to the interactions of the elec-
tronic and vibrational motions and will exclude the coupling with 
rotation. This may be permissible to a good approximation since 
the effects of the rotational coupling for polyatomic molecules, 
owing to their generally high moments of inertia and small angular 
velocities, are probably only second order compared to the vibra-
tional-electronic ones.

KURT E. SHULER 
To take account of the effect of the vibrational-
electronic interaction on the reactant-product correla-
tions, it will be necessary to investigate the correlations 
between the vibronic (vibrational-electronic) states of 
the reactants, the LSC and the products.21 The require-
ment for an adiabatic vibronic correlation is, analogous 
to the electronic ones discussed above, that the LSC 
have a vibronic species which arises both from the 
combination of the vibronic states of the reactants and 
of the products. In carrying out such an analysis, it is 
found that (a) for reactions involving only atomic 
and/or diatomic reactants and products, vibronic and 
electronic correlations lead to identical results so that 
the vibrational-electronic interactions do not have to 
be taken into account explicitly; (b) for reactions in-
volving polyatomic reactants or products the totality 
of the allowed adiabatic correlations between reactant 
and product states can be obtained only by making 
vibronic correlations so that in this case the vibrational-
electronic interaction must be taken into account. 
Case (a) 
The "vibronic states" of atoms and diatomic mole-
cules are identical with their electronic ones. The only 
polyatomic species involved in the reaction whose 
vibronic states must be determined is the LSC and the 
only mode of vibration of this LSC which must be taken 
into account in establishing the vibronic correlations is 
the vibration along the reaction coordinate22 which 
brings about the breakup of the LSC into its separated 
constituents, i.e., the vibration which leads to reaction. 
None of the other modes of vibration of the LSC enter 
into this problem since they do not lead to reaction. The 
only difference between an electronic and a vibronic 
correlation is then that for the latter, one uses the 
vibronic states of the LSC obtained by forming the 
direct product of the electronic representations and the 
vibrational species which leads to reaction. To each 
electronic state of the LSC there corresponds then one, 
and only one, vibronic state which is pertinent to the 
reaction. It is readily evident that under these condi-
tions, states of reactants and products which correlate 
electronically will also do so vibronically,28 while, con-
11 The vibronic representations (states) are obtained by forming 
the direct product of the pertinent electronic and vibrational 
representations. For a detailed discussion, see reference 7. The 
vibrational species for various symmetry groups are discussed at

23 Thus, for example, reactants A+B2 of species e1S. and 812:;.+ 
will correlate electronically via a LSC (C20) of species 'lA l with 
products AB+B of species olPu and <1;1. If 
the vibration along the 
reaction coordinate is of species B 
2, then for a vibronic correlation 
one has: reactants ••

, and various other vibronic 
species. Reactant and product states thus correlate vibronically 
via evlB2 as they correlated electronically via 8lA l. 
versely, states which do not correlate electronically 
will not correlate vibronically either.24 
Case (b) 
In this case the vibrational-electronic interaction 
must be considered explicitly for both the LSC and the 
polyatomic reactants and/or products. The argument 
for the LSC follows along the lines given above in that 
only the vibrations along the reaction coordinate which 
lead to reaction need to be taken into account. For the 
polyatomic reactants and products, however, all modes 
of vibration must be taken into consideration since 
their vibrational motions are independent of those of 
the LSC owing to the rearrangement of the vibrational 
energy during the reaction. If one now tests the vi-
bronic correlations between the various vibronic states 
of the reactants, the products, and that of the LSC, one 
finds that some of the states of reactants and products 
which did not correlate electronically will do so vibroni-
cally.25 The vibrational-electronic coupling must there-
fore be taken into explicit account in establishing the 
correlations for these reactions. 
For reactions involving polyatomic reactants, the 
LSC will in general be of a very low symmetry or have 
no symmetry properties at all so that there will be 
hardly any orbital electronic restrictions on the adi-
abatically allowed product term manifold. If to this 
one adds the additional product states allowed by the 
electronic-vibrational interaction, it becomes evident 
that the adiabatic orbital correlation rules impose very 
few, if any, restrictions on the allowed term manifold 
of the products of a chemical reaction.26 One may thus 
state the quite general rule that, except for some ex-
ceptional cases, there are no strong orbital restrictions on 
the adiabatically allowed electronic term manifold of the 
products formed in chemical reactions involving poly-
atomic reactants.

analogy with that presented in reference 23. The rule is based on 
the fact that ·XX·Y""<ZX·y for X...,Z if X, Y, and Z are non-

degenerate species owing to the operation of the Jahn-Teller 
principle. 
25 For a simple example of vibronic correlations, see R. S. 
Mulliken, Phys. Rev. 60, 506 (1941). Note, for instance, that while 
the <III. state of linear CO2 does not correlate with the 8lA, -state 
of bent CO2, certain corresponding vibronic states "I};,,- and

branching steps in the H2-02 reaction. The work of 
Gaydon and Wolfhard28 and Broida and Shuler9 on the 
specific enhancement of OH(2) 
to the levels v' = 2 and 
3 seems to indicate that there is a large concentration 
of free atoms in the H2-02 
flame at atmospheric pres-
sure. It 
is therefore reasonable to suppose that reactions 
(5) and (6) are of some importance in the hydrogen-
oxygen flame at atmospheric pressure and will con-
tribute to the formation of OH(22;+) in these flames. It 
would be of particular interest to ascertain by what 
mechanism the electronically excited OH(22;+) is pro-
duced preferentially in the levels v' = 2 and 3. As will 
be shown below, the correlation rules developed in 
Sec. II will be of great help in arriving at a more detailed 
picture of these processes. 
A. The Reaction H+02
->OH*+0 
The detailed features of the production of OH(22;+) 
can best be brought out from a consideration of the 
relevant potential energy surfaces.30 The only electronic 
states of the reactants which need be consideredt are 
H2(S) and 02(32;g-, Idg , 12;g+, 32;,.+, 32;,.-). All other 
states of Hand O2
, both homopolar or ionic, are ener-
getically too high to be of importance. As far as the 
products are concerned, the electronic states which 
must be taken into account are 0(3Pg, IDg) and OH(2IT, 
22;-,22;+) and the repulsive states of OH such as 42;- and 
4IT. There is some question as to the nature of the 22;-
state of OH. Gaydon and Wolfhard28 have suggested a 
wakly attractive OH(22;-) state on the basis of their 
spectroscopic findings, while a consideration of the 
electron configuration of OH(22;-)[K(2so)2(2pO")2(2p'/l")2 
X (3sO")] would seem to indicate that it may be a re-
pulsive one. The weakly attractive OH(22;-) state in the 
form suggested by Gaydon and Wolfhard has been 
chosen for the potential energy surfaces of Figs. 1 and 2. 
Since the role of the 22;- state of OH in reactions (5) and 
(6) is not affected by or dependent upon its stability, 
the arguments to follow will retain their validity even 
if further spectroscopic work should prove that the 
OH(22;-) state is repulsive. 
The LCS (H02
) formed in reaction (5) is most prob-
ably of symmetry C. so that the correlations between 
the reactants H+02 and the products OH+O can be 
determined from Table III. Since reaction (5) involves 
only atomic and diatomic reactants and products, a 
purely electronic correlation will suffice to establish 
the adiabatic term manifold of the products (see case a

recently observed the 3a. and 12),,- states of 02. These states, 
which are found to be close to the 12),,+ state, should be added to 
the above list of O2 states. This addition will, however, not in-
fluence the arguments to follow since the main interest centers on 
the correlations involving O2

above). The correlations pertinent to the formation of 
OH(22;+) are shown in Fig. 1.31 The potential curves for 
O2 were taken from Herzberg,4 the OH potential curves 
were calculated from Morse functions,a2 and that for 
OH(22;-) is based on the work of Gaydon and Wolf-
hard.28 It 
will be noted that the ground states of O2 
and 
OH, i.e., O2
(32;9-) and OH(2m, correlate via H02
(2,4A"); 
the excited states O2
(32;,.-) and OH(22;+) correlate via a 
different H02 surface of species 2.4A". All of the states 
of O2 which arise from 0(3P)+0(3P) correlate with 
OH(22;-) via either "A' or 'A" surfaces. 
The discussion of the behavior and properties of the 
potential surfaces in the interior of the cube will be 
limited to the ground state of O2
, in which most of the 
oxygen molecules will be found, and to the excited 
state O2
(32;,,-) arising from o 
(3P) + o 
(3P) which can 
correlate directly with OH(22;+).33 One of the ways in 
which OH(22;+) can be formed utilizes excited O2(32;,,-) 
via the upper, excited 2A" surface by 
02(32;,,-)+H(2Sg)->H02
(2A")-tOH(22;+)+0(3Pg). 
(7) 
31 Figure 1 is based on certain simplifying assumptions which 
must be made in order for a graphical presentation of potential 
surfaces of polyatomic molecules to be feasible. Since only two 
spatial coordinates are available (the third coordinate giving the 
potential energy of the system), one must neglect the vibrations 
of the NLC and make the additional assumption that all bond 
angles remain constant during the reaction so that the two 
intermolecular distances H-O and 0-0 will be sufficient for a 
complete configurational (and thus energetic) specification of the 
reaction complex. Similar stratagems must be used for the con-
struction of potential energy diagrams for all types of nonlinear 
polyatomic molecules. The use of this simplified model will, 
however, not affect the validity of the discussion to follow.

.. In writing down these correlations, only the lowest multi-
plicity of the intermediate reaction complex will be considered 
explicitly. In the absence of information to the contrary, it will 
be assumed that among surfaces of identical orbital species the 
one with the lowest multiplicity will be the lowest energetically 
and thus the one on which the reaction is most likely to proceed.

A path whereby OH(2+)

OH(2+), respectively. This reaction can be written as

transition 
Since the two surfaces between which the radiation-
less transition of reaction (8) is supposed to take place 
are of the same orbital electronic species and multi-
plicity (2A"), one would expect such a large repulsive 
interaction that this radiationless transition would seem 
to have only a very small probability of occurrence. 
It has, however, been shown by Teller36 that potential 
surfaces of polyatomic molecules of the same electronic 
species may cross since now two or more parameters 
(internuclear distances, bond angles) are available 
whose variation will be sufficient in all cases to produce 
a degeneracy of such electronic states and thus allow a 
crossing of the surfaces. The probability of a radiation-
less transition of the reaction system at such a crossing 
point may be quite high, the transition probability 
being given by an equation analogous to that derived 
by Zener and Landau for diatomic molecules.! The 
radiationless transition shown in Eq. (8) may thus 
occur by this mechanism. 
A radiationless transition between the two 2A" sur-
faces of reaction (8) may also be brought about by the 
weak coupling of the two different charge distributions 
34 This intersection could not readily be shown in Fig. 1. It is 
clear, however, that since OH(2l:+) and OH(2l:-) intersect, the 
surfaces which connect with these states must also intersect in the 
interior of the cube. 
35 E. Teller, J. Phys. Chern. 41, 109 (1937). 
of the upper and lower 2A" states. The upper 2A" sur-
face of H02 is formed from 02(3,,-) and H(2Sg). It 
has 
been pointed out by Mulliken36 that the 02(3u-) state 
is an ionic one (V state) resulting from 0+0- and 
0-0+, and it may thus be assumed that the H0 2(2A") 
resulting from it will have a certain amount of ionicity 
and may perhaps be written as (HO)+-o- and 
(HO-)-O+. The 02(3o-) ground state is homopolar 
(N state) and the H0 2(2A") formed from it is thus 
presumably homopolar. Since the interaction between 
these ionic and homopolar 2A" states takes place at a 
rather large 0-0 internuclear distance (see Fig. 1), 
a radia 
tionless transition between the two 2 A" sllrfaces 
may quite readily occur.37 It 
is not possible to ascertain 
without a more detailed investigation which one of 
these two processes is more effective in reaction (8). 
In order to account for the specific enhancement of 
the levels v' = 2 and 3 of OH(2+) in the hydrogen-
oxygen flame, Gaydon and Wolfhard28 have suggested 
the "pre-association" reaction 
radiationless 
0(3P)+H(2S)OH(2-) 
)OH(2+), (9) 
transition 
where it is postulated that the OH(2-) curve intersects 
the OH(2+) curve at about v' = 2. The interaction of 
OH(2-) and OH(2+) is, however, very weak, being 
due to only a very small coupling between the elec-
tronic spin and the rotation of the internuclear axis. 
It 
is therefore doubtful whether the radiationless transi-
tion shown in reaction (9) is sufficiently strong to ac-
count for the observed vibrational nonequilibrium 
distribution of OH(2+). The radiationless transitions 
of polyatomic molecules are in general stronger than 
those brought about in diatomic molecules by the 
coupling of rotational and electronic motion. It 
is there-
fore suggested that reaction (8), with H atoms in excess 
of their thermal equilibrium concentration, is more 
efficient in producing OH(2+) in its specific vibrational 
nonequilibrium distribution than the two atom pre-
association reaction put forth tentatively by Gaydon 
and Wolfhard.38 
B. The Reaction O+H2OH*+H 
The LSC (OH 2) for this reaction is most probably of 
symmetry C. so that Table III is to be used in estab-
lishing the correlation between reactants and products. 
The relevant electronic states which need to be con-
36 R. S. Mulliken, J. Chern. Phys. 7, 20 (1939). 
37 The decisive factor here is the relative magnitude of the period 
of nuclear vibration and the time required for the electron to 
tunnel from one charge distribution to the other. This depends 
upon the internuclear distance at which the "crossing" takes place. 
For a more detailed discussion, see F. London, Z. Physik 74, 143 
(1932). 
3S Reaction (8) is also to be preferred for the production of 
OH(2l:+) over reaction (9) on the ground that the concentration 
of O2 molecules in the hydrogen-oxygen flame is much larger than 
that of 0 atoms so that collisions between H and O2 will be much 
more frequent than those between Hand 0 atoms.

sidered on the basis of the available energy are 0(3Pg) 
and OeDg), OH(2ll, 2-, 2+) and H2(Ig+, 3u+). All 
other states of H2
, both ionic and excited homopolar 
are energetically too high39 to be of much importance 
in this reaction. The same holds true for 0(15g ) which 
is about 4.2 ev above 0(3P 
g). The pertinent correlations 
between the reactant and product states via the 
LSC (OH2) of symmetry Cv are shown in Fig. 2. 
It will be noted from Fig. 2 that if OH(2+) is 
to be produced from 0(3Pg
) and H2(1g+) there must 
be a radiationless transition between OH2(lA') and 
OH2(3A"). Owing to the difference in both spin and 
symmetry of the electronic wave functions, the inter-
actions between these two states will be extremely weak. 
While the interaction of orbital electronic species may 
sometimes be enhanced sufficiently for radiationless 
transitions by the excitation of non 
totally symmetric 
vibrations,7 the interaction between triplet and singlet 
surfaces can be brought about only by spin-orbit 
coupling which for the light nuclei considered here 
would be extremely weak. The reaction 
radia 
tionless 
0(3PII)+H2(1g+)OH2(3A")------> 
transition 
would thus be much less effective than reaction (8) in 
producing 
OH(2+). Aside from possible energetic 
considerations, and by analogy with similar reactions 
which violate the spin correlation principle,! about 
1()4 to 106 OH(2+) 
radicals will be produced by reaction 
(8) for every one formed by reaction (to). 
The principal mechanism by which OH(22;+) is formed 
directly from 0 plus H2 in reaction (6) involves excited 
oxygen atoms and may be written as 
This reaction is the analog of reaction (7) involving H 
plus O2 where both reactions proceed on excited com-
plex surfaces. While reactions (7) and (11), like many 
other chemical reactions, may well give rise to products 
in some type of nonequilibrium distribution, they 
cannot account for the very specific enhancement of the 
levels v' = 2 and 3 of OH(2+). If this observed non-
equilibrium distribution is to be attributed to a specific 
chemical reaction, then the most likely one appears to 
be reaction (8) where the specific enhancement is 
brought about by the radiationless transition at the 
crossing point of the two H0 2(2A") surfaces.

APPENDIX 
Correlation Rules for Reactions Involving 
Polyatomic Linear Complexes and Products 
For simple association reactions where the only 
product is a linear polyatomic molecule, it seems quite 
likely that the intermediate complex will be of a linear 
equilibrium nuclear configuration throughout the course 
of the reaction. This type of reaction is exemplified by 
O+CO···C···+O-C-O 
Cv 
D 
h 
and 
N+NN·· 
·N·· ·ON-N-O, 
Cv 
Cv 
where the LSC is linear and of symmetry Cv. The 
adiabatic correlation rules relating the states of these 
linear polyatomic products to those of the separated 
reactants are, owing to the presence of identical sym-
metry relations, very similar'to those for the formation 
of diatomic molecules from separated atoms and can 
readily be obtained by a simple extension of the Wigner-
Witmer rules.3 •4 
The electronic spin correlation rules are identical 
for the formation of both diatomic and linear poly-
atomic molecules. Depending upon the mode of forma-
tion of the linear polyatomic molecule (LPM) (atom 
+molecule or molecule+molecule), the orbital angular 
momentum quantum number Ap of the polyatomic 
molecule is given, in analogy with the diatomic case, by 
Ap= IML+MAI or Ap= IMA+MA'I where ML, MA, 
and M A' are, respectively, the components of orbital 
angular momenta of the atoms and/or molecules which 
combine to form the linear polyatomic molecule. How-

of the normal modes in such h'ighly symmetrical systems 
will make for added complexity. It can probably be 
stated as a general rule that owing to the vibrational-

tions on the adiabatic term manifold of the LPM 
produced in simple association reactions for which 
Tables V to VII can serve as general guide posts. The 
adiabatic spin correlations which determine the multi-

vibrational-electronic coupling. 
41 For these types of dissociation (and association) reactions the 
large amplitUde of the oscillations in conjunction with the an-
harmonicity of the potential energy will make for particularly
