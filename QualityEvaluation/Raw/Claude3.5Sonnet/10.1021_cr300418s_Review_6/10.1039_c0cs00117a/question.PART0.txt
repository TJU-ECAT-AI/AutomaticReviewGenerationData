This critical review describes the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts from the point of view
of four simple, but essential for Chemistry, molecules (namely dihydrogen, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen monoxide and ethylene) that are considered as probes or as reactants in combination
with in situ controlled temperature and pressure Infrared spectroscopy. The fundamental
properties of H2, CO, NO and C2H4 are shortly described in order to justify their different
behaviour in respect of isolated sites in different environments, extended surfaces, clusters,
crystalline or amorphous materials. The description is given by considering some key studies
and trying to evidence similarities and differences among surfaces and probes (572 references).

Introduction: Probing a surface
Heterogeneous catalysts are complex systems whose properties
are given by a combination of multiple factors. Activity,
selectivity and life-time of the catalyst are determined by the
optimum combination of specific features that range from
nano to micro and macro properties of the surface properties
of the catalyst.1 A powerful tool to obtain a detailed descrip-
tion of the catalyst surface properties is the use of probe
molecules in combination with an investigative technique
able to monitor with the sufficient sensitivity the probe
surface interaction.222 One of the most widely used techniques
that follows this approach, is Mid-infrared spectroscopy
(4200400 cm1) using appropriate probe molecules. The
method is indirect, in the sense that it monitors the surface
through the perturbation inferred to the probe. The observables
are the changes in vibrational frequency and intensity of the
probe modes. IR-inactive modes can also be observed as a
result of the interaction with the surface. In some cases it is
also possible to follow induced changes of skeletal and surfaces
modes of the catalysts2325 and or to follow a reaction-dynamic
on the surface.16,20,26,27 In this respect, time- and temperature-
resolved FTIR spectroscopy has the potential to detect inter-
mediate species in a reaction chain.20 In this contribution we
have chosen four probe molecules (H2, CO, NO and C2H4) and
for each of them we will report some case studies in which
they behave as probe molecules and or as reagent.

Ideally, molecular probes for IR studies should satisfy the
following requirements (i) small size, so that the probe can
monitor surfaces in all details, (ii) detectable by infrared and
associated by features that can discriminate between surface
sites of different nature, (iii) high extinction coefficients, so
as to lead to optimum detection sensitivity, (iv) the probe
molecule should allow to perform quantitative determinations
and be responsive not only to the surface site but also to its
close environment, this is particularly relevant for detecting
bi-functional surface sites, and (v) in order to avoid alterations
of the material under test, probesurface interaction should be
ideally weak. Exception to point (i) can be done in some
specific cases, like Brnsted sites in zeolites, where IR spectro-
scopy allows to measure both the perturbation of the molecule
on the adsorbing site and the perturbation of the latter
induced by probe adsorption. In these cases, the parallel use
of different probe molecules of increasing size (NH3 and TMA
or Py and collidine etc. . .) can result in a surface site speciation
able to discriminate the different adsorbing sites on the basis of
their accessibility.22,2830
2.
Dihydrogen
2.1
The Dihydrogen molecule, its vibrational properties and
the experimental set up
Dihydrogen is an attractive probe molecule for many reasons31
(i) the small dimensions should allow a very detailed descrip-
tion of surfaces and cavities; (ii) the unperturbed n(HH) mode
is IR-inactive so, any band appearing in the IR is due with
perturbations induced by the adsorption process; (iii) H2 is
highly sensitive to surface heterogeneity: even small pertur-
bations of the single HH bond induced by interaction with
surface centers lead to shift of the n(HH) stretching mode
larger than those observed for probes containing multiple
bonds (N2, O2, CO)32 and finally (iv) because of its amphoteric
character (quadrupolar moment as shown in the bottom inset
of Fig. 1), H2 is able to test both acidic and basic surface sites.
A limitation in the use of H2 as a probe is however represented
by the very low interaction energy with most adsorbing
centers, a fact which often requires very low temperatures
(at least 77 K or even lower, vide infra) to obtain reasonable H2
coverage.17,31,3338 This justifies the smaller number of papers
published so far on the IR spectra of adsorbed dihydrogen in
respect of parallel studies made by using other probe
molecules.
Before going on to illustrate and discuss the manifestations
of adsorbed H2, it is useful to shortly summarize the basic
spectroscopic properties of the dihydrogen molecule in the free
(gaseous) state:3941 (i) dihydrogens exist as two isomers
differing for the orientation of the nuclear spins, i.e., para-
(nuclear singlet state, I = 0) and ortho-H2 (nuclear triplet
state, I = 1); (ii) nuclear statistic confines the two spin
isomers to different rotational states, characterized by even
Fig. 1
Vibrational manifestations of ortho-H2 (I = 1) and para-H2
(I = 0). The main part reports in the (42204100 cm1 region) the
Raman spectrum of unperturbed H2 in the gas phase (pure vibrational
modes). The rotationalvibrational Raman spectrum of gaseous H2 is
reported in the top inset (44504750 cm1 region). Only the two
narrow components are pertinent, the intense and broad band at ca.
4570 cm1 being due to fluorescence by the quartz cell. Bottom inset:
electrostatic potential curves of H2 showing the quadrupolar nature of
the molecule. Unpublished figure.

J (rotational quantum number) values for para- and by
odd J values for ortho-H2; (iii) the two isomers give rise to
distinguishable spectroscopic manifestations in the Raman
spectrum of normal H2 as depicted in Fig. 1, that reports the
data for vibrational and rotational-vibrational spectra of
gaseous dihydrogen.42 The n = 0 - n = 1 transition
(n, vibrational quantum number) in para-(Q(0)) and ortho-H2
(Q(1)) are at 4161 and 4155 cm1, respectively. The Q1(0) and
Q1(1) components shift to lower frequency (812 cm1) on
passing from gaseous to liquid and solid H2 and, as their
separation increases, passing from 6 (gas) to 9 (solid) cm1.
For what concerns the vibrationalrotational components, the
lowest in frequency is the S1(0) at 4500 cm1 for para-H2 and
the S1(1) at 4715 cm1 for ortho-H2. Finally, although the
equilibrium ortho/para ratio is a function of the temperature
(e.g., it is 3 : 1 at 298 K and about 1 : 99 at 20 K), the
interconversion of ortho-H2 to the more stable para form is
very slow even in the liquid state, since it requires an inversion
of nuclear spins.43,44 Faster interconversion can be promoted
by spin catalysis (vide for instance ref. 45 and references
therein) through adsorption on metals such as tungsten and
nickel and solids with surface-active and paramagnetic centers
(vide infra). Because the nuclear spin is reversed without
breaking the HH bond,44 and the two H2 species have
different spectroscopic features, the evolution of one species
to the other can be followed during an IR experiment.
The infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed
using an ad hoc designed cryogenic cell allowing (i) the in situ
high-temperature activation of the sample under high vacuum
conditions or in the desired atmosphere. (ii) to perform FTIR
adsorption experiments at fixed temperature, as low as ca.
20 K (estimated at the sample level), and variable H2 pressure
(in the 00.5 bar range); (iii) to record the IR spectra of the
species adsorbed in the whole 30020 K temperature interval
while simultaneously measuring the gas-phase equilibrium
pressure (PH2), a procedure which allows us to obtain the
site-specific adsorption enthalpy.17 A detailed description of
the cryogenic cell (consisting of a modified closed circuit liquid
helium Oxford CCC 1204 cryostat) is given elsewhere.14 The
FTIR spectra were collected in transmission mode (at 2 cm1
resolution) on a Bruker Equinox-55 FTIR spectrometer
equipped with a MCT detector whose sample compartment
was modified ad hoc to accommodate the cryogenic IR cell.
In the following we will use the wavenumber of the Q(0)
mode of para-H2 as reference for the unperturbed molecule:
n0(HH) = 4161 cm1; from this reference all shifts undergone
by the H2 molecule upon adsorption on a surface site will be
defined as D
n(HH) = 
n(HH)  
n0(HH). As the n(HH) mode
of the dihydrogen molecule undergoes a batochromic- (or red-)
shift upon adsorption, observed D
n(HH) shifts will be negative.
Hereafter, the interaction of H2 with the following class of
materials will be reviewed from the insight of IR spectroscopy;
section
2.2: microporous
polymers;
section
2.3: zeolitic
materials; section 2.4: MOFs materials; section 2.5: high surface
area oxides; section 2.6: composite metal nanoparticles/zeolitic
materials. This list, drawn on the basis of the authors back-
ground, is of course far from exhaustive. Interaction of H2
with graphitic materials like high surface area carbons, carbon
nanotubes, graphane layers is of course a very important
chapter in materials science,4649 that has been overlooked
in this review owing to the extremely high experimental
difficulties encountered in collecting IR spectra from this black
class of materials.50 Inelastic neutron scattering,5153 Raman
spectroscopy54 and ab initio calculations5559 are more appropriate
techniques in this regard.
2.2
Dihydrogen exploring unpolar cavities: Adsorption in
microporous polymers
Surfaces of polymeric microporous materials are hardly charac-
terized by probe molecules due to the mostly unpolar character
of their surfaces, nevertheless, dihydrogen has proven to be
able to discriminate materials characterized by crystalline
microporous ordered phases from totally disordered systems.60
Due to the absence of specific polarizing sites, molecular
hydrogen adsorbs on these materials only at a tempera-
ture close to that of liquid helium (approximately 20 K).
Fig. 2a compares the spectra obtained at highest coverage
(PH2 = 30 mbar) on two aerogels both with 35% crystallinity
and 90% porosity, one nanoporous (d phase, black curve in
Fig. 2a), the second dense (b phase, dark grey curve); H2
adsorbed in a commercial St-DVB material with high surface
area (ca. 1000 m2 g1) is also shown for the sake of comparison.
d and b phases were used as prepared, in the form of small
cylinders with a diameter of about 1 cm and 0.5 cm thick. The
St-DVB sample was measured on a self-supporting pellet
obtained by finely grinding the commercial beads. Before
H2 adsorption all the samples were outgassed overnight
under high vacuum (residual pressure o106 bar) at 300 K
to remove adsorbed impurities.
A downward shift in respect to the Raman frequency of the
free molecule in the range of D
n(HH) = 1060 cm1 agrees
with the calculations of Hu
 bner et al.61 and can be ascribed to
Fig. 2

and (b) reports a schematic representation of high and medium H2
loadings, respectively. Polymer walls in blue, H2 molecules in red. The

the interaction of H2 with the electron rich part of the
polymeric structures (phenyl rings) through weak dispersive
forces.42 These absorptions are intense and well defined for the
d aerogel showing some narrow or very narrow components
centered at ca. 4145 (with two shoulders at higher and lower
frequency), 4136, 4117 and 4107 cm1 while are negligible for
the b aerogel. This clearly indicates that the FTIR peaks of
Fig. 2a (black line) correspond to specific interactions of H2
with the phenyl rings of the nanoporous crystalline phase. On
the contrary, the spectrum obtained for the fully amorphous
cross-linked polystyrene (light grey curve), while covering the
same spectral range, consists of a broad nearly structureless
absorption (full width at half maximum ca. 40 cm1). The fine
structure characteristic of d phase has been considered a
consequence of the presence of a regular arrangement of the
adsorbing centers which induces ordering of the H2 molecules
in the adsorbed phases. The dependence of the H2 spectrum on
the gas equilibrium pressure for the adsorption at 20 K on the
d aerogel of s-PS is shown in Fig. 2b. It is evident that the
components in the 41254100 cm1 range are the last to
disappear on lowering the H2 equilibrium pressure and must
be hence associated with stronger adsorption sites (as compared
to those responsible for the bands in the 41554125 cm1
interval). A plausible hypothesis is that these sites are
associated with more confined regions of the cavities of the d
phase. The inclusion of four H2 molecules per each crystalline
cavity (up to 2 wt%) of the nanoporous d phase has
been shown by molecular simulations (Grand canonical
Monte Carlo simulations) and confirmed by gravimetric
measurements.60 This H2 uptake in the crystalline cavities
has been shown to be additive with respect to the H2 adsorp-
tion on the surface of the aerogel nanofibers.
2.3
Dihydrogen exploring zeolitic cavities: Interaction with
walls, framework and extraframework sites
Among microporous materials, zeolites represent probably
one of the most studied in the field of heterogeneous catalysts.
The possibility to choose the Si/Al ratio in synthetic zeolites in
wide ranges, makes it possible to modulate the ionicity of the
material (which increases with decreasing Si/Al ratio). The net
formal charge associated with each the AlO4, units is 1e, so
that the zeolite framework is negatively charged. The net
negative charge is balanced by Mn+ cations (Lewis acid centres),
or by protons in the acidic form of the zeolite. These ions are
not a part of the zeolite framework, and can be exchanged by
other cations, affecting acidity and internal electric fields.
Brnsted acidity arises from bridging Si(OH)Al groups in
the protonic form of zeolites. An important source of
Lewis acidity concerns structural defects and extraframework
aggregates. All these aspects can be easily monitored by
dihydrogen adsorption at temperature comprised in the
7720 K to give OH  H2 (Brnsted sites) and Mn+  H2
(Lewis sites) adducts.
2.3.1
Silicalite and alkali-metal-exchanged zeolites. Fig. 3
compares H2 isotherms collected at 20 K, of H2 adsorbed
on silicalite, Na-ZSM-5 and Na-LTA zeolites. H2 adsorp-
tion on silicalite, (Fig. 3c) shows a complex set of narrow
bands (less than 5 cm1 at half maximum) growing in the
41504130 cm1 range that change in intensity ratio upon
increasing coverage, testifying the formation of organized
structures due to molecular hydrogen condensed inside the
cavities. These features, only observable in the case of spectra
collected at very low temperature, tend to disappear when
specific interactions occur and/or when the cavities become
larger (vide infra). In the case of Na+ exchanged zeolites, the
appearance of bands associated to dihydrogen perturbed by
Na+ cations is observed, as widely reported in previous
literature.31,36,38,62 The set of spectra reported in Fig. 3b in
the case of Na+ exchanged ZSM-5, characterized by a much
broader character, are dominated by a main band that appears
at 4100 cm1 and shifts to 4108 cm1 upon increasing coverage.
Note the absence of any fine structure of the spectra previously
observed in the case of pure silicalite (Fig. 3c). Moving to
Na-LTA (Fig. 3a), upon increasing PH2, a band which appeared
at 4075 cm1 shifts to 4091 cm1. The difference between the
data obtained in case of Na-ZSM-5 and Na-LTA should be
associated with the different topology of the framework and to
the fact that in the case of LTA, simultaneous interaction with
more than one site can occur. A large variety of spectroscopic
data, in combination with molecular modeling calculations
have been reported and deeply discussed also in terms of
interaction enthalpy, in some recent papers63,64 in the case of
H2 adsorption on alkaline cations exchanged zeolites. Inter-
action of CO and NO probes on alkalimetal exchanged
zeolites will be discussed in sections 3.2.1 and 4.2, respectively.
A particularly high loading of extraframework cations can
be reached in zeotype materials such as ETS-10, a silicon
titanate characterized by a crystalline structure formed by
orthogonal chains of corner-sharing TiO6 octahedra linked
by SiO4 tetrahedra giving rise to a regular three-dimensional
arrangement of 12- and 7-ring channels.6569 The presence of
TiOTi wires gives ETS-10 peculiar optical properties,7075
while the channel system is responsible for its behavior
as a molecular sieve. Every TiO6 unit introduces a 2e net
charge which is compensated in as-synthesized ETS-10 by

H2 adsorption at 20 K on a self-supporting thin wafer of
(Na,K)-ETS-10 sample (Engelhard Corp., Iselin, NJ, chemical
formula Na1.45K0.55TiSi5O13) pre-activated at 623 K for 1 h is
reported in Fig. 4a) shows the time evolution of the IR
spectrum of dihydrogen adsorbed at 20 K; Fig. 4b reports
the effect of progressive outgassing at 20 K.78 A preliminary study
performed at 77 K on Na-ETS-10.79 (spectra reported in the inset
of Fig. 4b), showed a simplified set of data: only a doublet
assigned respectively to the n(HH) mode of 1:1 Na+H2
adducts involving o-(4107 cm1) and p-H2 (4113 cm1) was
observed.
In the spectrum collected immediately after H2 dosage
(dashed line in Fig. 4a) three intense bands at 4111, 4120
(broad) and 4138 cm1 have been assigned to the HH
stretching vibration of hydrogen molecules adsorbed on the
extra-framework
cations
(band
at
4111
cm1),
on
the
channels wall (band 4120 cm1), and to molecules forming a
liquid-like phase entrapped inside the 12 membered ETS-10
channels (band at 4138 cm1) respectively. All these bands
gradually decrease in intensity with time with the parallel
formation of a new, upward shifted triplet at 4118, 4127 and
4146 cm1 (grey curves in Fig. 4a); this transformation is
nearly complete after 10 h of contact (black solid line in
Fig. 4a). The appearance of three isosbestic points at 4115,
4124 and 4140 cm1, leads to the conclusion that the dihydrogen
adducts responsible for the first triplet of bands are transformed
into those responsible for the second triplet following a 1 : 1
stoichiometry (see the arrows). As the bands correlated by
arrows in Fig. 4a are separated by 78 cm1, we conclude that
the evolution of the spectra is indicative of the ortho to para
conversion of the adsorbed dihydrogen species. Main features
coming from the set of spectra collected upon changing
dihydrogen equilibrium pressure (Fig. 4b) are the following:
(i) the spectrum at low H2 pressures consists of a doublet
of bands at 4113 and 4107 cm1. The 41134107 cm1
doublet is downward shifted of D
n(HH) = 48 cm1 with
respect to the 
n(HH) frequency of gas phase p-(4161 cm1)
and o-H2 (4155 cm1), in agreement with the experimental
observations35,36,38 and the theoretical predictions80 for the
side-on interaction of molecular hydrogen on Na+ sites in a
variety of microporous systems.
(ii) Upon further PH2 increase, the doublet reaches a
maximum in correspondence with the dashed bold curve and
then decreases in intensity (to total disappearance in the last
spectrum represented by the full bold line), while a new
absorption develops in a parallel way at 4118 cm1 indicating
that, at 20 K, the initially formed Na+  H2 complexes can
further add H2 to form Na+  (H2)2 moieties.
(iii) As soon as the band at 4118 cm1 due to the
Na+  (H2)2 reaches its maximum, further increase of PH2
leads to the appearance of a new absorption centered at
4128 cm1 (D
n(HH) D 30 cm1 with respect to gaseous H2).
Bands in similar positions have been observed for the H2
adsorption at 20 K on other microporous systems (vide supra)
and assigned to perturbation of the hydrogen molecules by

schemes corresponding in the central part of the Figure). The corresponding bands are evidenced by asterisks, orange, green and dark yellow
respectively. The inset of part (b) reports the IR spectrum collected on an almost homo-ionic Na-ETS-10 collected at liquid nitrogen temperature.

of M+  (H2)n adducts with n > 2 can be ruled out by the
observation that its growth is not correlated with a decrease in
the band of the M+  (H2)2 adducts at 4113 cm1 as well as
for steric hindrance reason.
(iv) Finally, the appearance of a component at 4137 cm1
that gradually shifts to 4140 and ends with a strong band at
4146 cm1, testifys the formation of a liquid-like phase filling
the ETS-10 channels. Main types of interaction are evidenced
by red arrows in part (b) of Fig. 4.
Molecular mechanics calculations on Na-ETS-10 structure
have been performed. All details are reported in ref. 78. The
results of energy optimizations at different coverages are
described in the central part of Fig. 4. The calculated
Na+  H2 complexes have a T-shaped geometry, as expected
from the H2 electrostatic potential and as verified in several
theoretical works.80,81 The most stable geometry of the adsorbed
molecules was that with all the H2 molecules disposed parallel
to the channel axis. In the 2 : 1 complex the H2 molecules are
arranged in such a way as to maximize the distance among
them, in agreement with previous literature results.64,82

Fe-zeolites. Dihydrogen appears as an ideal molecule
for the characterization of the Brnsted and Lewis acid
properties of a complex system like Fe-silicalite, which is still
extensively studied because of the unique properties as catalyst
for one-step oxidation of benzene to phenol.8385 The com-
plexity of this material derives from the fact that, while in the
as synthesized zeolite iron is present in framework tetrahedral
positions as Fe3+ (giving so rise to Brnsted acidity associated
to the presence of RSi(OH)FeR bridged sites);86 thermal
treatments, which are a prerequisite to induction of catalytic
activity, result in the breaking of the SiOFe framework
bonds and in migration and partial reduction of iron to give
a variety of extraframework Fe2+ and Fe3+ centres.8790
Among them, some Fe2+ sites are thought to be the precursors
of the species active in partial oxidation.91 The active sites are
formed by decomposition of the oxidizing agent (N2O) to give
highly reactive oxygen-containing moieties (the so called
a-oxygen).92 These aspects will be discussed in more detail in
section 4.6, where the probe molecule used to investigate the
catalyst surface will be NO.
The spectra obtained upon dosage of H2 (PH2 E 8 kPa) at
20 K on a sample at the three different stages of treatment are
compared in Fig. 5a): protonic (activated at 573 K in vacuum:
black curve) activated (treated in high vacuum at 973 K: blue
curve), oxidized (obtained by treating activated samples in
oxygen (13 kPa) at 773 K and outgassing at 573 K: red curve).
All the samples show mediumstrong absorptions in the
region 41704100 cm1 while, only on the systems activated
at temperatures sufficiently high (973 K), bands appear in
41003900 cm1 range, suggesting that the thermal treatment
causes iron migration from framework to extra-framework
positions (blue and red curves). The absence of similar
manifestation in the case of protonic sample, is in agreement
with the fact that tetrahedral Fe3+ in framework positions
does not have any adsorptive capability.86
The spectrum of H2 adsorbed on protonic Fe-Silicalite
shows an intense absorption due to the superposition of two
components, one located at 4137 cm1 and a shoulder at
41464140 cm1 assigned to dihydrogen adsorbed in the
internal voids of the zeolite and on the external RSiOH
groups respectively.93 A third band at 4112 cm1 is due to the
n(HH) mode of OH  H2 adducts formed on the structural
RFe(OH)SiR Brnsted acid sites (see also data concerning
H2 adsorption on [Fe]H-ZSM-594 and H-ZSM-532 acid zeolites)
and observe its reduction on the activated and oxidized
samples (only a tail, covering the 41304100 cm1 interval, is
visible). Activated Fe-Silicalite shows a very complex spectrum
characterized with at least 2 doublets: one in 41004000 cm1
(maxima at 4050 cm1 and at 4028 cm1) and a second one in
the 40003900 cm1 (couple of bands at 3990 and 3960 cm1)
ranges.93 Oxidized sample is characterized by the growth in
intensity of the second doublet at detriment of the first. This
behaviour suggests to rule out the occurrence of overlapping
forces, as observed in the case of homogeneous [Fe(Z2-H2)Ln]
complexes (where usually iron is present as Fe2+, and L
are cyclopentadienil ligands or chelating agents containing

nitrogen and/or phosphine groups)95,96 that are characterized
by 
n(HH) stretching vibration of the H2 ligand at about
3000 cm1, see ref. 97, and favors the view of an interaction
mainly involving electrostatic forces. Polarization of the H2
molecule by the electric field exerted by the Fen+ centres
makes it possible to assign the first doublet to Fe2+  H2
adducts while the second to Fe3+  H2 species. This assign-
ment is also confirmed by the set of spectra shown in parts (b)
and (c) of Fig. 5, that report spectra evolutions upon increasing
H2 coverage. The doublet at 3990 and 3960 cm1, more intense
in the oxidized sample, is clearly visible starting from very low
coverages and saturate very easily, then followed by the bands
at 4050 cm1 and at 4028 cm1 more visible on the activated
sample. The larger perturbation of the 
n(HH) mode for the
interaction of H2 by Fe3+ species with respect to (less polarizing)
Fe2+ is emerging from the D
n(HH) (172 and 202 cm1 for
Fe3+; 102 and 134 cm1 for Fe2+ sites). The existence in
Fe-Silicalite activated at high temperature of a variety of
extraframework Fe3+ and Fe2+ centres, in relative concentra-
tion depending on the iron content as well as on the activation
procedure,
has
been
already
hypothesized
and
demon-
strated in previous works based on a variety of experimental
techniques;87,98 among them we will cite here the results
obtained by the use of IR spectroscopic probes like NO and
CO, the former here reviewed in section 4.6. Note that H2,
being able to detect and differentiate the presence of two
families of Fe2+ and Fe3+respectively behaves like the NO
probe in the case of the ferric species and of CO in that of the
ferrous ones.87
Formation of the adducts discussed so far are governed by
weak polarization forces (which inter alia accounts for their
stability at low or very low temperature only); occurrence of
overlapping forces, which can operate in the case of transition
metal counterions, results in distinctly larger 
n(HH) shifts.
This is the case for the Cu+/H2 complexes already formed
at room temperature in copper exchanged ZSM-5,100 where

to
those operating in matrix-isolated [Cu(Z2-H2)Cl] molecular
adducts102 are responsible for D

Dihydrogen exploring metallo-organic frameworks: Effect
of framework topologies and cations
In relation to studies devoted to develop new materials for
molecular hydrogen storage, a wide variety of MOFs have
been tested towards dihydrogen interaction with both experi-
mental and theoretical approaches.103114 Some results are
encouraging, showing that some MOF materials (owing to
their extremely large surface area) are able to retain reversibly
significant H2 quantities (6.2 and 7.0 mass% for IRMOF-20
and MOF-177 respectively at 70 bar and 70 K, close to the
DOE targets). The largest drawback of MOFs for H2 storage
application is their weak binding strength to H2, which
necessitates a cryogenic working temperature. Extensive efforts
were made to synthesize and test, mainly through volumetric/
gravimetric measurements) new MOFs with enhanced H2
affinity, while only a few were based on spectroscopic data.
Most of the data were obtained at low temperature104,111,115
even though a very recent paper reports measurements
performed at room temperature and high pressure.116
As already mentioned in the case of studies performed on
alkaline metal substituted zeolites,100 also in the case of MOFs,
VTIR (Variable Temperature Infrared) spectroscopy was
able to give relevant data on interaction energies104,111,115,117
both enthalpy and entropy of H2 on MOFs based on the
accessibility and polarizing power of the exposed metal sites:
MOF-5 (inaccessible metal sites) and HKUST-1, CPO-27-Ni
(accessible metal sites).118 First of all it was noticed that the
first spectroscopic features associated with H2 adsorbed on the
MOF surface were observed at different temperatures: 180 K
for Ni-MOF, 110 K for HKUST and 105 K for MOF-5.
These temperatures correlate with the enthalpy of adsorption
obtained by means of the VTIR method on these materials
and with the shift experienced by the HH stretching
frequency after the adsorption. This relationship can be ascribed
to the different nature and accessibility of the metal sites.
In the case of MOF-5 very weak signals at 4121 and 4112 cm1
(grey curve in Fig. 6) are assigned to para- and ortho-H2
adsorbed on weak polarizing sites in proximity of Zn2+and/or
close to OH groups in local defect. (DHads = 7.4 kJ mol1)
Comparison with the H2 spectra on ZnO rules out any assign-
ment to H2 interacting directly with exposed Zn2+ (vide infra
section 2.5.2). Upon decreasing the temperature IR spectra
become dominated by a component at 4130 cm1 (black curve
in Fig. 6) that can be assigned to para-H2 in interaction with
the apolar walls of MOF-5 and satellite bands at 4146
and 4138 cm1, due to liquid-like H2 in the MOF-5 channels
(para-ad ortho-H2 respectively).104,119 In this regard it is
worth recalling that the group of Zerbi120 has performed a

Raman study on the interaction of MOF-5 with both
H2 and D2.
The IR spectrum obtained in the case of H2 adsorption at
low coverage in the case of HKUST-1 (cyan curve in Fig. 6) is
characterized by a doublet at 4097 and 4090 cm1 assigned
to
para-H2  Cu2+
and
ortho-H2  Cu2+
complexes.117
(DHads = 10.1 kJ mol1) Frequency shifts and interaction
enthalpy found in HKUST-1 suggest that Cu2+ ions are
partially shielded by the surrounding oxygen atoms of the
carboxylate units and behave like purely polarizing centers
where d-electrons do not effect the interaction with H2. Upon
decreasing the temperature to 20 K a new adsorption grows at
4084 cm1 with a shoulder at 4089 cm1 while the growth of
bands due to H2 (ortho and para) interacting with the organic
part of the framework (presumably the phenyl rings) is
occurring in the 41204150 cm1 range (main band centered
at 4136 cm1) (dashed dot blue curve). Sample equilibration at
20 K (30 min) at constant pressure (full line blue curve) causes
the selective decrease of the band at 4084 cm1, the parallel
growth of the component at 4089 cm1 (clear isosbestic point
at 4087 cm1), the disappearance of the band at 4133 cm1,
and the small increase of all the others components (4137, 4140,
and 4148 cm1). These time-dependent spectral changes are
associated with conversion of ortho-into the more stable
para-H2, implying that Cu2+ species in HKUST-1 acts as a
spin catalyst, similarly to other oxidic materials containing
paramagnetic impurities.44 Note that the time scale for the
extensive ortho/para-H2 conversion is much shorter than that
reported for pure H2
121 and for H2 in other microporous
materials78
at
comparable
temperatures.
Dihydrogen
is
strongly perturbed by CPO-27-Ni, as testified by the doublet
observed at 4035 and 4028 cm1 (D
n(HH) = 130 cm1
DHads = 13.7 kJ mol1)111 starting from 180 K (orange
curve in Fig. 6). The two bands can be assigned to two
spectroscopically non equivalent Ni2+  H2 complexes or to
the para and ortho-species respectively. Upon decreasing the
temperature till 20 K, the IR spectrum changes substantially
(red curve) taking into account also of the interactions with
the benzene rings (bands at 4128 and 4132 cm1) and to the
formation of a liquid-like H2 phase (band at 4147 cm1).
Unlike MOF-5 and HKUST-1, in Ni-CPO-27 the adsorption
is irreversible at 20 K. The need to increase the temperature to
be able to desorb H2 influences also the equilibrium between
ortho and para species, making difficult the final assignment.
All of these observations allow to identify in CPO-27-Ni the
material with the best performances, on the basis of purely
energetic evaluations.
Isostructural CPO-27 (M = Co, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) frame-
works have been studied by Zhou et al.122 in terms of strength
of dihydrogen binding. In this series the highest binding
affinity for Ni2+ sites was found (Zn2+ o Mn2+ o Mg2+ o
Co2+ o Ni2+). Fig. 7 report IR data obtained for H2 inter-
action with isostructural CPO-27-M (M = Mg, Co and Ni)
frameworks in grey, green and red respectively. For all the
investigated isostructural CPO-27-M, dihydrogen adsorption,
on lowering the temperature, follows essentially three steps:
(i)
formation
of
metal
hydrogen
complex
(M2+  H2),
(ii) adsorption on the benzene ring and (iii) condensation
inside the pore (liquid like H2). Points (ii) and (iii) develop
very similarly in the three samples, while point (i), related to
the role of the cations toward dihydrogen binding, specific
features are observed with respect to: 
n(HH) vibration shift,
onset temperature (Tonset) and enthalpy of complex formation.
In the case of CPO-27-Mg a doublet at 4092 and 4086 cm1
is observed at low coverage (starting from 130 K, light grey
curve). Spectra evolve upon cooling the sample at 20 K,
showing the growth of components 4126 and 4137 cm1, while
the component at 4086 cm1 decreases substantially in intensity
becoming a shoulder of the main component at 4092 cm1.
Upon decreasing the equilibrium pressure, the component at
4086 cm1 becomes visible again, even if it is always less
intense than the band at higher wavenumber,123 this implies
that an orthopara conversion has occurred. This observation
suggests that the doublet at 4035 and 4028 cm1, observed in
the case of CPO-27-Ni, can be explained in term of orthopara
dihydrogen components in analogy to what was found in the
case of CPO-27-Mg. The reason why in CPO-27Ni it is not
observed as an intensity ratio change within the doublet,
indicates that a total orthopara conversion has already
occurred extensively within the time scale of the experiment
(a few seconds).
This behaviour can be explained in terms of orthopara
dihydrogen conversion, catalyzed by this material. It is interesting
to compare the bathochromic frequency shift observed in this
material (approximately D
n(HH) = 73 cm1) with those
found in the case of H2 adsorbed on magnesium-exchanged
Y124 and X125 faujasite-type zeolites (bathochromic shift of
D
n(HH) = 107 and 98 cm1, respectively). Clearly the
magnitude of such a frequency shift depends not only on the
nature of the H2 adsorbing cation, but also on its coordination
sphere. Even less comparable are the values observed in the
case of high surface area MgO (hsa-MgO sample in section
2.5.1) where the strong ionicity of the solid combined with
the presence of highly defective sites is associated with a
much more complex chemistry. Finally, H2 adsorption at
low coverage on CPO-27-Co gives rise, starting from 150 K,

therms (at 77 and at 87 K) and inelastic neutron scattering.
For low coverage (0.1 H2 molecules per metal atom) they
found the isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) to be 10.9 kJ mol1
for the case of magnesium and 11.5 kJ mol1 for cobalt126 very
similar values to those obtained by VTIR method.115

Dihydrogen on reactive oxidic surfaces: MgO and ZnO
case studies
Activation of the hydrogen molecule on extended surfaces of
oxides is of great interest in catalysis10 e.g. hydrogenations,
dehydrogenations, and hydrogen transfer reactions are known
to occur on the surfaces of a-Cr2O3 and other oxides containing
transition metal ions with partially filled d-shells. Solids
incorporating metal ions in d10 or d0 electronic configuration
(such as ZnO, or MgO) are generally less active but never-
theless important, at least for fundamental investigations,
because of their ability to dissociate the hydrogen molecule.
Investigations of HH bond activation on oxide surfaces
are also important because of the analogies with CH bond
activation, which occurs in various industrial catalytic processes.
In this respect, it has been shown that the sites responsible for
H2 dissociation on MgO are also active for CH bond
cleavage.127
2.5.1
The MgO/H2 system. Dissociative adsorption of
dihydrogen on high surface area MgO (hsa-MgO) can be
homolytic or heterolytic,10 being the homolytic splitting
supposed to operate under UV-irradiation only.128130 Hetero-
lytic splitting takes place in the dark and on coordinatively
unsaturated (cus) Mg2+O2 surface pairs following the
schematic mechanism illustrated in Scheme 1: hsa-MgO was
obtained by careful decomposition of Mg(OH)2 at 523 K
in vacuo,14 resulting in about 230 m2 g1 and exhibits a
morphology constituted by small interpenetrated cublets as
schematically reported in Fig. 8a. Samples, pressed into pellets
suitable for transmission infrared measurements, were out-
gassed in high vacuo at 1073 K for 2 h. On hsa-MgO, in a wide
range of temperature (20300 K) and following different
experimental procedures, three families of hydrides and hydroxyl
groups are formed and developed differing for their vibra-
tional properties and their behavior upon PH2 changes.131 For
the sake of brevity we report here only the set of spectra
collected at 20 K, upon lowering the pressure and the spectra
will be described from low to high coverage.
At low H2 coverages (red curves), two couples of bands
develop in the region of hydroxyls and hydrides respectively.
The first family is characterized by two intense and narrow IR
peaks at 1325 and 3462 cm1 (see Fig. 8b), corresponding to
the n(MgH) and n(OH) modes, respectively. These species are
irreversible at 20 K. The fact that they are reversible at RT
upon reducing PH2, suggests that the two fragments are either
in adjacent positions or, if adsorbed at distant positions, able
to easily migrate on the surface to recombine and give back
molecular hydrogen.131134 Kno
 zinger et al. hypothesized that
the splitting process occurs on highly unsaturated surface
sites134 moreover they have molecular precursors, as demon-
strated by an experiment where H2 was dosed at 20 K and
spectra were collected for 1 h.131 A second family of species is
characterized by a n(MgH) mode at 1125 cm1 (broad band)
and by a n(OH) mode at 3712 cm1 (sharp band) and shows a
higher level of stability, even at room temperature. This
second family of sites has been assigned to the result of a
heterolytic splitting process occurring at inverse corner
sites.131,135 A couple of structures that can give rise to these
species is depicted in Fig. 8a.
Moving to higher coverages (black curves) an important
structured absorption in the 42004000 cm1 range is developing,
testifying the adsorption of molecular hydrogen. The three
complex components centered at about 41264122, 40994093
and 40814076 cm1 have been ascribed to Mg5c
2+  H2,
Mg4c
2+  H2 and Mg3c
2+  H2 molecular adducts, respec-
tively. The expected ortho-para splitting (of 6 cm1) is clearly
visible for the doublet at 40994093 cm1, while just results in
a band broadening for the remaining two. These values are
significantly downward shifted with respect to the n(HH)
mode of the unperturbed H2 molecule measured in the gas
phase by Raman spectroscopy: 
n(HH) = 4161 and 4155 cm1
for the ortho and para H2, respectively. The assignment of
Gribov et al.131 thus reflects the increased weakening of the
HH bond strength expected by moving from the adduct
formed on a five-coordinated, Mg5c
2+ magnesium cation
(regular (100) surface site), through the complex formed on
a four-coordinated Mg4c
2+ cation (step site), to the adduct
formed on a three coordinated Mg3c
2+ cation (corner site):
D
n(HH) B 38, 62 and 80 cm1, respectively. Interaction
of CO on hsa-MgO will be discussed in section 3.3.2.
The evaluation of the intensity of the site specific IR bands
upon lowering the surface coverage (y) by changing the
temperature (spectra in Fig. 9a) made it possible to identify
the adsorption enthalpy of the three families of sites, as reported
in Fig. 9b. In all cases the intensities of the IR bands, A(T),
increases gradually with decreasing T, reaching asymptotically
a maximum at different T, which correspond to the saturation
of Mg2+  H2 on each category of cationic sites present. The
saturation allow us to know quantitatively, at any T, the
fraction of sites covered by H2, defined as y(T) = A(T)/Amax,
and thus the fraction of empty sites [1  y(T)]. The equilibrium
constant (Kads) of the adsorption process for any given
temperature can be described, under the Langmuir approxi-
mation, as follow:2,14,15,17,100,131,136,137
Kads = y(T)/{[(1  y(T)] PH2}
(1)
Applying the Vant-Hoffequation, the angular dependence
of the Ln(Kads) versus 1/T gives the adsorption energy, see
Fig. 9b, showing the dependence of Ln(Kads), for each species,
plotted against 1/T. In the present cases, the H2 adsorption

enthalpies are 3.6 kJ mol1 on the penta-coordinated Mg2+
ions emerging on the (100) faces and terraces, 4.6 kJ mol1 on
tetra-coordinated cations placed on edges and steps, and
7.5 kJ mol on tri-coordinated cations located on the corners.
A good linear correlation is observed in all the three cases,
reflecting the validity of the adopted model.
2.5.2
The ZnO/H2 system. Strong polarization forces
induced by acidbase couples (in this case O2 and Mg2+),
are not the only way able to break heterolitically hydrogen
molecules; among oxides a much more intriguing system,
was found in the case of ZnO Kadox material.138 Sample
pre-treatment requires activation at 773 K for 1 h under a
dynamic vacuum, followed by oxygen dosage at high tempera-
ture, in order to compensate oxygen lost during thermal
activation. Then the sample is cooled to room temperature
and oxygen outgassed to a final pressure of 104 mbar.
Electron micrographs have shown that ZnO crystallites were
prevalently hexagonal single crystals, elongated along the
c-axis with typical dimensions of 3060 nm wide and
150300 nm long (consistent with the measured surface area
of 10 m2 g1). An example is shown in Fig. 10, that reports an
HRTEM image of a ZnO microcrystal showing interferences
fringes for (10
10) planes. Non-polar (10 
10) prismatic faces,
together with (11 
20), represent about 80% of the exposed
surfaces, while the remaining 20% is constituted mainly by
polar surfaces (0001) and (000 
1) that strongly reconstruct
giving rise to kinks and steps, clearly visible in Fig. 10a (arrows
evidence rounded crystal ends). Termination of (10 
10) plane
show Zn2+ and O2 ions arranged in pairs, having a coordinative
unsaturation available, as shown in the structures reported in
Fig. 10b. This specific structural arrangement has been con-
sidered as the basis of the peculiar reactivity of this material
towards molecular hydrogen at room temperature.139143
Fig. 10c and d reports IR spectra obtained upon progressive
dihydrogen dosages: two IR adsorption bands at 3492 and at
1710 cm1, assigned to the fundamental stretching vibration of
hydroxyl n(OH) and hydride n(ZnH) surface modes testify a
dissociative chemisorption of the dihydrogen molecule on
adjacent Zn2+O2 ion pairs, which act as a Lewis acidbase
couple (see pictorial view in Fig. 10b).144,145 As the interaction
is completely reversible at room temperature, large efforts
have been devoted to obtain ZnO materials with high surface
area, in order to exploit this behaviour in the field of materials
for hydrogen storage. Unfortunately, only in the case of
samples with this specific morphology, this unusual property
has been observed. Once hydroxyls and hydrides are formed
(probably on (10 
10) faces), upon increasing PH2 and lowering
the temperature down to 20 K, the coordination of molecular
hydrogen occurs, as testified by the development of complex
spectra in the 41604000 cm1 range, see Fig. 10e. Starting

4018 and 4025 cm1 appears, that has been ascribed to molecular
hydrogen adsorbed on Zn2+ sites that shows a coordinative
vacancy. By lowering the temperature in the range 15053 K, a
new band at 4040 cm1 grows, due to the formation of weekly
bonded adducts with Zn-OH species. At very low temperature,
reaching a maximum at 20 K, a complex absorption centered at
4130 cm1 indicates the formation of a condensed liquid phase
of hydrogen. In the mean time all the bands at lower frequencies
(40404018 cm1) undergo a red shift of about 10 cm1, testifying
the effect of the formation of H2 ad-layers.

Dihydrogen spill over in Pd-containing Y-zeolite
The three-dimensional framework of zeolite-Y is generated by
connecting sodalite units (or b-cages, delimited by six-membered
ring windows, as evidenced in Fig. 11a) through hexagonal
prisms to give a structure characterized by the presence
of large cavities with diameter of about 13 A
 (super-cages or
a-cages).146 In the case of protonic Y zeolite, Al(OH)Si
bridged
sites
can
be
distributed
among
four
different
locations147 protruding in the super cages (sites 1 and 4), or
inside more restricted spaces, like the sodalite-cage (site 2) or
the hexagonal prisms (site 3), see left part of Fig. 11a. According
to neutron diffraction148 only sites 1 and 3 are significantly
populated in Y zeolites and responsible for two characteristic
n(OH) absorptions at 3623 cm1 (site 1) and 3550 cm1
(site 3),33,149 commonly named high frequency (HF) and low
frequency (LF) band in the specialized literature.149 Hydroxiles
associated to the LF band are generally unperturbed by probe
molecules as the small aperture of sodalite cage, preclude
the entrance of the probes, even as small as dihydrogen. The
adsorption of increasing doses of H2 initially causes the
progressive erosion of the HF component and the parallel
growth of a new, slightly broader n(OH) band downward shifted
of 48 cm1 (new absorption at 3603 cm1 and isosbestic point
at 3630 cm1, testifying the formation 1 : 1 OH H2 adducts
involving the Brnsted groups located in site 1 of the super-cages
(Fig. 11b). No substantial changes are observed in the case of the
LF component suggesting that the H2 molecule cannot freely
penetrate the six-membered openings regulating the access to the
sodalite-cage. Calculation of the potential barrier performed
with accurate ab initio methods evidenced that the energy
needed for a ring penetration is high: around 26 kJ mol1,
independently from the molecule orientation.150

to gaseous H2. The component at 4115 cm1 was attributed to
the n(HH) mode of H2 molecules involved in the 1 : 1
OH  H2 complexes formed at site 1;150 the 4125 cm1
component was assigned to the formation of Na+  H2
adducts,31 while the band at 4137 cm1 was attributed to H2
molecules unspecifically adsorbed and more weakly perturbed
by interaction with the zeolite walls (vide supra).
Scarano et al.150 included Pd nanoclusters inside the Y
framework (hereafter sample Pd0Y) through ion exchange
with aqueous solution of [Pd(NH3)4](NO3) of a commercial
NH4NaY zeolite, followed by calcination in vacuum at
T = 473 K, oxidation with oxygen (P = 50 mbar) at 673 K;
outgassing at 673 K; reduction with H2 at 573 K and further
outgassing at the same temperature. Before performing the
reduction step, Scarano et al.150 verified the effective success of
the NH4
+/Pd2+ cationic exchange monitoring by IR the
important decrease of the n(OH) modes, particularly the HF
ones (blue dotted spectrum in Fig. 11b). A combined EXAFS
and TEM (Fig. 11c) study on Pd0Y sample shows a large
predominance of large particles with diameter in the 50100 A
interval, clearly located outside the zeolite pores.
Pd0Y shows Brnsted acidic sites largely restored, especially
those located towards the supercage; compare blue dotted
spectrum in Fig. 11b with the red curve in the left side of
Fig. 11d. So Pd0Y is actually a protonic zeolite.150152 In Pd0Y
the appearance of HF and LF bands are evident even if LF peak
is only (1/10)th of the original indicating that the reduction
process is more favored in the large super-cages than in the small
sodalite and prismatic units. To verify the possibility that atomic
hydrogen produced by splitting of the H2 molecule on the Pd
metal particles or clusters can diffuse following spill-over effects
inside the internal voids of the faujasite structure, IR spectro-
scopy has been used for possible evidence of H/D exchange
reactions involving the Brnsted sites of the Pd0Y zeolite. To
this scope, a sample reduced at 573 K was contacted with D2 at
300 K and spectra recorded as function of the contact time
(spectra in Fig. 11d) and its inset. It is possible to see that the
spectrum immediately after D2 dosage (red curve) still exhibits
the HF and LF absorptions, due to the n(OH) modes of protons
in sites 1 and 3, with nearly unchanged intensity. After a short
contact time (60 s) at 300 K the intensity of HF signal at
3645 cm1 is reduced of about 90% (blue curve) and that of
the LF component at 3558 cm1 of about 50%. At the same
time, two bands develop at 2688 and 2623 cm1 undoubtedly
associated with n(OD) vibrations [
n(OH)/
n(OD) 1.32 and 1.36,
respectively]. After 120 s, the LF component is nearly completely

disappeared and the corresponding n(OD) band increased in
intensity, while the residual HF band is hardly affected. The
inset of Fig. 11d reports the growth of a component that can be
associated to the bending mode of OD groups. All these
manifestations (not occurring on Pd-free HY zeolites) are easily
explained on the basis of an isotopic H/D exchange of the
Si(OH)Al-acid groups, made possible by the spill-over ability
of Pd metal.150,151,153 The reaction involves the Brnsted sites
located inside the super-cages but also those pointing inside the
hexagonal prisms: this is the clear demonstration that, unlike
the molecule, atomic hydrogen can penetrate the hexagonal
openings of the zeolite framework and diffuse into the sodalite-
cages, as predicted by the ab initio calculations.150
It is also a matter of fact that the OH species in the super-
cages are exchanged more rapidly and more efficiently by
deuterium than those located in the sodalite-cages. This
phenomenon can be explained on the basis of the potential
barrier that atomic hydrogen (deuterium) has to overcome in
order to access the cage. Scarano et al. noticed that for
Pd2+Y samples reduced at 573 K the reaction exchange is
very fast (being complete after only 120 s)150 as compared with
other literature values: Sachtler and coworkers151 have for
instance reported that on a Pd2+Y sample reduced at 673 K
where the OH/OD exchange is not complete even after about
4 h of contact.

Relationship between D
n(HH) and D
n(CO) shifts for H2
and CO adsorption on the same sites
Dihydrogen has been also extensively used for the charac-
terization of Brnsted acidity of zeolites. Also in this case the
interaction is mainly electrostatic in nature and shows typical
D
n(HH) values for the OH  H2 interaction in the range
E70 (strongly acid RSi(OH)AlR groups in H-SSZ-13
zeolite) C E30 cm1 (weakly acid RSiOH species),154
while for H2 adsorption on extra framework Lewis sites the
shifts lie in the B160 cm1 (extraframework Al3+) B 60 cm1
(alkaline cations) range.31,32 In this regard a large work has
been done by Larin et al.40,41,155,156 to provide theoretical
models able to understand the D
n(HH) values for the
M+  H2 adducts formed inside zeolitic frameworks.
For electrostatic-type interactions, when comparison is
made with the spectroscopic data concerning adsorption
on the same sites of the much more popular CO probe
(vide infra section 3), it is found that the shifts of the 
n(CO)
and 
n(HH) frequencies are linearly correlated and that
and D
n(HH) E 2D
n(CO). This is due to the fact that the
n(HH) of the single HH bond is more sensitive than the
n(CO) of the triple CRO bond to local effects (like struc-
ture, number of ligands in the coordination sphere, etc.)
possibly influencing the physicochemical properties of the
adsorbing centres32 (vide infra). The data reported in Fig. 12
clearly show that the relationship is verified for a number
of systems including SiO2, acidic and exchanged zeolites,
oxides, etc. It is, on the contrary, noteworthy the relevant
scatter of the points corresponding to Cr2+ species grafted

Classical and non-classical metal carbonyls, a brief
overview
The literature on metal carbonyls is enormous and several
reviews have already been devoted to this subject.5,10,158165
The way CO interacts with metal cations may involve different
contributions, according to the nature of the metal-cations sites.
(a) The electric field created by a positive charge (like for instance
an alkaline metal cation) causes a polarization of the CO
molecule which depends on the local electric field of the site,
i.e. on the charge density of the cation mainly, modulated by the
neighbor anions.166172 The spectroscopic evidence of the polari-
zation of the CO molecule is an upwards shift (blue-shift) of the
stretching frequency of the CO bond with respect to the 
n(CO)
of the gas (2143 cm1),173 owing to the increase of the force
constant of the CO bond, and the decrease of the bond
length.159162,167169 (b) In the presence of an acceptor of electron
pairs, such as a metal cation possessing empty orbitals of suitable
energy (and thus acting as Lewis acidic center) the C-end lone
pair of CO is transferred to the metal cation giving rise to a
s-coordination (Mn+  CO). In this case too, the interaction
between CO and the metal cation causes the 
n(CO) stretching
frequency to shift towards a value higher than that of the gas. It
is generally accepted that the higher the blue-shift, the stronger
the interaction, according to the Lewis acidic strength of
the metal site.5,159163,167172,174 (c) In the case of transition
metal cations possessing partially filled d orbitals, a significant
Mn+ - CO p-donation can occur from the orbitals of the
d-block metal back to the orbitals of the CO molecule. The
increase of the electronic density in the anti-bonding orbitals of

the CO molecule causes the force constant of the CO bond to
decrease, the CO bond length to increase and thus the 
n(CO) to
be red-shifted with respect that of the gas. The strength of the
bond between CO and the d-block metal cations, and the 
nCO
stretching frequency, are not expected in such a case to be
simply correlated. In fact, as far as the strength of the carbonyl
bond increases, as a consequence of the synergistic effect of
the s-(Mn+  CO) and p-(Mn+ - CO) components, the
resulting 
nCO is located in a spectral position which is a com-
promise of a blue- and a red-shifts,159163,174180
In the case of a simple polarization due to the electric field
generated by a coordinatively unsaturated cation (as described
in point i), as well as in the case of either non d or d0 metal
cations involving a plain s-coordination (as described in point
ii), a correlation does exist between the blue-shift of the
stretching frequency (D
nCO) and the adsorption enthalpy
DadsH, vide infra Fig. 16c. A wide literature concerning a
number of coordinatively unsaturated metal cations either
exposed at the surface of oxides, or dispersed as charge-
balancing cations in zeolites confirms this relationship.10,174,181
It is worth noting that the bonding features of such metal
carbonyl species formed in heterogeneous conditions match
with the definition of non classical metal carbonyls, reported
in ref. 159163 and 174 for complexes formed in homogeneous
conditions. Indeed, for the species categorized as non classical
metal carbonyls the basic classical metal carbonyls state-
ment 
n(CO) must be lower than 2143 cm1 does not apply.
Summarizing, for CO ligands bound to d-metal cations,
the experimentally observed 
n(CO) gives an indication of the
relative contribution of the different components. In the
classical metal carbonyls the effect described in (iii) prevails,
whereas in the non classical carbonyls the effects described
in (i) and (ii) are predominant.

CO on alkalimetal exchanged zeolites: Pure electro-
static interaction. The close shell configuration of all alkali
metal cations M+ makes them ideal probing sites for a pure
electrostatic interaction. In such a case, the perturbation of the
CO stretching frequency is proportional to the local electric
field strength (E) according to the Stark effect:169

where e0 is the vacuum permittivity, qsite is the formal M+ site
charge (usually lower than e), Ez is the contribution of the
anionic environment and where dMCO is the distance between the
cation nucleus and the CO baricenter (dMCO = RM + RCO, being
RM the cationic radius and RCO the CO semi-axis along the CO
direction). This linear correlation between D
n(CO) and d2
MCO is
clearly appreciable from the data reported in Fig. 14. Alkali-metal

neighbor anions, see eqn (1) in section 2.2.1).169 An increase of the
d/d+ charge separation between carbon and oxygen atoms, propor-
tional to E, occurs that results in a reduction of the CO equilibrium
distance, a strengthen of the CO bond and a consequent increase of the
nCO. See Fig. 25b for the analogous spectra of NO dosed on alkali
metal exchanged-ferrierite. Part (b): when M posses empty orbitals of

halides182 could not be directly used to establish a simple
cationmolecule interaction, because on the large [001] faces
adsorbing cationic sites are not isolated, resulting in a relevant
Madelung effect and important static and dynamic shifts are
observed,10 vide infra section 3.31. The existence of a simple
electrostatic interaction was observed already in the late
seventies by Hauge et al.,183 who monitored the 
n(CO) of
carbon monoxide in interaction with different alkalimetal
fluoride molecules isolated in cryogenic argon matrices. They
found that the positive D
n(CO) was roughly increasing upon
decreasing the cationic radius (RM), a clear evidence that the
M+  CO interaction is of pure electrostatic origin.
Also
alkalimetal
cations
hosted
as
extraframework
charge balancing inside zeolitic channels or cavities act
as isolated sites able to coordinate CO molecules at low
temperature.146,166168,184,185 In such cases a direct D
nCO p
1/d2
MCO relationship was observed. The model reported in
eqn (2) was derived by Lamberti et al.,169 who used the
experimental D
n(CO) values measured by FTIR on Na+-,
K+-, Rb+- and Cs+-exchanged ZSM-5 and MOR zeolites to
determine, the local positive electric field strength at the cation
site E (26 V nm1), the effective charge on the cationic site
(0.650.75 e) and the negative contribution from the negatively
charged zeolitic framework Ez (4.2 and 4.7 V nm1
ZSM-5 and MOR, respectively). The data reported in Fig. 14
also contains the data collected on Li-ZSM-5 and Li-MOR,
where the local electric field is as high as 8.2 V nm1. Please
note the remarkable values of the local electric field probed
by CO, as 1 V nm1 = 109 V m1. The simple electrostatic
model here summarized169 has successively been significantly
improved by the more sophisticated ab initio approach, on
naked cations170 and on fragments mimicking the zeolite
sites,171 by Ferrari et al. These two successive studies confirmed
the electrostatic nature of the interaction. In this regard, also
the theoretical works of Larin et al.184,185 are worth mentioning.
A better insight on the IR spectra reported in Fig. 13a
allows to realize that a minor band is present below 
n0(CO).
As was the case for the main band, also this low-frequency
band is cationic-specific, as it has been found to appear at
2108, 2113, 2117, 2119, and 2122 cm1 for Li+-Na+-, K+-,
Rb+-, and Cs+-ZSM-5, respectively.167 A temperature depen-
dent IR experiment, allowed Otero Arean et al.187 to prove
that CO interacts with exchangeable cations M+ of zeolites to
form both M+  CO and M+  OC adducts, responsible of
the main (blue shifted) and minor (red-shifted) IR bands,
respectively.
3.2.2
CO on Cu+-exchanged zeolites: The ability of IR to
discriminate among different adsorbing sites and to highlight
effects of adsorption-induced cation displacement. Copper-
exchanged molecular sieves have been widely investigated
after
the
discovery
that
Cu-ZSM-5
are
active
in
the
direct decomposition of nitric oxide to nitrogen and oxygen
molecules.188194 Due to their superior catalytic activity, most
of the data reported refer to more than 100% copper-exchanged
samples195 prepared via a conventional ion exchange with
aqueous solutions of cupric ions, which contain mixtures of
copper ions in different aggregation and oxidation states.178,196204
The heterogeneity of copper species in catalysts prepared
following this way is evident, and implies that a structural
model for Cu cations cannot be confidently assessed. This
makes the elucidation of structural and catalytic properties of
isolated and clustered species a difficult subject.
Since the early nineties the Turin group has developed
an ongoing research100,174,205216 in the characterization of
Cu+-ZSM-5 samples prepared following an original exchange
path, based on the reaction at 573 K between the zeolite (in the
protonic form) and gaseous CuCl following eqn (3):
Si(OH+)Al
(surf) + CuCl(g) - Si(OCu+)Al
(surf) + HCl(g)
(3)
It has been proven that the so obtained material can be
considered as a model solid, containing only well defined
isolated copper species in a single, well defined, oxidation
state. Cu+-ZSM-5 samples prepared following our method
has been of greatest help in understanding the local structure
of Cu+ ions in zeolites that certainly affects their catalytic
behavior. In fact, because of its model character, the system
offers clear and simple spectroscopic, energetic and structural
outputs which assignment is straightforward. This is the
reason why the experimental results emerging from its charac-
terization have been also used as model values for comparison
of the computational outputs obtained in advanced quantum
chemical studies.101,176,177,217222 It is finally worth recalling
that this exchange method, having the advantage of directly
introducing only Cu+ cations, was first applied to ZSM-5
matrix but was subsequently extended to faujasite,213,223,224
mordenite,224226 b224,226 and ferrierite227 molecular sieves.
The high coordinative unsaturation of the Cu+ cations hosted
in zeolites is further demonstrated by their ability to form,
depending on CO equilibrium pressure (PCO) and temperature,
carbonyl complexes of high structural and spectroscopic quality.
At room temperature relatively stable adducts such as the
mono-[Cu(CO)]+ and dicarbonyl [Cu(CO)2]+ complexes are
observed,174,175,206,208,210212,226,228 (see Fig. 15a and b) which
evolve to tricarbonyl [Cu(CO)3]+ species when the system is
cooled down to liquid nitrogen temperature,206,208,210,211 see

dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) described here-
after in section 3.2.4. The formation of nitrosyl adducts on the
same Cu+ sites will be discussed in section 4.4.
When comparison is made with the homogeneous cupric
polycarbonyls, it is worth mentioning that binary compounds
of the type [CuI(CO)n]+ A have been observed in strong
acidic media, such as H2SO4, CF3SO3H, FSO3H, BF3H2O
and HF.159 The isolation of such complexes as solids is
however very difficult and only in 1996 did Rack et al. report
the formation and the structural and spectroscopic characteri-
zation of [CuI(CO)n]+[AsF6] (n = 1, 2, 3) compounds.229,230
IR spectroscopy of CO dosed at increasing PCO on
Cu+-zeolites is reported in Fig. 15a, b and c for ZSM-5, b,
Y and mordenite hosting frameworks. For a description of the
framework structures and for a scheme on the evolution of the
n(CO) modes vs. PCO, please see Fig. 15d and e for Cu+-ZSM-5
and Cu+-Y, respectively. A larger portion of the Y framework
is reported in Fig. 11a. At low PCO (Fig. 15a), a single band

is observed for the monocarbonylic complex in ZSM-5,
b and mordenite zeolites. Conversely in Y zeolite two
different Cu+  CO adducts are observed characterized by
n(CO) = 2160 and 2144 cm1, which are formed on two
different cationic sites, labeled as II and II* respectively
(see Fig. 15e).213 This IR evidence is supported by Rietveld
refinement of XRPD data collected at the ESRF synchrotron,
where two different cationic sites have been determined in the
supercage.213 By increasing PCO (Fig. 15b), the formation of
Cu+  (CO)2 adducts is observed for all samples, as proved by
the splitting of the monocarbonyl band into two bands due to
the nas(CO)2 and ns(CO)2 modes of the complex.206,208,213 The
fact that both bands are IR active indicates that the intra-
zeolitic Cu+  (CO)2 adducts have C2v symmetry (or lower),
while the homogeneous counterparts are linear (DNh).229 A
further increase of PCO (Fig. 15c) causes for ZSM-5, b and Y
zeolites a nearly total Cu+  (CO)2 - Cu+  (CO)3 transfor-
mation as indicated by the appearance of a new triplet of IR
active bands. This means that we are dealing with a complex
of symmetry rather lower than C3v, unlike homogeneous coun-
terparts which form planar adducts of D3h symmetry.229
As far as mordenite is concerned, the presence of cations in
the less accessible side pocket sites implies the co-presence of
mono-, di- and tri-carbonyl adducts even at the higher PCO,225
resulting in a broader and rather unresolved IR spectrum
(black curve in Fig. 15c). For the Y zeolite, it is worth noticing
that, in spite of the presence of two cationic sites in the
supercage, the IR spectrum obtained at high PCO indicates
the presence of one only family of Cu+  (CO)3 adducts. This
relevant fact is explained in terms of the high solvatation
power of the CO molecules, which are able to extract the
Cu+ cations in the more shielded position (site II*) as proved
by both EXAFS and XRPD,213 see Fig. 15e. The set of
spectra collected on Cu+Y represents a clear example of
adsorption-induced effects cation displacement. A similar
solvatation effect has been observed for Cu+-ZSM-5,208,210

the formation of well defined, Cu+  (CO)n (n = 1, 2, 3)

how IR spectroscopy of adsorbed probe molecules is able to

ZSM-5: Discrimination between polarization, r-donation and
p-back donation effects. The fact that Cu+ and Ag+ (two 11 (IB)
of transition ions with analogous valence shell electronic
configuration: 3d10 and 4d10, respectively) have the same
charge and a very similar cationic radius then alkaline Na+
and K+ cations,234 R(Cu+) = 0.96 A
 vs. R(Na+) = 0.97 A
and R(Ag+) = 1.26 A
 vs. R(K+) = 1.33 A
 , implies that the
local electric field experienced by CO adsorbed on such couple
of cations hosted in the same site, should be almost the same
and so does electrostatic interaction of metal carbonyl inter-
action (section 3.2.1). This has been the driven idea of Kuroda
et al.180 and of Bolis et al.174 who reported a combined IR and
micro-calorimetric,
investigation
on
the
Cu+  (CO),
Na+  (CO), Ag+  (CO) and K+  (CO) carbonyls formed
at RT inside ZSM-5 zeolite. EXAFS was used to verify that
Cu+ and Ag+ occupies the same cationic sites in ZSM-5.
Using this strategy Bolis et al.174 were able to disentangle the
electrostatic interaction to s-donation and p-back donation
interactions in both Cu+  (CO) and Ag+  (CO) adducts
formed inside ZSM-5 zeolite. Of course we are dealing with
simple conclusions that can be extracted from well conceived
experiments. To assess a precise description of s-donation and
p-back donation contributions for a given metalcarbonyl
complex,
appropriate
ab

calculations
should
be
performed.176,177,218222
The room temperature PCO-dependent IR spectra of CO
adsorbed on Cu+-ZSM-5 (top magenta/red curves) and
Ag+-ZSM-5 (top blue curves) are reported in parts (a) and
(b) of Fig. 16, respectively. For comparison also the highest
coverage spectra obtained dosing CO on Na+- and K+-ZSM-5
are reported in the bottom parts as orange and cyan curves. As
already discussed above (section 3.2.2) the [Cu(CO)]+ mono-
carbonyl observed at low PCO (magenta spectrum, band at
2157 cm1), progressively evolves into [Cu(CO)2]+ (red curves,
bands at 2178 cm1 and 2151 cm1) upon increasing PCO. Only
monocarbonyl species are formed on Ag+-ZSM-5 at 300 K
(top blue curves in Fig. 16b: band at 2192 cm1).174,180,235,236 A
less spectacular [Ag(CO)]+ - [Ag(CO)2]+ is observed at 77 K,
owing to the small shift between the symmetric asymmetric
stretching modes of the dinitrosyl: 2190 and 2184 cm1.235,236
In this regard, please note that the interpretation of similar
high coverage IR spectra in terms of a Cu+  (CO)2 complex
on a single Cu+ site has been questioned in the literature,
where the bands around 2178 cm1 and 2151 cm1 were
ascribed to two monocarbonyls formed on two different
Cu+ sites in ZSM-5.180,202,237 Proof that the PCO-dependent
spectra evolution reported in Fig. 15a is actually due to a
Cu+  (CO) - Cu+  (CO)2 transformation has been proved
by two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) by
Bolis et al.174 and will here be described in section 3.2.4.
Besides the overall similarity of the two systems, remarkable
differences in both the spectroscopic and thermodynamic
features have been observed. The spectral position of the
CO stretching band of the monocarbonyl complex is blue-
shifted with respect to the gas of a greater extent in the case
of Ag+, D
n(CO) = +49 cm1, than in the case of Cu+,
D
n(CO) = +14 cm1, see Table 1, opposite to what expected
on the basis of either the sole electrostatic field or the com-
bination of the electrostatic plus the s-coordination effects,
larger in the case of Cu+ species. Indeed, notwithstanding
the lower D
n(CO), the zero-coverage enthalpy of adsorp-
tion,
DadsH,
for
[Cu(CO)]+
is
greater
than
that
of
[Ag(CO)]+: B120 vs. B100 kJ mol1. These facts implies a
much larger p-back bonding interaction for [Cu(CO)]+ compared
to [Ag(CO)]+.174,180 As anticipated already, quoted authors174,180
evaluated the electrostatic contribution in the case for
[Cu(CO)]+ and [Ag(CO)]+ complexes investigating the inter-
action of CO with alkaline iso-radial cations (Na+ and K+
respectively) hosted in the same microporous MFI system
was investigated. The pure electrostatic interaction between
CO and Na+ or K+ cations resulted in DadsH B35 and
B28 kJ mol1, respectively.
In Fig. 16c the shift of the CO stretching frequency, D
n(CO), is
reported as a function of the enthalpy of adsorption DadsH for
a large set of systems investigated in ref. 174 (full symbols) and in
the remaining literature (open symbols),180,202,237242,244247,243

in comparable conditions in different laboratories. The reported
data can be divided into three subgroups: (i) non-d/d0/d10
metal carbonyls (black circles); (ii) copper metal carbonyls
(red squares); (iii) silver carbonyls (blue diamonds).
As far as non-d/d0/d10 metal carbonyls are concerned, a
linear correlation between the spectroscopic and thermo-
dynamic quantities is evident, resulting in:
D
nCO = [(1.03  0.05) cm1 mol (kJ)1] DadsH
+ (4  3) cm1 ,
(4)
with linear correlation parameter of R = 0.981.174 For non-d/d0
metal cations any contribution of p-back-donation is prevented,
while this does not necessarily hold for d10 metals. Among the
reported data, Zn2+ is the only example of d10 metal cation
and behaves as non-d cases both when hosted in Y-zeolite
cages or exposed at the surface of ZnO. Being the linearity
observed in Fig. 16c based on a statistically significant number
of pairs of experimental data, eqn (4) can be considered
as an empirical rule of general validity for all non-d/d0 metal
carbonyl complexes, allowing to infer calorimetric values from
spectroscopic experiments and vice versa. The observed linear-
ity implies that, when the polarization of the CO molecule
and/or the s-coordinative capacity of the cation increases
(as witnessed by the increasing D
n(CO),248 also the strength
of the interaction increases (as testified by the increase of
DadsH). Thus either D
n(CO) or DadsH measurements can be
used to evaluate the Lewis acidic strength of coordinatively
unsaturated non-d/d0 cationic sites.
As far as the second and third sub-groups are concerned,
spectroscopic and calorimetric data obtained on copper
(red squares) and silver (blue diamonds) carbonyls lie in a
completely different region of the DadsH/D
n(CO) plane
(Fig. 16c) and they do not correlate with the empirical rule
reported in eqn (4). The interaction between the CO ligands
and the metal transition cations is indeed much more complex
than the one involving non-d/d0/d10 metal cations, in that
a p-back donation is, at least partially, always operative.
The p-back donation contribution is however larger for
copper than for silver, as indicated by the larger deviation
from the empirical line (4) of the former values. In order to
attempt to single out the different p- and s-contributions it is

useful to analyze in details the different pairs of values reported
in Table 1. The pair of values (DadsH = 120 kJ mol1 and
D
nCO = 17 cm1) obtained for the Cu+-ZSM-5 model
system174 well agrees with the values reported by Kuroda
et al.180 on Cu+/SiO2Al2O3.
In Fig. 16c, the (D
n(CO), DadsH) pairs characterized by
negative D
n(CO) values, refer to partially reduced copper
species. It has been reported that in the case of CO adsorbed
on [Cu(NH3)n]+ sites entrapped in the zeolite pores the CO
frequency does suffer a red shift.210 Correspondingly, a lower
enthalpy of adsorption (DadsH = 80 kJ mol1) with respect
to the bare Cu+ sites was measured, indicating a weakening of
the interaction. Indeed, the actual charge density of the copper
cations is lower in the presence of charge-releasing NH3
ligands, as probed by independent XANES spectra.174 For
this
reason,
the
copper
cations
in
the
intra-zeolitic
[Cu(NH3)n]+ complexes are have been defined as partially
reduced.174 In order to confirm this suggestion, spectroscopic
and thermodynamic data on the interaction of CO with
partially reduced copper species grafted on a non porous
ZnO matrix247 are reported in the diagram shown in
Fig. 16c (open squares). A linear correlation, which slope is
close to that of eqn (4) line, is empirically observed, in the
40120 kJ mol1 DadsH range, for the reported copper
carbonyls:
D
nCO = [(1.21  0.07) cm1 mol (kJ)1] DadsH
+ (127  6) cm1
(5)
with
R
=
0.993.
The
positive
value
of
the
slope
[(1.21  0.07) cm1 mol (kJ)1] of the linear correlation
is surprising. Indeed, as far as classical carbonyls are
concerned,159,161163 an increase of the p-back donation is
accompanied by a decrease of the IR-spectroscopic shift and
by a parallel enhancement of the M+C bond strength: this
should imply a negative slope in the DadsH/D
n(CO) plane,
that does not match with the data reported in Fig. 16c. Bolis
et al.174 explained this unexpected behaviour as following. The
linear
decrease
of
D
nCO)
observed
by
moving
from
[Cu(CO)]+ through [Cu(NH3)nCO]+ and Cu+/ZnO down to
Cu0/ZnO is not due to a progressive increase of the p-back
donation component of the CuCO bond, but to a progressive
decrease of the net charge on the Cu(I) cations. This brings
about
to
a
progressive
extinguishment
of
the
electro-
static component. This hypothesis explains why D
n(CO)
and DadsH correlate positively and why the slope obtained
in eqn (5) is similar to that obtained for non-d/d0 system.
The decrease of the net charge on the cation in the
[Cu(NH3)nCO]+ system, with respect to the pure carbonyl
adduct is justified by the charge-releasing role played by ammonia
ligands, whereas the effect observed on the Cu(I)/ZnO and
Cu(0)/ZnO systems has been caused by progressive reducing
treatments in H2.247
As for silver carbonyls formed in ZSM-5 or SiO2Al2O3
matrices. (blue diamonds in Fig. 16c), the result reported by
Bolis et al.174 perfectly match those reported by Kuroda
et
al.180
Due
to
the
limited
number
of
calorimetric
and spectroscopic pairs available for Ag carbonyls, it has
not been possible to draw a correlation relationship between
D
nCO and DadsH values based on a solid statistical ground,
as was done in the case of both Cu and non-d/d0/d10
metal carbonyls (eqn (5) and (4), respectively). This is
particularly true owing to the lack of experimental data related
to partially reduced Ag species in the low DadsH/D
n(CO)
region.
3.2.4
Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS)
study on the [Cu(CO)]+ - [Cu(CO)2]+ transformation in
Cu+-ZSM-5.
Two-dimensional
correlation
spectroscopy
(2D-COS) provides a useful tool to evaluate systematically
the spectroscopic changes occurring to a system subjected to
an appropriate external perturbation,249253 which corresponds
to a variation of the PCO in our case. 2D-COS can then be used
to assess statistic relationships between the different spectro-
scopic features that are changing along the dynamic series, in
order to extract valuable information that can be otherwise
difficult to obtain. In the 2D-COS nomenclature the spectra
collected upon varying PCO are defined as dynamic spectra
and can be recorded before and during the application of the
perturbation. A description of the mathematical development
of 2D-COS is beyond the scope of the present section.
Therefore, for a further description of the mathematical
formalism of 2D-COS, the reader is addressed to the original
literature.249251,254,255 In this context it is just worth recalling
that the relevance of 2D-COS spectroscopy applied to cata-
lysts characterization has been demonstrated e.g. by the group
of Caen22,256,257 and by Baiz et al.258 on metal carbonyls.
Parts (a) and (b) of Fig. 17 report a three-dimensional
view of the 2D dimensional synchronous and asynchronous
spectra, respectively, obtained from the dynamic spectra
reported in Fig. 16a (red spectra). The 2D synchronous
spectrum couples IR components which variation is mutually
correlated, while the 2D asynchronous spectrum couples IR
components which variations is not correlated along the series
of dynamic spectra. The fact that the intensity of the 2D
asynchronous spectrum (Fig. 17b) is negligible with respect to
that of the synchronous one Fig. 17a) means that all IR
features appearing in the spectra reported in Fig. 16a are
mutually correlated. In other words the hypothesis that the
components at 2157 and 2151 cm1 could be attributed to two
different [Cu(CO)]+ complexes adsorbed on two different
Cu(I) sites is definitively ruled out. To have a better insight
on the 2D synchronous spectrum Fig. 17, part (c) reports
the content of the three-dimensional part (a) with the two-
dimensional contour-plot method. From Fig. 17c two features
are evident. Firstly the bands at 2178 and 2151 cm1 correlate
positively (red spots), i.e. they are two different vibrational
modes of a single species. Secondly the band at 2157 cm1
correlates
negatively
(blue
spots)
with
both
2178
and
2151 cm1 bands indicating that the species responsible of
the 2157 cm1 is converted upon increasing PCO into a second
species characterized by two IR modes at 2178 and 2151 cm1.
The Cu+  (CO)- Cu+  (CO)2 transformation suggested in
sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 is then fully confirmed.

has revealed the co-presence of Lewis Cr3+ sites, hydroxiles and
structural water in different proportions depending on the activa-
tion pre-treatment, giving rise to a variety of adducts always
characterized

positive

MIL-53-(Ga),261 in UiO-66,262,263 Ni-Cubane264 and in Ni-PiP.265
Here we report a summary of the results obtained upon
adsorption, at low coverage, of CO in MOFs containing divalent
metal ions with a coordinative vacancy and characterized by a
very similar ionic radius (Fig. 18). In HKUST-1 CO forms
adducts, hardly reversible at liquid nitrogen temperature,
characterized by a band at 2178 cm1.117,266 The observed
CO frequency, being very close to that found in the case of
CPO-27-Mg267 (2175 cm1), where the adduct is readily
reversible at liquid nitrogen temperature, suggests that in the
case of Cu2+ a pure electrostatic and s-donation interactions
are not sufficient to explain the features of Cu2+  (CO)
complexes and a minor contribution of p back donation
must be also considered. Similar considerations have to be
addressed in the case of CPO-27-Ni268,269 and CPO-27-Co,
where CO monocarbonyls give rise to bands at 2177 and
2160 cm1 respectively. Note that in the case of the Co form,
the adducts are hardly reversible at room temperature, testifying

have chosen to discuss the Cr2+/SiO2 system.
The importance of the Phillips catalyst in the industrial PE
production287,288 and of surface modified ones289291 makes
Cr/SiO2 one of the most investigated systems by several
experimental techniques.16,292294 Despite the huge amount
of published literature, the structure of Cr6+/SiO2 and of its
relative Cr2+/SiO2 (which is the most studied from a spectro-
scopic point of view) is still unresolved. This is mainly due to
the amorphous nature of the support that prevents the use of
diffraction techniques and is responsible of heterogeneity in
the grafted species. Also EXAFS spectroscopy, often used to
investigate the local structure of amorphous systems, still did
not fully elucidate the structure of Cr2+ sites due to the low Cr
loading (0.5 wt%) and to its high reactivity toward O2/H2O
poisons. Highly diluted systems should be measured in fluores-
cence mode, a request that increases the acquisition times,
making
the
contamination
problems
more
severe.295298
Finally, the absence of a structural model and the difficulty in
treating open shell systems makes a computational approach
not straightforward.137,299,300
Indirect information on the coordination environment of
Cr2+ sites have been obtained by vibrational spectroscopies of
probe molecules. Interaction with CO was studied by in situ IR
since the mid-seventies,16,301,302 probing the formation at room
temperature of non classical161,162 (prevailing s-donation)
carbonyls on a heterogeneity of Cr2+ sites. The nature of
carbonyls turns to classical161,162 one (prevailing p-back donation)
upon lowering the temperature (increasing the coverage), with a
spectacular change in the IR spectra (from blue to cyan curves in
Fig. 19a).
The whole set of spectra has been interpreted in terms of
multiple CO addition model on three different surface families
of isolated CrA, CrB, and CrC sites,16,302306 characterized by
an increasing number of oxygen ligands. The scheme reported
in Fig. 19b depicts this interpretation, that is summarized
hereafter. Experiments performed at 300 K result in the
appearance of the well known RT-triplet (bands at 
n(CO) =
2191, 2184, and 2179 cm1 in the blue spectrum of Fig. 19a)
and are considered the fingerprint of the Cr2+/SiO2 system.
The 2191 cm1 peak is the stretching mode of CO s-bonded
on a Cr2+ site possessing a high polarizing ability, named
as B site, and able to coordinate only one CO molecule at
RT: CrB(CO). The 2184, and 2179 cm1 bands have been
assigned to symmetric and antisymmetric modes of a dicarbonyl
formed at CrA sites: CrA(CO)2. CrC is not able to coordinate
CO at RT.
The CrA and CrB families are able to coordinate further CO
ligands at low temperature/high pressure (grey and cyan
spectra in Fig. 19a), implying that the involved CrA and CrB
species are both highly coordinatively unsaturated (although
at different degrees). On such sites CrA(CO)3 and CrA(CO)3
are formed, both characterized by there n(CO) stretching
modes: see Fig. 19b, violet and orange dotted vertical lines,
respectively. The weak shoulder at B2200 cm1 (observable
only at high CO pressure) indicates that at this stage CO
ligands are filling also CrC family of unsaturated and weaker
sites forming CrC(CO) adducts.
The hypothesis schematized in Fig. 19b implies that the
formation of linear carbonyls, which progressive inset on Cr2+
sites implies a ligand displacement (adjacent surface siloxane
groups) in order to allow the progressive Cr2+ - Cr2+(CO) -
Cr2+(CO)2 - Cr2+(CO)3 evolution, thus adsorption-induced
surface reconstruction. This behaviour is the direct evidence of
the unique role of the surface in the optimization of the CrCO
interaction. More recently Damin et al.307 performed in situ
Raman experiments highlighting the presence of specific surface
modes involving Cr2+ emerging from the silica background,
because of the resonant intensification. These modes are signifi-
cantly perturbed upon CO adsorption (insets in Fig. 19a). This
is a clear, although indirect, proof that an important rearrange-
ment of the local environment of the Cr2+ site at the silica
surface occurs upon CO adsorption.
The first direct structural proof of such an adsorption
induced Cr2+ mobility, foreseen by IR spectroscopy, came
in 2010 only. Gianolio et al.233 performing an in situ, tempera-
ture dependent, Cr K-edge EXAFS experiment proved that
Cr2+ species grafted on SiO2 are extracted from the surface
upon CO adsorption at 100 K exhibiting an increase of the
average CrO distance of DRCrO = +0.08 A
 . At room
temperature, low CO coverages, (blue curves in Fig. 19a and c)
surface siloxane are still present in the local environment of
Cr2+, preventing the adsorption of CO on sites CrC and
limiting the CO addition to mono- and di-carbonyls On CrA
and
CrB
sites,
respectively.
Under
such
circumstances,
the Cr2+  CO interaction can not be fully optimized, it is
dominated by electrostatic and s-donation effects and the
p-back donation is not fully operative, the D
n(CO) is positive
and we are dealing with non-classical carbonyls.161163 At low
temperature, high CO coverages (cyan curves in Fig. 19a and
c), the cooperative effect of three CO molecules on sites CrA
and CrB allows (i) the displacement of adjacent siloxane
ligands and the extraction of the Cr2+ ion from the silica
surface (DRCrO = +0.08 A
 ). These combined effects allows a
rearrangement of the Cr2+  CO interaction where the p-back
donation can now be fully operative dominating the nature of
the metalcarbonyl bond: D
n(CO) becomes negative and the
CrA,B(CO)3
complexes
are
transformed
into
classical
carbonyls.161163
This structural flexibility is the key for understanding the
catalytic activity of Cr2+ sites in presence of adsorbates.
Reversible modification of the active sites upon adsorption/
desorption of adsorbates have been already revealed by in situ
IR (and /or Raman) combined with EXAFS in the case
of isomorphously substituted TiIV species in TS-1308311 of
counterions in zeolites,211,213,312 (discussed in section 3.2.2) an
in the parent Ni2+/SiO2 case, as documented by Martra
et al.231,232 In all cases these structural data, coupled with
other spectroscopic results and ab initio calculations, have
been of high relevance in achieving an overall comprehension
of the site reactivity. In section 5.3 we will appreciate the
relevance of the Cr2+ flexibility in the ethylene polymerization

Carbonyls extended surfaces
The extended surfaces obtained on sintered oxides, halides and
metals represented since decades a materials-bridge able to
connect the world of Surface Science, using perfect and clean
vacuum-cleaved single crystal surfaces or thin films, to the
world of Catalysis, using complex, hill-defined but highly
active high surface area materials.10,14,138,182,298,313376 In
section 3.3, some selected examples on the characterization
of such class of materials with in situ IR spectroscopy is
reported.
3.3.1
Coverage evolution of the IR spectra of CO adsorbed
on extended oxide and halides surfaces: Dynamic and static
shifts. Moving from CO adsorbed on isolated surface sites
(section 3.2) to CO adsorbed on extended surfaces, the vibra-
tional features of the adsorbed molecules became significantly
more complex, see Fig. 20. This is due to the appearance of a
coverage (y) dependence that progressively modifies the spectra
from the lowest coverages (y - 0 limit) to the highest coverages
(y - ymax limit). In most cases a 1 : 1 surface stoichiometry is
reached and ymax = 1, but sometimes geometrical hindrance
limitations among CO adsorbates may result in ymax o 1.
Anyhow, this shift will be defined as D
n in the following:
D
n = 
n(CO)y-ymax 
n(CO)y-0

This shift has been ascribed to changes in lateral inter-
actions
among
adsorbates.
As
discussed
by
many
authors,10,138,182,334,377394
in
overlayers
formed
by
very
weakly adsorbed diatomic species, the interaction among the
oscillators is essentially of the through space type. These
interactions occur among the static and dynamic dipoles of
the diatomic species. For this reason, the shift D
n is the sum of
two contributions:
D
n = D
nstat + D
ndyn
(7)
When the interaction energies become larger than those
characteristic of simple physiosorption processes, other static
effects must be considered as well, which, more appropriately,
are classified as chemical. These effects, being transmitted
through the solid, are also called through solid effects. Two
types of chemical effects can be proposed: inductive and
relaxation effects (which are not always independent). The
first effect is associated with electronic density changes at a
given site induced by adsorption at a neighboring site. This
effect is absent when overlap forces are not operating (as e.g. is
the case of CO on MgO(001), where electrostatic polarization
forces are absolutely predominant). The relaxation effect is a
through solid effect associated with changes in surface relaxa-
tion associated with the formation of adlayers. In fact, upon

P25 sample, composed by anatase with small amounts of rutile. The dotted line curves reported for a-Cr2O3 and CuCl represent the y - ymax

nstat can be directly obtained
(violet horizontal arrows). For the CuCl case the 
n(CO) is plotted vs. PCO for both highly crystalline (red circles) and highly dispersed phase
supported on g-Al2O3. Similar spectra obtained for the MgO and NiO systems are reported in Fig. 21, and Fig. 26a, respectively. Figure adapted

adsorption at a given cationic position, the positive ions move
towards an energetically more favorable position and the same
do the negative ions in nearest neighbor positions and so on.
Although the effect is dying away with a few lattice constants,
it is evident that adsorption at a given site modifies the
structural situation in a small but non-negligible circular area
around the adsorption centre, thus perturbing the adsorptive
properties of other cationic sites within this circle. This effect is
always present and is expected to have greater importance for
chemisorption or for e.g. the CO/ZnO system (because of the
tetrahedral coordination of zinc and oxygen) and on high
index faces of other oxides exposing ions in low coordination
sites (vide infra).
Experimentally, when dosing natural CO on given surface,
only the overall shift (D
n = D
nstat + D
ndyn) is obtained. The
relative values of D
nstat and D
ndyn are evaluated by means of
IR experiments performed with 12CO-diluted isotope mixtures,
suggested by Hammaker et al.,378 which removes the dynamic
coupling between
12CO and
13CO oscillators in diluted
12CO/13CO (x : y) mixtures with y c x (typically x = 515
and y = 9585). So the shift undergone by the minority of
12CO oscillators is subjected to the static shift only, because
12CO are statistically surrounded by 13CO oscillators, that
does not couple with them as they are out of resonance:
D
nstat = D
n(12CO in diluted 12CO/13CO mixtures)
(8)
Once D
nstat has been measured from the experiments with
diluted 12CO-13CO mixtures, eqn (8), then the value of D
ndyn
can be directly obtained from the D
n value measured with
natural CO simply inverting eqn (7). Table 2 reports of several
halides and oxides the experimental values of the
12CO
stretching frequencies 
n(CO)y-0 and 
n(CO)y-ymax obtained
from IR experiments performed dosing natural CO, and the
n(CO)y-ymax obtained from diluted isotopic mixtures. As
discussed above, these values allow to obtain D
n, D
nstat and
D
ndyn. Available from literature data, also reported in Table 2
is the dynamic polarizability398,399 (av) of CO adsorbed on the
different surfaces. av is obtained from D
ndyn following the
modified Hammaker equation:378
[(
n(CO)y-0 + D
ndyn)/
n(CO)y-0]2 = 1 + (y av S0)/(1 + y ae S0),
(9)
where (
n(CO)y-0 + D
ndyn) is the stretching frequency at
y - ymax in absence of static effects, ae is the electronic
polarizability (ae = 1.98 A
 3)380 and S0 is the direct dipolar
sum. The free CO molecule is characterized by a0
v = 0.057 A
 3:
the larger is the variation of av from a0
v, the stronger is the
interaction of CO with the surface. From the data reported in
Table 2, this occurs for NiO, a-Cr2O3 and CuCl.
The complexity of the IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed on
well defined oxide and halides surfaces is well documented by
the set of coverage-dependent spectra reported in Fig. 20
(for ZnO,138 a-Cr2O3,334,383,384,389,400 MgCr2O4,10 LaCr2O3,10
TiO2
10,397 and CuCl),390 Fig. 21 (for MgO)14,17,182,389,401404
and Fig. 26a (for NiO).182,405407 The main components of the
IR bands reported in those Figures are briefly commented on.
ZnO. The IR spectra of increasing doses of CO adsorbed at
77 K on ZnO pretreated at 673 K under vacuum are illustrated
in Fig. 20. These spectra are characterized by strong absorp-
tions in the 21902168-cm1 range.10,138,408 These absorptions,
centered at frequencies higher than that of CO gas, correspond
to polarized CO species s-bonded at the carbon end on Zn2+
sites. At y - 0 a single peak (due to the superposition of two
unresolved components), tailing into the low frequency region,
is observed at 2190 cm1. Upon increasing y, the A peak
gradually shifts to lower frequencies and then declines while
new bands (B, B0, B00) appear and disappear in succession. For
y - 1 a single narrow component at 2168 cm1 (C band)
dominates. The overall shift is D
n = 22 cm1, being
D
ndyn = +6 cm1 and D
nstat = 28 cm1, see Table 2. Like
the A peak, also the C band is composite as can be clearly seen
at intermediate coverages where two components are detected.

CO stretching frequencies of natural CO (12CO : 13CO = 99 : 1) adsorbed on different halides and oxides at both low (y - 0) and high

measured 
n(CO) frequencies, the overall (D
n), the dynamic (D

nstat) shifts can be obtained according to eqn (6)(8). When
available, also the dynamic polarizability (av) of adsorbed CO has been reported. Note that a0

The composite structure of the A and C peaks has been
attributed to CO adsorbed on Zn2+ sites located on (10
10)
and (11
20) faces.10,138 The stepwise evolution of the spectra of
adsorbed CO as a function of coverage is a unique charac-
teristic of ZnO: the five bands arise from the stepwise occupa-
tion of the surface Zn2+ sites, and correspond to different
surroundings of any given CO molecules.138,385,386
a-Cr2O3. At low coverage Cr3+  CO adducts are observed
at 2181 cm1. On the basis of the relative abundance of the
faces defining the microcrystals shown (determined by a parallel
HRTEM study), the 2179, 2172 cm1 doublet (y - 1) were
assigned to CO on 5-fold and 4-fold coordinated Cr3+ ions of
the (
2116) face, while the peak at 2167 cm1 can be safely
attributed to CO end-on adsorbed on Cr3+ ions of the (01
12)
face.334,383,384,389,400 The overall shift is D
n = 14 cm1, being
D
ndyn = +14 cm1 and D
nstat = 28 cm1, see Table 2.
MgCr2O4. A preliminary HRTEM study revealed that the
investigated MgCr2O4 spinel is composed of highly crystalline
single crystal particles mainly exposing the (111) and (311)
faces. The IR spectrum of adsorbed CO is dominated by the
spectroscopic manifestations of Cr3+  CO adducts formed
on the (111) face. At y - 0, the major peak is centered at
2169 cm1, which gradually shifts down to 2157 cm1 in the
y - 1 limit, resulting in D
n = 12 cm1, D
ndyn = +10 cm1
and D
nstat = 22 cm1, see Table 2. It has been shown that
Mg2+ cations are not exposed to CO,10 so that all the spectro-
scopy reported in Fig. 20 is related to the formation of
Cr3+  CO adducts only. In addition to the main peak in
the spectra of Fig. 20, two weak bands in the 21702185 cm1
range are detected which also slightly shift with coverage.
These bands are tentatively attributed by Zecchina et al.10 to
CO adsorbed on Cr3+ centres located on (311) face or on
edges or steps.
LaCr2O3.
Conversely
to what
was observed
for the
MgCr2O4 case, both Cr3+ and La3+ contribute to the IR
spectra measured dosing CO on LaCr2O3.10 The spectra at
increasing PCO adsorbed at 77 K on LaCrO3 activated at
1100 K show two main bands in the 21802165 cm1 and
21622155 cm1 range (see Fig. 20). Both components are

system,334,383,384,389,400 Zecchina et al.10 assigned the component
at 21622155 cm1 (highly reversible upon lowering PCO) to
CO adsorbed on La3+ terminated surfaces, and the peak at
21802165 cm1 (more stable toward outgassing) to CO on
Cr3+ terminated surfaces. The band associated to Cr3+  CO
adducts is subjected to the following shifts: D
n = 14 cm1,
D
ndyn = +13 cm1 and D
nstat = 27 cm1, while smaller
shifts are observed for the La3+  CO: D
n = 6 cm1,
D
ndyn = +7 cm1 and D
nstat = 13 cm1, see Table 2.
TiO2. Degussa P25 titanium dioxide is composed mainly of
the anatase phase with small amounts of rutile. Morpho-
logically, the microcrystals are well defined, preferentially
exposing the [010] face. The singleton measured at y - 0, is
charaterized by a 
n(CO) = 2193 cm1, while the spectrum of
CO adsorbed at maximum coverage (see Fig. 20) is dominated
by a band at 2180 cm1.397 The extremely narrow bandwidth
(FWHM o 1.5 cm1) of this component suggests that the
respective Ti4+  CO complexes are formed on very regular
surface planes and that the observed band at y = 1 is the
collective in-phase stretching mode of an ordered 2-dimensional
layer of parallel CO molecules polarized by 5-fold coordinated
ions exposed on the predominant [010] planes. The following
shifts have been obtained: D
n = 13 cm1, D
ndyn = +4 cm1
and D
nstat = 17 cm1, see Table 2. These figures and the
value of the dynamic polarizability av = 0.025 A
 3, suggest that
the surface Ti4+  CO bonds are dominated by electrostatic
(polarization)
forces.
The
successive
accurate
HRTEM
and FTIR investigation by Martra410 indicates clearly that
commercial TiO2 samples (P25 by Degussa and TiO2 by
Merck) are significantly different materials.
CuCl. The case of CuCl is quite particular. The IR spectra
performed with natural CO resulted in an almost coverage
independent 
n(CO),390 being D
n = 2 cm1, see Table 2 and
Fig. 20. However, this invariance is due to an almost
perfect balance between two opposite and comparable effects,
being D
ndyn = +11 cm1 and D
nstat = 13 cm1. When
CuCl is obtained by ethylene reduction of highly dispersed
CuCl2/Al2O3, the catalyst for ethylene oxychlorination,391,411414
then an important global shift is obtained. In this case
D
n = 14 cm1,391,393,394 see blue squares in Fig. 20. This
impressive change in the PCO dependence of the IR spectra is
due to the fact that supported CuCl is so highly dispersed
(about 50% of Cu atoms are surface atoms) that there is no
extended face to allow dipoledipole interaction. Under
such circumstances, as demonstrated by an isotopic mixture
experiment,391 the dynamic shift is switched off(D
ndyn = 0)
and D
n = D
nstat.
MgO. On highly perfect MgO smoke crystals182 (vide infra
Fig. 21c) the 
n(CO) moves from 2157 cm1 (for y - 0) down
to 2148 cm1 (for y - ymax), resulting in is D
n = 6 cm1,
being D
ndyn = +3 cm1 and D
nstat = 11 cm1, and in
av = 0.031 A
 3, see Table 2.
NiO. The evolution of the IR spectra of CO dosed on
low surface area NiO crystals as a function of coverage is
reported in section 4.3 to allow a direct comparison with the
series of spectra obtained dosing NO on the same material
(vide infra Fig. 26a). On such a highly sintered NiO sample,
the y - 0 limit results in a Ni2+
5cus  CO characterized
by a stretching frequency of 2152 cm1, that progressively
shifts downwards to 2136 cm1 for (y E 1), resulting in
D
n = 16 cm1. With the aid of the isotopic substitution
method, Escalona Platero et al.415 have calculated that
D
ndyn = +27 cm1 and D
nstat = 43 cm1, and that
av = 0.256 A
 3, see Table 2. All these values are definitely
higher than those found on MgO: this means that both the
permanent and the dynamic dipoles and the associated charge
oscillations from the adsorbate to the surface and vice versa
during the stretching vibration, which have direct influence on
av are substantially increased upon adsorption on NiO. This in
turn indicates that the Ni2+  CO bond has not a purely
electrostatic character (as in the Mg2+  CO case) and that
some dp overlap forces play a small but definite role.416 The
quantification of the chemical contribution in the Ni2+  CO
bond is difficult to make on the basis of the IR results: however
by considering the modest enhancement of av and the very
reversible character of the CO species even at low temperature,
it has been concluded that chemical forces still play only a
minor role.10 Under these circumstances the assumption that
the static shift is mainly due to dipoledipole (through space)
effects can still be considered to be a valid approximation. The
presence of a small back-donation in the Ni2+  CO bond also
explains why the frequency of the CO peak is lower than that
observed on MgO.
Summary. Besides the main IR band, which shifts upon PCO
increase has been widely debated above, the IR spectra
reported in Fig. 20, Fig. 21 and Fig. 26a contain several other
minor features that allows a deep knowledge of the minority
surface adsorbing sites, such as defects, edges and corners, that
are usually the most reactive ones sites. The assignment of all
such minor IR bands is however beyond the purposes of this
review, and we refer to the quoted references for a complete
description. Exception will be made for the MgO case, that has
been chosen to be described in detail in the next Subsection as
typical case study of the possibility to bridge the gap
between Surface Science and Catalysis.
3.3.2
Tuning the surface area of MgO: A means to bridge
the gap between surface science and catalysis. As clearly
demonstrated for a-Cr2O3,340 NiO,417 CO14,418 and other
oxides or halides10,248,377,389 the gap between the single crystals
and polycrystalline samples is not so profound as it has been
depicted in early studies. In this review we chosen MgO as case
study to support this thesis.
The particles of MgO, even when prepared in highly dispersed
form (200300 m2 g1), show a great tendency to assume a
cubic habit and to expose low index (100) faces and terraces.10
In other words, these particles are intrinsically possessing the
properties of single crystals (100) faces, the only difference
being represented by the larger proportion of sites located on
the edges and on the corners of the cubelets, see the TEM
micrographs reported in Fig. 8a and Fig. 21a0. As a con-
sequence it can be safely hypothesized that, as far as MgO is
concerned, the above mentioned gap of understanding could
be diminished and rationalized by studying samples with

The IR spectra of increasing doses of CO adsorbed at 77 K
on three different MgO samples of increasing crystallites
perfection, hereafter hsa (already considered for the inter-
action with H2, see section 2.5.1) sintered and smoke,
are reported in parts (a), (b) and (c) of Fig. 21 (surface
area E200, 35 and 10 m2 g1 respectively).10,389 The main
features of the spectra illustrated in Fig. 21ac can be inter-
preted in terms of Mg2+  CO adducts as detailed in the
following: (i) the weak adsorption at about 2203 cm1, clearly
observed only on the high surface sample (Fig. 21a), is due to
Mg2+
3cus  CO adducts; (ii) the absorption at 21702164 cm1
(Fig. 21a and b) appears as a shoulder at high coverages and
becomes a well defined peak only for y - 0 and is ascribed to
CO adsorbed on Mg2+
4cus ions located on edges and steps
(absent on smoke, see Fig. 21c); (iii) the dominant absorption
at 21572148 cm1 (for y - ymax) is assigned to CO adsorbed
on the ions of the predominant (001) faces: the narrow
FWHM (4.5 cm1, for y - ymax) of this band in the most
perfect sample (smoke), is remarkably small (Fig. 21c) and is
correlated with the high perfection of the crystals which
minimize the inhomogeneous broadening effects; (iv) the weak
absorption at 21502146 cm1, distinctly observable on high
surface area sample for y -0 only, has been assigned to CO
bonded to pairs of Mg2+ at step sites, as schematized in the
two structures reported in Fig. 21d.
The detailed comparison of the spectra obtained on smoke
(Fig. 21e) and on single crystal (100) faces419 (Fig. 21f)
indicates that the differences are negligible and that MgO
crystals of the smoke sample exhibits (100) surfaces of
single crystal quality, see the TEM micrograph reported in
Fig. 21c0. The signal to noise of the spectra obtained on the
MgO smoke sample is however two orders of magnitude
higher than those obtained on the vacuum cleaved single
because of the higher number of surface atoms exposed to
the IR beam.
The same temperature dependent IR experiments that
allowed to determine the heat of adsorption of H2 on the
three different class of surface sites (Mg2+
3cus, Mg2+
4cus
and Mg2+
5cus) on MgO, see Fig. 9 in section 2.5, has been
applied by Spoto et al.14 also on the CO adsorption on MgO.
The slopes give the adsorption enthalpies, which are very close
for CO adsorbed on edge species: 21.9 and 22.6 kJ mol1 for
the 2161 and 2170 cm1 bands respectively (linear and
bridged, see Fig. 21d, Mg2+
4cus sites). As for the band due
to CO adsorbed on regular (100) terraces, the measured
adsorption enthalpy is much lower: 12.5 kJ mol1. The heat
of adsorption of CO on Mg2+
3cus could not be extracted
because the Mg2+
3cus  CO was not desorbed upon heating
the sample from 60 to 300 K.14

How
surface
science can help catalyst characterization. Among noble metals,
Palladium has been chosen as a case study because of its
relevance in hydrogenation420426 and coupling reactions,427435
the most relevant being the MizorokiHeck436439 and the
Suzuki440442 reactions. As reviewed here below the relevance
of Pd in catalysis has driven an important effort of the surface
science community to understand in deep detail the adsorption
and reactivity properties of the most exposed Pd faces.
Vibrational spectroscopies such as infrared reflection
absorption spectroscopy (IRAS, also known as reflection
absorption infrared spectroscopy, RAIRS),443446 sum frequency
generation (SFG)447,448 spectroscopy and high resolution

Surface
science
techniques have then been able to also characterize well defined
metal clusters deposited on suitable substrates.446,460464 Three
main categories of carbonyls can be identified, which are
characterized by rather defined frequency regions for the
CO stretching mode:456,465,466 (i) linear carbonyls (on-top sites)
usually absorb in the B21302000 cm1 stretching region; (ii)
2-fold bridged carbonyls are characterized by a 
n(CO) in the
B20001850 cm1 interval; (iii) 3-fold bridged carbonyls
(on hollow sites) are defined by a CO stretching mode in
the B19201800 cm1 region. In all cases we are dealing with
classical carbonyls, where the p-back donation effects, causing
a red shift of the 
n(CO), are largely dominant with respect to
s-donation and electrostatic effects, both contributing to a
blue shift of the 
n(CO),161,162,174 see section 3.1. The frequency
ranges of linear, 2-fold and 3-fold bridged carbonyls reported
above are quite large as different phenomena influence the
observed 
n(CO). Due to the progressive build up of lateral
lateral interactions among adsorbed CO molecules, the CO
stretching frequencies of linear and bridged carbonyls show
important blue shifts upon increasing y,443,458,467469 hereafter
given in CO monolayers. It is worth noting that the exact
frequency interval of the three categories of carbonyls, as well
as the precise 
n(CO) vs. y evolution, may change slightly as a
function of the experimental conditions (temperature, equilibrium
pressure, etc.) and from author to author.335,338,348,361,443,450459
As far as Pd(111) surface is concerned (Fig. 22b), the
evolution vs. y of the IRAS spectra measured upon dosing
CO can be summarized as follows. (i) At the lowest y, only
three-fold bridged carbonyls are observed, at a distinctly low
n(CO) around 1810 cm1.443,458,467 (ii) Increasing y up to
B0.5, CO molecules occupy either two-fold bridging sites or
three-fold hollow sites. This structure is essentially characterized
by a band around 1920 cm1.458 (iii) Within y = 0.50.7,
various complex overlayer structures have been reported.443,457,458
In particular, around y = 0.7, it has been suggested that some
CO molecules are forced into a-top sites with a simultaneous
reconstruction of the two-fold structure, resulting into a shift
of the two-fold band up to 1946 cm1 and into the con-
temporaneous appearance of a band around 2080 cm1, due
to linear carbonyls (Fig. 22b).443 (iv) A further increase of y
results in a progressive strength of these two last components
that simultaneously shift upwards to 1952 and 2090 cm1,
respectively.458 It is worth noticing that at these y values a
small component around 2090 cm1 is often present in the
IRAS spectra see e.g. Fig. 1 and 2 in ref. 467 or Fig. 2a in
ref. 458 even if it is rarely discussed. This component, clearly in
the region of linear carbonyls, can be assigned to carbonyls
formed on a small fraction of defects. (v) At maximum
coverage (y Z 0.75) a new surface rearrangement occurs,

layers that are formed during CO adsorption on the Pd(111)
single crystal at y = 0.33, 0.50, 0.625 and 0.75.
A much simpler spectral evolution has been observed upon
increasing y on the Pd(100) face.458 In this case only two-fold
bridged carbonyls species have been observed whose 
n(CO)
moves from 1895 cm1 (y E 0.05) up to 1995 cm1 at ymax, see

As key study system we have chosen the Pd/SiO2Al2O3
system.392 Fig. 22c reports the IR spectra of CO dosed at
300 K on Pd/SiO2Al2O3, previously reduced at 673 K in H2,
upon decreasing y. In the adopted experimental conditions,
ymax (bold black curve) corresponds to T = 300 K and
PCO = 50 Torr, whereas ymin (bold blue curve) is obtained
by evacuation at 300 K down to 104 Torr. Three components
are clearly visible in this set of spectra. (i) The high frequency
one progressively decreases in intensity and moves from
2097 to 2087 cm1 (D
n = 10 cm1) upon lowering y. The
high ymax spectrum presents a tail at the low frequency side,
which progressively becomes relatively more relevant upon
lowering y. Both bands are in the range of linear carbonyls,
but show a marked different behavior. The low frequency
shoulder is coverage independent, in both intensity and frequency
in this y range; on these bases it is ascribed to CO linearly
adsorbed on defects.458,478 Conversely, the important blue-
shift characterizing the band dominating the ymax spectrum
(D
n = 10 cm1), makes difficult the assignment of this band
to linear carbonyls adsorbed on defects (as advanced by Lear
et al.471,472), and favors its interpretation in terms of linear CO
molecules adsorbed on well defined Pd(111) faces. (ii) The
most intense and sharp band of the whole set of spectra moves
from 1994 cm1 down to 1988 cm1 (D
n = 6 cm1) upon
reducing PCO, accompanied by a slight intensity increase.
(iii) Finally a broad component centered at ymax around
1925 cm1 progressively shifts downwards to 1905 cm1 at
ymin (D
n = 20 cm1). The former component (ii) clearly lies
in the range where two-fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(100) are
expected, while the latter lies in the region of overlap between
two- and three-fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(111) and its
assignment is less straightforward.392
The three main components characterizing the spectra
reported in Fig. 22c, exhibit a frequency shift much smaller
than that investigated in the single crystal experiments reported
in Fig. 22a and b. Moreover, no evidence of three-fold
carbonyls below 1900 cm1 is detectable in the IR spectra of
Fig. 22c. These observations imply that, the thermodynamic
conditions reached in the experiment reported in Fig. 22c were
unable to reach, by far, a ymin comparable to that reached in
the UHV conditions of the single crystal experiments Fig. 22a
and b. For this reason, a complete assignment of spectral
components to different carbonyl species is not possible on the
basis of the data reported in Fig. 22c only.
In order to be able to compare IR data with the surface
science literature, i.e. to reach lower y values, the desorption
process was progressively performed (down to PCO = 104 Torr)
at increasing temperatures, up to 573 K. The IR spectra
obtained in such conditions are reported in Fig. 22d. As done
for the literature data on single crystals discussed above, we
will present the spectra reported in Fig. 22d as a function of
increasing y.
The lowest y spectrum (red curve in Fig. 22d) exhibits three
main components, at 1900, 1800 and 1694 cm1. The two
bands at 1900 and 1800 cm1 were be attributed straight-
forwardly to two-fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(100) faces
(
n(CO) = 1895 cm1 on single crystals) and to three-fold
bridged carbonyls on Pd(111) faces (
n(CO) = 1807 cm1 on
single crystals), respectively.443,458 The y value reached by CO
desorption at 573 K is sufficiently low to guarantee the absence
of any feature due to linear carbonyls on well defined faces
(y o 0.6 according to single crystal literature).458 As for the
component at 1694 cm1, which is an extremely low frequency
and never observed on single crystals, it has been interpreted
as due to a fraction of three-fold bridged carbonyls interacting
through the O termination with the Al3+ acid sites of the
SiO2Al2O3 support.392 Increasing y will result in the progressive
population of adjacent three-fold bridged carbonyls, with the
parallel increase of laterallateral interactions destroying the
interaction with the adjacent Al3+ support site. This explana-
tion accounts for the upward shift of the band at 1694 cm1 up
to 1740 cm1 in the spectrum collected after desorption at
523 K (orange spectrum in Fig. 22d).
Upon increasing y, the 1900 cm1 component, due to the
two-fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(100) faces, progressively
shifts upwards at 1922, 1958, 1976, 1981 and up to 1988 cm1,
for the spectrum collected after CO evacuation at 300 K
(orange spectrum in Fig. 22d).392 The value measured at
PCO = 50 Torr, 
n(CO) = 1994 cm1, exactly corresponds
to the frequency observed on single crystal Pd(100) faces at
ymax.443,458
The evolution of the 1800 cm1 component, due to three-
fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(111) faces, is more complex
(see Table 3). A progressive y increase results in an upward
shift to 1820, 1841, 1865, 1880, up to 1905 cm1 in the sample
desorbed at 300 K (Table 3 and Fig. 22d). All of these bands
are characterized by a high energy shoulder, that could be
explained in terms of surface heterogeneity. Starting from the
sample desorbed at 473 K, also a contribution in the region of
linear carbonyls gradually appears. This absorption, initially
centered at 2064 cm1 (sample desorbed at 473 K, dark green
curve in Fig. 22d), splits into two components upon increasing
y. The low frequency one, more important at low y, is almost
coverage-independent in frequency (appearing at 2067 cm1 in
the sample desorbed at 333 K, dashed grey curve) and rapidly
saturates in intensity. Conversely, the high frequency compo-
nent becomes the dominant one in the y region discussed in
Fig. 22c, and undergoes an upward shift of +10 cm1 (passing
from 2087 to 2097 cm1, see Table 3). As advanced above,
the frequency evolution of these two components confirms
their attribution to linear carbonyls adsorbed on defects
(low frequency one) and on Pd(111) faces (high frequency one).
Coming to the intensities, care must be done in correlating
their integrated area at ymax to their relative abundance. As
clearly reviewed in the work of Hollins,478 the high frequency
component can gain intensity due to a coupling interaction
within CO adlayers, because of a characteristic transfer of
intensity occurring from the band due to lower frequency
species (linear CO on defects) to that of its high-frequency
counterpart (CO on well defined Pd faces). This transfer
is particularly efficient when the frequency separation is
small.478,479
The assignment of the linear carbonyl bands reported
above have consequences on the interpretation of the bands
of bridged carbonyls on the Pd(111) face. According to the

surface science literature, linear carbonyls on Pd(111) faces
start to appear around y = 0.7, accompanied by the presence
of two-fold bridged carbonyls on the same face.443,457,458 For
this reason, the component moving in the RT desorption
experiment from 1925 to 1905 cm1, should be attributed
to two-fold bridged carbonyls on Pd(111) face (Table 3).
This implies that, upon increasing y, the three-fold bridged
carbonyls persist until linear carbonyls appear; at this point
they are converted into two-fold bridged due to a surface
rearrangement (sample desorbed at 300 K, dark blue curve in
Fig. 22d).
However, it is well known that the 19251905 cm1 interval
lies in the frequency frontier between the region of three- and
two-fold bridged carbonyls, and that the bands falling there
have been assigned to both species moving from author to
author of the quoted literature. The non straightforward
assignment of the band in the 19251905 cm1 interval to
two fold bridged carbonyls, in turn, makes questionable the
assignment of the highest 
n(CO) to linear carbonyls on
Pd(111). In the case that all the components appearing in
the 19251905 cm1 interval are assigned to three-fold bridged
carbonyls on Pd(111), authors assumed that the y value
reached in the experiment does not allow the three fold to
two fold + linear surface rearrangement on Pd(111) faces,
than the two family of bands observed in the linear carbonyl
regions have to be assigned to CO adsorbed on two different
type of defects (steps and corners).392 As already recalled, this
is the assignment made by Lear et al.471,472 Notwithstanding
this alternative interpretation simplifies the assignments of the
bands in the bridged carbonyls region, it has serious difficulties
in explaining both the magnitude and the sign of the of the
shift undergone by the high frequency component upon
increasing y: D
n = 
n(ymax)  
n(ymin) = 10 cm1. This
question still remains open for the moment.
Summarizing, the surface science literature allowed Groppo
et al.392 to: (i) give a straightforward interpretation of the low
y spectra in terms of two- and three-fold bridged carbonyls
adsorbed on Pd(100) and Pd(111) faces, respectively; (ii)
advance two alternative interpretations (both having different
strengths and weakness) of the high y spectra. This represents
a clear example on how close and intermixed the topics in

Platinum and Rhodium supported catalysts for CO
oxidation.
Platinum
and
Rhodium
supported
catalysts
are relevant materials for green chemistry and car exhaust
treatments.480482 In both cases the catalytic activities of
supported metal particles is generally recognized to be influenced
by
the
chemical
composition
of
the
support
materials
(acidbase properties), pore size and curvature, presence of
promoting elements.483492 The understanding of the effect of
a support oxide on the properties of noble metal is a challenging
subject because it opens a way towards modeling and tuning of
the catalytic properties by a deliberate choice of the support
and dopants. In combination with catalytic tests, HRTEM
and EXAFS measurements, a powerful technique in elucidating
these aspects is the infrared spectroscopy of chemisorbed CO,
as it can be regarded as a sensitive and local probe of the
electronic properties of supported metal nanoparticles. Its
application is based on the fact that differences in electronic
state are reflected in changes in the vibrational characteristics
of the MCO adduct. Similarly to what was deeply discussed
for palladium (section 3.3.3), in the case of platinum supported
catalysts, CO adsorption causes the appearance of IR bands
in 21001900 cm1 region (assigned to linear CO) and in
19001700 cm1 spectral range (due to 2-, 3-, or even 4-fold-
coordinated CO bridged bonded). Moreover, the intensity
ratio of the linear and bridged bonded bands (L : B ratio)
can be used as a measure for the electronic state of the Pt
nanoparticles. It has been found that Pt nanoclusters on basic
supports are relatively more electron-rich than on acidic
supports, which is reflected by an increased red shift of the
CO stretching frequency and a decreased L : B ratio. Another
attractive feature of the IR technique is that it can be used to
perform real-time temperature programmed desorption (TPD)
studies to obtain direct information on changes in the PtC(O)
bond strength. This approach has been followed for systematic
studies on well defined Pt nanoparticles supported on a wide
range of porous silica493 and Y-zeolites,491 elucidating the
effect of monovalent (H+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and
divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+) on the
electronic properties of Pt particles. An increasing electron
charge on the supported Pt nanoparticles indirectly induced by
alkaline and earth alkaline metal ions via the framework
oxygen atoms promotes the CO oxidation activity due to an
increased CO surface coverage. The effect is more relevant in
the case of zeolite-supported Pt nanoparticles in respect
of Pt/SiO2.493
Fig. 23 summarizes the time- and temperature-resolved IR
spectra of the different supported PtY catalysts, by differen-
tiating the charge-balancing cation of the zeolite.491 Reported
experiments, together with the similar experiment performed
on Pd particles (Fig. 22d), actually represent CO TPD experi-
ments followed by IR. Such spectroscopy TPD is much
more informative than the standard TPD because it is able
to discriminate among the different adsorption sites. In other
words, from standard TPD it is just known that a CO
molecule has left at a given temperature, from IR-TPD, it is

also known where this molecule came from. On the basis
of the whole set of experimental data reported in Fig. 23ai,
Weckhuysen et al.491 extracted three main observations.
(i) The linear CO absorption bands of Pt/HY (Fig. 23a) are
sharp and symmetrical, whereas alkaline metal (Fig. 23be)
and earth alkaline metal (Fig. 23fi) cation-containing samples
possess broad asymmetrical bands with shoulders. In the case
of Pt/HY, the bandwidth points to the presence of a single
type of linear-coordinated CO and hence, to a uniform
coordination number for the supported Pt particles.456 The
large bandwidths for the cation-containing zeolite Y samples
has been explained by Weckhuysen et al.491 assuming the
presence of nonbonding electrostatic interactions and in
particular attractive ion-dipole interactions.494
(ii) The 
n(CO) value for the bands due to both linear
and bridged carbonyls decrease upon substitution of the

D
n(CO) of linearly coorinated PtCO adducts versus the
cation radius-to-charge ratio. From the reported data, it is
evident that there exists a correlation as a high red shift
corresponds to a high cation radius-to-charge ratio. Similar
trends were observed for the 
n(CO) value of the band due
to bridged carbonyls, although due to the complexity and
broadness of these bands less straightforward conclusions can
be drawn.
(iii) Both alkaline and earth alkaline cations posses complex
spectra formed by at least three and ill-resolved bands
(most evident for materials loaded with the divalent cations).
The intensity of the band due to bridged carbonyls decreases
faster than that of the linear carbonyls at around 2000 cm1.
IR band intensities of linear and bridged CO species decrease
with increasing measurement temperature and the relative
extent of the band intensity decrease is influenced by the
presence
of
alkaline
and
earth
alkaline
metal
cations.
The ratio of the IR band intensities of linear to bridged
Pt-coordinated CO decreases in the order: Pt/H+-Y >
Pt/M2+Y > Pt/M+Y. A systematic shift from linear to
bridge bonded CO was observed for decreasing Lewis acidity,
as expressed by the KamletTaft parameter a.491,495 A decreasing
a results in an increasing electron charge on the framework
oxygen atoms and therefore an increasing electron charge on
the supported Pt nanoparticles. The CO coverage on the
supported Pt nanoparticles increases with increasing electron
density on Pt. This increasing electron density was found
to result in an increased CO oxidation activity, and basic
promotors facilitate the chemisorption of CO on the Pt
nanoparticles. This adsorbed CO reacts with adsorbed O
according to a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism to give rise
to the formation of CO2. The most promoted CO oxidation
catalyst is a Pt/KY sample, which has a T50% of 390 K and a
L : B ratio of 2.7.491
Parallel studies have been performed by the Utrecht group
in the case of Rh nanoparticles,496 also combining directly the
reactivity toward CO and NO.497 These systems have been
considered as models for the NOx storage-reduction catalysts
(e.g., PtBaO/Al2O3) currently used in cars. Upon showing
that BaO most likely plays a dual role because it acts as a
NOx trap but also promotes the CO oxidation activity of
the supported Pt nanoparticles, interesting guidelines for the
development of improved three-way exhaust catalytic conver-
ters can be suggested from the here reviewed studies.
4.
Nitric oxide
4.1
General consideration on the metalNO interaction:
Comparison with the CO case
Nitric oxide is a molecular probe characterized by properties
similar to those of CO. In fact, similarly to CO:7,10,158
(1) It can interact with positive centres (Li+, Na+ and
K+ etc) via the nitrogen end. In the following it will be
documented that this interaction is associated with a positive
shift of 
n(NO) stretching frequency, as was the case for CO
(see section 3.2.1).
(2) It interacts with transition metal centers (both positively
charged or neutral) with formation of surface nitrosyls
characterized by stretching frequency spanning in a wide
range. It will be shown that this frequency range is similar to
that covered by carbonyls.
However substantial differences are observed for the two
probes. In particular:
(a) Unlike CO, the adsorbateadsorbent interaction energy
on non transition metal centres is weaker than the adsorbate
adsorbate interaction because NO, being a radical, has a
distinct tendency to dimerize with formation of stable N2O2
species.498 Consequently, the surface species observable on
non transition metal oxides are predominantly dimeric and the
related spectroscopy is very complex.
(b) When NO is interacting with positively charged transi-
tion metal centers, the presence of an extra electron in the p*
orbital of NO is resulting in a superior bonding character. The
superior p acceptor ability of NO with respect to CO has been
clearly documented for homogeneous complexes499502 and for
matrix isolated unsaturated nitrosyls.503 In the following it
will be illustrated that, all other factors remaining constant
(like structure, charge and the number of d-electrons of the
adsorbing site) the bonding of NO can be characterized by a
larger back donation with respect to CO. This effect is
associated with larger oscillator strength. In conclusion the
NO probe behaves (with respect to CO) as an efficient
amplifier of the dp overlap effects.
(c) While the M  CO (M = transition metal centre) bond is
always linear, the M  NO bond is bent. The average MNO
angle of M(NO)n complexes (n = 1, 2 or 3) decrease with
increasing n, resulting in more bent structures. In these cases
NO behaves formally as NO and the associated stretching
frequency can be highly downward shifted with respect to the
gas phase. This effect is maximized in negatively charged
complexes.503 In some cases 
n(NO) stretching frequencies as
low as 1400 cm1 have been reported: as for the (Ag NO).
(d) Due to its radical character, NO is more reactive than
CO, and on metal surfaces easily undergoes decomposition or
reaction with adsorbed oxygen.
(e)
Although
the formation
of CO+ and CO
has
been
reported
and
characterized
by
IR
spectroscopy
(
n(CO)+: 2240 cm1;
n(CO):1250 cm1) when CO is
adsorbed at 77 K on highly defective KCl containing V and
F centers,504 the presence of these species has never been
reported at RT. The formation of these species is the result
of direct electron donation to V centres or electron abstraction
from a F centre. Notice that on the same defective system also
(C2O2)2 (IR peaks at 15351264 cm1) were observed at
77 K. As for oxidic surfaces are concerned, the observation
of unstable CO and C2O2
 has been reported at 77 K for
electron rich magnesium oxide doped with metallic magnesium
and/or with alkali metals.505 Unlike CO+, the NO+ species
(isolelectronic with respect to neutral CO) are observed as
stable species on oxidic surfaces at RT: this result is differen-
tiating the NO and CO probes. However the formation of
NO+ is not the result of the direct interaction of NO with a
electron acceptor site (strong Lewis acid centre or a V centre)

but is the result of the interaction of NO with oxygen adsorbed
on transition metal centres. In a few cases (highly ionic
surfaces) it has been reported that dimers of the ionic NO
species (N2O2)2 are observable by IR on oxidic surfaces
(vide infra). By analogy with the results concerning CO inter-
action with the same systems, it will be illustrated that these
species have more probably a (N2O3)2 structure and are not
the direct product of electron abstraction from the surface and
that a more complex reaction (interaction with coordinatively
unsaturated O
Qcentres) is involved to generate these negatively
charged species.
For sake of brevity only a few representative case studies will be
illustrated. When needed, a direct comparison with IR spectro-
scopy of CO adsorbed on the same sites will be reported. The
similarity of CO and NO as probes of electrostatic fields is clearly
documented in Fig. 24 (red squares). In the figure the experi-
mental results where both probes have been used on the same
samples are reported. Investigated samples are: Na+- and K+-
ETS-10,79 TiO2,506 ZrO2,506 MgO,14 NaCl,182 Cu+-ZSM-5,208,215

CPO-27-Ni,268,508
a-Fe2O3,99
Cu2O/SiO2,226
CuCl/g-Al2O3.391 A very good linear dependence has been
obtained for the data collected on alkalimetal exchanged
ferrierite (red squares), where the anionic environment is
exactly the same for the three investigated cations. For the
same reason, a pretty good linear relationship was obtained
for the Na+- and K+-exchanged ETS-10 (M+  NO and
M+  ON adducts, full and open orange squares, respectively).
An acceptable linear dependence has also been obtained for
non-d and d0 systems (blue circles); the lower accuracy of the
linear fit is due to the different anionic environments of the
investigated samples. It is evident that the overall red, orange
and blue set of data are well correlated, proving that all these
interactions are mainly dominated by the electrostatic inter-
action and that the two molecules are responding in the same
way to the Stark effect induced by the same cation sites.
When d-metals are considered (green triangles), any attempt
to rationalize 
n(CO) vs. 
n(NO) fails, proving that the extent of
the p-back donation is significantly different for the CO and
NO probes, as discussed in section 4.1. In particular, it is
worth noticing that, with the only exceptions of Cu2O/SiO2
and g-CuCl/Al2O3, for all the remaining investigated d-systems,
the 
n(CO) is blue shifted, indicating a dominance of electro-
static and s-donation interactions, while the 
n(NO) are signifi-
cantly red shifted (only Ag+-ZSM-5 and a-Fe2O3 making
exception), revealing the major role played by the p-back
donation interaction. To further investigate this aspect most
of these systems will be described in greater detail in the
following subsections.
4.2
Electrostatic interaction of NO with alkalimetal cations
As was the case for CO (see section 3.2.1), the adsorption of
NO on Li+-, Na+- and K+-exchanged zeolites is the ideal
experiment to estimate the response of NO to the polarizing
field of the cations not containing d-electrons. However, as the
interaction of NO with these positive centers is charac-
terized by low enthalpy, the adsorption process under mono-
molecular form is contrasted by the distinct tendency of NO
(which is a radical) to dimerize with formation of N2O2
species. For this reason, the IR spectroscopy of adsorbed
NO is usually dominated by properties of dimers, a fact which
complicates the study of the adsorbed monomeric species. The
relative contribution of adsorbed N2O2 and NO can be
favorably modified by decreasing the equilibrium pressure
(PNO). In fact at the lowest PNO, the adsorbateadsorbate
interactions (and hence dimers formation) are minimized.
Consequently the manifestation of monomeric NO can
(in principle) become observable.
The result of a typical experiment performed on K-ferrierite,
where the IR manifestations of adsorbed NO have been
unambiguously put into evidence by Bordiga et al.35 are here
illustrated in Fig. 25a. As expected, at the highest coverage
(Fig. 25a), the IR spectrum is very complex because it is
dominated by manifestation of the dimer. However when the
coverage is gradually decreased by lowering the PNO (bold curve
in Fig. 25a), a single peak at 1882 cm1 is emerging which
can be unambiguously assigned to the adsorbed K+  NO
monomer. When the same experiment is performed on Li+-
and Na+-ferrierite, an estimation of the effect of the cation
radius on the NO stretching frequency becomes possible and
the results are compared in Fig. 25b. IR absorption bands at
1906, 1894 and 1882 cm1 are observed for Li+-, Na+- and
K+-exchanged ferrierite. These values are shifted upward
with respect to the gas phase (
n0(NO) = 1876 cm1) by:
D
n(NO) = +30, +18 and +14 cm1, respectively. These
data perfectly correlate with the corresponding D
n(CO), see
red squares in Fig. 24.

CuCl/g-Al2O3, and Cr2+/SiO2 and Fe2+-ZSM-5 (green triangles). In
the Cr2+/SiO2, Fe2+-ZSM-5 and g-CuCl/Al2O3 cases, where only
dinitrosyl adducts have been observed, the baricenter frequency has
been reported. For systems undergoing a coverage dependent shift
(see section 3.3.1) the frequency of the y - 0 limit has been reported. The
data concerning MgO and NaCl are inferred from the published data by
assuming that the 
n(NO) frequencies of the monomers are coinciding
with the highest frequency mode of the adsorbed dimers. Note that in the
original figure, reported in ref. 35 and containing only the 3 points
referred to ferrierite, the Li+ and K+ points have been wrongly inverted.
We apologize for this inconvenience. Unpublished figure.

4.3
Interaction of NO with Ni2+ centers
To further illustrate the superior ability of NO as amplifier of
the dp overlap forces, the IR manifestations of NO and CO
adsorbed on the Ni2+centres at the NiO(100) faces can be of
great utility. The chosen system is an highly sintered NiO
polycrystalline sample of high crystalline perfection that is
dominated by regular NiO(100) faces and where steps, corners,
and defect surface sites play a negligible role (see the analogous
of the MgO smoke reported in section 3.3.2). In such a
simplified case, the 5-fold coordinated Ni2+ ions emerging
on (100) faces are characterized by a single coordination
vacancy: consequently only monomeric species can be formed
upon NO and CO contact.417 This has implications on the IR
spectrum which, being due to monocarbonyls and mono-
nitrosylic species only, is very simple and of straight inter-
pretation.
The
relevant
spectral
sequences
obtained
on
NiO(001)/CO and NiO(001)/NO systems are reported in
Fig. 26, as a function of the coverage y. For NO, the adducts
(stable at room temperature) are characterized by a coverage-
dependent 
n(NO) stretching frequency in the 18051799 cm1
range (Fig. 26b). A 
n(NO) value lower than that of NO gas
[
n0(NO) = 1876 cm1] and the stability at RT, imply that dp
overlap contributions must be substantial in the case of the
Ni2+  NO interaction.10
From Fig. 26b it can be inferred that the shift of the 
n(NO)
band of mononitrosyls with respect to the 
n0(NO) is signifi-
cantly red shifted, while the corresponding monocarbonylic
complexes formed on the same sites undergoes a small blue
shift (Fig. 26a). This is the direct consequence of the larger
p-acceptor ability of NO. An intriguing feature of the spectral
sequence of adsorbed NO on NiO(100) face is that the overall
frequency shift D
n = 
n(NO)y-ymax 
n(NO)y-0 is positive. This
never occurred for the CO molecules in all investigated cases,
see Table 2. As D
n = D
nstat+D
ndyn, see eqn (7), and as
D
nstat o 0, while D
ndyn > 0, this implies that D
ndyn > D
nstat
for NO on NiO(100). A high D
ndyn is the consequence
of a strong dipoledipole interaction among adjacent NO
oscillators, that is significantly increased by the increment
of the NO dipolar moment induced by the strong dp
contribution to the Ni2+  NO bond. In effect experiments
with diluted NO isotopic mixtures10 (vide supra section 3.3.1)
have quantified the following shifts: D
n
= +6 cm1,
D
nstat = 26 cm1 and D
ndyn +32 cm1.
In agreement with the above considerations, the molar heat
of adsorption of NO on Ni(100) surfaces in the 0 o y o 0.2
coverage range (81 kJ mol1)509 is much greater than that
obtained for CO on Ni(100) (29 kJ mol1).510 It is worth
noticing that 81 kJ mol1 is very close to what has been found
for NO adsorbed on activated CPO-27-Ni MOFs, for which
parallel measurements gave a qdiff, of 8284 kJ mol1.508 In
that case, at the lowest NO coverages, a band at 1845 cm1,
clearly tailed at lower frequency side, is observed, upon
the formation of Ni2+  NO adducts. The smaller red shift
observed for the adsorbed NO in respect to what found in the
case of NiO(001), indicates that for MOF, p-back-donation
effect is less relevant than s donation and polarization
effects.506
4.4
Interaction of NO with Cu+ and Ag+ centers in ZSM-5
zeolite
The interaction of NO with Ag+ in Ag+-ZSM-5 is weak, as
indicated by the reversible character and the small shift of
n(NO) with respect to NO gas frequency.236,507 The positive
shift D
n(NO) = +8 cm1 is indicative of an interaction with
prevailing electrostatic character and weak contribution of

dp overlap forces. Among all d-metals summarized in Fig. 24,
the Ag+-ZSM-5 and the a-Fe2O3 are the only two cases
showing a Ag+  NO interaction characterized by a D
n(NO)
> 0. Due to this fact the NONO interaction occurs already at
the lowest PNO, originating N2O2 (cis and trans) species
instead of Ag+(NO)2 dinitrosyl on silver sites, see Fig. 27a.
The same is not occurring for Cu+ in Cu+-ZSM-5, see
Fig. 27b.208,215 In fact as the direct Cu+  NO interaction
energy is sufficiently large, Cu+(NO)2 are preferentially
formed upon interaction of NO, and the formation of N2O2
dimers is prevented. The presence of a strong bond in
Cu+  NO complexes is further testified by the irreversible
character of the IR absorption bands upon outgassing and by
the negative shift of the 
n(NO) frequency (D
n = 65 cm1) of
the mononitrosylic complex, that locate the corresponding
triangle in Fig. 24 on the left-hand side of the diagram. This
is indicative of the presence of a relevant dp overlap
interaction.507
Part (c) of Fig. 27 shows evolution of the FTIR spectra
during NO decomposition over Cu+-ZSM-5 catalyst, upon
increasing the temperature from 80 K (cyan spectrum) to
300 K (red spectrum). The main part of Fig. 27c reports the
NO stretching region. The evident decrease of the Cu+(NO)2
doublet is not ascribable to a displacement of the equilibrium
between adsorbed NO and NO in the gas phase having a
thermodynamic origin. In fact this decrease is not accompanied
by the growth of the 1810 cm1 IR absorption band of
Cu+(NO)
adduct
(nearly
absent
in
the
spectra).
On
the contrary, the appearance of a broad adsorption in the
19201880 cm1 range is observed, which is due to the
formation of different complexes of nitric oxide molecules
adsorbed on Cu2+ ions.205,206,208,215 During the temperature
increase the 2NO - O2 + N2 reaction is progressively
switched on, and cuprous ions are oxidized to the cupric state.
By evaluating the intensity of the remaining Cu+(NO)2 bands,
it was inferred that a fraction of 85% of the overall copper has
been oxidized by NO. Coming to the intermediate products
of the NO decomposition process, new bands appear in the
23752215 cm1 region (inset in Fig. 27c). The complex
absorption in the 23752345 cm1 range, with maximum at
2355 cm1, indicates the formation of Cu2+(N2) adducts.208,215
This band is complicated by the presence of co-adsorbed NO+
species,511 formed upon disproportionation of NO. The
relatively stronger absorption in the 22702220 cm1 range
is due to the presence of N2O molecules weakly bonded in the
zeolite channels.196,208,215
4.5
Interaction of NO with Cr2+ ions grafted on silica
As it has been largely documented,16 the Cr6+/SiO2 system
can be fully reduced in CO with exclusive formation of Cr2+
ions anchored to the silica surface.16,302306,512514 On this
system, both CO (see section 3.2.6) and NO have been used
to explore the structure of the Cr2+ sites. For the scope of this
review it is interesting to compare the IR spectra of both
molecules, see Fig. 28.
From Fig. 28 it can be inferred that: (i) While the room
temperatures Cr2+(CO)n (n = 1, 2) carbonyls are absorbing at
frequencies higher than the 
n0(CO) (see section 3.2.6), the
corresponding Cr2+(NO)n (n = 1, 2) nitrosyl surface com-
plexes are absorbing at frequencies lower than 
n0(NO), see the
corresponding point in Fig. 24. (ii) While the Cr2+(CO)n
are reversible upon PCO decrease at RT, the corresponding
nitrosyls are very stable. (iii) The intensity of the n(NO) bands
of the Cr2+(NO)n complexes are more intense with respect to
those of the corresponding Cr2+(CO)n species. All these
observations can be fully explained if the superior p-acceptor
ability of NO is taken into full consideration. In fact an
increased dp interaction has the effect of increasing the
stability, of downward shifting the vibrational frequencies
and to increase the oscillator strength.

and Cu2+  N2 adducts (see inset). Vertical lines in parts (a) and (b) indicate the frequency of the NO molecule in the gas phase:

A completely different picture is emerging when the IR
experiments are performed at liquid nitrogen temperature.
The temperature decrease allows NO to insert a third molecule
resulting in formation of Cr2+(NO)3 complexes, although the
frequency intervals of the NO stretching modes do not
change significantly from what is observed for the Cr2+(NO)2
complexes at 300 K. This is a consequence of the fact that the
Cr2+  NO interaction is already fully operative for the
dinitrosyl complex. On the contrary, as documented in section
3.2.6, the same temperature decrease, accompanied by the
insertion of a third CO molecule, is responsible of the fact
that the CO stretching is greatly downward shifted from
21912179 cm1 to 21252025 cm1. This effect moves the
corresponding the 
n(CO)/
n(NO) points out of the region
reported in Fig. 24.
4.6
Interaction of NO with Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions center in
zeolites
Fe-zeolites (in particular Fe-ZSM5 and Fe-silicalite) are a
family of catalysts where very diluted metal ions appear to
be extremely active in many relevant oxidation reactions
(e.g. methane to methanol and benzene to phenol), a fact
suggesting a comparison with the same ions in enzymes.99 The
active oxygen (named a-oxygen following the definition of
Panov et al.515) ,probably under the atomic form, can derive
from the decomposition of N2O. For this reason, the N2O
decomposition reaction on these catalysts has been widely
studied. The complexity of these systems consists in the large
heterogeneity of iron species, ranging from isolated framework
Fe3+, grafted Fe2+ and Fe3+, clustered FexOy trapped inside
the zeolitic channels and large aggregates of Fe2O3 segregated
outside the zeolitic particles, see the cartoon reported in
Fig. 5a. It is known that the activity of Fe-zeolites increases
with dilution and that the maximum activity per iron atom is
reached for samples containing less than 0.1% by weight of
iron.91 Due to low concentration of the active Fe centres,
extremely sensitive techniques must be designed to explore the
structure and reactivity of surface sites.
The use of the CO probe to explore the exposed Fe2+ and
Fe3+ centres was not very informative because the CO probe
was not able to discriminate between different iron species
present in such a heterogeneous system. Independently on the
thermal and red/ox treatments the low temperature IR spectra
always resulted in a single monocarbonyl band (at 2162 cm1).87
The observed frequency value (higher than that of CO gas) is
indicative of very weak dp interaction, a fact justifying the
low stability of the species.
On the contrary the use of NO as a titrant of the exposed
iron sites resulted of great utility because NO showed excep-
tional affinity towards Fe2+ and Fe3+ centres leading at RT
to the formation of stable Fe3+(NO) and Fe2+(NO)n nitrosyls
(n = 1, 2, 3) characterized by extremely intense n(NO)
bands.99,8791,516533 The frequency of the IR bands due to
nitrosyls formed on Fe2+ sites is lower than that of NO gas, in
agreement with the greater p acceptor ability of NO with
respect to CO. Also, the stability and the high intensity of the
IR bands is the direct consequence of the increased p-acceptor
ability. When compared with IR data obtained for nitrosyls
formed on homogeneous complexes (Fig. 29a), these bands
give precious information about the oxidation and coordi-
nation state of the adsorbing centres.
A demonstration of the utility of NO to probe extremely
diluted Fe2+ centres, is illustrated in Fig. 30, where the spectra
of adsorbed NO on Fe-ZSM-5 samples with iron content in
the 3.300.08% interval are reported after normalization on
the overall iron species crossed by the IR beam. It can be seen
that the IR spectra of NO on samples containing less than
0.1% Fe (Fig. 30c) can be clearly detected with a good
signal/noise quality. The results illustrated in Fig. 30 are not
only showing that the concentration of isolated and low
coordinated Fe2+ sites reach their relative maximum concen-
tration at lowest iron loading, but also that on more concen-
trated samples the vast majority of iron is not probed by NO.
This result is clearly demonstrating that iron is in aggregated
form (plausibly a-Fe2O3 particles exposing a negligible fraction
of low coordinated sites, see cartoon in Fig. 5a). In high Fe
loaded samples, this dominant fraction of iron, not interacting
with reactants, is obviously catalytically inactive.

The interaction of NO with adsorbed oxygen on Fe-ZSM-
5: Formation of adsorbed NO+
As briefly mentioned in the previous paragraph, Fe-ZSM5 and
Fe-silicalite are good partial oxidation catalysts and the active
oxygen species is thought to be in form of atomic oxygen (a-
oxygen)515 adsorbed on low coordinated iron centres as
(Fe

Following eqn (10)(13), NO reacts with oxygen with
formation of NO2 and Fe2+. In presence of excess NO, the
Fe2+ species form readily Fe2+(NO)n (n = 1,2,3) species
characterized by the usual IR spectrum already illustrated for
the sample not containing adsorbed oxygen (Fig. 29b and 30).
The formed NO2 dimerize into N2O4, that is in equilibrium
with NO+ + NO3
. Then the NO+ fragment originates a fast
exchange reaction with the protonic sites of the H-ZSM-5
framework with formation of NO+ species anchored to the
framework as charge balancing cation, in place of H+. The
anchored NO+ species is responsible for the 2130 cm1 band
clearly observable in spectrum b of Fig. 31. The correctness of
the assignment is proved by the IR spectrum obtained upon
direct dosage of NO2 on a sample not containing adsorbed
oxygen.7,534

Adsorbed NO and N2O2
n (n = 1,2) dimers on ionic
surfaces
On the basis of a critical review of the literature on the IR
spectroscopy of adsorbed NO and N2O2
n (n = 1, 2) dimers,
it can be concluded that the most convincing results have been
obtained for NO adsorbed at low temperature (77 K) on KCl
containing V and F centres.504 On the same system, dosage of CO
at 77 K resulted in the formation of CO+ (
n(CO+) = 2240 cm1)
and CO (
n(CO) = 1250 cm1) along with (C2O2)2
(IR absorption bands at 15351264 cm1). The former species
are very unstable and disappear when the sample temperature
reaches 300 K. As mentioned above the formation of these
species is the result of direct electron donation to V centres or
electron abstraction from a F centre. Samples not containing
sufficient concentration of these surface defects do not originate
nor NO neither CO charged species. No similar IR results
have been obtained on oxidic surfaces containing F centres.
Only the ESR spectra of unstable CO and C2O2
 has been
reported at 77 K for electron rich magnesium oxide doped
with metallic magnesium or with alkali metals.505

of the above mentioned results and of the comparison with
analogous results obtained by using CO as probe, we think
that this assignment must be revised and that the bands
assigned to N2O2
2 can be assigned with more confidence to
N2O3

2NO + O2 - N2O3

where the involved O2 ions are located on corners and edges
of MgO and MgONiO solid solutions and are highly
coordinatively unsaturated. This reaction scheme is similar
to that of CO on the same system
2CO + O2 - C2O3
2
(15)
which has been fully documented in several papers reviewed in
ref. 14. The IR spectrum of NO adsorbed on MgONiO solid
solutions, where the 5-fold coordinated Ni 2+ ions emerging
on (100) faces are the dominant species, is also useful because
it allows to confirm the conclusions obtained for NO on NiO.
In fact a single band is observed at 1800 cm1 which can be
readily assigned to Ni2+  NO complexes.
5.
Ethylene
The properties of ethylene are mainly determined by the
presence of pp*orbitals, which control the interaction of
the molecule with different surface sites. The full p orbitals
efficiently act as centres having Lewis-base character and,
consequently, they can interact with acid centres with formation
of acidbase adducts. In the following, a case system illustrating
this situation will be illustrated, showing that the final con-
sequence of this interaction is an acid catalyzed polymerisation
process. On the other hand, when ethylene interacts with a
transition metal centre, the pp* system of orbitals becomes
operative as a whole. The interaction of olefins with a transition
metal centre and metal surfaces has been extensively studied in
the past. The metalolefin p-bond is in general described
following the mechanism of Chatt-Dewar-Ducanson537 involving
electron donation from the olefin p molecular orbital to the
metal d empty orbitals and synergic electron back-donation
from the metal to the olefin p* molecular orbital. This inter-
action can lead to formation of stable organometallic com-
plexes (of which representative examples are the Zeise salts),538
characterized by C
Q
C double bond elongation with respect to
the free molecule. In some cases, a consequence of this
activation can be a polymerization reaction, with formation
of high molecular weight polyethylene. In the second part of
this chapter, interaction of ethylene with chromium centres
(both in +3 and +2 oxidation states) will be discussed,
following evolution of the FT-IR spectra from the formation
of Cr-ethylene complexes to ethylene polymerization.
The case studies discussed below are among the best examples
to show the potentiality of time- (and sometimes temperature-)
resolved FT-IR spectroscopy in the detection of reaction
intermediates during fast catalytic reactions.20 Oligomeri-
zation and polymerization of ethylene, in fact, are extremely
fast reactions, where the single insertion event can take place
in a time interval which is very close to the detection limit of
the technique. It will be demonstrated that, by changing the
experimental conditions in a proper way, it is possible to
freeze precursors and intermediate species, even when their
amount is low in comparison with spectator species, thus
allowing, in some cases, the identification of the reaction
mechanism.

bonded precursors, protonation and oligomerization

inside
H-ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated by time-resolved FT-IR
spectroscopy.539 As the FT-IR spectra of the H-ZSM-5/C2H4
system evolves with time, it is useful to describe the whole
set of experimental data in two sub-chapters. In section 5.1.1,
the spectra obtained immediately after dosage of two different
amounts of ethylene (and for a total contact time not
exceeding 10 s) are considered, with the aim of elucidating
the structure of the primary interaction products (precursors).
In section 5.1.2, the sequence of spectra recorded at 6.8 s
intervals for a total contact time of ca. 1.5 min is reported and
discussed. This sequence is expected to give information on the
first stages of oligomerization and on the structure of the
shortest oligomers.
5.1.1
Formation of H-bonded precursors. Inside H-ZSM-5
several sites having a Brnsted acid character are present:540543
(a) silanols (IR absorption band at 3750 cm1), which
are characterized by a very low acid strength; (b) bridged
RSiOHAlR species (species I in Fig. 32), giving absorption
at 3609 cm1 and characterized by an acid strength approaching
that of super-acids; (c) OH species (species II in Fig. 32)
involving a partially extra-framework aluminium, responsible
of an IR absorption band at 3645 cm1 and characterized by
acid strength lower than that of the above mentioned species.
Upon interaction with ethylene at room temperature, the IR
absorption bands assigned to species I and II shifted to lower
frequency, as shown in Fig. 32. The amount of perturbed OH
species is a function of ethylene pressure. The large D
n(OH)
shift (close to 400 cm1 for species I and to 300 cm1 for
species II) is a clear indication of hydrogen bonding pertur-
bation. Simultaneously, also the vibrational modes of adsorbed
ethylene are perturbed with respect to those of the gas phase,
as summarized in Table 4. In particular, owing to the reduced
symmetry of adsorbed ethylene molecule and the reduced
density of charge of the C
Q
C double bond, structures I and
II account for the IR activation and for the small downward
shift of the n(C
Q
C) mode. Both, the shift to low frequency of
the OH stretching bands and the perturbation of the vibra-
tional modes of adsorbed ethylene (shown in the inset of
Fig. 32) can be easily explained on the basis of the formation
of a 1 : 1 p complex,539 as schematically depicted in Fig. 32,
characterized by a weakening of the C
Q
C bond (activation).
Note that, under the temperature and pressure conditions
adopted here, no formation of hydrogen-bonded complexes
with the very weakly acidic silanols (responsible for the band
at 3746 cm1) is observed. This type of species is found only by
lowering the temperature or by increasing the gas pressure
(as it will be discussed for ethylene interacting with silica,
see section 5.3).

5.1.2
Ethylene protonation and formation of oligomers.
Activation of the ethylene C
Q
C double bond on the Brnsted
sites of H-ZSM-5 is followed by a rapid protonation, as
testified by the evolution of the FT-IR spectra of the
H-ZSM-5/C2H4 system at longer contact time, shown in
Fig. 33. The gradual appearance of the characteristic bands
due to the vibrational modes of saturated CH3 (green colour)
and CH2 (orange color) groups is a clear indication that a
protonation and an oligomerization process occur,539 following
the scheme depicted in Fig. 33c.539 In particular, the IR
absorption bands at 2960 and 2876 cm1 (nasym(CH3) and
nsym(CH3)) and at 1460 and 1382 cm1 (dasym(CH3) and
dsym(CH3)), are characteristic of the terminal methyl group,
whereas the IR absorption bands at 2940 and 2866 cm1
(nasym(CH2) and nsym(CH2)) and at 1469 and 1442 cm1
(dasym(CH2) and dsym(CH2)), are characteristic of the methylenic
groups of the growing chains. It is evident that, as the
oligomerization proceeds, the relative intensity ratio of
the CH3 and CH2 characteristic bands changes in favour to
the CH2 ones. A closer inspection to the spectra reported in
Fig. 33 allowed Spoto et al.539 to advance some hypothesis on
the structure of the cationic products formed inside the zeolite
channels. It was concluded that the spectra recorded within the
first 30 s (spectra 25) are mainly attributed to linear
+CH2CH3 monomeric and +CH2(CH2)2CH3 dimeric species.
For longer contact times (spectra from 5 to 19), chain
propagation (indicated by the growth of all the bands
characterizing CH2 groups) was accompanied by branching
(indicated by the growth of the CH3 absorptions). The chain
length of the oligomers nearly corresponds to the linear free
space available between two channel intersections of the two-
dimensional pore system of H-ZSM-5; this observation is
attributed to the fact that the growth of the chains is stopped
at the channel intersection because they encounter either
oligomers, either growing or dead species.
At room temperature the ethylene oligomerization rate is
sufficiently low to be monitored by time-resolved FT-IR. The
hydrogen bonded species, characterized by weakened C
Q
C
double bond, is the essential precursor of the whole process.
That this is the case demonstrated by a similar experiment
conducted on the propene/mordenite system, where acid sites
having an acidity similar to that shown by the H-ZSM-5
system are present in the channels.545 Due to the inductive
effect of the methyl group, the electron density (and the
basicity) of the p orbitals in the propene molecule is larger
than in ethylene; as a consequence, the strength of interaction
of propene with the acid sites is greater than that of ethylene.
This had two main consequences: (a) the hydrogen bonding
interaction is stronger, as testified by greater shift shown by
the 
n(OH) band (ca. 500 cm1) and (b) the oligomerization
reaction is much faster (the zeolite channels were completely
filled by the oligomers in less than 5 s).545
5.2
Ethylene interaction with a transition metal site: Cr3+
sites at the surface of a-Cr2O3
The vibrational spectroscopy of metal-bonded olefins has
produced an abundant literature concerning metals-olefin
systems in low temperature matrices, in which the metals are
in the zerovalent state.546548 In contrast, only few vibrational
data are present in the literature concerning the interaction of
olefins with charged metal species.549551 Herein, we chose to
describe interaction of ethylene with isolated chromium cations,
since this offers the opportunity to show the important role
played by FT-IR spectroscopy in the detection of intermediate
species and in the understanding of ethylene polymerization

mechanism. It is important to observe that, in presence of a
chromium cation, the mechanism of ethylene polymerization
is different than that discussed above and catalyzed by
Brnsted acid sites. However, also in this case the first step
of the reaction involves formation of a molecular complex
(activated ethylene molecule), which is then transformed into a
more strongly adsorbed species playing a role in the initiation
steps of the polymerization reaction.
5.2.1
Formation of precursors Cr3+-ethylene complexes.
High surface area a-Cr2O3, such as many other chromium-
containing oxides (such as Cr/Al2O3 or Cr/SiO2, see below) is
quite effective in ethylene polymerization at room tempera-
ture. Scarano et al.544 performed a detailed time-resolved
FT-IR investigation aimed at the understanding of the inter-
action of C2H4 with structurally well-defined Cr3+ centres
located on low-index faces of a-Cr2O3. Fig. 34 shows time-
resolved spectra collected every 10 s during ethylene polymeri-
zation on a stoichiometric a-Cr2O3 sample, for a total contact
time of 30 min. As already done in the previous cases,
the initial spectrum will be discussed first, since it contains
information on the molecularly adsorbed ethylene. In a second
time, the evolution of the FT-IR spectra will be discussed,
which is associated with the formation of the polymeric chains.
As the 5-fold Cr3+ ions are the most abundant, we shall
assume, for simplicity, that the initial spectrum is essentially
dominated by the bands of the ethylene molecule adsorbed on
a single type of site.544 Formation of a Cr3+C2H4 complex is
testified by the appearance of characteristic bands of adsorbed
ethylene (red colour in Fig. 34, and Table 4), which strongly
resemble those of homogeneous complexes, where ethylene is
coordinated to positively charged transition metal centres
(electron-withdrawing centres) through a p bond perpendicular
to the plane of ethylene. As in that case, both the n(C
Q
C) and
the n(C
Q
C) + d(CH2) vibrational modes, which are IR
inactive and are responsible for the two Raman lines at 1623
and 1342 cm1, become IR active due to the reduced symmetry
of the molecule, giving rise to two weak bands at 1598 and
1336 cm1 (see Table 4). It is worth noticing that the shift of all
the vibrational modes of adsorbed ethylene is greater for the
Cr3+C2H4
complexes
than
for
the
hydrogen
bonded
OHC2H4 complexes discussed in the previous chapter. In
particular, n(C

that the molecule is strongly activated.

slowly takes place on stoichiometric a-Cr2O3, but it was
inferred that the reaction occurred only on a few, defective,
Cr2+ sites formed during the activation at high temperature in
the presence of hydrocarbon impurities and presumably
located on high-index faces, edges, and steps. Indeed, the
polymerization activity of reduced a-Cr2O3 samples (containing
Cr2+ sites embedded in a surface layer of Cr3+ centres) is
definitely greater than that of stoichiometric samples. This
suggests that a highly coordinatively unsaturated state is a
necessary prerequisite for the polymerization activity of Crx+
centres, as it will be discussed in the following chapter,
concerning ethylene polymerization on Cr/SiO2.
Nevertheless, the FT-IR spectra of the growing polymeric
chains on a-Cr2O3 merit a short comment. The formation of the
polymer, already in the first stages of the reaction, is evidenced
by the appearance of a pair of bands at 29242918 and
2851 cm1, growing with time in a parallel way at nearly con-
stant rates. As already discussed in the previous chapter, these
bands are assigned to in-phase and out-of phase stretching
vibrations of CH2 groups, belonging to the growing polymeric
chains. Two observations are relevant for the following discussion.
(i) The IR absorption bands assigned to nasym(CH2) and
nsym(CH2) are located at lower frequency with respect to those
observed during ethylene oligomerization on H-ZSM-5. This
behaviour can be explained in terms of length of the poly-
ethylene chains. Previous FT-IR studies552559 have shown
that the CH2 stretching frequencies (in both the symmetric
and antisymmetric modes) are sensitive indicators of lateral
interactions between long n-alkyl and PE chains and also
provide a qualitative indication of the conformational disorder.
A shift toward higher wavenumbers indicates an increased
conformational disorder. Values at lower frequency will be
found in the case of polyethylene formed on the Cr/SiO2
Phillips catalyst. (ii) Starting from the few reduced sites, the
polymer chains grow and spread out on the flat a-Cr2O3
surfaces and tend to gradually cover the whole microcrystal.
The FT-IR spectrum collected at longer polymerization time
(dashed curve in Fig. 34) demonstrated that the CH2 groups of
the polyethylene chains interact with the Cr3+ centres of the
flat surfaces. In fact, anomalous low-frequency bands in both
the CH2 stretching and bending regions (labelled with an
asterisk)
demonstrate
agostic-type
interactions
between
CH2 groups and Cr3+ sites.16 This weak agostic interaction
is destroyed by CO, because CO is able to displace the CH2
groups from the Cr3+ centres (data not shown).

Ethylene interaction with a transition metal site: Cr2+
sites on the Phillips catalyst
The interaction of ethylene with isolated Cr2+ sites at the
surface of amorphous silica has been the subject of many
investigation since decades,16,292,294 for two main reasons.
First, Cr/SiO2 (the Phillips catalyst) has a great industrial
importance, since it accounts for more than 50% of all the
High Density Polyethylene produced in the world; second,292,294
Cr/SiO2 has been considered for long time as a model catalyst
to test the ability of different spectroscopic techniques in
determining the structural, electronic, and vibrational proper-
ties of isolated Cr(II) sites.16,293 For the purpose of this work, it
is interesting to resume here the main results obtained by

applying FT-IR spectroscopy in the identification of ethylene
polymerization mechanism.
The Phillips catalyst, in contrast to Ziegler and metallocene
catalysts, is the only olefin polymerization catalyst where the
active sites do not contain an initial alkyl ligand from which to
grow the first polymer chain.16,294 Consequently, the polymeri-
zation mechanism operating on the Phillips catalyst requires
several additional and yet ill-defined steps that must precede
polymerization itself, in order to transform the Cr(II) precursors
into the real active sites. However, investigation of these first
reaction steps is not an easy task for two main reasons: (i) only
a fraction of the Cr(II) sites are really active in ethylene
polymerization;560 and (ii) at room temperature, ethylene
coordination to the Cr(II) centres is rapidly followed by a very
fast polymerization reaction.16 By decreasing the ethylene
polymerization rate several authors reported the appearance,
in the first stages of the reaction, of few IR absorption bands
assigned to Cr(II)C2H4 complexes.561,562 However, in these
conditions the monomer concentration rapidly decreases and
the vibrational features of the polymeric products overcome
those of the C2H4 complexes, so that the very weak manifesta-
tion of the ethylene p-complexes have a transient character.
It is thus evident that, to clearly observe C2H4 molecular
complexes under stationary conditions polymerization must
be avoided. For this reason, the study of the Cr(II)C2H4
complexes and of the deriving intermediate species has been
achieved only recently, by lowering the temperature down to a
value where kT is lower than the activation barrier of the first
step of the polymerization.20,26,27,157,563
A sequence of temperature- and pressure-resolved FT-IR
spectra of Cr(II)/SiO2 sample upon C2H4 adsorption and
reaction are reported in Fig. 35. As during the experi-
ment both temperature and pressure are changing simul-
taneously with time, it is useful to discuss the evolution of
the spectra in two subsequent time (and temperaturepressure)
intervals.
5.3.1
Formation of Cr2+-ethylene complexes. At 100 K all
the monomer molecules are adsorbed on the metallic part of
the cell. In the 100250 K range (light grey spectra in Fig. 35),
ethylene progressively vaporizes and originates an equilibrium
pressure of about 15 Torr. Under these conditions ethylene is
adsorbed on both, silanols and on the Cr(II) sites. However,
since the silanols are by far the most abundant species, the
spectra are dominated by the vibrational manifestations of
the SiOHC2H4 complexes, which overshadow the weaker
manifestation of the significantly less abundant Cr(II)ethylene
complexes.20,157,563
These
spectra
can
be
directly
com-
pared with those discussed in section 5.1.1: the shift to low
frequency of the OH stretching bands and the perturba-
tion of the vibrational modes of adsorbed ethylene are smaller
with respect to those observed for ethylene p-complexes
formed at room temperature on the Brnsted sites of
H-ZSM-5, in agreement with the lower acidity of the silanol
groups.
At about 250 K, the interaction of ethylene with silanols
becomes negligible, but the temperature is still too low to
allow polymerization to start. These are the best conditions to
observe the Cr(II)ethylene p-adducts, which can later originate
the polymeric products.20,157,563 The vibrational properties of
the Cr(II)ethylene adducts are resumed in Table 4, and
compared to those of the complexes formed on a-Cr2O3. It
is worth noticing that the shift of the n(C
Q
C) vibrational
mode with respect to the gas phase (Raman value) is the
largest reported in the table (33 cm1), testifying that the
molecule is strongly activated. However, we are not able at this
point to distinguish between spectator and really active sites.
5.3.2
Ethylene polymerization on the Cr2+ sites at the
Cr2+/SiO2 surface. Finally, when the temperature is allowed
to grow from about 250 to 300 K, the polymerization reaction
slowly takes place (sequence of black curves in Fig. 35), as
evidenced by the growth of two IR absorption bands at 2925
and 2855 cm1, due to the nasym(CH2) and nsym(CH2) vibra-
tional modes of the polymeric chains. In addition to these
bands, two weak bands at 2931 and 2860 cm1 are also evident
at short polymerization times. These bands, already reported
by Bordiga et al.,562 have been recently explained in terms of
nasym(CH2) and nsym(CH2) vibrational modes of precursor
species having a metallacycle structure, which are charac-
terized by a structural strain decreasing with increasing ring
dimension.563
5.3.3
Ethylene polymerization on the Cr2+ sites at the
Cr2+/SiO2 surface: Observation of reaction intermediates. In
order to get more insight into the ethylene polymerization
mechanism on the Phillips catalyst, ethylene polymerization
reaction was further slowed down, not only by working at low
temperature, but also by working in presence of CO as a
poison.563 The sequence of FT-IR spectra displayed in Fig. 36

Temperature-, time- and pressure-resolved C2H4 polymeri-
zation on the Cr(II)/SiO2 catalyst in the 100300 K range, in the OH
and CH stretching regions. Dotted spectrum refers to the sample at
ca. 100 K before interaction with ethylene. Light grey spectra are
dominated by ethylene physisorption. Grey spectra correspond to the
gradual disappearance of the IR absorption bands due to SiOHethylene
complexes, in absence of polymerization. Black spectra monitor the
polymerization reaction. The bold black spectrum corresponds to a
polymerization time of about 10 min. Figure reproduced with permission

corresponds to those discussed in Fig. 35, but in the presence
of a small amount of CO. Only the 30502800 cm1 region is
shown, in order to better identify the IR absorption bands
associated with intermediate species. The few bands evidenced
in Fig. 35, which are observed also in absence of CO poison
(although much lower in intensity) have been assigned to
small, strained, metallacycle intermediate species. This time-,
temperature-, and pressure-resolved FT-IR experiment allowed
us to conclude that the initiation of ethylene polymerization
on the Phillips catalyst follows a metallacycle route,563 thus
clarifying a question that was remained open since 1950 to
now. It is worth mentioning that the metallacycle mechanism
was shown to occur for several ethylene trimerization and
tetramerization catalysts.564568 and for homogeneous Cr
catalysts.569,570 For these systems, both the oxidative coupling
of the first two ethylene molecules to form the metallacyclo-
pentane intermediate567 and the insertion of an additional
ethylene into the metallacyclopentane species571,572 have been
claimed to constitute the rate-determining step.
