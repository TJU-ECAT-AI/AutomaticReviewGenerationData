Focusing on size-selected gold clusters consisting of up to 20 atoms, that is, in the size regime where properties cannot be
obtained from those of the bulk material through scaling considerations, we discuss the current state of understanding pertaining to
various factors that control the reactivity and catalytic activity of such nanostructures, using the CO oxidation reaction catalyzed
by the gold nanoclusters adsorbed on MgO as a paradigm. These factors include the role of the metal-oxide support and its defects,
the charge state of the cluster, structural ﬂuxionality of the clusters, electronic size effects, the effect of an underlying metal support
on the dimensionality, charging and chemical reactivity of gold nanoclusters adsorbed on the metal-supported metal-oxide, and the
promotional effect of water. We show that through joined experimental and ﬁrst-principles quantum mechanical calculations and
simulations, a detailed picture of the reaction mechanism emerges.

1. Introduction
Characterization
and
elucidation
of
the
size-
dependent evolution of the physical and chemical
properties of ﬁnite materials aggregates, having discrete
quantized energy level spectra, speciﬁc structural and
morphological motifs and exhibiting unique dynamical
characteristics, are among the outstanding challenges of
modern materials science. Indeed, investigations of the
unique properties of ﬁnite materials aggregates, and
studies aiming at gaining deep insights into the devel-
opment of materials characteristics from the molecular
and cluster regimes to the bulk phase, are major themes
of current interdisciplinary basic and applied research
endeavors. In many instances, it is found that for larger
materials aggregates the deviations of the properties
from the bulk limit scales with the size of the aggregate.
However, in many cases, at suﬃciently small sizes,
which most often lie in the nanoscale regime, the
dependence of the material’s property on size becomes
non-scalable, and then small becomes diﬀerent in an
essential way, where the physical and chemical proper-
ties become emergent in nature, that is, they can no
longer be deduced or extrapolated from those known for
larger sizes [1].
Nanocatalysis is one of the most exciting subﬁelds of
nanoscience. Unlike the common practice in catalysis
where the catalytic performance scales with the surface
to volume ratio of the dispersed catalytic agent, nano-
catalysts are distinguished by their unique and non-
scalable properties that originate from the highly
reduced dimensions of the active catalytic aggregates.
Consequently, the central aim of nanocatalysis is the
promotion,
enhancement,
steering
and
control
of
chemical reactions by changing the size, dimensionality,
chemical composition, morphology, or charge state of
the catalyst or the reaction center, and/or by changing
the kinetics through nanopatterning of the catalytic
reaction
centers.
Since
the
aforementioned
size-
dependent
non-scalable,
and
often
non-monotonic,
evolution of materials’ properties may occur when at
least one of the material’s dimensions is reduced to the
nanoscale, nanocatalytic systems may appear as ultra-
thin ﬁlms, nanowires or clusters. For these systems the
chemical and physical properties are often controlled by
quantum size eﬀects and they present new opportunities
for an atom-by-atom design, tuning and control of
chemical activity, speciﬁcity, and selectivity [2].
With the focus of this article being on gold nano-
catalysts, we recall ﬁrst the common experience that
in bulk form gold is the noblest of all metals [3–5].
Consequently it has not been considered till quite
recently as a possible catalyst. The chemical inertness of
gold is reﬂected in the low adsorption energy of gases
participating in a number of catalytic reactions of
interest and the lack of activation, and/or high dissoci-
ation barriers, of the weakly adsorbed molecules [3].
Additionally, the low melting point of gold hampers the
preparation of nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm in
diameter [6], which is of importance for maximizing the
active surface area of a catalyst.
First results which indicated that small gold particles
may act as catalysts were reported in the early 1970s
[7,8]. Subsequent work [6,9,10] highlighted the exciting

catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles and described
methods for the preparation of approximately hemi-
spherical gold particles on selected metal oxides. These
studies have shown that gold nanoparticles may exhibit
high catalytic activity for various reactions, including
CO oxidation and propylene epoxidation. Moreover, it
has been demonstrated that Au nanoparticles catalyze
some reactions already at rather low temperatures [9]
(with CO oxidation reported at temperatures as low as
200 K), thus making them interesting for a series of
room temperature applications; for comprehensive lists
of applications of gold nanocatalysts see refs. [4,9–15].
Understanding the emergent chemical activity of
nanoscale gold particles poses a particularly complex
challenge in light of the aforementioned inert nature of
this metal in the bulk form. It is therefore not surprising
that certain attempts to explain some of the more recent
observation about Au nanocatalysis through the use of
methodologies developed in the course of investigations
of the catalytic activity of other noble metals (e.g. Pt), did
not lead to conclusive results and/or were not supported
by further experiments. Thus for example in early papers
a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism was assumed for
the Au-catalyzed CO oxidation reaction, involving the
dissociation of oxygen molecules on the Au catalyst [16],
as is the case for platinum group metals. The catalytic
activity of gold nanoparticles was thus explained by an
increased heat of adsorption of oxygen atoms, produced
by a hot ﬁlament on gold nanoparticles, compared to
bulk gold [16,17]. However, it has been discovered
through ﬁrst-principles calculations [18–20] (see below)
that independent of the substrate, oxygen adsorbs
molecularly (without formation of a dissociated inter-
mediate state) on Au nanoclusters supported on metal
oxide, forming activated partially charged species (su-
peroxo- or peroxo-like species) which react with CO to
form CO2 [18–20]. This prediction has been subsequently
supported by experiments showing that on reactive Au
particles after adsorbing oxygen and pumping of the
oxygen in the chamber, no adsorbed oxygen can be
anymore titrated by CO pulses, thus demonstrating the
absence of dissociative adsorption of oxygen [21]. In fact,
it seems that the relatively weak adsorption energy of
oxygen on gold and the formation of ‘‘activated’’ oxygen
molecules, are among the key features underlying the low
temperature nanocatalytic activity of gold.
While signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in the
past several years toward fundamental understanding
of the materials and operational factors that govern
the catalytic activity of gold nanostructures, much
remains to be learned. This subject is complicated by
the convergence of a number of interdependent factors
that can inﬂuence and vary the reactivity and reaction
pathways, including the identity and nature of the
support surface, the preparation procedures used and
the ambient conditions (e.g. humidity). In their review,
Bond and Thompson [15] summarized as consensual
observations that: (i) oxide-supported small gold par-
ticles show highest reactivity at sizes of about 2–3 nm,
whereas unsupported gold particles are weakly active
at best; and (ii) the choice of support, the method of
preparation and the pretreatment before use, are very
important
factors
controlling
the
reactivity.
These
authors also discussed a possible mechanism involving
reaction at the edge of a particle involving the sup-
port, thus emphasizing the importance of the perime-
ter interface. Haruta concluded, along similar lines,
that the performance of Au nanoparticles is deﬁned by
three major factors, the contact structure to the oxide
support, the nature of the support and the particle
size,
with
the
contact
structure
being
the
most
important factor [6]. The proposed perimeter model
implies direct involvement of the support in the CO
oxidation reaction [22]. Furthermore, an enhancement
of the catalytic activity of small gold particles due to
moisture was reported [23,24]. This is particularly
relevant for applications at ambient conditions, since
commonly the presence of moisture is found to be
detrimental
or
non-beneﬁcial
to
their
activity.
In
contrast to the above perimeter model Goodman et al.
concluded on the basis of investigations involving a
bilayer gold model catalyst supported on titania that
the role of the TiOx support is mainly that of a dis-
persant and a promoter [14,25]. As we discuss below
the special role of the adsorbed peripheral interface
between the gold nanostructure and the supporting
metal-oxide
emerges
also
from
recent
theoretical
studies. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the
adsorption propensity of O2 to ﬁnite size Au particles
is
increased,
particularly
at
low-coordinated
sites
[18–20,26–30].
The
importance
of
low-coordinated
sites is in line with experimental work on supported
gold model catalysts that emphasized the inﬂuence of
highly uncoordinated gold atoms on the CO adsorp-
tion properties [31–33].
It is evident from the above brief remarks that the
juxtaposition of diﬀerent preparation procedures, vari-
ous pretreatment conditions and supports, often poorly
characterized
catalytic
particles
(e.g.,
essentially
unknown size, morphology and/or structure), and the
strong inﬂuence of these factors on the reaction out-
come, are not conducive to the development of a com-
prehensive picture of the interaction processes and
reaction mechanisms that underlie gold nanocatalysis.
Aiming at disentangling the factors controlling the
reactivity of gold and wishing to gain insights into the
microscopic origins of the size-dependent reactivity of
gold in the nanoscale regime, we believe that further
progress can be achieved through investigations of well-
deﬁned model systems. Consequently in this brief
review, we summarize our experimental and ﬁrst-prin-
ciples theoretical endeavors focusing on the CO oxida-
tion reaction catalyzed by size-selected gold particles
supported on thin metal-oxide ﬁlms. The size of the

146
particles which we explore is up to 1 nm in diameter,
that is, the size regime in which the electronic, and
thus catalytic, properties of the particles cannot be
deduced
from
the
bulk
behavior
through
scaling
considerations.
2. The size-dependent reactivity of supported Aun clusters
Aun clusters were produced by a laser vaporization
source [34,35], size-selected in a quadrupole mass spec-
trometer
and
deposited
with
low
kinetic
energy
(<0.2 eV/atom, i.e. softlanding) on thin oxide ﬁlms
[36,37]. A concern that arises when using free clusters to
prepare monodispersed cluster materials is the fate of
the deposited cluster during and after deposition. In
addition to molecular dynamics simulations [38–41],
several experiments, such as STM investigations [42,43],
or absorption spectroscopy of clusters embedded in a
rare gas matrix have been performed, which demon-
strate that soft landing of clusters is possible [44]. Also,
the studies of the chemical reactivity of supported
clusters using pulsed molecular beams show evidence of
stability of the samples [45]. Recently, we were able to
provide strong evidence in support of the monodisper-
sity of the deposited clusters by using cavity ringdown
spectroscopy [46]. In these experiments each gold cluster
with up to 20 atoms shows a distinct optical response
in the visible photon energy range. In addition, by
comparing the optical response of SiO2-supported Au1
and Au2 (ﬁgure 1) only an extremely weak atomic fea-
ture in the Au2-spectrum is observed, indicating that
post-deposition
fragmentation
is
less
than
5%.
Furthermore, the spectrum of Au1 does not reveal any
feature of the dimer or larger clusters, indicating that
aggregation can be excluded.
Supported, small gold clusters have mainly been
deposited on thin MgO(100) ﬁlms. These thin ﬁlms can
be prepared either as defect-rich ﬁlms, characterized by
a given density (5% ML) of extended defects and point
defects (F-centers), or as defect-poor ﬁlms with a neg-
ligible density of F-centers [18,47]. The oxidation reac-
tion of CO was studied by a combination of temperature
programmed reaction (TPR) and Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In these experiments,
isotopically labeled 18O2 and 13CO molecules were used
and the catalytic oxidation of CO involving oxygen
atoms from the MgO substrate could be excluded, since
only the
13C16O18O isotopomer was detected. Both
defect-poor as well as defect-rich bare MgO ﬁlms, are
inert for CO oxidation [18].
As illustrated in ﬁgure 2, gold clusters with up to
seven atoms are inert for CO oxidation on defect-rich
MgO and the smallest size for which the low tempera-
ture (T < 250 K) combustion was detected is Au8. For
larger sizes a distinct size dependence has been observed
(ﬁgure 2(a)), with roughly two temperature regions for
CO oxidation: T < 250 K and T > 250 K, which can be
associated with diﬀerent reaction mechanisms (see
below). As expected, gold ﬁlms are inert for CO oxida-
tion. By integrating the total area in the mass spectra,
the total number of CO2 molecules formed per cluster
can be plotted vs. the number of atoms per cluster
(ﬁgure 2(b)). No linear dependence of the reactivity as
a function of size can be observed indicating clearly
Figure 1. Shown are the measured optical responses of Au1 and Au2 deposited on amorphous SiO2. Note that in the Au1 spectrum no features of
Au2 are observed, indicating that coalescence can be excluded. In the spectrum of Au2 a very weak optical response is observed just below 2.5 eV,
which might originate from gold atoms. If this feature is attributed to single Au atoms then the fragmentation of Au2 upon deposition is less than
5%. Note that in this energy range also a small feature of Au2 is predicted by ab-initio calculation. Both spectra have been measured by cavity
ring-down spectroscopy.

that the number of reactive sites diﬀers for each cluster
size.
3. The reaction mechanism
Turning our attention to the reaction mechanism, for
the CO oxidation reaction on gold clusters supported on
MgO ﬁlms, two main characteristics are notable. The
TPR spectra shown in ﬁgure 3, were obtained for the
CO oxidation reaction catalyzed by Au8 clusters sup-
ported on defect-poor and defect-rich MgO ﬁlms. These
spectra show ﬁrst that the reactivity is strongly depen-
dent on the number of defects on the support (see
below). Secondly, for reactive gold clusters (see also
ﬁgure 2), two temperature ranges may be distinguished,
i.e. roughly T < 250 K and T > 250 K. Concerning the
two temperature ranges, two diﬀerent reaction pathways
may contribute to the oxidation of CO. We note here
that due to the reaction conditions [18] peaks in the TPR
spectra may be associated with Langmuir-Hinshelwood
(LH)
reaction
mechanisms.
Indeed,
two
diﬀerent
LH-type mechanisms were predicted by ﬁrst-principles
simulations of the reaction [18]. With the observed
formation of CO2 at 140 K (ﬁgure 4(a–c)), we associate
a reaction where the two reactants are co-adsorbed
initially on the triangular top facet of the Au8, hence the
name LHt mechanism. The distance between the carbon
atom and one of the peroxo oxygens in this local
minimum energy state is equal to d(CO1) = 3.11 A
˚ .
Through mapping of the potential energy surface along
the C–O1 reaction coordinate, a rather low energy
barrier
DEb
(LHt) = 0.1 eV
occurring
at
d(CO1)  2.0 A
˚
was determined for the LHt oxidation
channel, with the end product being a weakly adsorbed
carbon dioxide molecule (0.2 eV). The LHt low-tem-
perature oxidation mechanism was found by these the-
oretical studies (with similar energetics), for reactions on
the gold cluster deposited on either a defect-free
MgO(100) surface, or one containing an F center (FC)
defect site [18] and both are expected to be relatively
insensitive to the Aun cluster size, correlating with the
experimental results (ﬁgures 2 and 3).
As shown in ﬁgure 3, the higher temperature channel
is strongly enhanced for Au8 supported on a defect-rich
(compared to a defect-poor) MgO(100) support. This
trend correlates with the prediction obtained from the
simulations pertaining to a LH-periphery (LHp) reac-
tion mechanism, starting with a CO molecule adsorbed
on the top-facet of the Au8 cluster and an oxygen mol-
ecule in a peroxo-like state that is bonded to the
periphery of the interfacial layer of the cluster, where the
distance between the C atom and the oxygen marked O1
is d(CO1) = 4.49 A
˚ . Indeed, mapping of the potential
energy surface along the C–O1 reaction coordinate
revealed for Au8/MgO(FC) a rather broad reaction
barrier DEb(LHp)  0.5 eV at d(CO1)  2.0 A
˚ (ﬁgure 4),
while for the defect-free substrate a signiﬁcantly higher
barrier was found, DEb(LHp)  0.8 eV; the reaction
product is shown in ﬁgure 4(f) for the Au8/MgO(FC)
catalyst. This change in activation energy is at the origin

reaction. The question may arise, why the two reaction
channels are observed experimentally, since the low-
temperature mechanism should be always dominant
because its reaction rate is orders of magnitude higher.
In fact, theoretical studies revealed that only one oxygen
molecule adsorbs on the clusters. Thus, there exists an
ensemble of Au8 clusters with an oxygen molecule
adsorbed on the periphery and another ensemble with
the oxygen molecule bound to the top facet. The ratio
between the number of CO2 molecules formed at low
temperature to the number formed at high temperature
is in the same range as the ratio between the number of
O2 molecules which adsorb directly on the Au8 cluster
(leading to O2 adsorbed on the top facet of Au8) to the
number of molecules which adsorb onto the cluster via
reverse spill-over from the MgO substrate (leading to O2
adsorbed at the periphery of the Au8 cluster).
In addition to the two LH-type mechanisms, a third
reaction path was found in the calculations, starting
from the optimal conﬁguration of an activated O2
molecule adsorbed on the Au8/MgO(F5c) catalyst. A gas
phase CO molecule brought to the vicinity of the peroxo
molecule reacts spontaneously (without an energy bar-
rier), forming a carbon dioxide molecule weakly bound
to the catalyst. Therefore, this reaction (ﬁgure 4(g, h))
corresponds to an Eley-Rideal (ER) type mechanism,
which can occur even at 90 K, that is during the initial
dosing stage in the experiment.
4. The role of the MgO substrate
In the following, we take a closer look at the inﬂuence
of surface defects on the activity of the smallest active
gold cluster on MgO, i.e. Au8. As aforementioned, the
theoretically predicted strong inﬂuence of defect struc-
tures of the MgO substrate on the reactivity of the Au8
clusters is apparent in the experiments (ﬁgure 3). An
important class of point defects in MgO are oxygen
vacancies, their direct characterization on the surface,
however, is not straightforward. Singly charged surface
oxygen vacancies (F+-centers) have been characterized
recently by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
measurements [48]. Neutral F-centers are not susceptible
to EPR spectroscopy, but have been investigated by
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM
and STS) [49,50]. On MgO ﬁlms prepared with low
deposition rates, Au8 clusters are essentially inert. On
the other hand, Au8 clusters are found to be catalytically
active on defective MgO(100) ﬁlms, prepared by using
high deposition rates [18]. On the latter ﬁlms Au8 clus-
ters lead to the formation of CO2 at 140 and 280 K.
Note, that these observations are independent of the
preparation procedure for defect-rich MgO ﬁlms, that is,
ﬁlms prepared by high deposition rates show the same
results as ﬁlms with a high density of FC prepared after
the methodology of Pfnu
¨ r et al. [51] (see ﬁgure 3(c)).
This ﬁnding suggests F-centers to play a deciding role
concerning the reactivity of deposited Au8 clusters.
The inﬂuence of F-centers on MgO(100) ﬁlms on the
reactivity of gold clusters was studied in more detail by
FTIR, using CO that serves here, at the same time, both
as reactant and as a probe molecule. These experiments
were combined with extensive density-functional theory
calculations. In the FTIR spectra, shown in ﬁgure 5, CO
stretch frequencies at 2102 cm)1 and 2077/2049 cm)1
(Au8 on defect-poor and defect-rich ﬁlms, respectively)
are observed as well as a band at 1300 cm)1, which is
tentatively attributed to highly activated O2, indicating
that both reactants, CO and O2, are adsorbed molecu-
larly at 90 K [15]. For the reactive model catalyst the
disappearance of these vibrational bands coincides with
the formation of CO2 (ﬁgure 5(right)), whereas, in the
case of the unreactive (ﬁgure 5(left)) model catalyst
(Au8/MgO(defect-poor)), the two reactants simply des-
orb from the sample, as monitored by mass spectrometry
[18,19]. From theoretical studies, three energy-optimized
deposited cluster conﬁgurations pertinent to the experi-
mental conditions are obtained (ﬁgure 6). The bare
adsorbed Au8 cluster (ﬁgure 6(a)) exhibits only a slight
distortion from the structure of the corresponding gas-

phase neutral cluster [19]. However, the strong inﬂuence
of F-centers is reﬂected in the calculated binding energy
of Au8 to the defective MgO surface (3.445 eV) and to
the defect-free surface (1.225 eV), respectively; for details
of the calculations, see Ref. [19]. Optimal geometries
with a single adsorbed CO molecule, Au8/O2/CO/
MgO(FC), and at saturation coverage of the cluster (i.e.
with three adsorbed CO molecules, Au8/O2/(CO)3/
MgO(FC)), are shown in ﬁgure 6(b, c), respectively.
Among the adsorbed
13CO molecules at saturation
coverage, only two have a signiﬁcant dynamic dipole
moment perpendicular to the surface, CO(1) and CO(3),
consistent with the experimental observation (ﬁgure 5).
The key for understanding the inﬂuence of F-centers
on the reactivity of the Au8 cluster is the experimentally
observed redshift in the CO stretch frequency by
25–50 cm)1 for CO/Au8/MgO(defect-rich), compared to
CO/Au8/MgO(defect-poor).
This
shift
indicates
a
change in the charge-state of the gold octamer bound to
defective
magnesia
surface,
since
the
absorption
frequency of CO adsorbed on metal surfaces depends
strongly on the population of the antibonding 2p*
orbital. Table 1 summarizes the calculated inﬂuence of
excess charge DQ for the isolated Au8/O2/13CO complex.
The calculations clearly show that the
13CO stretch
frequency shifts as a function of the charge-state of the
complex. In detail, the shift is correlated with variations
in the population of the antibonding state. For neutral
complexes (DQ (Au8/O2/13CO) = 0 in table 1) with zero
spin, a vibrational frequency of 2009 cm)1 is obtained
for the adsorbed
13CO. The calculated decrease in
frequency (61 cm)1) in comparison to the value calcu-
lated for the free molecule is attributed to a net excess
charge (0.285e)) on the adsorbed molecule, resulting
from back-donation into the CO(2p*) antibonding state.
As expected, such donation of charge from occupied

orbitals of the metal to unoccupied states of the adsor-
bed molecule is even more pronounced (0.88e)) for the
more electronegative di-oxygen molecule. Upon charg-
ing the complex with up to 0.5e), the net excess charge
on the 13CO molecule is increased to 0.34e) and it is
reﬂected in a redshift of the CO stretch frequency
(1975 cm)1) by 34 cm)1 with respect to the neutral
cluster case (2009 cm)1). Concurrently, the C–O bond-
length is increased (see table 1). A similar behavior is
also found, when starting from the triplet state of the
neutral complex. The actual degree of charge transfer
can be deduced directly from ab-initio calculations,
where the charge density of the Au8/MgO(FC) system is
compared with the isolated system (Au8, MgO(FC))
[18,19]. The diﬀerence of the two charge density plots
predicts a charge transfer of 0.5e) into the cluster (see
inset in ﬁgure 5). Comparing theory and experiment, the
experimentally observed redshift in the C–O stretch for
the molecule adsorbed on diﬀerently prepared MgO
(defective and defect-poor) ﬁlms is thus provides direct
experimental evidence for the existence of high concen-
tration of FC on our defect-rich MgO ﬁlms.
Figure 5. FTIR spectra taken at 90 K after exposing the model catalysts (left) Au8/MgO(100)defect-poor and (right) Au8/MgO(100)defect-rich to
13CO and O2 and annealing the sample to the indicated temperature. The frequencies between 2050 and 2100 cm)1 are attributed to adsorbed CO,
whereas the band at 1300 cm)1 may originate from activated O2 molecules. Note, the redshift of the CO-stretch by 50 cm)1 on defect-rich ﬁlms.
This shift is consistent with the predicted charging of the cluster when deposited on an F center (middle inset), where the diﬀerence of the charge
densities of the isolated (Au8, MgO(FC)) and the model system (Au8/MgO(FC)) was calculated. The charging was estimated to be 0.5–1.0 e).

The consequences of the charge transfer from the
oxygen vacancy into the deposited Au8 cluster, for the
binding and activation of the two reactants can be
outlined by analyzing the local density of electronic
states (LDOS), projected on the oxygen molecule,
adsorbed
at
the
periphery
site
of
Au8/MgO(FC)
(ﬁgure 7(a)). All the prominent peaks can be unambig-
uously assigned to orbitals of (free) molecular oxygen
origins. In addition, these states overlap with the entire
d-band of the Au8 cluster (ﬁgure 7(b)) in the range of
)7 eV £ E £ EF, where EF is the Fermi energy. Bonding
of the oxygen molecule to the gold octamer involves
mainly hybridization of the 5r, 1p||, and 1p^ oxygen
states with the gold d-band. Most importantly, the full
spin-manifold of the antibonding 2p* states of O2 is
located below EF, resulting in strong activation of the
O2 molecule through occupation of the antibonding
orbitals. This leads to weakening of the O–O bond that
is reﬂected in a signiﬁcant increase of its length (1.43 A
˚ ),
compared to that of the free molecule (1.25 A
˚ ), and the
molecule is adsorbed in a peroxo-like state [19]. We
observe that O2 binding to the cluster is stronger in the
presence of the F-center (0.47 and 0.33 eV for the spin 0
and spin 1 states, respectively), in comparison to the
case without F-centers (0.33 and 0.30 eV for the spin 0
and spin 1 states, respectively). The bonding of CO to
the Au8/O2/MgO(FC) complex can be understood by
analyzing the correlation diagram, shown in ﬁgure 8. It
depicts LDOS for the two reactants, CO (ﬁgure 8(left))
and the Au8/O2/MgO(FC) complex (ﬁgure 8(right)), as
well as for the product complex Au8/O2/CO/MgO(FC),
with the CO adsorbed on the deposited cluster (ﬁg-
ure 8(middle)). As expected, the 3r and the non-bonding
4r molecular orbitals of the isolated CO are not

Results for free (Au8O2
13CO) complexes as a function of excess electron charge DQ. The results are shown for various values of the spin; for the
neutral cluster, we show triplet (S = 1) and singlet (S = 0) states. The displayed quantities are: m – the CO stretch frequency; BE(O2 + 13CO) –
the CO binding energy to the gold cluster with a preadsorbed oxygen molecule; the bond distances, d(13CO), d(O2), and excess electronic charges,
DQ(13CO), DQ(O2), of the two adsorbed reactants CO and O2. We remark for reference, that the calculated vibrational frequency of gas-phase
13CO is 2070 cm)1 ,which is 25 cm)1 smaller than the experimental value of m (13CO) = 2095 cm)1.
Figure 7. Local density of the electronic states (LDOS) of Au8/O2/MgO(100)FC. For these studies the O2 molecule was adsorbed on the
periphery and no CO molecules were co-adsorbed in order to separate the interaction of O2 with the cluster from coupling eﬀects between the
reactants. The prominent peaks of the oxygen LDOS are labeled following the conventional nomenclature for the molecular orbitals of the gas-
phase O2 molecule, with ^ and || meaning perpendicular and parallel to the MgO surface, respectively. The Fermi energy is at 0 eV.

involved in the bonding to the cluster complex as their
energies are not changed upon adsorption. On the other
hand, the non-bonding 5r orbital is stabilized by the
interaction (by about 3 eV) and thus it contributes to the
chemisorption of carbon monoxide to the surface-sup-
ported complex through hybridization with the metal-
cluster orbitals. The 1p level is slightly pushed upward in
energy (<1 eV). The largest contribution to the bonding
of CO to the complex occurs via hybridization of the
antibonding 2p* levels of CO and the occupied frontier
electronic states of the cluster complex. The 2p* orbitals
are pushed below the Fermi level, partially populating
this molecular state, i.e. the so-called backdonation [52].
All these features are also present in the correlation
diagram of the cluster complex bound to the defect-free
MgO surface, where backdonation, however, is less
pronounced.
5. Electronic size eﬀects
Understanding the size-dependent electronic struc-
ture of the Aun/MgO(FC) model catalysts is funda-
mental for elucidation of their atom-by-atom controlled
reactivity. As discussed above, bonding and activation
of O2 at the periphery site of the Au8/MgO(FC) model
catalyst, is enabled by resonances formed between the
cluster’s electronic states and the 2p* molecular states of
oxygen. A drastically diﬀerent scenario is found for the
interaction of O2 with a smaller gold cluster, Au4/
MgO(FC), where molecular oxygen adsorbs in an ‘‘on-
top’’ conﬁguration, with one of the oxygen atoms
binding to a single gold atom [53]. This system exhibits
rather weak binding of the molecule to the metal cluster
(0.18 eV) and an almost unperturbed O–O bond length.
The weak binding can be attributed to the narrower d-
band of the adsorbed Au4 cluster, compared to that of
Au8, with a consequent lack of overlap between the
states at the bottom of the d-band of the gold cluster
and
the
molecular
oxygen
states,
with
energies
E < )5 eV. Moreover, the antibonding 2p^* and 2p||*
orbitals of the adsorbed oxygen molecule are located
above EF, which results in no activation of the molecule
by the adsorbed Au4 cluster; for further details see Ref.
[53].
6. Structural dynamical ﬂuxionality
The capability of small clusters to exhibit several
structural forms (isomers) of comparable energies, and
to interconvert between such isomers at ﬁnite tempera-
ture, is one of the hallmarks of cluster science. This
unique structural variability may inﬂuence the chemical
reactivity of nano-catalytic systems in two main ways.
First, at ﬁnite temperature, the model catalyst will form
an equilibrium ensemble of coexisting structural con-
ﬁgurations, with various isomers, exhibiting diﬀerent
chemical reactivities. Second, and most importantly, is
the structural dynamic ﬂuxionality of clusters in the
course of reactions, that expresses itself in the ability of
a given structural isomer to dynamically adapt its
structure, such as to allow the reaction to evolve on the
most favorable free-energy path. Such ﬂuxional pro-
pensity is illustrated in ﬁgure 6(a–c), comparing the
adsorbed bare-cluster geometry with those of the gold
cluster, with adsorbed reactant molecules on it. The
structural ﬂuxionality is
essential for the reaction to

occur, since it was found that constraining the cluster to
maintain its original geometry prevents the adsorption
and activation of O2 [53].
7. Tuning of the catalytic activity of Au nanoclusters
via support design
One of the goals of research in nanocatalysis is the
control and tuning of catalytic activity. Most recently
tuning of the catalytic activity of gold nanoclusters
through the design of the underlying support has been
explored [54]. It was shown that gold clusters adsorbed
on a very thin (two layers) defect-free MgO ﬁlm which is
itself supported on Mo(100) [55], may serve as model
catalysts for the low-barrier oxidation of CO. The origin
of the emergent activity of the nanoclusters is a dimen-
sionality crossover of the adsorbed gold clusters, from
inactive three-dimensional (3D) optimal structures on
thick MgO ﬁlms, to catalytically active 2D ones for
suﬃciently thin MgO ﬁlms (less then 1 nm in thickness)
supported on Mo(100). The increased gold wetting
propensity on the MgO/Mo(100) surface originates
from electrostatic interaction between the underlying
metal and metal-induced excess electronic charge accu-
mulated at the cluster interface with the metal-oxide ﬁlm
[56]. The excess interfacial charge is predicted to activate
O2 molecules adsorbed at the interfacial periphery of the
2D gold island with the MgO/Mo(100) surface. This
activation, which weakens greatly the O–O bond, lowers
rather remarkably the barrier for reaction of the acti-
vated molecule with CO and the subsequent emission of
CO2.
While details of the calculations can be found else-
where [2,54,56] we take this opportunity to give some
pertinent detail. The ﬁrst-principles calculations used in
studies
are based on a density functional theory
approach [57–59] with exchange and correlation energy
corrections included through a generalized gradient
approximation (GGA) [60]. A plane wave basis is used
with a cutoﬀkinetic energy of 30 Ry, and ultrasoft
pseudopotentials (scalar relativistic for Au) [61] are
employed with C-point sampling of the Brillouin zone.
In structural relaxations corresponding to minimization
of the total energy, convergence is achieved when the
forces on the atoms are less than 0.001 eV/A
˚ .
In modeling the metal-supported MgO ﬁlms a four-
layer Mo(100) slab (lattice constant of 3.15 A
˚
) of
thickness 4.64 A
˚
was used, since it has been found to
reproduce (in its middle) the bulk electronic properties
of Mo [62]. The planar Au20 clusters was adsorbed on a
MgO/Mo(100) with 5 · 6 unit cells of the Mo(100) sur-
face; for the 3D tetrahedral cluster the dimensions of the
MgO surface (without the metal support) were the same,
and the bottom layer of the metal oxide was held ﬁxed.
In all calculations, the periodically replicated slabs were
separated [in the (100) direction] by a vacuum region of
20 A
˚ . In structural optimizations all the atoms of the
adsorbed gold clusters, the MgO thin ﬁlm, and the ﬁrst
two layers of the Mo substrate were allowed to relax. In
calculation involving the tetrahedral gold structure the
MgO(100) crystalline surface was modeled by a two-
layer MgO(100) slab which is suﬃciently thick to both
reproduce the properties of the bare MgO surface [63],
and to obtain converged results (with respect to the
number of MgO layers) for the energetics of adsorbed
Au clusters [30].
The gas-phase optimal 3D tetrahedral Au20 cluster
[64] was found to maintains its structure on the
MgO(100) surface, with a 1.2 eV advantage over the
planar structure [56] (ﬁgure 9). However, this cluster
adsorbs O2 only weakly (0.34 eV on the top apex atom
of the pyramid with d(O–O) = 1.28 A
˚ remaining close
to the gas phase value), and no binding was found at
peripheral sites of the gold/MgO interface; when CO is
preadsorbed at the top apex Au atom (0.7 eV) no
coadsorption of O2 occurs.
In light of the above inactivity of the 3D structure we
focused our investigations on Au20 adsorbed on a
Figure 9. The dimensionality crossover of Au20, from a 3D stable structure in the gas phase (left) and when adsorbed on MgO(100), to a 2D

energies are given; e.g., E2D>E3D indicates a more stable 2D structure.

two-layer MgO/Mo(100). Here the planar isomer is
more stable then the 3D one by 3.3 eV (see ﬁgure 9),
with the enhanced stability resulting from penetration of
metal states through the thin MO ﬁlm and charge
accumulation at the cluster/MgO interface (up to 1e for
Au20) [56]. Furthermore, in this conﬁguration the O2
adsorbs relatively strongly (1.35 eV) at the cluster
periphery (ﬁgure 10), and the process is accompanied by
transfer of electronic charge (about 1.3e) into the anti-
bonding 2p* orbital leading to activation of the O–O
bond of the adsorbed molecule into a peroxo state with
d(O–O) = 1.52 A
˚ and no spin polarization.

illustrating activation of the adsorbed molecule through population of the antibonding 2p* orbital.

Two mechanisms for the reaction of CO with the
activated oxygen molecule were probed. Various CO
coadsorption sites were probed. First, adsorption to the
gold cluster was examined yielding relaxed adsorption
conﬁgurations with CO binding energies ranging from
0.8 eV (CO binding to a peripheral Au atom that is
nearest-neighbor to the Au atom bonded to the O2),
down to a vanishingly small binding for a non-periphery
nearest-neighbor Au atom on the ﬂat gold island.
However, calculation of the barrier [54] for reaction
between the reactants (with CO at the peripheral site)
yielded a high value of close to 1.0 eV.
We have tested also several CO coadsorption sites
located on the MgO surface in the vicinity of the adsorbed
O2. The adsorption geometry shown in ﬁgure 11(a) is
characterized by a CO binding energy of 0.4 eV. Starting
from this coadsorption conﬁguration the LH reaction
barrier leading to formation of CO2 was calculated to be
0.15 eV; the transition state is shown in ﬁgure 11(b), CO2
formation in ﬁgure 11(c), and the energy proﬁle along the
reaction coordinate is displayed in ﬁgure 11(d). The
product molecule desorbs readily in the course of the
reaction (the binding energy of CO2 to a Mg site on the
MgO(100) surface is merely 0.14 eV). Alternatively, sev-
eral reaction trajectories that follow the ER mechanism
were probed. Some of these trajectories yielded formation
of CO2 with a small (0.2 eV) or vanishngly small barriers,
depending on the angle of approach.
These results serve to illustrate one of the method-
ologies that may be employed in attempting to control
the reactivity of adsorbed gold nanostructures through
manipulations of the supporting substrate. Such an
approach may be coupled with other developments for
controlling the interfacial charge (and consequently the
chemical
reactivity)
in
nanocatalytic
systems,
for
example, through the use of applied ﬁelds.
8. The eﬀect of water
As mentioned in the introduction, for certain sup-
ports, moisture is able to increase the activity of gold
nanocatalysts by about two orders of magnitude [24]
Thus, the inﬂuence of water on the chemical activity of
gold clusters was recently investigated with the use of
quantum mechanical ab-initio calculations for Au8
adsorbed on a defect-free MgO(100) surface [65], i.e. a
system that does not exhibit charging eﬀects and is inert
for CO oxidation (see above).
The inﬂuence of water (co-)adsorption manifests
itself in the calculated change of the oxygen binding
energies. For the gold octamer, bound to a defect-free
MgO(100) surface, two spatial regions for oxygen
adsorption may be identiﬁed in the calculations: (i) the
top facet of the cluster, where O2 adsorbs weakly
(adsorption energies up to 0.1eV), in agreement with
[18,27,30] and (ii) peripheral sites (at the Au8/MgO
interface), where O2 adsorbs with energies between 0.3
and 0.8 eV (Table 2), with the O–O bond extended to
1.37–1.49 A
˚ . Water adsorbs (relative weak) on free and
supported Au clusters (table 2), with adsorption ener-
gies that vary from 0.2 to 0.6 eV, and without apparent
correlation between the adsorption strength and the
coordination of the adsorption site. Interestingly, it
was found that an adsorbed H2O is an ‘‘attractor’’ for
molecular O2 and in the presence of an adsorbed water
molecule O2 preferentially adsorbs at a neighboring
site. Moreover, it may bind even at sites where the
adsorption of O2 (without coadsorbed H2O) is ener-
getically unfavorable.
In some cases of H2O and O2 coadsorbed on the top
facet of Au8/MgO, the proton shared by the H2O and O2
molecules may actually be considered as transferred to the
O2 species and an OH and a hydroperoxyl-like (HO2)
group are formed; for details see [65]. The distance
between the O atoms sharing the proton takes a value of
about 2.49 A
˚ , while the O–O hydroperoxyl bond length
reaches a value of about 1.48 A
˚ (that is 21% larger than in
a free molecule), reﬂecting a very high degree of bond
activation. A charge analysis shows, that an amount of
approximately 0.31e is transferred from the Au8/MgO
system to the coadsorbed species. These results suggest
that the coadsorption of H2O and O2 stabilizes partially
charged highly activated states of the adsorbed oxygen
molecule. No such bond-activation is found for the
adsorption of O2 on the top-facet of the supported gold
octamer without water coadsorption. MgO surfaces are
hydrophilic and H2O molecules adsorb with energies of
about 0.4 eV. In the vicinity of the peripheral interfacial
sites of the Au cluster the calculations showed, that the
adsorption energy of H2O increases by 0.1–0.2 eV
(depending on the particular site and adsorption conﬁg-
uration); thus, the gold cluster acts as an attractor for
adsorbed water (reverse spillover). Hence, at the interface
between the Au cluster and the MgO surface, peripheral
sites show a high propensity to bind both H2O and O2
(Table 2). The markedly larger binding energies of the
coadsorbed complex (compared to the individual adsor-
bates) reﬂect a synergetic eﬀect, expressed through the
occurrence of the aforementioned proton sharing and
proton transfer processes.

To address the reactivity of O2 coadsorbed with H2O
on the top facet of the adsorbed gold cluster, a sequence
of adsorption and reaction steps that result in the cat-
alytic oxidation of CO, is displayed in ﬁgure 12. Starting
from the bare Au8/MgO system, an H2O molecule
adsorbs
ﬁrst
(ﬁgure 12(a)).
Subsequently,
an
O2
molecule is coadsorbed and the system is exposed to
incident CO (see the proton-sharing conﬁguration in
ﬁgure 12(b)). In ﬁgure 12(c), a proton transfer process,
induced by the incoming gaseous CO molecule is shown,
leading to formation of a hydroperoxyl-like complex.
Upon reaction of the CO molecule with the complex, the
proton shuttles back towards the hydroxyl group
(ﬁgure 9(d)),
with
the
process
culminating
in
the
desorption of a CO2 molecule and reformation of an
adsorbed H2O molecule that is preferentially oriented
with respect to the remaining adsorbed oxygen atom
ﬁgure 12(e)). The above ER-like reaction mechanism
involves relatively low barriers. It was found that the
formation of the transition state (ﬁgure 12(d)) entails a
readily accessible energy barrier of 0.5 eV. An added
CO molecule reacts readily (a barrier of 0.1 eV) with the
single adsorbed oxygen atom, and the (barrierless)
desorption of the CO2 product closes the catalytic cycle.
For a peripherally adsorbed O2 reacting with a CO
molecule adsorbed in its vicinity, a Langmuir-Hinshel-
wood reaction barrier of 0.4 eV was found (with or
without a neighboring coadsorbed H2O molecule). The
barrier for desorption of the CO2 product is 0.6 eV
under dry conditions and 0.3 eV with coadsorbed H2O.
9. Summary
Focusing on size-selected gold clusters consisting of
up to 20 atoms, that is, in the size regime where prop-
erties can not be obtained from those of the bulk
material through scaling considerations, we summarized
in this article the current state of understanding per-
taining to various factors that control the reactivity and
catalytic activity of such nanostructures, using the CO
oxidation reaction catalyzed by the gold nanoclusters
adsorbed on MgO as a paradigm. These factors include
the role of the metal-oxide support and its defects, the
charge state of the cluster, structural ﬂuxionality of the
clusters, electronic size eﬀects, the eﬀect of an underly-
ing metal support on the dimensionality, charging and
chemical reactivity of gold nanoclusters adsorbed on the
metal-supported ultra-thin metal-oxide ﬁlms, and the
promotional eﬀect of water. We have shown that
through joined experimental and ﬁrst-principles quan-
tum mechanical calculations and simulations, a detailed
picture of the reaction mechanisms in nanocatalysis, and
of methods for controlling and tuning the catalytic
activity, emerge.
