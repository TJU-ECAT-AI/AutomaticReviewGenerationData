The reaction of small ligands within the distal pocket of haem proteins such as myoglobin,
to form ligated, low-spin iron complexes is an archetypal spin-forbidden process in
bioinorganic chemistry, because the initial, ‘‘deoxy’’ iron complex has a high-spin ground
state. Density functional theory (DFT), transition-state theory (TST), and hybrid
DFT/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations are reported on the carbon monoxide
reaction. Using DFT data for a model compound, TST rate calculations at room
temperature are carried out which give fair agreement with experiment, and suggest a
highly non-adiabatic nature to the reaction. QM/MM calculations on the whole protein
are reported, which are in qualitative agreement with the gas-phase model results, but
suggest that protein matrix eﬀects on the reaction rate may be important.
Introduction
Non-adiabatic reactions are common in biochemistry, especially processes such as electron
transfer, and photochemical internal conversion and intersystem crossing. The theoretical study of
biological electron transfer, and its nonadiabatic aspects, is a huge area of research.1,2 Electron
transfer, e.g. from a redox cofactor to an enzyme active centre, can occur over quite large distances,
so a considerable amount of work has focussed on understanding the pathways followed by
electrons in such cases. Photosynthesis and vision are just two examples of processes involving
electronically excited states. In recent years, a lot of computational work has addressed the
non-adiabatic chemistry involved in the excited-state dynamics of the retinal chromophore
involved in vision (see e.g. refs. 3 and 4).
The class of biological non-adiabatic process which is the topic of this paper is diﬀerent, as it
involves thermal processes without electron transfer. Many of the transition metal cofactors
involved in metalloproteins exist at a given oxidation level, and have a coordination shell such that
their ground state has one or more unpaired electrons. As a result, some thermal bioinorganic
reactions involve a change in spin state along the reaction coordinate. Except in the limit of very
strong spin–orbit coupling, therefore, these reactions are non-adiabatic since they will involve
hopping, with sub-unity probability, from a potential energy surface corresponding to one
spin-state to one corresponding to another spin-state.
In recent years, we have carried out studies on a fairly large number of spin-forbidden reactions
in the area of organo-transition metal chemistry.5–11 We ﬁnd that the spin-forbidden nature of
reactions can have a profound impact upon their kinetics, regardless of the degree of non-
adiabaticity involved. The reason for this is that even in the presence of strong spin–orbit coupling,
movement from one spin-state to another ﬁrst requires that the system reach the regions of
conﬁgurational space where the zeroth-order potential energy surfaces (or diabatic states) cross.

Because these zeroth-order surfaces can be very diﬀerent due to diﬀerences in the bonding in the
two states, the position and energetics of such crossing regions cannot necessarily be readily
predicted. In our cited work, we have located the minimum energy crossing points (MECPs) for a
number of systems, using a code we have developed,12,13 in conjunction with existing ab initio
program packages. In all cases, we have found that reactivity can be understood in qualitative
terms based on the energy of the crossing points.
However, non-adiabatic eﬀects are clearly important also. This is most clear from our study of
spin-forbidden addition of carbon monoxide to triplet iron tetracarbonyl.11 This reaction has
been studied experimentally in the gas-phase, and found to proceed about ﬁve hundred times
slower than the gas-collision rate, in contrast to the spin-allowed related CO addition to iron
tricarbonyl, which is nearly as fast as the collisional rate. As well as locating the MECP between
singlet and triplet surfaces, we used a non-adiabatic version of transition state theory to
calculate the gas-phase rate coeﬃcient for the ﬁrst of these reactions.11 We found that roughly
half of the decrease in rate coeﬃcient is due to the presence of a very low energy barrier
introduced by the surface crossing, with the MECP lying less than 1 kcal mol1 above the
separated reactants. However, the remainder of the rate reduction was due to ineﬃcient surface
crossing from one diabatic state to another at the MECP. Clearly, non-adiabatic behaviour can
have a measurable eﬀect on the rate of reaction in spin-forbidden processes involving transition
metal compounds.
As well as this work on organometallic systems, we have started to apply our methodology to
bioinorganic processes (note that others have also considered the eﬀect of spin on reactivity in
biochemistry, see e.g. refs. 14 and 15). In particular, we have decided to focus initially on the
reactions of myoglobin and related porphyrin proteins. Myoglobin has been referred to16 as the
‘‘Hydrogen Atom of Biology’’: an archetypal system which has been studied by a large number of
groups, using a broad range of methodologies, and addressing a number of fundamental issues
relating to the properties and reactivity of biomolecules in general. With our interest in spin-
forbidden chemistry, it is of particular interest because one of the key reactions it undergoes is
exactly such a process. The central part of myoglobin is a haem group: a porphyrin ring system
with an iron atom at its centre. As well as the four nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin, the iron is
bonded to a nitrogen atom on a histidine side-chain. This pentacoordinate iron system is referred
to as deoxymyoglobin. The physiological function of myoglobin is as an oxygen molecule carrier in
muscles, as it can bond O2 as a sixth ligand (to form oxymyoglobin). Other small molecules, such
as carbon monoxide, NO, and isocyanides RNC, are also able to bond to the metal centre.
The structures of a model system for deoxy- and carbonmonoxy-myoglobin, involving only
the central part of the haem system, and the imidazole sidechain of the histidine ligand, are shown
in Fig. 1.
Deoxymyoglobin is known from experiment to have a quintet electronic state, corresponding to
a high-spin conﬁguration of the Fe(II), 3d6, iron centre. In contrast, oxymyoglobin, carbonmonoxy-
myoglobin, and nitroxymyoglobin all have low-spin ground states, with, respectively, S ¼ 0, 0, and
1/2. The carbonmonoxy- form involves low-spin Fe(II), the oxy- form is best described as having a

low-spin coupling between low-spin Fe(III) and a superoxide O2
 ligand, whereas the unpaired
electron in the nitroxy- form is mostly on the NO ligand. In all cases, then, ligand association to the
deoxy- form involves a spin ﬂip of at least one electron on the metal, and a change in the overall spin,
so these reactions are spin-forbidden. In the case of interest here, addition of CO, there is a double
spin ﬂip, to go from a quintet reactant to a singlet adduct.
There has been a lot of experimental work on this reaction. The main technique used has been
ﬂash photolysis of the carbonmonoxy- (or oxy- or nitroxy-)myoglobin, leading to rupture of the
Fe–X bond, followed by spectroscopic,17,18 and more recently ultrafast X-ray crystallographic,19–21
observation of the resulting dissociated species. These experiments can be described by using the
heuristic free energy surface shown in Fig. 2.
Here the protein is shown as a globular structure, with the iron in the ‘‘middle part’’, surrounded
on all sides but one by the protein and the porphyrin ring. Also shown is a very thin ‘‘tube’’ leading
from the outside to the vicinity of the iron atom–this is not in fact present in static structures, and is
likely to arise only as a result of dynamic ﬂuctuations. Finally, there is a cavity (not to scale!) on
one side of the iron atom, which is present in the X-ray structures, and is referred to as the distal
cavity. In most experiments, the protein is prepared in its oxy- or carbonmonoxy-bonded form,
which is then photolysed, to form the geminate pair, in which the ligand is still in the distal cavity,
but not bonded to the metal. The decay of this state can occur via two processes, geminate
recombination and diﬀusion of the ligand out into the solvent; both are empirically observed to
involve some kind of energy barrier. In this work, the focus is on the geminate recombination,
which is observed, especially at low temperature, to occur on diﬀerent timescales. This has been
taken17,18 to mean that the geminate pair exists as an ensemble of protein conformations which
interconvert less readily than they undergo recombination, and that the latter process has barriers
of diﬀerent height associated with it in the diﬀerent conformations. The aim of the present work is
to contribute to an understanding, at the atomistic level, of the potential energy surfaces and the
dynamics associated with recombination of CO.
As an archetypal system in biophysics, there has naturally been a vast amount of previous
computational and theoretical work on recombination. On the computational, electronic structure
side, early work by several groups used systems such as the small model of Fig. 1, and addressed
aspects such as the structure and electronic structure of carbonmonoxy- and oxy-myoglobin,22–24
as well as the nature of the exited states and surfaces involved in photodissociation.25–27 This work
typically used semiempirical theory or low levels of ab initio theory or DFT. More recently,

increasingly accurate calculations, also on model compounds, have been carried out to address
e.g. the energetics of iron–porphyrin (porphine) electronic states,28–31 the bonding and infrared
spectroscopy of the various adducts,32,33 the potential energy surfaces involved in photodissocia-
tion,34,35 and relative energetics of electronic states and bond energies,36 including the eﬀect of
hydrogen bonding in the distal cage with extended models.37 Also in the last years, a number of
hybrid QM/MM calculations have appeared, in which all the myoglobin atoms, not just the haem
system, are included, and focussing on the geometry and hydrogen bonding in various adducts,38–41
as well as on vibrational frequencies and NMR shifts.42,43
A number of studies,44–46 including our own,47 have started to compute potential energy sur-
faces, for the model systems, to attempt to understand the recombination rates. Most of this work
has calculated the potential energy on one- and two-dimensional grids, e.g. by varying the Fe–C
distance, and the Fe out of plane distance. The authors have then used the modelled surfaces to
make predictions for the recombination rate, based on the locus of crossing of the surfaces and a
dynamical model. This approach is similar to the one used here, except that the non-adiabatic
model for recombination is diﬀerent, and that we have located the exact, full-dimensional lowest
energy crossing point (MECP), not some 2-D or even 1-D approximation. This is important
because recombination involves motion along several coordinates: as well as the two already
mentioned, motion of the proximal histidine and slight structural changes in the porphyrin ring
have some importance. Also, the basis sets used in one of the studies44 were too small, and led to an
erroneous description of the quintet surface, which was found to be somewhat attractive, instead of
purely repulsive as in our work.47 This led us to the qualitative picture of the potential energy
surfaces shown in Fig. 3.
As can be seen, the deoxyhaem model is computed to have a quintet ground state (with a close-
lying triplet, which appears not to be important in reactivity), with the singlet lying ca. 5 kcal mol1
higher. The singlet surface interacts attractively with CO at all distances, leading to a crossing with
the repulsive quintet curve, at an energy Erel(MECP) of 2.4 kcal mol1 above the reactants. This
suggests that geminate recombination of CO is slow in myoglobin for an intrinsic, electronic,
reason: the need to cross from quintet to singlet introduces an energy barrier. In this model, the fact
that diﬀerent protein conformations undergo recombination at diﬀerent rates is due to the protein
matrix modulating an already existent barrier. To put this conclusion on a ﬁrmer footing, we hereby
present two extensions to this earlier work. First of all, we have modelled the rate coeﬃcient, and
its temperature dependence, for geminate recombination. For this, we use a modiﬁed form of our
non-adiabatic transition-state code, and our computed potential energy surfaces for the model
cluster system, including information on the MECP. Next, we have used a hybrid QM/MM
method to provide a preliminary description of the potential energy surfaces involved in carbon
monoxide geminate recombination in the full myoglobin system.

Computational details
The QM calculations of vibrational frequencies have been carried out using the Jaguar program
code,48 and with the FeC24N6OH16 cluster model of the haem active site of carbonmonoxy-
myoglobin shown in Fig. 1. The standard B3LYP density functional method is used in all calcu-
lations, with restricted ‘‘wavefunctions’’ in all cases, i.e. RB3LYP for closed-shell systems and
ROB3LYP for open-shell systems. The basis set used is the same as used in our earlier study: the
standard Los Alamos ECP on Fe, together with the Jaguar48 triple-zeta basis set (LACV3P),
the standard 6-311G* basis on the CO ligand, and the ﬁve coordinating nitrogen atoms, and the
6-31G* basis (with ﬁve spherical harmonic d polarization functions) on all other atoms.
QM/MM calculations in essence involve two calculations: one QM calculation, and one MM
calculation, whose results need to be combined in a speciﬁc way. This formal structure is reﬂected
in the way we carry out our calculations, using three separate programs. First of all, the completely
standard Jaguar QM code is used to calculate the QM energy, with the electronic polarization
induced by the MM region represented using an array of point charges. Next, the TINKER MM
code49 with the CHARMM27 all atom forceﬁeld50 is used to calculate the MM energy and carry
out geometry optimisation of the MM atoms. In this case, the native Fortran code has been slightly
edited for better compatibility with the QM/MM program itself. This ﬁnal component is our own
new interface, called QoMMMa, which will be described in detail elsewhere.51 In brief, like our
previous code for locating crossing point between potential energy surfaces,12,13 it is designed to
interact in as ﬂexible a way as possible with existing, unmodiﬁed, QM (and MM) codes, and
resembles in this respect some other QM/MM codes.52,53 It is made up of a suite of Unix shell
scripts and Fortran 90 programs, which create input for the QM and MM codes, run QM and MM
jobs, analyze and integrate the results from the output, compute the QM/MM total energy and
gradients, and optimise the geometry of the QM part. The QM/MM implementation is very similar
to those described by others. Polarization eﬀects on the QM atoms (the charge-charge part of the
QM/MM Hamiltonian) are included by inserting point charges corresponding to the MM atoms in
the QM Hamiltonian. The steric QM/MM interactions are also included, using standard van der
Waals radii for the QM atoms as included in the MM force-ﬁeld.50
The covalent bonds between the QM and MM atoms are treated using the link atom method54 in
a version similar to that suggested by Field et al.55 Speciﬁcally, in the MM energy expression, all
terms including only QM atoms are deleted, whilst all those in which at least one atom is MM are
conserved. Capping H atoms are introduced in the QM calculation at positions situated along the
XQ–XM bond of the full system, and at a distance deﬁned by the ratio of the ideal XQ–H and XQ–
XM bond lengths. These atoms interact with the MM charged atoms, but the MM charge on the
link atom and some close-lying MM atoms is set to zero to avoid non-physical eﬀects; this is done
in such a way as to treat the QM region with an integer charge state, and to conserve the total
charge in the MM region. The QM gradient on the capping atom is spread over the XQ and XM
atoms based simply on the geometric deﬁnition of the capping atom’s position, and the position of
the capping atom is not explicitly optimised. Optimisation of the QM region is performed using a
BFGS method, whereas the MM atoms are fully optimised (to within an RMS gradient of 0.1 kcal
mol1 A
˚ 1) at each QM geometry.
In principle, these MM ‘‘micro-iterations’’ would require a large number of computations of the
QM contribution to the QM/MM energy gradient for the MM atoms. This is avoided in a way
similar to that already suggested in the literature:56,57 this gradient is approximated by that induced
by a set of point charges positioned at the QM centers, with a correction term given by the dif-
ference between the exact gradient term at the initial geometry, and this simple electric ﬁeld con-
tribution. As discussed in the literature,56,57 this approximation becomes exact as one approaches a
stationary point. For convenience, in our implementation, Mulliken charges are used to represent
the QM region (with the charge on the capping H atoms added to that on the QM atom to which
they are bonded); tests show that even this crude representation gives a fairly good description
of the electrostatic potential, which is more than adequate given that this term is only used as
a correction, and vanishes at the optimized geometry.
Non-adiabatic TST calculations were carried out using a modiﬁcation of our existing codes.11,13
Vibrational densities of state within the harmonic approximation were computed using the steepest
descent method.58,59

Non-adiabatic transition state theory (NA-TST)
Our transition state theory method, which is based on that of Lorquet,60 and similar in some
respects to other non-adiabatic rate theories,61–64 has been described in detail in previous work,11,13
and only the key features need to be mentioned here. Our approach is also similar in spirit to that
part of the previous theoretical work on the CO recombination rate which models it as involving a
change in spin.44–46,65–67 The key diﬀerence with previous work is that we use the ab initio MECP
from our previous work47 as the critical geometry, and include a full dimensional treatment of all
degrees of freedom. As in the previous work on CO reaction with iron tetracarbonyl,11 the
topology of the potential energy surfaces involved in the reaction is relatively simple (there are no
intermediates), see Fig. 3, such that we only need to consider the rate coeﬃcient for the forward
reaction, addition of CO to the haem iron atom. Also, the MECP and its surrounding crossing
hyperline can be taken to represent the critical surface, so that variational methods are not needed.
For these reasons, we can use the following simple expression for the thermal rate constant:
k T
ð Þ ¼
1
hQR T
ð Þ
Z
1
0
NMECP E
ð Þ expðE=kBTÞdE
In this equation, h is Planck’s constant, NMECP(E) is an eﬀective number of states at the MECP,
including non-adiabatic eﬀects (see below for a discussion of this term), for a given energy E
relative to the zero-point level of the reactants, and kB is Boltzmann’s constant. QR(T ) is the
reactant partition function, including in the present case the vibrational degrees of freedom of the
quintet haem fragment, computed here at the B3LYP level of theory, and the rotational, vibra-
tional, and translational degrees of freedom of the carbon monoxide co-reactant. Vibrational and
rotational contributions to the partition function are treated in the normal ways, from harmonic
frequencies and rotational constants obtained from the quantum mechanical calculations. For the
translational degrees of freedom, however, we adopt a diﬀerent approach. Thus, geminate
recombination is not a straightforward bimolecular reaction, since CO is ‘‘imprisoned’’ in the distal
pocket of the protein in the reactant state. The reaction can be better described as being a
unimolecular process, in which some of the nuclear degrees of freedom of the single ‘‘reactant’’ are
extremely unconstrained. We consider that CO can rotate more or less freely in the distal cavity–
hence the inclusion of a rotational partition function, as mentioned above. The translational
motion could be described either using three very loose harmonic oscillators, or using the particle
in a box expression. The latter approach has been used here, with the size of the box chosen,
slightly arbitrarily, to be 3 A
˚ cubed.
As mentioned, NMECP(E) is an eﬀective number of states at the MECP, which is given as:
NMECP E
ð Þ ¼
ZE
0
rMECP E  Eh
ð
Þ psh Eh
ð
ÞdEh
This equation involves an integration over Eh , the part of the total energy E which is in the
coordinate orthogonal to the seam of crossing between the two surfaces. For each value of this
energy, the contribution to the integrated sum of states NMECP(E) is obtained as a product of the
density of states within the crossing seam rMECP(E  Eh), and a probability for hopping from one
surface to the other, psh(Eh). The ﬁrst of these terms is similar to the traditional density of states
term used within the dividing surface around a saddle-point: the crossing seam deﬁnes a sub-space
within which the available energy E  Eh may be distributed in many diﬀerent ways amongst the
available vibrational degrees of freedom. Although it is possible to compute eﬀective harmonic
vibrational frequencies within the seam of crossing,12 we have chosen here to approximate this set
of frequencies in the following way: the frequencies for the quintet reactant fragment were used
unchanged, as well as the free CO vibrational frequency, and four frequencies equal to 50 cm1, to
represent the two rotational and two translational degrees of freedom of the carbon monoxide lost
upon going from the reactants to the MECP. The choice of this value of 50 cm1 is arbitrary but
reasonable: the equivalent set of transitional frequencies at the Fe(CO)4–CO MECP, which were
computed elsewhere,11 lie between 40 and 200 cm1, and the present MECP is slightly ‘‘looser’’,

with r(Fe–C) ¼ 2.33 A
˚ vs. 2.24 A
˚ for the Fe(CO)4 case. Note that one of the CO translational
degrees of freedom becomes the reaction coordinate at the MECP.
The term psh is the probability for hopping from one surface to another upon passing the
crossing seam between the two zeroth order potential energy surfaces. This is calculated using
either Landau–Zener theory or from WKB theory (using an expression given by Delos68). The
Landau–Zener expression gives a ﬁnite hopping probability only for energies above the crossing
point energy (which was found to be 2.38 kcal mol1 above the reactants,47 2.66 kcal mol1 after
correction for zero-point energy), whereas the WKB expression allows for tunnelling from one
surface to another below the crossing. Both give similar values for energies above the crossing.
Whichever expression is used, psh depends upon the square of the electronic coupling term V12
between the two surfaces, due to spin–orbit coupling. In the present case, this term is not known,
but has been estimated67 to be of the order of 10 cm1, which is the value used here. psh also
depends on the slopes of the two surfaces along the coordinate orthogonal to the crossing seam, in
the vicinity of the MECP, and on the reduced mass in this direction. These latter terms are obtained
from the gradients on the two surfaces at the MECP, which were obtained in our previous study.47
Thus, the reduced mass is of 15.9 u, the slope on the singlet surface has a magnitude of 0.0497 Eh
a0
1, and that on the quintet surface has a magnitude of 0.0144 Eh a0
1, and is oriented in the
opposite direction.
With these parameters, we compute the unimolecular rate coeﬃcients shown in Fig. 4, using both
the Landau–Zener and WKB variants of the non-adiabatic transition state theory. Also shown in
Fig. 4 is the rate computed for the hypothetical adiabatic process (i.e. where psh ¼ 1.0 for energies
above the barrier), using the computed and estimated MECP properties for the transition state.
As can be seen, the Arrhenius plot for both the adiabatic and Landau–Zener computed rates are
almost linear. The apparent activation energy for the Landau–Zener case is of 3.0 kcal mol1, i.e.
very slightly more than the energy barrier after correction for zero-point energy. The WKB non-
adiabatic rate, which, unlike the two others, allows for tunnelling below the barrier, has positive
curvature at low temperatures, which is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations on

this process.18 At higher temperatures, the WKB and Landau–Zener expressions lead to very
similar computed rates.
The overall rate is diﬃcult to compare with experiment, as the geminate recombination reaction
occurs at diﬀerent rates in diﬀerent systems. Nevertheless, the lifetime for recombination at room
temperature is observed to be ca. 1 ms for myoglobin,45,46 which corresponds to a rate coeﬃcient of
roughly 106 s1, in good agreement with our computed rates of 2.2  105 and 2.8  105 s1,
respectively, with the Landau–Zener and WKB expressions. As discussed below, however, it should
be realized that this agreement is in part fortuitous; the error on the calculated rate is certainly of
one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the fact that the values obtained are of the right order of
magnitude, with a reasonable choice of parameters, is very encouraging.
Most importantly, in the present context, is that it lends a certain amount of conﬁdence to one of
the key conclusions derived from the rate calculations, namely that the process is severely non-
adiabatic. The ratio of the computed rates using the adiabatic and non-adiabatic theories is of ca.
300, which provides a measure of the average frequency with which the reactive system, upon
passing the crossing seam, hops from the quintet diabatic curve to the singlet one. This probability
is less than 1%, indicating that the behaviour is very diabatic, as expected given the low spin–orbit
coupling. This conclusion is in contrast to that reached in several other works, which suggest
instead that CO recombination is close to being adiabatic,44,67 and careful tests will be needed to
establish which theory gives a more accurate rendering of the non-adiabatic behaviour.
The computed rates are obviously dependent on many of the parameters and assumptions used
in the TST calculations. For example, given the cubic dependence of the particle in a box partition
function on the box length, changing the latter to 2 or 4 A
˚ respectively increases or decreases all
rates by roughly a factor of three. Equally, the treatment of CO rotational motion as free could
have a severe impact on the rate: the rotational partition function at room temperature is about
100, and this value could be much decreased if rotation were considered to be hindered. This would
lead to an equivalent increase in the computed rate. Changing the spin–orbit coupling matrix
element V12 by a factor of two from the chosen67—and highly arbitrary!—value of 10 cm1 changes
the computed non-adiabatic rates by a factor of four. This thereby changes the relative value of the
adiabatic and non-adiabatic rates; however, V12 needs to be increased to more than 50 cm1 for the
non-adiabatic rate to become only ten times smaller than the adiabatic one. This order of
magnitude of the coupling seems unlikely, given that this is a two-electron spin change. For
example, even the one-electron spin-coupling matrix element calculated11 for the Fe(CO)4 þ CO
system is only 30–60 cm1, depending on the geometry considered, so the present coupling must be
smaller. The use of assumed frequencies of 50 cm1 for the transitional modes at the MECP adds
another point of uncertainty. Increasing all of these to 100 cm1, or decreasing them to 25 cm1
leads to a decrease or an increase respectively in the computed rates by as much as an order of
magnitude. Finally, the computed rate is sensitive to the barrier height: increasing or decreasing it
by 1 kcal mol1 leads to a decrease or increase, respectively, of the computed rate at 300 K by
roughly a factor of four. As discussed below in the context of the QM/MM calculations, the
protein environment is certainly likely to modulate the height of the MECP, and as in the
Fe(CO)4 þ CO system, the uncertainties over the accuracy of the DFT description of the shape of
singlet and quintet potential energy surfaces, and more pertinently of their relative energetics,69
certainly also mean that the true barrier height might be somewhat diﬀerent from that used here.
Bearing in mind these uncertainties, the agreement with experiment is pleasing, although it
should be emphasised that joint changes in V12 , the MECP frequencies, and the particle in a
box/free rotor treatment of CO, could lead to the same computed rate.
QM/MM computations on myoglobin
In this part of the work, the aim is to understand whether the simpliﬁed, cluster, treatment of
geminate recombination, in which the rate is estimated from properties of the reactants and of the
MECP for a very small model is realistic. In fact, it is immediately clear that this model is not
appropriate. As discussed in the Introduction, it is known that at low temperatures, diﬀerent
conformations or substates of myoglobin exist, which interconvert more slowly than they undergo
geminate recombination, and which undergo the latter process at diﬀerent rates.17,18 This shows

that conformations of the protein chain around the haem centre do have an inﬂuence on the singlet
and quintet potential energy surfaces, and hence on the rate of recombination. To examine this
question, it is therefore necessary to obtain potential energy surfaces for the whole protein. This is
computationally rather diﬃcult or impossible at the DFT level of theory, so we have instead used a
hybrid QM/MM approach for this part of the work. Our results focus at ﬁrst on the geometry and
relative energy of the three key points on the potential energy surfaces for recombination, namely
the carbonmonoxy- singlet, and the deoxy- quintet and singlet.
Given the importance of obtaining a consistent conformation for the diﬀerent points considered,
a systematic procedure is used to generate the initial geometries for all optimisations. First of all,
crystallographic structure 1A6G of carbonmonoxy-myoglobin (obtained70 at a resolution of 1.15
A
˚ ) was downloaded in PDB format from the Protein Database. It was then converted to Tinker
XYZ format, which has the side-eﬀect of deleting the haem prosthetic group, all the waters of
crystallization, and the two sulfate counter-ions. The coordinates of the haem group were manually
retrieved from the PDB ﬁle and added to the Tinker XYZ ﬁle, with appropriate hydrogens. The
histidine residue in the distal pocket was treated as being protonated on the Nd atom, so that the
nitrogen oriented towards the iron atom and the CO ligand is unprotonated. Other polar residues
were treated as protonated or deprotonated in the standard way.
Using Tinker, a box of 900 TIP3P water molecules was constructed then equilibrated at 300 K
for 5 ps. A sphere of radius 16 A
˚ was selected from the resulting structure, and superimposed on the
myoglobin structure, centred on the iron atom, using the ‘‘Soak’’ routine in Tinker, so that water
molecules overlapping with atoms on the protein are deleted. The water molecules were then
equilibrated for 5 ps at 300 K, during which time they were prevented from ‘‘boiling oﬀ’’ by
applying a harmonic restraining potential beyond an Fe–O(water) distance of 20 A
˚ . During this
equilibration, the whole of the protein was maintained frozen. The ﬁnal structure contained ﬁve
water molecules in or very near either the proximal or the distal cavities around the haem group,
and these were then manually deleted. This leaves a system with a total of 3032 atoms, including
170 water molecules, and 2522 protein atoms. Then the whole structure was minimised to within a
gradient of 0.05 kcal mol1 A
˚ 1, in a stepwise manner designed to preserve the overall features of
the crystallographical structure. First, the position of all the hydrogen atoms was optimised whilst
keeping the heavy atoms ﬁxed, then the water molecules were optimised holding the protein ﬁxed,
and ﬁnally, all atoms except the iron atom, the CO ligand, the ﬁve coordinating nitrogen atoms,
and the 1504 atoms situated more than 15 A
˚ from the iron atom, were optimised. For all these
manipulations, a cutoﬀdistance of 8 A
˚ was used for non-bonded interactions. No cutoﬀs were used
in the QM/MM calculations. The CHARMM27 all-atom forceﬁeld50 was used throughout.
The QM subsystem was composed of the porphyrin ring, with four methyl and two vinyl side-
chains but without the two propionate side-chains, the iron atom, the CO ligand, and the imidazole
ring part of the proximal histidine ligand, bonded to iron through the Ne atom. Three link atom
connections were used: between the Cb of the porphyrin ring and the ﬁrst carbon atom of the two
propionate side-chains, and between the carbon atom of the imidazole ring and the b carbon of the
proximal histidine. This corresponds, in the case of the carbonyl complex, to a QM system with the
formal composition C32FeH28N6O, i.e. 68 atoms, including 3 capping hydrogen atoms. For the
dissociated state, we have simply removed the CO atoms from the initial structure for the car-
bonmonoxy- system, and carried out optimisation under the same conditions. In all QM/MM
optimisations, the 1504 distant atoms referred to above were frozen in position. The QM subsystem
of the optimised structure of the carbomonoxy-myoglobin is shown in Fig. 5.
Our results for the optimised geometries are rather similar to those described elsewhere.39,40 For
the carbonmonoxy- complex, as shown in Fig. 5, the CO ligand is almost orthogonal to the
porphyrin plane, with an Fe–C–O angle of 169, and N–Fe–C angles all close to 90. The Fe–C and
Fe–N distances are similar to those found both in model systems and in QM/MM calculations.
For the quintet fragment, we ﬁnd that the iron atom does not move very far out of plane, only by
0.17 A
˚ , versus 0.29 A
˚ in the model system.47 Sigfridsson and Ryde40 found in their study that the
distance out of the plane of the iron atom depends quite strongly on the orientation and
protonation state of the distal histidine residue. With the Nd-protonated case, like the one we use
here, the distance is quite small (0.34 A
˚ ), but it is much larger with the tautomeric Ne-protonated
histidine (0.50 A
˚ ). The singlet fragment, which does not appear to have been considered in previous
studies, adopts a geometry rather similar to that of the quintet fragment.

Of more interest here is the energetics of these three situations. Because we have modelled the
dissociated fragments without the CO molecule, we can only calculate bond energies relative to
the gas phase CO. This should not be very diﬀerent to the bond energy for the geminate system, as
the non-polar carbon monoxide does not interact strongly with the residues lining the distal cavity.
Using the full QM/MM energies, we calculate a bond energy BDE(Fe–CO) of 11.7 kcal mol1 for
dissociation of CO to give the quintet deoxy- state, and the singlet state of the deoxy- fragment is
computed to lie a further 1.7 kcal mol1 higher (DE(1,5)). The values obtained with the model
compound are quite diﬀerent, at respectively 17.7 and 5.8 kcal mol1.47 The model compound bond
energy, in particular, seemed to agree very well with an experimental bond energy for myoglobin,
reported as being 19  2 kcal mol1,71 so the present QM/MM energy appears to be much less
accurate.
We note that Sigfridsson and Ryde have also computed the bond energy with respect to the
quintet fragment using the B3LYP QM/MM method,40 and obtain a value much closer to their
(and our) gas-phase model values. With the Nd-protonated distal histidine, i.e. the system closest to
the one we have used, their BDE(Fe–CO) is 21.7 kcal mol1. The diﬀerence with our results may be
due to diﬀerences in basis sets or in the choice of QM subsystem (compared to ours, this addi-
tionally includes the imidazole part of the distal histidine, but includes less side-chains on the
porphyrin ring). More important is clearly the deﬁnition of the QM/MM bond energy. Our value
uses the full QM/MM energy, including the full MM energy for all MM atoms, the QM energy
(including the charge-charge and polarisation terms arising from the inclusion of the MM charges
in the one-electron Hamiltonian), the link atom terms, and the QM/MM van der Waals interac-
tions. This is the energy term which is optimised in our method. Sigfridsson and Ryde instead use
only the ‘‘QM’’ part, i.e. the QM total energies in the presence of the ﬁeld of MM charges.
QoMMMa also outputs these energies as part of the full calculation, and, using them, we obtain a
BDE(Fe–CO) of 18.1 kcal mol1, and a DE(1,5) of 4.4 kcal mol1. Whilst these energies are much
closer to the gas-phase, cluster model, QM values, there is no particular reason why one should
include only the QM part of the QM/MM interaction in calculations (for a discussion of this
question, see ref. 72).
In any case, as pointed out by Sigfridsson and Ryde,40 QM/MM energetics need to be treated
with caution, as small changes in the system setup can have quite a strong eﬀect on computed total
energies. ‘‘Experimental’’ energies are often in fact heavily dependent on a model to convert
observed rates or equilibria into energies. Also, the present QM/MM results are only preliminary,
and considerably more information is needed on the eﬀect of considering the other tautomer of the
distal histidine, other protein substates, etc. It may also be desirable to consider other QM
methods. Whilst B3LYP is certainly one of the most accurate functionals for the small G2 test set
of main-group compounds,73 and has been robustly argued to yield very accurate energetics in
a wide range of bioinorganic systems,74,75 it is not clear that it does always give quantitative
accuracy, especially where bonding to transition metals is concerned. For example, in our work on
Fig. 5
QM region of the QM/MM optimized structure of carbonmonoxy-myoglobin. The three capping
hydrogen atoms corresponding to the C–C bonds bridging the QM and MM regions are shown with a slightly
increased size.

Fe(CO)5 ,11 we found that B3LYP underestimated the ﬁrst CO dissociation energy. Other func-
tionals, such as B3PW91, gave larger values for the bond energy, which were in better agreement
with accurate ab initio computations and with experiment, although, as with bioinorganic systems,
both the ab initio and the experimental values do need to be treated with caution. It is however
conceivable that the agreement between the experimental, myoglobin BDE(Fe–CO)71 and the
computational, model compound value, is fortuitous, and that there really is a diﬀerence between
the gas-phase and the protein bond energy, which cancels out with some error in the B3LYP
description. Note that it is also uncertain whether B3LYP can be trusted to reproduce the spin-
state splitting accurately, although experience with other systems suggests that it should not be
badly wrong in the present case.69,76
Despite these caveats, the present computed very small value for the singlet/quintet spin-state
splitting is thought-provoking. The decrease in the energy splitting compared to the QM model
calculations could be due to the additional side-chains present in the QM/MM calculation,
although this seems unlikely, to artefacts in the QM/MM model, or to subtle eﬀects arising from
the interaction between the preferred geometries of the two states and the protein environment.
Certainly, if the splitting really is this small in the present system, it is likely that the MECP also lies
lower than in the gas-phase model, which would lead to higher recombination rates. It will be
highly interesting to compare the relative energetics obtained with e.g. the tautomer of the distal
histidine, in the presence of dissociated CO, and for other substates generated by sampling diﬀerent
geometries from molecular dynamics simulations of both the carbonmonoxy- and deoxy- forms of
the protein. Previous work using molecular mechanics66 suggests that rather diﬀerent energetics for
the two states and the crossing point should be found in such cases.
Conclusions
In this work, we present two extensions to our earlier work on the intrinsic barrier to geminate
recombination of CO in haem proteins. First, we use non-adiabatic transition state theory to model
the rate for recombination using a combination of computed properties of the MECP between
singlet and quintet surfaces in a model of the haem centre, and some reasonable assumptions
concerning other parameters. This leads to a computed rate in fair agreement with experiment, and
to the conclusion that CO recombination at room temperature is highly non-adiabatic, with the
probability for spin-ﬂip at the MECP estimated to be less than 1% on average. This conclusion,
based on potential energy surfaces for a model system, will need to be revisited based on the
surfaces present in the full protein. As a ﬁrst step towards obtaining the latter, we present QM/
MM computations of the geometry and energetics of carbonmonoxy- and deoxymyoglobin, using
a new QM/MM code, QoMMMa. The bond energy and singlet/quintet spin-state splitting are
found to be smaller than in the gas-phase model, although only one conformational substate has
been considered so far.
