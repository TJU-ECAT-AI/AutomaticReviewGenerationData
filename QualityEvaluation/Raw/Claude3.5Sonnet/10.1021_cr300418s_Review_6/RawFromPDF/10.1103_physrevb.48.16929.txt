The generalization
of the local-density-approximation
method
for the systems
with strong
Coulomb
correlations
is proposed,
which restores
the discontinuity
in the one-electron
potential
as in the exact
density functional.
The method
is based on the model-Hamiltonian
approach
and allows us to take into
account the nonsphericity
of the Coulomb
and exchange interactions.
The calculation
scheme could be
regarded
as a first-principle
method
due to the absence of adjustable
parameters.
The method
was ap-
plied to the calculation
of the photoemission
(x-ray photoemission
spectroscopy)
and bremsstrahlung
isochromat
spectra of NiO.
What is the main problem
in applying
the local-density
approximation
(LDA) to the systems
with localized
elec-
trons?
Perdew
et al. ' considered
the problem
of a free
single atom in a reservoir
with which
it could exchange
electrons
(open system).
They showed
that
in this case
the exact density
functional
(although
still unknown)
re-
sults in a dependence
of the total energy
on the number
of electrons E (N) as a series of straight-line
segments:
E(N+x) =(1
x)E~+xE—
~+, ,
where E~ and Ez+, are ground-state
energies
for the N
and %+1 electrons.
The curve itself is continuous,
but
its derivative
BE/BN has discontinuities
at integral
values
of X.
E(M)
E(M —
1), M
—
—
1 &N &M
E(M+1)—
E(M),
M &N &M+1
(M is an integer
value).
The same is true for the one-
electron
potential
V(r) =M/5n(r),
which
should
jump
discontinuously
when
the
number
of electrons
goes
through
an integer value.
All actual calculations
for real systems
are performed
in the LDA, where
the function E versus N and all its
derivatives
are continuous.
The absence of the potential
jump,
which
appears
for the exact density
functional,
is
the reason for LDA failure in describing
the band gap of
Mott insulators
such as transition
metal
and rare-earth
compounds.
Gunnarsson
and
Schonhammer
showed
that
the discontinuity
in the one-electron
potential
can
give a large contribution
to the band gap.
In
Ref.
3
we
suggested
a
way
to
overcome
this
deficiency
of the LDA by adding
an orbital-dependent
correction
to LDA potentials
(the
so-called
LDA+ U
method).
LDA equations
themselves
are constructed
as a
mean-field
[Hartree-Fock
(HF)] theory and they could be
modified to take into account an on-site Coulomb interac-
tion
U.
One can look at the LDA as an analog
of a
homogeneous
solution of the HF equations.
This means
that the LDA gives the correct solution of the HF equa-
where J is the exchange parameter.
The one-electron
po-
tentials
V
are orbital dependent
in this approximation:
V
= VLD~+QU(n
np).
—
m'
+ g
( U —
J)(n
~ —
np) .
(4)
With
this
orbital-dependent
LDA+ U potential
orbital
polarization
becomes possible and the Mott-Hubbard
gap
appears
in the single-particle
spectrum.
We showed that
this method
is rather
successful
in the description
of the
electronic
structure
of a variety
of 3d transition
metals
compounds,
yielding
order-of-magnitude
improvements
on conventional
LDA results.
'
The above scheme
is based on the suggestion
that the
LDA corresponds
to the homogeneous
solution
of the
HF equations
with
equal
(averaged)
occupancy
of all d
orbitals.
But is it the best way to set the relationship
be-
tween the LDA and a model Hamiltonian
approach?
If
one follows the arguments
of Perdew et al. ' then one can
see that the main difference between the LDA and the ex-
tions
when
variational
freedom
is restricted
by the re-
quirement
that the occupancies of all d orbitals are equal
(averaged):
n
= np =g
n
/10. (The output
orbital
occupancies
can be different
in LDA calculations
due to
the crystal field splitting,
but as the potential
in the LDA
is a functional
of the charge density,
which
is defined
by
the total or averaged
per orbita1 number
of d electrons,
and this potential
is the same for all d orbitals,
then the
HF analog of the LDA should
have equal orbital occu-
pancies. ) Then the variational
space can be extended
by
adding to the LDA functional
a correction corresponding
to the deviation
of the orbital occupancies
n
from the
average on no..

act density
functional
is that
in the latter the potential
must
jump
discontinuously
as % increases
through
in-
teger values and in the former the potential
is a continu-
ous function
of the number
of electrons X. The second
important
fact is that while LDA orbital energies
[which
are derivatives
of the total energy
on orbital occupation
numbers
n; (e;= BE/Bn; )] are often in rather
bad agree-
ment with experiment
or more rigorous
calculations,
the
LDA total energy
is usually
quite
good (this is demon-
strated
by the LDA success to give correct crystal struc-
ture
and
equilibrium
volume
and
even
the
properties
defined
by the second derivative
of total energy
such as
phonon
frequency
). A good example
is a hydrogen
atom
where
the LDA orbital
energy
is —
0.54 Ry (instead of
—
1.0 Ry) but the total energy
( —
0.96 Ry) is quite close
to —
1.0 Ry.
The main idea of our LDA+ U method
is
the same as the Anderson
impurity
model:
to separate
electrons into two subsystems —
localized d or f electrons
for which
the Coulomb
d-d interaction
should
be taken
into account
by a term ,
' Ug;&
—n;n in a
m. odel Hamil-
tonian
and delocalized
s and p electrons
which
could be
described
by using
an orbital-independent
one-electron
potential
(LDA). Let us consider a d ion as an open sys-
tem with a Auctuating
number of d electrons.
The above
arguments
allow
us to suggest
that the Coulomb
energy
of d-d interactions
as a function of the number of d elec-
trons N given by the LDA is a good approximation
[but
not the orbital
energies
(eigenvalues)].
The correct for-
mula for this energy
should be E = UN(N —
1)/2. If we
subtract
this expression
from the LDA total energy func-
tional
and
add
a Hubbard-like
term
(neglecting
for a
while exchange
and nonsphericity)
we will have the fol-
lowing functional:
E =EiD~ —
UN(N —
1)/2+ —,

The orbital energies e, are derivatives
of (5) on orbital oc-
cupations
n,.:
e =BE/Bil =
. ti Dp + U( —

~ )
This simple
formula
gives the shift of the LDA orbital
energy —
U/2 for occupied
orbitals
(n; = I) and + U/2
for unoccupied
orbitals
(n; =0). A similar
formula
is
found
for
the
orbital-dependent
potential
[ V, (r)
=5E/5n, (r) where
variation
is taken
not on the total
charge density n(r) but on the charge density of a partic-
ular ith orbital n;(r)]:

In the LDA exchange
is partially
taken into account
in
such a way that the number
of electrons
with
different
spin projection
are equal (Nt =N&, N=N&+N&).
That
leads to the following
expression
for the LDA Coulomb
energy of d-d interactions
as a function
of total number
of d electrons X:
UN(N —
1)/2
JN(N —
2)/4 —
.
Finally
we could taken into account
nonsphericity
of
the Coulomb
and exchange
interactions,
i.e., dependence
on what particular
d orbitals
m and I' are occupied
by
introducing
matrices
U
~ and J
duces
this jump.
Again
we could
look at a hydrogen
atom H.
In this case U=0. 945 Ry and eID~= —
0.54
Ry.
If we consider the "spin-up" orbital to be occupied
(n& =1) and
the
"spin-down"
orbital
to
be
empty
(ni =0), then et= —
1.0125 Ry and
e&—
0.0675 Ry. It
looks quite reasonable.
The ionization
potential
for H is
exactly
1 Ry and the electron affinity is —
0.055 Ry.
Expression
(6) could remind
us of the "transition state"
approximation
of Slater. '
Slater showed that the excita-
tion energy
defined
as a difference of total energies
in the
final and initial
states [for example,
the removal
energy
E(N —
1)
E(N—
)] could be approximated
with good ac-
curacy
by LDA orbital
energies
(one-electron
eigenval-
ues), calculated
not
in the ground
state but
in the so-
called transition
state with occupancies
halfway
between
the
final
and
initial
states.
For the removal
energy
it
means
e(N —
—,
') and for additional
energy e(N+ —,
'). If
we suggested
that the LDA gives the d-d interaction
en-
ergy
in a form
UN(N —
1)/2, then
the derivative
of e
over N is equal to Uand e(N —
—,
')=e(N) —
U/2, e(N+ —,
')
=e(N)+U/2.
Comparing
this with
expression
(6) one
can see that our corrected
orbital
energies
for occupied
orbitals
correspond
to the removal
energies
in the transi-
tion state approximation
and orbital energies for unoccu-
pied orbitals correspond
to the addition
energies.
The functional
(5) neglects exchange
and nonsphericity
of the Coulomb d-d interaction.
If we take into account
exchange,
then for electrons
with
the same spin projec-
tion o, the interaction
energy
will be (U —
J), and with
different
spin it is still U:
V&{r)=ViD~{r)+ U( 2

Expression
(7) restores the discontinuous
behavior of the
one-electron
potential
of the
exact
density-functional
theory.
In Ref. 1 it was shown that the maximum
occu-

Kahn-Sham
orbital
energy e,„jumps
by
[E(N+1) E(N)]—
[E(N) —
E(N —
1)] (which—
is equal
to the Coulomb parameter
U by definition,
if one neglects
the
hybridization
9)
when
the
number
of electrons
changes from N —
5 to N+5. From (6) one can see that if
for N electrons the ith orbital is occupied and the jth or-
bital
is empty,
then e,„=e; for the
1V —
6 case and
e,„=e for N+5. As (e —

cannot
be
treated
in
this
way,
i.e.,
(mm'~l/r&z~m
"m"'). These types of terms,
which
are
very
important
in
atomic
multiplet
theory,
are
still
neglected.
To take this into account
we would
have to
abandon
the concept of an orbital energy and also the use
of a single Slater determinant
to describe the states of the
system.
The same
type of problem
occurs
in treating
only the z component
of the spin and thereby
neglecting
terms
such as JS& Sz, which
again are so important
in
multiplet
theory.
We remind
the reader
that
two elec-
trons
in difFerent
orbitals
with
an exchange
interaction
JS&Sz form a triplet and a singlet with an energy splitting
of J whereas if we consider
only the z component
of this
spin JS&,Sz, the splitting
between
ferromagnetic
and an-
tiferromagnetic
configurations
is J/2.
This stresses
the
importance
of the spin-Hip
terms which cannot be incor-
porated into a single-particle
potential.
We can now write
the total energy
functional
in the

In order to calculate
the matrices
U
~ and J
~ one
should
know the Slater integrals F"(F,F,F for d elec-
trons).
In Ref. 9 we showed that the Coulomb
parameter
U, which
we calculate
in the supercell
approximation,
could be identified
with the Slater integral F . What
is
the
relationship
between
exchange
parameter J and
E,F
integrals?
If we
average
matrices
U
~
and
(U
.—
J
.) over all possible
pairs of mm'
we should
obtain
U and U —
J as in expression
(8). Using properties
of the Clebsch-Gordan
coe%cients
one can prove
that
this averaging
gives

(17)
To define
all three
Slater
integrals
from
U and J one
needs to know
only the ratio F /F . In Ref. 11 F
and
F"are tabulated
for all 3d. The ratio E /E
for all ions is

of (13) over orbital

between 0.62 and 0.63. So we fixed the value of this ratio
at 0.625. Then the expressions
for the Slater integrals
are

(19)
The screened Coulomb
and exchange parameters
U and J
are calculated
self-consistently
in the supercell
approxi-
mation as described
in Ref. 9. Expressions
(9)—
(19) define
the version of our LDA + U method.
One could consid-
er it as one step further
from local-density
approximation
to exact density
functional.
The first step
was the so-
called
local spin
density
approximation
(LSDA) where,
instead
of a functional
of total charge
density E[n(r)],
the functional
of two spin densities E [n &(r),n&(r)] was
introduced.
Quite
naturally
the next step is to define a
functional
of spin orbita1 -densities E[[n
(r))] and ex-
pressions
(13) and (14) give this type of functional.
The
most important
property
of this functional
is the discon-
tinuity of the potential
and the maximum
occupied orbit-
al
energy
e „as the
number
of electrons
increases
through
an integer
value,
the absence
of which
is the
main
deficiency of the local-density
approximation
com-
paring
with the exact density
functional'
as far as band
gaps are concerned.
We applied
this scheme to the linear
muffin-tin
orbital
(LMTO) method
in two versions:
atomic sphere approxi-
mations
(ASA's) in orthogonal
representation'
and the
more rigorous full-potential
(FP-LMTO) version of Meth-
fessel. '
The earlier variant of our scheme
[Eqs. (3) and
(4)] was used in the ASA-LMTO method.
We chose NiO
as the object of the investigation
because a lot of the ex-
perimental
and theoretical
work
was performed
for this
compound.
The results for the magnetic
moments
value
are rather close in both methods:
1.6—
1.7p~ per Ni atom.
The energy
gap value
is more sensitive
to the choice of
the method
and to the details
of the calculation.
The
most accurate calculations
(with a filling of the interstitial
sites
with
the
empty
spheres
and
with
the
maximum
basis-orbital
set on every sphere) results
in an energy
gap
of 3.4 eV in the ASA-LMTO
calculation
and 3.7 eV in
the FP-LMTO calculation
[the experimental
value
is 4.3
eV (Ref. 14)]. It is worth mentioning
that in less accurate
calculations,
for example,
without
empty
spheres or with
the
smaller
basis-orbital
set,
the
results
could
vary
significantly:
in the
range
3.0—
3.4 eV in ASA-LMTO
and 3.7—
4.2 eV in FP-LMTO.
We used the FP-LMTO
method for further calculations.
It was pointed out above that in our method
the orbital
one-electron
energies of occupied
states have a meaning
of removal
energies
and those of the empty
states corre-
spond to the addition
energies.
If it is so, is it possible to
reproduce
photoemission
spectra and bremsstrahlung
iso-
chromat
spectroscopy
(BIS) of NiO by the results of our
LDA + U calculations?
Figure
1 shows the total and partial
densities of states
(DOS) for the valence band of NiO.
One can see a rather
broad
( =7.5 eV width)
band with strongly
mixed Ni 3d
and 0 2p states.
That
is in striking
contrast
with
the
standard
LSDA calculations'
where
Ni 3d bands
are
above the oxygen
bands
and those two groups of bands

are well separated.
The reason for this is the shift down
in energy
for occupied
d orbitals
due to the LDA+ U
correction.
The energy of unhybridized
occupied d orbit-
als is now even lower than the 0 2p orbitals and in the re-
sult the top of the valence band of NiO has predominant-
ly 0 2p character with a strong admixture
of Ni 3d states.
If we compare
this result
with
the experimental
photo-
emission
spectrum
of NiO
(upper
curve
on Fig. 3) one
can see that the experimental
band
is broader
and that
there is the strong
peak at the lowest binding
energy of
the experimental
spectrum
which
is absent
in calculated
DOS.
It is known
that configuration
interaction
calculations
based
on the model
Hamiltonian
approach
were
quite
successful in describing
photoemission
spectra of strongly
correlated
systems. ' '
What is the possible relationship
between LDA+ U and those models?
We showed
above
that
in our method
one-electron
energies of occupied
d
orbitals
correspond
to the removal
energy of the d shell
and in the configuration
interaction
calculation
it is the
energy of the configuration
~d ) for NiO. LDA+ U can
even
partially
imitate
multiplet
splitting
for
this
configuration
by
different
one-electron
energies
for
different
d orbitals
due to the nonspherical
Coulomb
and
exchange
interactions
[U
.,J
~ matrices
in (14)]. In a
model
Hamiltonian
approach
the
photoemission
spec-
trum
is calculated
as a distribution
of the
final
states
which are linear combination
of configurations
~d ) and
~d I.).' '
Both of these configurations
have
multiplet
structure
and
the
resulting
Hamiltonian
matrix
and
many-electron
wave
functions
are rather
complicated.
This complex picture can be crudely approximated
in the
following
way.
In the final state of the photoemission
removal
process
(before hybridization
with oxygen states is taken into ac-
count) there are three holes in the d shell which can be in
three
configurations:
~es&eg't ), ~egt t2g& ), and
~es&tz~& )
neglecting
off-diagonal
Coulomb interactions
as discussed
above.
The first configuration
(e
) hybridizes
with oxy-
gen
2p states
with
a-bond
hopping
parameter.
In this
simplified
scheme in order to take into account three pos-
sible ways of hybridization
corresponding
to three holes
this hopping
parameter
is multiplied
by V3 (Ref. 16) in
the spirit of the 1/I. approximation
by Gunnarsson
and
Schonhammer'
where L is the orbital
degeneracy.
In
this way we collected the hybridization
of each of the one
electron
orbitals
in the
configuration
in an
effectively
larger one for the complete configuration.
The other two
configurations
(e t') can hybridize
with oxygen
2p states
by two possible
ways: through
the e
channel,
with a 0.-
bond hopping
parameter
multiplied
by &2, and through
the t2
channel,
with a m.-bond hopping
parameter.
This
scheme could be easily simulated
in the LDA+ U calcula-
tions.
The energy of the
~ e
&e
& ) configuration
is the re-
moval
energy of e
& states
and
in our method
it is the
one-electron
energy
of
occupied
e
&
orbitals.
For
configurations
~es&tz
& ) and
~e it&st ) it will be the one-
electron
energies
of t2g& and
t2g~ orbitals,
respectively.
For every configuration
we performed
calculations
where
only
corresponding
d orbitals
were
taken
into account
with
the proper
factor increasing
hopping
parameters.
The partial
density of Ni 3d states obtained
in this calcu-
lation
is presented

Comparing
with Fig.
1 one can see that the result of
stronger
hybridization
is that peaks appear
2 eV higher
than
in the "nonmodified"
calculation
and also the "sa-
tellite" peaks around
8—
9 eV become more pronounced.
This result
is very similar
to the one obtained
from the
model Hamiltonian
calculations
where the first ionization
states are of 3d
symmetry
pushed
out of the top of the 0
2p band because of strong hybridization.
In the case of
the high-T,
compounds
or CuO these are the Zhang-Rice
singlets. '
We summed
the
curves
of Fig. 2 with
the
proper weights
and broadened
them corresponding
to ex-
perimental
resolution.
[We note that in x-ray photoemis-
sion spectroscopy
(XPS) it is mainly
the Ni 3d density of
states which
is probed. ] The result, together
with the ex-
perimental
XPS for NiO, is shown
in Fig. 3. Two main
features
of the experimental
curve —
"the main line" on
the top and the "satellite" around
8 eV—
are reproduced
in the calculated
spectrum.
In the final state of the BIS for NiO there is only one
hole in the d shell in configuration
e'~ ). In our approxi-
mated
scheme
it means
that
we can use the density
of
unoccupied
states obtained
in the calculation
without
any
renormalization
of the hopping
parameters
for the com-
parison
with the experimental
HIS (Ref. 14) or NiO (Fig.
4). The first peak in Fig. 4 corresponds
to Ni 3d states
and the rest of the spectrum
corresponds
to Ni 4s and
4p-derived
bands.
The 4s and 4p bands start immediately
above the Ni 3d empty
band,
but their intensity
is very
low and becomes significant
only 5 eV higher than the Ni
3d peak. It is worth mentioning
that the good agreement
in the relative
position of the Ni 3d peak and the 4s and
4p bands
is due
to the LDA+ U potential
correction
which
pushes
up the
energy
of the unoccupied
Ni 3d
states.
Without
such a correction
(in standard
LDA) the
Ni 3d peak is significantly
lower in energy
( = 3 eV).
Naturally
our scheme
is too oversimplified
to repro-
duce all details of experimental
spectra.
The remarkable
lack of intensity
in the calculated
photoemission
spectra
around
2 eV compared
with the shoulder
in this energy
region for experimental
spectra is, in our opinion,
due to
the fact that in the full configuration
interaction
calcula-
tion
there
are
also
states
which
do not
hybridize
as
strongly
as the factor of V 3 suggests.
In
summary,
we
propose
the
generalization
of the
local-density
approximation
based on the model
Hamil-
tonian
approach
which
restores
the discontinuity
in the
one-electron
potential
as in the exact density-functional
theory.
In order to calculate
photoemission
spectra of
the strongly
correlated
systems,
such as Ni0, it is neces-
sary to renormalize
the Ni 3d—
0 2p hopping
parameters
in the spirit of the 1/I. approximation.
Although
the
method
presented
here can yield
quite
accurate
results
for magnetic
moments
and band gaps, we note that it is
still a mean
field method
in which electron
removal
and
addition
states
are represented
by
single
Slater
deter-
minants.
Because of this, multiplet
structures
cannot be
properly
described
and
phenomena
such
as
spectral
weight transfers,
which are so characteristic
of correlated
systems,
are absent.
