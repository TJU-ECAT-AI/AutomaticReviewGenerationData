[1] "For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2"

[2] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e. involving surface oxygens from ceria."

[3] "Indeed, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the reactant molecule (e.g., CO) adsorbs on the catalyst surface and reacts with lattice oxygen to form the product (e.g., CO2). This process creates an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface. The vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from another source (e.g., H2O or O2), completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more easily reducible, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a more reducible oxide can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become over-reduced, potentially leading to structural instability or loss of active sites.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as a descriptor of the oxide's redox properties. It provides insight into the ease with which the oxide can participate in redox reactions, which is fundamental to many catalytic processes. A balanced ΔEv is often desirable - low enough to allow facile oxygen transfer but high enough to maintain the structural integrity of the catalyst. Therefore, understanding and tuning ΔEv through methods such as doping can be a powerful approach to optimizing oxide catalysts for specific reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。在这种机理中，反应物分子（如CO）吸附在催化剂表面，并与晶格氧反应形成产物（如CO2）。这个过程在氧化物表面创造了一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被来自另一个源（如H2O或O2）的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物更容易被还原，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为更容易还原的氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会过度还原，可能导致结构不稳定或活性位点的丧失。

ΔEv的重要性在于它作为氧化物氧化还原性质的描述符。它提供了氧化物参与氧化还原反应的容易程度的洞察，这对许多催化过程至关重要。平衡的ΔEv通常是理想的 - 足够低以允许容易的氧转移，但又足够高以维持催化剂的结构完整性。因此，通过掺杂等方法理解和调节ΔEv可以成为优化特定反应的氧化物催化剂的有力方法。
