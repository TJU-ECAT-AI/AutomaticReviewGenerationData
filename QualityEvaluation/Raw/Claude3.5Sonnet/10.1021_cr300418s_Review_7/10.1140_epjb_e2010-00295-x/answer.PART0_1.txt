[1] "For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2"

[2] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e. involving surface oxygens from ceria."

[3] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, reactant molecules (like CO) adsorb on the catalyst surface and react with oxygen atoms from the oxide lattice, forming products (like CO2). This process creates oxygen vacancies in the oxide. The reduced oxide surface is then re-oxidized by other oxidizing species (like H2O or O2), completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more easily reduced, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because:

1. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions.
2. Lower ΔEv often corresponds to easier re-oxidation of the reduced surface, allowing for faster catalytic cycles.

However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide might become overly reduced and lose its structural integrity or ability to effectively re-oxidize. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv is necessary for balancing reactivity and stability in oxide catalysts.

The significance of ΔEv extends to the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Oxides with moderate ΔEv values often exhibit the best oxidizing properties, as they can readily provide oxygen for reactions without becoming permanently reduced. This balance is critical for sustained catalytic performance in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机制中，反应分子（如CO）吸附在催化剂表面，并与氧化物晶格中的氧原子反应，形成产物（如CO2）。这个过程在氧化物中创造了氧空位。然后，还原的氧化物表面被其他氧化物种（如H2O或O2）重新氧化，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物更容易被还原，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为：

1. 氧空位的形成更容易，有利于释放晶格氧进行氧化反应。
2. 较低的ΔEv通常对应于还原表面更容易再氧化，允许更快的催化循环。

然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会过度还原并失去其结构完整性或有效再氧化的能力。因此，最佳的ΔEv对于平衡氧化物催化剂的反应性和稳定性是必要的。

ΔEv的重要性延伸到氧化物表面的氧化能力。具有适中ΔEv值的氧化物通常表现出最佳的氧化性能，因为它们可以readily提供氧用于反应，而不会永久还原。这种平衡对于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中持续的催化性能至关重要。
