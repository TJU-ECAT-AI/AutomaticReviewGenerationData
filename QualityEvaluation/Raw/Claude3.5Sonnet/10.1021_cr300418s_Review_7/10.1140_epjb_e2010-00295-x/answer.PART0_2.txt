[1] "The current study has been undertaken with the purpose to determine and understand the main factor(s) influencing the reducibility of Ir-doped ceria."

[2] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e. involving surface oxygens from ceria."

[3] "Indeed, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of surface oxygen atoms from the oxide catalyst. In this process, surface oxygen atoms react with adsorbed molecules, creating oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. These vacancies are then refilled by gas-phase oxygen or by oxygen from the bulk of the oxide.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more easily reducible, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a more reducible oxide can more readily provide oxygen atoms for the oxidation reaction, facilitating the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as an indicator of the oxide's reducibility and, consequently, its potential catalytic performance. Catalysts with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies are often more active in oxidation reactions, as they can more easily participate in the redox cycles involved in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher activity, the optimal value may depend on the specific reaction and conditions, as extremely low ΔEv could lead to over-oxidation or catalyst instability.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物催化剂表面氧原子的参与。在这个过程中，表面氧原子与吸附的分子反应，在催化剂表面创造氧空位。这些空位随后被气相氧或氧化物体相中的氧所填充。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物更容易被还原，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为更易还原的氧化物可以更容易地提供氧原子用于氧化反应，从而促进Mars-van Krevelen机理的进行。

ΔEv的重要性在于它作为氧化物可还原性的指标，进而反映其潜在的催化性能。具有较低氧空位形成能的催化剂在氧化反应中通常更活跃，因为它们可以更容易地参与Mars-van Krevelen机理中涉及的氧化还原循环。然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的活性，但最佳值可能取决于特定的反应和条件，因为极低的ΔEv可能导致过度氧化或催化剂不稳定。
