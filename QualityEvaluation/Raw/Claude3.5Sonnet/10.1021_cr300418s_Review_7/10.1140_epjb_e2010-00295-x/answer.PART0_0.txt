[1] "Experiments have demonstrated that ceria doping can efficiently improve its reducibility and catalytic redox activity [13,14]."

[2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[3] "Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been found to be highly active and selective for hydrogen production by oxidation stream reforming of ethanol. The promotion effect was partly attributed to the enhanced reducibility and oxygen storage-release capacity of Ir/CeO2 as compared with pure ceria [20,21]."

[4] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e. involving surface oxygens from ceria."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, a surface oxygen atom from the oxide catalyst is consumed to oxidize the reactant molecule, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase or from the bulk of the oxide, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity. This is because it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, making them more readily available for oxidation reactions. The easier formation of oxygen vacancies also facilitates the regeneration of the catalyst surface.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ΔEv is directly related to the strength of the metal-oxygen bond in the oxide. A lower ΔEv implies weaker metal-oxygen bonds, which means the oxide can more easily release its oxygen for oxidation reactions. This translates to a higher oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

3. Redox properties: The ΔEv is an important indicator of the oxide's reducibility. Materials with lower ΔEv values are more easily reduced, which is beneficial for many catalytic reactions involving redox cycles.

4. Oxygen mobility: Lower ΔEv values are often associated with higher oxygen mobility within the oxide. This property is important for the replenishment of surface oxygen vacancies from the bulk, maintaining the catalyst's activity.

5. Catalyst design: Understanding the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic performance helps in the rational design of more efficient catalysts. For example, doping ceria with certain elements can lower the ΔEv, enhancing its catalytic properties.

In summary, the ΔEv is a critical parameter in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, influencing the ease of oxygen release, catalyst regeneration, and overall catalytic performance. It serves as a valuable guide in understanding and improving oxide catalysts for various oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机理中，氧化物催化剂的表面氧原子被消耗以氧化反应物分子，在催化剂表面产生氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相或氧化物体相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性。这是因为从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，使它们更容易参与氧化反应。氧空位的更容易形成也有助于催化剂表面的再生。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv直接与氧化物中金属-氧键的强度相关。较低的ΔEv意味着金属-氧键较弱，这意味着氧化物可以更容易地释放其氧用于氧化反应。这转化为氧化物表面更高的氧化能力。

3. 氧化还原性质：ΔEv是氧化物可还原性的重要指标。具有较低ΔEv值的材料更容易被还原，这对许多涉及氧化还原循环的催化反应有利。

4. 氧移动性：较低的ΔEv值通常与氧化物内部更高的氧移动性相关。这个性质对于从体相补充表面氧空位很重要，维持催化剂的活性。

5. 催化剂设计：理解ΔEv与催化性能之间的关系有助于理性设计更高效的催化剂。例如，用某些元素掺杂氧化铈可以降低ΔEv，增强其催化性能。

总之，ΔEv是Mars-van Krevelen机理中的一个关键参数，影响氧释放的容易程度、催化剂再生和整体催化性能。它作为理解和改进各种氧化反应的氧化物催化剂的有价值指南。
