[1] "Experiments have demonstrated that ceria doping can efficiently improve its reducibility and catalytic redox activity [13,14]."

[2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

[3] "Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been found to be highly active and selective for hydrogen production by oxidation stream reforming of ethanol. The promotion effect was partly attributed to the enhanced reducibility and oxygen storage-release capacity of Ir/CeO2 as compared with pure ceria [20,21]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, a surface oxygen atom from the oxide catalyst is consumed to oxidize the reactant molecule, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase or from the bulk of the oxide, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity. This is because it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, making them more readily available for oxidation reactions. The easier formation of oxygen vacancies also facilitates the regeneration of the catalyst surface.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ΔEv is directly related to the strength of the metal-oxygen bond in the oxide. A lower ΔEv implies weaker metal-oxygen bonds, which means the oxide can more easily release its oxygen for oxidation reactions. This translates to a higher oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

3. Redox properties: The ΔEv is an important indicator of the oxide's reducibility. Materials with lower ΔEv values are more easily reduced, which is beneficial for many catalytic reactions involving redox cycles.

4. Oxygen mobility: Lower ΔEv values are often associated with higher oxygen mobility within the oxide. This property is important for the replenishment of surface oxygen vacancies from the bulk, maintaining the catalyst's activity.

5. Catalyst design: Understanding the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic performance helps in the rational design of more efficient catalysts. For example, doping ceria with certain elements can lower the ΔEv, enhancing its catalytic properties.

In summary, the ΔEv is a critical parameter in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, influencing the ease of oxygen release, catalyst regeneration, and overall catalytic performance. It serves as a valuable guide in understanding and improving oxide catalysts for various oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机理中，氧化物催化剂的表面氧原子被消耗以氧化反应物分子，在催化剂表面产生氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相或氧化物体相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性。这是因为从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，使它们更容易参与氧化反应。氧空位的更容易形成也有助于催化剂表面的再生。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv直接与氧化物中金属-氧键的强度相关。较低的ΔEv意味着金属-氧键较弱，这意味着氧化物可以更容易地释放其氧用于氧化反应。这转化为氧化物表面更高的氧化能力。

3. 氧化还原性质：ΔEv是氧化物可还原性的重要指标。具有较低ΔEv值的材料更容易被还原，这对许多涉及氧化还原循环的催化反应有利。

4. 氧移动性：较低的ΔEv值通常与氧化物内部更高的氧移动性相关。这个性质对于从体相补充表面氧空位很重要，维持催化剂的活性。

5. 催化剂设计：理解ΔEv与催化性能之间的关系有助于理性设计更高效的催化剂。例如，用某些元素掺杂氧化铈可以降低ΔEv，增强其催化性能。

总之，ΔEv是Mars-van Krevelen机理中的一个关键参数，影响氧释放的容易程度、催化剂再生和整体催化性能。它作为理解和改进各种氧化反应的氧化物催化剂的有价值指南。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, reactant molecules (like CO) adsorb on the catalyst surface and react with oxygen atoms from the oxide lattice, forming products (like CO2). This process creates oxygen vacancies in the oxide. The reduced oxide surface is then re-oxidized by other oxidizing species (like H2O or O2), completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more easily reduced, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because:

1. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions.
2. Lower ΔEv often corresponds to easier re-oxidation of the reduced surface, allowing for faster catalytic cycles.

However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide might become overly reduced and lose its structural integrity or ability to effectively re-oxidize. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv is necessary for balancing reactivity and stability in oxide catalysts.

The significance of ΔEv extends to the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Oxides with moderate ΔEv values often exhibit the best oxidizing properties, as they can readily provide oxygen for reactions without becoming permanently reduced. This balance is critical for sustained catalytic performance in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机制中，反应分子（如CO）吸附在催化剂表面，并与氧化物晶格中的氧原子反应，形成产物（如CO2）。这个过程在氧化物中创造了氧空位。然后，还原的氧化物表面被其他氧化物种（如H2O或O2）重新氧化，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物更容易被还原，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为：

1. 氧空位的形成更容易，有利于释放晶格氧进行氧化反应。
2. 较低的ΔEv通常对应于还原表面更容易再氧化，允许更快的催化循环。

然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会过度还原并失去其结构完整性或有效再氧化的能力。因此，最佳的ΔEv对于平衡氧化物催化剂的反应性和稳定性是必要的。

ΔEv的重要性延伸到氧化物表面的氧化能力。具有适中ΔEv值的氧化物通常表现出最佳的氧化性能，因为它们可以readily提供氧用于反应，而不会永久还原。这种平衡对于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机理的氧化反应中持续的催化性能至关重要。

In this process, surface oxygen atoms react with adsorbed molecules, creating oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. These vacancies are then refilled by gas-phase oxygen or by oxygen from the bulk of the oxide.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as an indicator of the oxide's reducibility and, consequently, its potential catalytic performance. Catalysts with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies are often more active in oxidation reactions, as they can more easily participate in the redox cycles involved in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher activity, the optimal value may depend on the specific reaction and conditions, as extremely low ΔEv could lead to over-oxidation or catalyst instability.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the following steps:

1. CO adsorbs on the metal catalyst surface
2. CO reacts with lattice oxygen from the oxide support at the metal-support interface, forming CO2
3. This creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide support
4. The reduced oxide support is then re-oxidized by another oxidant (e.g. H2O, O2), regenerating the catalyst

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because:

1. It is a measure of the reducibility of the oxide support
2. Lower ΔEv indicates the oxide can more easily release lattice oxygen to participate in oxidation reactions
3. This correlates with higher catalytic activity, as the oxygen transfer process is more facile
4. It also indicates stronger oxidizing ability of the surface, as oxygen can be more readily extracted

Thus, ΔEv serves as an important descriptor for the redox properties and catalytic performance of oxide catalysts operating via a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism. Catalysts with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies tend to show enhanced activity for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理包括以下步骤：

1. CO吸附在金属催化剂表面
2. CO在金属-支撑体界面与氧化物支撑体中的晶格氧反应，形成CO2
3. 这在氧化物支撑体中创造了一个氧空位
4. 还原的氧化物支撑体随后被另一种氧化剂（如H2O、O2）重新氧化，从而再生催化剂

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它是氧化物支撑体可还原性的度量
2. 较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易地释放晶格氧参与氧化反应
3. 这与更高的催化活性相关，因为氧转移过程更容易进行
4. 它还表明表面具有更强的氧化能力，因为氧可以更容易地被提取

因此，ΔEv作为一个重要的描述符，用于表征通过Mars-van Krevelen型机理运作的氧化物催化剂的氧化还原性质和催化性能。具有较低氧空位形成能的催化剂往往表现出增强的氧化反应活性。

A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more easily reducible, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a more reducible oxide can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become over-reduced, potentially leading to structural instability or loss of active sites.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as a descriptor of the oxide's redox properties. It provides insight into the ease with which the oxide can participate in redox reactions, which is fundamental to many catalytic processes. A balanced ΔEv is often desirable - low enough to allow facile oxygen transfer but high enough to maintain the structural integrity of the catalyst. Therefore, understanding and tuning ΔEv through methods such as doping can be a powerful approach to optimizing oxide catalysts for specific reactions.
