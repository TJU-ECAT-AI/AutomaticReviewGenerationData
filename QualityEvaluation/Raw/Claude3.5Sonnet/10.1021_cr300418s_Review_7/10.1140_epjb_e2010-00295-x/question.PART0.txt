Abstract. The effects of Ir doping on the oxygen vacancy formation energy have been investigated using
the DFT+U method, i.e., first-principles density functional theory calculations with the inclusion of the
on-site Coulomb interaction. The main factors influencing the reducibility of Ir-doped ceria are studied
carefully. It is found that, although the Ir doping induces gap states (MIGS) as do other noble metals
(Pd, Pt, Rh), the structural relaxation (instead of the electronic structure relaxation) is the main factor
responsible for the decrease of the oxygen vacancy formation energy, i.e., the Ir doping makes structural
distortions much more exothermic for the reduced ceria.
1 Introduction
It is well known that, due to its high oxygen storage ca-
pacity (OSC), CeO2 is used widely in various catalytic
processes, such as the purification of automobile exhaust
gases [1,2], the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction [35] and
preferential CO oxidation (PROX) [68]. The most critical
role that ceria plays in the three-way catalysts (TWCs) in
automobiles is to consume excess oxygen under fuel-lean
conditions and to release it under fuel-rich conditions [1,2].
Here, CO can be oxidized directly by lattice oxygen leav-
ing the ceria support reduced and the reduced support can
be re-oxidized by extracting oxygen from NOx or other ox-
idants [9,10]. For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism
is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts
at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the
ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is
then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2 [4,5]. With respect
to the PROX reaction, the highly reducible ceria support
also participates directly or indirectly in the CO oxida-
tion [7,8]. Thus, oxygen vacancies in the ceria support
play a critical role for all the above mentioned reactions.
In addition, oxygen vacancies can stabilize metallic parti-
cles supported on oxide surfaces [11,12], by making them
resistant to sintering.
Experiments have demonstrated that ceria doping can
efficiently improve its reducibility and catalytic redox ac-
tivity [13,14]. Using density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations, Metiu et al. showed that doping can dramati-
cally weaken the binding of a ceria surface oxygen to the
rest of the lattice and make ceria a better oxidation cata-
lyst; they suggested that it is worthwhile to explore doped

oxides as oxidation catalysts [15,16]. Indeed, the oxygen
vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the
reducibility of the oxide. Using the DFT+U method, our
group has recently investigated the effects on the oxygen
vacancy formation energy from doping ceria with Zr [17],
Pd [18], Pt and Rh [19], respectively. The main conclu-
sions from our work so far are as follows. Doping markedly
facilitates the reduction of the oxygen atoms near the dop-
ing centers. Usually, there are two major factors respon-
sible for the decrease of the oxygen vacancy formation
energy. On the one hand, the dopant modifies the elec-
tronic structures of the reduced ceria (electronic relax-
ation), and on the other hand it facilitates the structural
distortions (structural relaxation). For the Zr-doped ma-
terial, there are no new metal induced gap states (MIGS)
between the O2p valence band and the Ce4f levels, and
the dopant-induced electronic modification is unimportant
compared to the structural relaxation, as far as the oxy-
gen vacancy formation energy is concerned. As in the case
of undoped ceria, the electrons released by the removed
O atom mainly occupy the 4f states of the two Ce cations
neighboring the oxygen vacancy. In contrast, when noble
metal (NM) dopants are introduced, in addition to the
structural relaxation, MIGS consisting of NMd and O2p
states appear between the top of the O2p band and the
Fermi level. For Pd doping, upon reduction, electrons re-
leased by the removed O atom mainly occupy the MIGS
and are localized on the Pd dopant and its nearest oxy-
gen neighbors. For Pt and Rh, on the other hand, both
the dopants and the Ce cations offer states suitable for
accommodating extra electrons, which makes the doped
ceria more easily reducible. For all three NMs we have in-
vestigated, however, the electronic relaxation appears to
play a more important role than structural relaxation for
the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy.

Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been found to be highly ac-
tive and selective for hydrogen production by oxidation
stream reforming of ethanol. The promotion effect was
partly attributed to the enhanced reducibility and oxygen
storage-release capacity of Ir/CeO2 as compared with pure
ceria [20,21]. Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded
into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and
reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to pro-
ceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22], i.e.
involving surface oxygens from ceria. The current study
has been undertaken with the purpose to determine and
understand the main factor(s) influencing the reducibility
of Ir-doped ceria. We will show how the geometric struc-
ture, energetics and electronic structure of the CeO2(111)
surface changes when it is doped with Ir in the surface
layer. We are not aware of any previous DFT or other
quantum-mechanical studies of Ir-doped ceria in the lit-
erature. Nor are we aware of any studies of the very con-
nected system Ir/CeO2(111).
The computational methods are described in Section 2.
The calculated results are presented in Section 3 and a
brief conclusion is given in Section 4.
2 Computational methods
Fully spin-polarized calculations were performed using the
ab initio total energy and molecular dynamics program
VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation program) [2325]. The
interactions of ions and electrons were treated within the
frozen-core all-electron projector-augmented-wave (PAW)
method of Bl
ochl [26], where cerium 5s, 5p, 5d, 4f, and 6s
electrons, the oxygen 2s and 2p, and the Iridium 5d and 6s
electrons were considered as valence electrons. The elec-
tron exchange and correlation were treated within the gen-
eralized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-
Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [27].
DFT+U was chosen as our computational approach,
since it can describe the structural, electronic (band struc-
ture) and redox properties of CeO2, Ce2O3, and CeO2x
in an acceptable way, as shown by several recent studies.
In the DFT+U method [28,29], a Hubbard parameter, U,
is introduced for the Ce4f electrons to describe the on-
site Coulomb interactions and the U value is chosen to
be 5.0 eV, since it is found previously that for U = 5 eV
and greater, the localization of the Ce4f electrons in the
partially reduced ceria can be properly described [30,31].
The CeO2(111) surface was chosen as the substrate in
this work, since it is the most stable among the low-index
surfaces, and the doped ceria was created by substituting
a Ir atom for a surface Ce atom. The surfaces were mod-
eled as slabs, periodically repeated in the z direction per-
pendicular to the surface and separated from their images
by a 15 
A vacuum gap. Each slab consisted of a stack of
(O-Ce-O) sandwiches, including 12 atomic layers in each
slab with oxygen terminations. A p(2 × 2) lateral cell was
used with the cell parameters kept fixed at the calculated
equilibrium lattice constant value (5.48 
A).
The Kohn-Sham orbitals were expanded in plane waves
with a kinetic energy cutoffof 30 Ry. The Brillouin-zone
integrations were performed using Monkhorst-Pack (MP)
grids [32] and a Gaussian smearing of Sigma = 0.2 eV.
The final results were extrapolated to that of Sigma =
0.0 eV. A MP grid of (4×4×1) was used for the ceria(111)
surfaces and (8 × 8 × 8) for the bulk ceria. The structure
optimizations were performed until the force on each atom
was less than 0.02 eV/
A, with the bottom six atomic layers
fixed to mimic the bulk. In addition, the dipole correction
was included in order to cope with the electric field arising
from the formation of O vacancy on the surface [33,34]. It
was shown that the previous setting can properly describe
the properties of the ceria systems [1719].
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Unreduced surfaces
Bulk crystalline CeO2 has the fluorite structure. Our
calculations give an equilibrium lattice parameter of
5.48 
A; the experimental value is 5.411 
A [35]. The clean
CeO2(111) surface was fully relaxed under the restriction
of fixed cell parameters. The relaxation is found to be
quite small and the slab shows slight contraction, which
agrees with the previous results [36,37].
To measure the stability of the substitutional de-
fect, we have calculated its formation energy, which was
estimated as the adsorption (or incorporation) energy
of the dopant atom [38], Eads, defined as: Eads =
E(ceria slab) + E(Ir) E(Ir/ceria slab), where E(Ir/ceria
slab) and E(ceria slab) are the total energies of the opti-
mized slabs with and without a Ir dopant; E(Ir) denotes
the total energy of a free Ir atom. We assume that a Ce-
vacancy has already been created before the Ir atom ad-
sorption. Thus, the formation energy is 11.87 eV, which is
much larger than those of the Cu doping (6.46 and 7.80 eV
for the symmetric and asymmetric Cu0.08Ce0.92O2 config-
urations) [38]. However, it must of course be kept in mind
that although the Ce-vacancy formation itself is known
to occur experimentally under suitable conditions, it is
a costly process (we obtain a value of 18.99 eV for the
formation energy of the Ce vacancy). Figure 1 shows the
optimized Ce1xIrxO2 surface (i.e. the Ir doped CeO2 sys-
tem), together with the distribution of the electrons in the
MIGS (metal induced gap states) which will be discussed
below. The structural distortion caused by doping is char-
acterized by the distances between the Ir dopant and its
six O neighbors and the results are shown in Table 1. The
Ir-O distances are seen to be much smaller than the Ce-O
distances in the undoped system. This is correlated with
the smaller Ir-O bond lengths (1.982.02 
A) in Ir oxide
(i.e., IrO2 with a rutile structure with the calculated equi-
librium lattice parameters of a = 4.54 
A, c = 3.19 
A and
the experimental values of a = 4.496 
A, c = 3.154 
A [39])
as compared with the Ce-O distance (2.37 
A) in ceria. The
O atoms labeled with a number n (=18) (Fig. 1b) are
cited in the discussion as O1O8. After doping, all O1
to O8 ions are structurally different, except for O2 and O3
(at the surface), as well as O5 and O8 (sub-surface) which
are equivalent. The similar symmetry-broken phenomena
were reported for Cu doping [16].

the paper.
The TDOSs (total density of states) for CeO2(111) and
Ce1xIrxO2(111) are shown in Figure 2. The characteris-
tics of the TDOS for the CeO2(111) surface are in agree-
ment with the previous reported results which have been
well described elsewhere [40]. For the doped system, sim-
ilar to Pd [18], Pt and Rh doping [19], MIGS appear and
locate between the top of the O2p band and the Fermi level
and these states are mainly localized on the Ir cation and
its neighboring oxygen anions as shown in Figure 1b. The
analysis from the partial DOS shows that the MIGS are
mainly composed of Ir5d and O2p states. A Bader charge
analysis [41] shows that there are in total 3.05 electrons
localized on the Ir cation in the energy window of about
0.8 eV to the Fermi level.
3.2 Reduced surfaces
3.2.1 O vacancies formation energies
In the present study, the O vacancy formation energy for
CeO2(111) surface is defined as: Evac = [E(CeO2x) +
x/2E(O2) E(CeO2)]/x, where E(CeO2), E(CeO2x)
and E(O2) are the energies of the unreduced system,
the reduced surface and the free O2 molecule. x repre-
sents the number of the oxygen vacancies included in the
CeO2x within the simulation cell. For O2(g), the cal-
culated bond length is 1.29 
A and the binding energy is

6.18 eV. The corresponding experimental values are 1.21 
A
and 5.2 eV [42]. For the doped systems, a similar definition
for the O vacancy formation energy is used.
It has been reported that the subsurface O vacancy is
almost as stable as the surface vacancy with the small
energy difference depending on the calculation meth-
ods [36,43,44]. It has also been noted that the subsurface
O can serve as the nucleation center for the surface O va-
cancy cluster [44] and that there are local orderings for
these subsurface defects, with a tendency to form linear
patterns [45]. Therefore, the formation energies for both
the surface and subsurface O vacancies were calculated in
order to investigate how doping changes the subsurface O
vacancies stabilities and the relative stabilities compared
to those on the surface.
We created an oxygen vacancy by removing in turn
each of the structurally unique oxygen atoms from the un-
doped or doped surfaces (a neutral atom was removed).
Then the structure with an oxygen vacancy was reopti-
mized. The O vacancy formation energies are listed in Ta-
ble 2. For the undoped system, there is only one unique
surface oxygen atom and one unique subsurface oxygen
atom. The formation energy of a surface O vacancy is
2.90 eV which is consistent with our previous value of
2.89 eV [46]. The formation energy of a subsurface O

face vacancies and V (O5O7) are the subsurface vacancies for
the Ce1xIrxO2x(111).

vacancy is 2.55 eV, which is more stable by 0.35 eV than
that for the surface O vacancy, qualitatively in agree-
ment with the previous GGA result [36] and GGA+U
result [43].
For the Ce1xIrxO2(111) system, there are three
unique oxygen atoms on the surface (O1, O3, and O4)
and three unique subsurface oxygen atoms (O5, O6, and
O7). The final structure with an oxygen vacancy is de-
noted VOn (On = O1, O3, O4, O5, O6, or O7). We find
that the VO3 structure converges to the VO5 structure since
O5 immediately goes up and takes the O3 site when O3
is removed. Therefore only the information about two sur-
face oxygen vacancies (VO1 and VO4) and three subsurface
oxygen vacancies (O5, O6, and O7) is shown in Table 2.
Apparently the most stable O vacancies are those around
the dopant and their Evac values (1.64, 1.07 and 1.45 eV
for VO4, VO5 and VO7, respectively) are much smaller than
those for the undoped system (2.90 and 2.55 eV for the
surface and subsurface oxygen vacancy respectively). Evac
for the oxygen vacancies further away from the dopant are
2.99 and 2.68 eV for VO1 and VO6, respectively, and thus
similar to the values for the undoped system. These val-
ues suggest that in the doped ceria, the dopant cations
could serve as the active centers for the surface redox re-
actions. We find that subsurface O vacancies are generally
more stable than a vacancy at the surface and this effect
is somewhat enhanced by the Ir doping.
3.2.2 Optimized structures
To explore the main factors influencing the O vacancy
formation energy, we analyze the effects of doping on the
relaxed structures of the reduced surfaces, and we start
with surface vacancies. The relaxed structures for CeO2x
(with a surface O vacancy) and Ce1xIrxO2x (VO4 struc-
ture) are shown in Figure 3. For the undoped system, upon
full relaxation, the surface structure is severely perturbed
when a vacancy is formed and thus the initial symmetry of
the three Ce ions around the vacancy is broken, as found
in a previous study [40]. The main features of this per-
turbation, shown in Figure 3a, are that the nearest neigh-
bor Ce cations move away from the center of the vacancy
by 0.10 
A and 0.17 
A, respectively. The smaller displace-
ment refers to the cerium cations which are reduced as
shown below and are denoted as Ce3+, and the larger
displacement corresponds to the unreduced cerium cation
(denoted as Ce4+). The next nearest neighbor O an-
ions (in the subsurface layer) displace by 0.10 
A (the O
ions coordinated to the two Ce3+ ions) and 0.22 
A (the
O ions coordinated to both Ce3+ and Ce4+) toward the
center of the vacancy. This is in agreement with the rear-
rangement pattern as reported by Esch et al. [44]. For the
Ce1xIrxO2x(111) surface, shown in Figure 3b, the rear-
rangement pattern is very similar to that of CeO2x. Two
nearest Ce atoms move away from the vacancy by 0.11 
A,
only larger by 0.01 
A than that for the undoped system.
And the Ir cation moves away by 0.19 
A. The subsurface
O atoms around the vacancy show the same displacements
trends as the CeO2x(111) surface. However, the O atom
coordinated to two Ce3+ ions has a smaller displacement
(0.05 
A) and the atoms coordinated to a Ce3+ ion and
the Ir cation move toward the vacancy by 0.32 
A, which
is larger by 0.1 
A than that for the undoped system. This
relaxation mode is correlated to the electron localization
pattern as described below. As a result, the O-Ir distances
are all shortened by about 0.10 
A. The larger structural
changes compared to the undoped system may be respon-
sible for the much smaller O vacancy formation energy.
For the optimized structures of CeO2x(111) with a
subsurface O vacancy, the changes of the distances be-
tween the vacancy and the surface nearest O atoms as well
as the three neighboring Ce atoms are shown in Figure 4a.
Consistent with the surface O vacancy case, the three Ce
atoms move away from the vacancy (by 0.15 
A). How-
ever, three O atoms show quite different behavior. One
moves towards the vacancy (0.49 
A); the second moves
away the vacancy (0.02 
A); and the distance between the
third O atom and the vacancy does not change compar-
ing to that of the unreduced systems. For the doped sys-
tem (VO5, shown in Fig. 4b), the structural distortions
are much larger than what we found for the surface va-
cancy. The largest displacement of an O atom toward the
vacancy is 0.65 
A, while the Ir atom moves away from
the vacancy by 0.20 
A. In addition, the Ir-O bond lengths
contract by up to 0.26 
A.
Through their extensive DFT calculations, Metiu
et al. [15,16] demonstrated that a dopant disrupts the
oxygen-oxide bond if its own oxide has a different structure
than that of the host. In this case, the dopant finds that
the number of the oxygen atoms in the neighborhood and
their positions are not right and has difficulties bond-
ing to them. Thus the dopant makes the surface oxygen
more active. We attribute the large structural distortions
to this factor, but, from the discussion above, it is not
enough to make the conclusion that structural relaxation
is the main factor influencing the O vacancy formation
energy. To address which factor (structural relaxation or
electronic relaxation) is more important in lowering the
O vacancy formation energy, the electronic structure is
investigated below.
3.2.3 Electronic structure
Upon doping, there are MIGS situated between the top
of the O2p band and the Fermi level (shown in Fig. 2b),
which are mainly localized on the Ir dopant and its neigh-
boring oxygens. But can the MIGS accommodate the

electrons released by the removed oxygen atom and fa-
cilitate the vacancy formation, as was the case for dop-
ing with Pd [18]? To this end, the DOSs for different re-
duced systems are shown in Figure 5. In agreement with
the previous DFT+U results [40], we find that for the re-
duced CeO2(111) surface (Fig. 5a), a new peak appears
between the top of the valence band and the bottom of
the unoccupied Ce4f band, and the Fermi level locates
in the gap between this peak and the empty Ce4f band.
An analysis of the partial electron density (corresponding
to the electrons occupying the new peak) shows that the
electrons occupying the gap states are well localized on
the two Ce cations next to the oxygen vacancy (Fig. 3c).
The Bader charge analysis of the partial charge density
corresponding to the Ce4f gap state peak gives a total
of almost two electrons. Each of two reduced Ce ions re-
ceives about 0.94 electrons, which confirms that two excess
electrons are mostly transferred to the Ce4+ ions which
are reduced to Ce3+ cations. This is consistent with the
previous experimental conclusions that the reduction of

CeO2 surfaces results in partial occupation of the Ce4f
and the formation of Ce3+ ions, as shown by XPS, XANES
measurements [47]. This electronic localization behavior is
consistent with the above described structural relaxation
pattern with symmetry broken. Figure 5b shows the to-
tal DOS for the Ce1xIrxO2x(111) surface with a surface
O vacancy (VO4). Compared to that for the CeO2x(111)
surface, there are no evident changes, except that the gap
states located between the top of the O2p band and the
empty Ce4f states become higher and wider. This is be-
cause the electrons left by the removed oxygen atom are
still situated in this gap. The partial electron density dis-
tribution (corresponding to the electrons which are accom-
modated in the gap states) in Figure 3d shows that the ex-
cess electrons left by the removed oxygen are still localized
on the same two Ce cations as in the undoped system and
Ir doping causes no apparent perturbation to the local-
ization. The electron localization pattern on and around
the Ir dopant is similar to that of the unreduced doped
system. Integration of the DOS for these gap states using
the Bader charge analysis gives a total of 2.97 electrons
localized on the dopant, very similar to the unreduced sys-
tem. There are two additional electrons localized on the
two Ce cations (shown in Fig. 3d). Projected density of
states (PDOS) (shown in Fig. 6a) for Ir cations (before
and after the formation of the vacancy) indicates that the
presence of the vacancy has little impact on the electronic
structures of the dopant. The calculated spin magnetic
moment for the Ir dopant for this system is 0.63μB, which
is close to that for the unreduced doped system (0.70μB).
This further indicates that the electronic structures of the
dopant are not sensitive to the formation of the O vacancy.
PDOS (shown in Fig. 6b) for Ce3+ cations indicates that
the existence of the dopant hardly modifies the localiza-

tion of the electrons released by the formation of oxygen
vacancy. These results are similar to our findings for Zr-
doped ceria [17] and we conclude that Ir doping does not
significantly change the electronic structure of the reduced
ceria and it is expected that electronic relaxation is not
the main factor responsible for the significant changes of
the O vacancy formation energy.
The characteristics of the TDOS for the CeO2(111)
surface with a subsurface O vacancy (not shown) are just
the same as that for the surface with a surface O vacancy.
With the removal of a neutral oxygen atom, the two elec-
trons released are almost exactly localized on the two Ce
cations which are reduced from Ce4+ to Ce3+. Although
we get the same energy trend (i.e., the subsurface oxygen
vacancy is somewhat more stable than the surface one)
as Fabris et al. did [43], the features of the electrons lo-
calization are somewhat different. The two Ce3+ cations
locate on the first- and second-Ce layers, respectively, in
the present study, while in reference [43] two Ce3+ are all
on the first-Ce layer. This possibly results from the dif-
ferent computational strategies and initial structures for
optimization. Again, doping does not significantly change
the electronic structures. Lets take VO5 as an example.
Doping makes the two Ce3+ cations situated on the same
layer (i.e., the first Ce-layer) and the Ir dopant loses a
little fraction of electrons (0.13 vs. the total number of
2.92 electrons localized on the dopant cation). Similar to
the surface vacancy systems, PDOS (not shown) for Ir
dopants (and Ce3+ cations) further shows that doping
has no significant influence on the electronic structures
for the reduced systems. And absolute value of the spin
magnetic moment for the Ir atom is 0.61μB, smaller than
that of the VO4 system only by 0.02μB. These further
demonstrate that doping ceria with Ir has not significantly
changed the electronic structures of the reduced ceria and

energy-favorable structural distortions should be respon-
sible for the reduction of O vacancy formation energy.
We further investigated the ferro- and antiferro- cou-
plings of the two Ce3+ cations for undoped ceria(111) sys-
tems with a surface or subsurface oxygen vacancy. Re-
cently, Keating et al. shown that oxygen vacancies on the
(111), (110) and (100) low index surfaces does not dis-
play any evidence for ferromagnetic preference [48]. In the
present study, for the system with the surface (subsurface)
oxygen vacancy, the energy difference between the AFM
and FM configurations is 1 × 103 (4 × 103) eV. For
both the cases, the energy differences between FM and
AFM are too small to indicate the preferential AFM (or
FM) behavior. The results are consistent with those of the

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
