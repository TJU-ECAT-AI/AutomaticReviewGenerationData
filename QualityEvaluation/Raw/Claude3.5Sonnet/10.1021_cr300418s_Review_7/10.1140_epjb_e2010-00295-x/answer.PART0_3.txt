[1] "For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2"

[2] "With respect to the PROX reaction, the highly reducible ceria support also participates directly or indirectly in the CO oxidation"

[3] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to proceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism"

[4] "Indeed, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important probe of the reducibility of the oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the following steps:

1. CO adsorbs on the metal catalyst surface
2. CO reacts with lattice oxygen from the oxide support at the metal-support interface, forming CO2
3. This creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide support
4. The reduced oxide support is then re-oxidized by another oxidant (e.g. H2O, O2), regenerating the catalyst

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because:

1. It is a measure of the reducibility of the oxide support
2. Lower ΔEv indicates the oxide can more easily release lattice oxygen to participate in oxidation reactions
3. This correlates with higher catalytic activity, as the oxygen transfer process is more facile
4. It also indicates stronger oxidizing ability of the surface, as oxygen can be more readily extracted

Thus, ΔEv serves as an important descriptor for the redox properties and catalytic performance of oxide catalysts operating via a Mars-van Krevelen type mechanism. Catalysts with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies tend to show enhanced activity for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理包括以下步骤：

1. CO吸附在金属催化剂表面
2. CO在金属-支撑体界面与氧化物支撑体中的晶格氧反应，形成CO2
3. 这在氧化物支撑体中创造了一个氧空位
4. 还原的氧化物支撑体随后被另一种氧化剂（如H2O、O2）重新氧化，从而再生催化剂

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它是氧化物支撑体可还原性的度量
2. 较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易地释放晶格氧参与氧化反应
3. 这与更高的催化活性相关，因为氧转移过程更容易进行
4. 它还表明表面具有更强的氧化能力，因为氧可以更容易地被提取

因此，ΔEv作为一个重要的描述符，用于表征通过Mars-van Krevelen型机理运作的氧化物催化剂的氧化还原性质和催化性能。具有较低氧空位形成能的催化剂往往表现出增强的氧化反应活性。
