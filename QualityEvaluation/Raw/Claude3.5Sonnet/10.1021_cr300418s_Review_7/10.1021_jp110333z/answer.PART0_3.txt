[1] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

[2] "On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."

[3] "The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane. Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which is beneficial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This allows the oxide to more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction. The literature shows that doping oxides with lower valence dopants (LVDs) significantly reduces ΔEv, making it easier to remove surface oxygen atoms.

The lower ΔEv also correlates with increased oxidizing ability of the surface. This is evidenced by the stronger binding of H atoms and CH3 radicals to the surface oxygen atoms of LVD-doped oxides, as well as the more exothermic dissociative adsorption of methane on these surfaces.

Furthermore, the lower ΔEv and increased reactivity of surface oxygen in LVD-doped oxides can lead to lower activation energies for breaking C-H bonds, potentially making them better catalysts for reactions like methane activation.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, it may also lead to faster deactivation of the catalyst if the oxygen vacancies are not promptly refilled. Therefore, the optimal ΔEv for a given catalytic reaction would balance the ease of oxygen removal with the ability to regenerate the active site.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这有利于Mars-van Krevelen机制。这使得氧化物能更容易为氧化反应提供氧。文献表明，用低价掺杂剂（LVDs）掺杂氧化物显著降低了ΔEv，使得移除表面氧原子变得更容易。

较低的ΔEv还与表面氧化能力的增强相关。这体现在H原子和CH3自由基与LVD掺杂氧化物表面氧原子结合更强，以及甲烷在这些表面上的解离吸附更放热。

此外，LVD掺杂氧化物中较低的ΔEv和表面氧反应性的增加可能导致C-H键断裂的活化能降低，potentially使它们成为更好的甲烷活化等反应的催化剂。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，但如果氧空位不能及时补充，也可能导致催化剂更快失活。因此，对于特定的催化反应，最佳的ΔEv应在氧的易移除性和活性位点的再生能力之间取得平衡。
