[1] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

[2] "On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the re-oxidation of the reduced surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which enhances the oxide's ability to donate oxygen to reactants and participate in oxidation reactions. This lower energy barrier for oxygen removal typically correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. Additionally, a lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide surface has a higher oxidizing ability, as it can more readily release oxygen to participate in reactions. The significance of ΔEv extends beyond just vacancy formation, as it also relates to the overall reactivity of surface oxygen atoms, influencing processes such as hydrogen and methyl radical binding, and methane dissociation on the surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及从氧化物表面移除氧原子以氧化反应物，随后通过气相氧再氧化还原的表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这增强了氧化物向反应物提供氧并参与氧化反应的能力。这种较低的氧移除能量障碍通常与氧化反应的更高催化活性相关。此外，较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。ΔEv的重要性不仅限于空位形成，还与表面氧原子的整体反应性有关，影响氢原子和甲基自由基的结合以及甲烷在表面上的解离等过程。
