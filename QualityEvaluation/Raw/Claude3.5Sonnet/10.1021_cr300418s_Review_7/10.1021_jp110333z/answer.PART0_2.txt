[1] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

[2] "On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."

[3] "The presence of the LVD1 substantially increases the energy gained by the dissociative adsorption of methane. Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial parameter in this mechanism. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which is important for two reasons:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction, potentially increasing the catalytic activity. This is because the removal of lattice oxygen is often a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ease of oxygen removal (lower ΔEv) also indicates a higher oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This means the oxide can more effectively oxidize adsorbed species on its surface.

The significance of ΔEv extends beyond just the removal of oxygen. It also relates to the binding energies of species like H and CH3 to the surface oxygen atoms, as well as the dissociative adsorption of molecules like methane. Lower ΔEv values are often associated with stronger binding of these species and more favorable dissociative adsorption, which can further enhance catalytic activity for certain reactions.

In the context of doped oxides, particularly those with low valence dopants (LVDs), the ΔEv is typically reduced compared to undoped oxides. This suggests that doping can be a strategy to enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces for reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及到氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是这一机制中的一个关键参数。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这在两个方面很重要：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，可能会增加催化活性。这是因为晶格氧的移除通常是Mars-van Krevelen机制中的一个关键步骤。

2. 氧化能力：氧的易移除性（较低的ΔEv）也表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力。这意味着氧化物可以更有效地氧化其表面上吸附的物种。

ΔEv的重要性不仅限于氧的移除。它还与H和CH3等物种与表面氧原子的结合能，以及甲烷等分子的解离吸附有关。较低的ΔEv值通常与这些物种的更强结合和更有利的解离吸附相关，这可能会进一步增强某些反应的催化活性。

在掺杂氧化物的背景下，特别是那些低价掺杂剂（LVDs）的氧化物，ΔEv通常比未掺杂的氧化物低。这表明掺杂可能是一种增强氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的策略，特别是对于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的反应。
