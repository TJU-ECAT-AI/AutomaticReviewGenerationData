[1] "We characterize the reactivity of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide by four quantities: the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface; the binding energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 of a H atom or a CH3 radical to a surface oxygen atom; and the energy ΔECH4 of dissociative adsorption of methane (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group)."

[2] "In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide."

[3] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, which is essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to operate efficiently. When ΔEv is lower, the oxide surface can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction, making it a more active catalyst.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct relationship to the oxide's ability to release and replenish oxygen during the catalytic cycle. A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more easily form oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules. These vacancies can then be refilled by gas-phase oxygen or other oxidizing species, completing the catalytic cycle.

Additionally, the article mentions other parameters (ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4) that, along with ΔEv, provide a comprehensive picture of the oxide surface's reactivity. These parameters indicate how strongly the surface interacts with various species involved in catalytic reactions, further influencing the overall catalytic performance.

In summary, a lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability of the oxide surface in the context of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This parameter, along with others, helps in understanding and predicting the behavior of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机理中，氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，这对于Mars-van Krevelen机理的有效运作至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧化物表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，使其成为更活跃的催化剂。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物在催化循环中释放和补充氧的能力直接相关。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易形成氧空位，这对于反应物分子的吸附和活化至关重要。这些空位随后可以被气相氧或其他氧化物种填充，完成催化循环。

此外，文章还提到了其他参数（ΔEH，ΔECH3和ΔECH4），这些参数与ΔEv一起，提供了氧化物表面反应性的全面图像。这些参数表明表面与催化反应中涉及的各种物种的相互作用强度，进一步影响整体催化性能。

总之，在Mars-van Krevelen机理的背景下，较低的ΔEv通常与氧化物表面更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力相关。这个参数与其他参数一起，有助于理解和预测氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的行为。
