[1] "We characterize the reactivity of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide by four quantities: the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface; the binding energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 of a H atom or a CH3 radical to a surface oxygen atom; and the energy ΔECH4 of dissociative adsorption of methane (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group)."

[2] "In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide."

[3] "To probe the change in oxygen activity caused by the dopant, we used the energy ΔEv of making an oxygen vacancy, the energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 to bind a H atom or a CH3 radical to an oxygen atom in the surface layer, and the energy ΔECH4 of the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, which is essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to operate efficiently. When ΔEv is lower, the oxide surface can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction, making it a more active catalyst.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct relationship to the oxide's ability to release and replenish oxygen during the catalytic cycle. A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more easily form oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules. These vacancies can then be refilled by gas-phase oxygen or other oxidizing species, completing the catalytic cycle.

Additionally, the article mentions other parameters (ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4) that, along with ΔEv, provide a comprehensive picture of the oxide surface's reactivity. These parameters indicate how strongly the surface interacts with various species involved in catalytic reactions, further influencing the overall catalytic performance.

In summary, a lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability of the oxide surface in the context of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This parameter, along with others, helps in understanding and predicting the behavior of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机理中，氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，这对于Mars-van Krevelen机理的有效运作至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧化物表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，使其成为更活跃的催化剂。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物在催化循环中释放和补充氧的能力直接相关。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易形成氧空位，这对于反应物分子的吸附和活化至关重要。这些空位随后可以被气相氧或其他氧化物种填充，完成催化循环。

此外，文章还提到了其他参数（ΔEH，ΔECH3和ΔECH4），这些参数与ΔEv一起，提供了氧化物表面反应性的全面图像。这些参数表明表面与催化反应中涉及的各种物种的相互作用强度，进一步影响整体催化性能。

总之，在Mars-van Krevelen机理的背景下，较低的ΔEv通常与氧化物表面更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力相关。这个参数与其他参数一起，有助于理解和预测氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的行为。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the re-oxidation of the reduced surface by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which enhances the oxide's ability to donate oxygen to reactants and participate in oxidation reactions. This lower energy barrier for oxygen removal typically correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. Additionally, a lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide surface has a higher oxidizing ability, as it can more readily release oxygen to participate in reactions. The significance of ΔEv extends beyond just vacancy formation, as it also relates to the overall reactivity of surface oxygen atoms, influencing processes such as hydrogen and methyl radical binding, and methane dissociation on the surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及从氧化物表面移除氧原子以氧化反应物，随后通过气相氧再氧化还原的表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这增强了氧化物向反应物提供氧并参与氧化反应的能力。这种较低的氧移除能量障碍通常与氧化反应的更高催化活性相关。此外，较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。ΔEv的重要性不仅限于空位形成，还与表面氧原子的整体反应性有关，影响氢原子和甲基自由基的结合以及甲烷在表面上的解离等过程。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial parameter in this mechanism. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which is important for two reasons:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide can more readily provide lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction, potentially increasing the catalytic activity. This is because the removal of lattice oxygen is often a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ease of oxygen removal (lower ΔEv) also indicates a higher oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This means the oxide can more effectively oxidize adsorbed species on its surface.

The significance of ΔEv extends beyond just the removal of oxygen. It also relates to the binding energies of species like H and CH3 to the surface oxygen atoms, as well as the dissociative adsorption of molecules like methane. Lower ΔEv values are often associated with stronger binding of these species and more favorable dissociative adsorption, which can further enhance catalytic activity for certain reactions.

In the context of doped oxides, particularly those with low valence dopants (LVDs), the ΔEv is typically reduced compared to undoped oxides. This suggests that doping can be a strategy to enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces for reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及到氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是这一机制中的一个关键参数。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这在两个方面很重要：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供晶格氧，可能会增加催化活性。这是因为晶格氧的移除通常是Mars-van Krevelen机制中的一个关键步骤。

2. 氧化能力：氧的易移除性（较低的ΔEv）也表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力。这意味着氧化物可以更有效地氧化其表面上吸附的物种。

ΔEv的重要性不仅限于氧的移除。它还与H和CH3等物种与表面氧原子的结合能，以及甲烷等分子的解离吸附有关。较低的ΔEv值通常与这些物种的更强结合和更有利的解离吸附相关，这可能会进一步增强某些反应的催化活性。

在掺杂氧化物的背景下，特别是那些低价掺杂剂（LVDs）的氧化物，ΔEv通常比未掺杂的氧化物低。这表明掺杂可能是一种增强氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的策略，特别是对于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的反应。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, which is beneficial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This allows the oxide to more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction. The literature shows that doping oxides with lower valence dopants (LVDs) significantly reduces ΔEv, making it easier to remove surface oxygen atoms.

The lower ΔEv also correlates with increased oxidizing ability of the surface. This is evidenced by the stronger binding of H atoms and CH3 radicals to the surface oxygen atoms of LVD-doped oxides, as well as the more exothermic dissociative adsorption of methane on these surfaces.

Furthermore, the lower ΔEv and increased reactivity of surface oxygen in LVD-doped oxides can lead to lower activation energies for breaking C-H bonds, potentially making them better catalysts for reactions like methane activation.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, it may also lead to faster deactivation of the catalyst if the oxygen vacancies are not promptly refilled. Therefore, the optimal ΔEv for a given catalytic reaction would balance the ease of oxygen removal with the ability to regenerate the active site.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧原子更容易，这有利于Mars-van Krevelen机制。这使得氧化物能更容易为氧化反应提供氧。文献表明，用低价掺杂剂（LVDs）掺杂氧化物显著降低了ΔEv，使得移除表面氧原子变得更容易。

较低的ΔEv还与表面氧化能力的增强相关。这体现在H原子和CH3自由基与LVD掺杂氧化物表面氧原子结合更强，以及甲烷在这些表面上的解离吸附更放热。

此外，LVD掺杂氧化物中较低的ΔEv和表面氧反应性的增加可能导致C-H键断裂的活化能降低，potentially使它们成为更好的甲烷活化等反应的催化剂。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，但如果氧空位不能及时补充，也可能导致催化剂更快失活。因此，对于特定的催化反应，最佳的ΔEv应在氧的易移除性和活性位点的再生能力之间取得平衡。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text provides insights into the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

The literature characterizes the reactivity of surface oxygen atoms using four key parameters, including ΔEv. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies on the surface, which is crucial for oxidation reactions. The presence of low valence dopants (LVDs) in the oxide surface significantly reduces ΔEv, thereby increasing the oxidizing ability of the surface.

The increased reactivity of the doped oxide surface is also reflected in the higher binding energies of H atoms and CH3 radicals (ΔEH and ΔECH3), as well as the increased energy of dissociative adsorption of methane (ΔECH4). These factors contribute to enhanced catalytic activity.

However, the literature also points out a potential complication in catalysis by LVD-doped oxides. The dissociation products of reactants (e.g., H and CH3 from methane) can act as compensating agents, potentially poisoning the catalyst if not removed promptly. This suggests that in some cases, the rate-limiting step in catalytic oxidation reactions might shift from the initial bond breaking to the removal of reaction intermediates from the surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在给定的文献中并未被明确讨论。然而，文本提供了关于氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力方面重要性的见解。

文献使用四个关键参数来表征表面氧原子的反应性，包括ΔEv。较低的ΔEv表明在表面上更容易产生氧空位，这对氧化反应至关重要。低价掺杂剂（LVDs）在氧化物表面的存在显著降低了ΔEv，从而增加了表面的氧化能力。

掺杂氧化物表面反应活性的增加也反映在H原子和CH3自由基的结合能（ΔEH和ΔECH3）更高，以及甲烷解离吸附能（ΔECH4）增加。这些因素都有助于提高催化活性。

然而，文献还指出了LVD掺杂氧化物催化过程中的一个潜在复杂性。反应物的解离产物（例如，来自甲烷的H和CH3）可以作为补偿剂，如果不及时移除，可能会使催化剂中毒。这表明在某些情况下，催化氧化反应的速率限制步骤可能会从初始键断裂转变为从表面移除反应中间体。
