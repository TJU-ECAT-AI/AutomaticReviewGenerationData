[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

[2] "It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[3] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, forming CO2.
2. The oxygen vacancy on the surface is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the oxidation of CO to CO2.
2. The initial removal of oxygen from the surface (creating the vacancy) is the determining step in the reaction.
3. A lower ΔEv makes it easier for the oxide to release oxygen, increasing its oxidizing ability.
4. The ease of vacancy formation directly impacts the catalyst's ability to participate in the redox cycle, affecting its overall catalytic activity.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，形成CO2。
2. 表面上的氧空位随后被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，因为：

1. 更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量可以增强CO到CO2的氧化。
2. 从表面初始移除氧（创造空位）是反应的决定性步骤。
3. 较低的ΔEv使氧化物更容易释放氧，增加其氧化能力。
4. 空位形成的容易程度直接影响催化剂参与氧化还原循环的能力，从而影响其整体催化活性。
