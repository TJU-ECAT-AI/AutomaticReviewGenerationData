[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

[2] "It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[3] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, forming CO2.
2. The resulting oxygen vacancy is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances CO oxidation to CO2.
2. The initial removal of oxygen from the surface (creating the vacancy) is the determining step in the reaction.
3. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide surface can more easily release oxygen, increasing its oxidizing ability.

Therefore, by modifying the oxide to reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy, researchers can potentially improve its catalytic performance for oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的运作方式如下：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，形成CO2。
2. 随后，产生的氧空位被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，因为：

1. 更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量可以增强CO氧化为CO2的过程。
2. 从表面初始移除氧（创造空位）是反应的决定性步骤。
3. 较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面可以更容易地释放氧，从而增加其氧化能力。

因此，通过修改氧化物以降低氧空位形成能，研究人员可以潜在地改善其在氧化反应中的催化性能。
