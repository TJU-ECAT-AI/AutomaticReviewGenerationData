[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

[2] "It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[3] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
2. The oxygen vacancy is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances CO oxidation to CO2. This is because the initial removal of oxygen from the surface is the determining step in the reaction, while the subsequent healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is generally favorable.

By lowering the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, the oxide surface becomes more active for catalysis, as it can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction. This also increases the oxidizing ability of the surface, as it can more easily release oxygen to participate in reactions. Therefore, tuning the oxygen vacancy formation energy through methods such as doping or surface modifications is a key strategy for improving the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过两步过程运作：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，创造氧空位。
2. 氧空位随后被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量可以增强CO向CO2的氧化。这是因为从表面初始移除氧是反应的决定性步骤，而随后用气相氧或NO2愈合空位通常是有利的。

通过降低氧空位形成的能量障碍，氧化物表面变得更具催化活性，因为它可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。这也增加了表面的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。因此，通过掺杂或表面改性等方法调节氧空位形成能量是提高氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中性能的关键策略。
