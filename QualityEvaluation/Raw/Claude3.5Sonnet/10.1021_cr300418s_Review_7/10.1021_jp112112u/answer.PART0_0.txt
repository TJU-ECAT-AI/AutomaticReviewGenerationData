[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

[2] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

[3] "It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
2. The oxygen vacancy is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It is the key factor in enhancing the formation of CO2 from CO.
2. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the oxidation of CO.
3. The initial removal of the oxygen from the surface is the determining step in the reaction, as healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is generally favorable.

Therefore, by engineering oxide catalysts with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies, their catalytic activity for oxidation reactions can be improved.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，创造一个氧空位。
2. 氧空位随后被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它是增强CO生成CO2的关键因素。
2. 更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量增强了CO的氧化。
3. 从表面移除氧的初始步骤是反应的决定性步骤，因为用气相氧或NO2愈合空位通常是有利的。

因此，通过设计具有较低氧空位形成能的氧化物催化剂，可以提高它们在氧化反应中的催化活性。
