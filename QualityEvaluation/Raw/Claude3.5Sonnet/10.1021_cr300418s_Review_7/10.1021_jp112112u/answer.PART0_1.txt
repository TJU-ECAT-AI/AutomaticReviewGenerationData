[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

[2] "It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

[3] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through the following steps:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, forming CO2.
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide.
3. The oxygen vacancy is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances CO oxidation, as it makes it easier to remove oxygen from the oxide surface. This is the key factor in improving the catalyst's performance.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as the rate-determining step of the overall reaction. While the healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is generally favorable, the initial removal of oxygen to create the vacancy is the limiting factor. Therefore, reducing the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation is a primary strategy for improving the catalytic activity of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过以下步骤运作：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，形成CO2。
2. 这在氧化物中创造了一个氧空位。
3. 然后氧空位被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量增强了CO的氧化，因为它使从氧化物表面移除氧变得更容易。这是提高催化剂性能的关键因素。

ΔEv的重要性在于它是整个反应的速率决定步骤。虽然用气相氧或NO2填补空位通常是有利的，但初始移除氧以创造空位是限制因素。因此，降低氧空位形成的能量障碍是提高氧化物表面在氧化反应中催化活性的主要策略。
