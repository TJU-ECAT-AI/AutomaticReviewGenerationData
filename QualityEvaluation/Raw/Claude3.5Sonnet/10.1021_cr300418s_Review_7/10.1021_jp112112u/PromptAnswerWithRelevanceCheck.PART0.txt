<quotes>

[1] "This reaction follows the Mars van Krevelen mechanism, (16) in which CO removes oxygen from the oxide. This oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst."

[2] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."

[3] "It is now understood that, in order to enhance the formation of CO2 from CO, the key quantity is the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide; by making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, the oxidation of CO can be enhanced."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
2. The oxygen vacancy is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. It is the key factor in enhancing the formation of CO2 from CO.
2. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the oxidation of CO.
3. The initial removal of the oxygen from the surface is the determining step in the reaction, as healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is generally favorable.

Therefore, by engineering oxide catalysts with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies, their catalytic activity for oxidation reactions can be improved.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，创造一个氧空位。
2. 氧空位随后被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，因为：

1. 它是增强CO生成CO2的关键因素。
2. 更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量增强了CO的氧化。
3. 从表面移除氧的初始步骤是反应的决定性步骤，因为用气相氧或NO2愈合空位通常是有利的。

因此，通过设计具有较低氧空位形成能的氧化物催化剂，可以提高它们在氧化反应中的催化活性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through the following steps:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, forming CO2.
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide.
3. The oxygen vacancy is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances CO oxidation, as it makes it easier to remove oxygen from the oxide surface. This is the key factor in improving the catalyst's performance.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as the rate-determining step of the overall reaction. While the healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is generally favorable, the initial removal of oxygen to create the vacancy is the limiting factor. Therefore, reducing the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation is a primary strategy for improving the catalytic activity of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过以下步骤运作：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，形成CO2。
2. 这在氧化物中创造了一个氧空位。
3. 然后氧空位被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量增强了CO的氧化，因为它使从氧化物表面移除氧变得更容易。这是提高催化剂性能的关键因素。

ΔEv的重要性在于它是整个反应的速率决定步骤。虽然用气相氧或NO2填补空位通常是有利的，但初始移除氧以创造空位是限制因素。因此，降低氧空位形成的能量障碍是提高氧化物表面在氧化反应中催化活性的主要策略。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, forming CO2.
2. The oxygen vacancy on the surface is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the oxidation of CO to CO2.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. CO removes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
2. The oxygen vacancy is then replenished, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A more favorable (lower) oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances CO oxidation to CO2. This is because the initial removal of oxygen from the surface is the determining step in the reaction, while the subsequent healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is generally favorable.

By lowering the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, the oxide surface becomes more active for catalysis, as it can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction. This also increases the oxidizing ability of the surface, as it can more easily release oxygen to participate in reactions. Therefore, tuning the oxygen vacancy formation energy through methods such as doping or surface modifications is a key strategy for improving the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过两步过程运作：

1. CO从氧化物表面移除氧，创造氧空位。
2. 氧空位随后被补充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更有利（更低）的氧空位形成能量可以增强CO向CO2的氧化。这是因为从表面初始移除氧是反应的决定性步骤，而随后用气相氧或NO2愈合空位通常是有利的。

通过降低氧空位形成的能量障碍，氧化物表面变得更具催化活性，因为它可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。这也增加了表面的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。因此，通过掺杂或表面改性等方法调节氧空位形成能量是提高氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中性能的关键策略。
