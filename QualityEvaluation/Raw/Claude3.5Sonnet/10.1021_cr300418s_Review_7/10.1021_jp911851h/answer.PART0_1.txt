[1] "The positive role of oxygen vacancy defects on reduced oxide surfaces has been stressed."

[2] "In the case of CO oxidation by Au clusters supported on Fe-doped TiO2, the experiments provide clear indication that the main effect due to the presence of Fe is likely to facilitate O vacancy formation"

[3] "The oxygen vacancy energy formation (Ef) has been calculated as [...] All energies are obtained at the corresponding computational level, as described in Table 1. The calculated Ef values range between 4.5 and 5.3 eV"

[4] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase. However, the perturbation in the electronic structure is much larger due to the presence of 3d states which results in a high spin state, in agreement with experiment."

[5] "The present results provide compelling evidence that the presence of Fe strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface. This conclusion is likely to be much less dependent on the theoretical method used to describe the electronic structure of these materials"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen reacts with the substrate to form the oxidized product, creating an oxygen vacancy in the catalyst. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies and thus promotes the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv, as a lower energy requirement for vacancy formation suggests that lattice oxygen is more readily available for oxidation reactions.

The study demonstrates that doping TiO2 with Fe significantly reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy, especially at the surface. This reduction in ΔEv explains the enhanced catalytic activity observed in Fe-doped TiO2 systems, particularly for CO oxidation reactions. The presence of Fe introduces changes in the electronic structure of the oxide, which contributes to the lowering of the vacancy formation energy without significantly altering the atomic structure of anatase TiO2.

These findings highlight the importance of ΔEv as a key parameter in understanding and predicting the catalytic performance of oxide materials in oxidation reactions. By manipulating the oxygen vacancy formation energy through strategies such as doping, researchers can design more efficient catalysts for various oxidation processes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及到催化剂晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，晶格氧与底物反应形成氧化产物，同时在催化剂中产生氧空位。这个空位随后被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它促进了氧空位的形成，从而促进了Mars-van Krevelen机制。表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响，因为空位形成的能量需求较低意味着晶格氧更容易参与氧化反应。

研究表明，用Fe掺杂TiO2显著降低了氧空位形成能，尤其是在表面。ΔEv的这种降低解释了Fe掺杂TiO2系统中观察到的增强的催化活性，特别是对于CO氧化反应。Fe的存在引入了氧化物电子结构的变化，这有助于降低空位形成能，同时不显著改变锐钛矿TiO2的原子结构。

这些发现强调了ΔEv作为理解和预测氧化物材料在氧化反应中催化性能的关键参数的重要性。通过诸如掺杂等策略来操纵氧空位形成能，研究人员可以为各种氧化过程设计更高效的催化剂。
