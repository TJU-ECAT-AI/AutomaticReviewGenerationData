Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The text focuses on doping of ceria surfaces with Ta and Nb to create Ce3+ ions, and the subsequent interaction with NO2. It does not contain information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the role of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

给定的文献中没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制以及氧空位形成能(ΔEv)的重要性。文本主要关注用Ta和Nb掺杂氧化铈表面以创建Ce3+离子，以及随后与NO2的相互作用。它不包含有关Mars-van Krevelen机制或ΔEv在决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力方面的作用的信息。
