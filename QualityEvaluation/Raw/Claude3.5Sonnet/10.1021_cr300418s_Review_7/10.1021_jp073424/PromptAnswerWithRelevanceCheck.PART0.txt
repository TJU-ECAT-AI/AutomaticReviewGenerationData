[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas."

[2] "As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[3] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism, doping the ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power and Al and Ga should decrease it."

[4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst the oxide must be able to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction. If this step is very slow the oxide will be a poor catalyst."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates by supplying oxygen from the surface of the oxide to the molecule being oxidized. The reduced oxide is then reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules in the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. It serves as a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher oxidizing power, as it means oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, allowing the oxide to more readily supply oxygen for the oxidation reaction.

The ease of forming oxygen vacancies directly relates to the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Doping can influence this property - for example, doping ZnO with Au, Ag, or Cu can increase its oxidative power by lowering the energy required for vacancy formation, while doping with Al or Ga can decrease it.

However, it's important to note that a good oxidation catalyst must not only be able to supply oxygen easily (low ΔEv) but also be able to efficiently recover that oxygen by reacting with gaseous oxygen. If the reoxidation step is very slow, even an oxide with low ΔEv may be a poor catalyst overall. Therefore, both the ability to form oxygen vacancies and the ability to refill them are crucial for effective catalytic performance in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过从氧化物表面供应氧气来氧化被氧化的分子。然后，还原后的氧化物通过与气相中的氧分子反应而重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义。它是氧化物氧化能力的良好指标。较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的氧化能力，因为这意味着氧空位更容易形成，使氧化物能够更容易地为氧化反应提供氧气。

在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，形成氧空位的难易程度直接关系到氧化物的氧化能力。掺杂可以影响这一特性 - 例如，用Au、Ag或Cu掺杂ZnO可以通过降低空位形成所需的能量来增加其氧化能力，而用Al或Ga掺杂则可以降低其氧化能力。

然而，需要注意的是，一个好的氧化催化剂不仅要能够容易地供应氧气（低ΔEv），还必须能够通过与气态氧反应有效地恢复氧气。如果再氧化步骤非常缓慢，即使是ΔEv较低的氧化物也可能是一个较差的催化剂。因此，形成氧空位的能力和重新填充空位的能力对于氧化反应中的有效催化性能都至关重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The surface oxygen of the oxide is used to oxidize the reactant molecule.
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface.
3. The reduced oxide is then reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. ΔEv serves as an indicator of the oxide's oxidizing power. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher oxidizing ability.

2. The ease of forming oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

3. Doping can affect ΔEv and thus the oxidative power of the oxide. For example, doping ZnO with Au, Ag, or Cu decreases ΔEv, increasing its oxidative power, while doping with Al or Ga increases ΔEv, decreasing its oxidative power.

4. However, catalytic activity depends not only on the ease of oxygen vacancy formation but also on the ability of the oxide to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the donated oxygen. If this step is slow, even an oxide with low ΔEv may be a poor catalyst.

Therefore, while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher oxidizing ability, the overall catalytic activity depends on the balance between the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and the ability to replenish these vacancies from the gas phase.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. 氧化物表面的氧被用来氧化反应物分子。
2. 这在氧化物表面创造了一个氧空位。
3. 还原后的氧化物随后通过与气相中的氧分子反应而重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义：

1. ΔEv作为氧化物氧化能力的指标。较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的氧化能力。

2. 形成氧空位的容易程度（较低的ΔEv）是衡量氧化物在Mars-van Krevelen机制中氧化能力的标准。

3. 掺杂可以影响ΔEv，从而影响氧化物的氧化能力。例如，用Au、Ag或Cu掺杂ZnO会降低ΔEv，增加其氧化能力，而用Al或Ga掺杂会增加ΔEv，降低其氧化能力。

4. 然而，催化活性不仅取决于氧空位形成的容易程度，还取决于氧化物与气相氧反应并恢复捐赠氧的能力。如果这一步骤很慢，即使是具有低ΔEv的氧化物也可能是一个糟糕的催化剂。

因此，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的氧化能力，但整体催化活性取决于氧空位形成的容易程度与从气相补充这些空位的能力之间的平衡。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The oxygen for the oxidation reaction is supplied directly from the surface of the oxide catalyst.

2. This creates an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface.

3. The reduced oxide is then reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface for several reasons:

1. It serves as a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a stronger oxidizing ability.

2. It influences the ease of forming oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Lower ΔEv values facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

3. It can be manipulated through doping to enhance or decrease the oxide's oxidative power. For example, doping ZnO with Au, Ag, or Cu lowers ΔEv, increasing oxidative power, while doping with Al or Ga increases ΔEv, decreasing oxidative power.

However, it's important to note that a low ΔEv alone does not guarantee good catalytic performance. The oxide must also be able to efficiently reoxidize (i.e., react with gaseous oxygen to refill the vacancies) to complete the catalytic cycle. If this step is too slow, the oxide may be a poor catalyst despite having a low ΔEv.

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 它作为氧化物氧化能力的良好指标。较低的ΔEv通常表示更强的氧化能力。

2. 它影响形成氧空位的容易程度，这对Mars-van Krevelen机制至关重要。较低的ΔEv值有利于氧空位的形成，可能增加催化活性。

3. 可以通过掺杂来操纵它，以增强或降低氧化物的氧化能力。例如，用Au、Ag或Cu掺杂ZnO会降低ΔEv，增加氧化能力，而用Al或Ga掺杂会增加ΔEv，降低氧化能力。

然而，需要注意的是，仅仅低ΔEv并不能保证良好的催化性能。氧化物还必须能够有效地重新氧化（即与气态氧反应以填补空位）以完成催化循环。如果这一步骤太慢，尽管ΔEv低，氧化物可能是一种不好的催化剂。
