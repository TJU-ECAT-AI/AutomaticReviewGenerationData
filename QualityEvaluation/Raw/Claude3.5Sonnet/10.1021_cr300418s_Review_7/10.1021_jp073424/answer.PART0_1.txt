[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas."

[2] "As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[3] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars–Van Krevelen mechanism, doping the ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power and Al and Ga should decrease it."

[4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst the oxide must be able to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction. If this step is very slow the oxide will be a poor catalyst."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The surface oxygen of the oxide is used to oxidize the reactant molecule.
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface.
3. The reduced oxide is then reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. ΔEv serves as an indicator of the oxide's oxidizing power. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher oxidizing ability.

2. The ease of forming oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

3. Doping can affect ΔEv and thus the oxidative power of the oxide. For example, doping ZnO with Au, Ag, or Cu decreases ΔEv, increasing its oxidative power, while doping with Al or Ga increases ΔEv, decreasing its oxidative power.

4. However, catalytic activity depends not only on the ease of oxygen vacancy formation but also on the ability of the oxide to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the donated oxygen. If this step is slow, even an oxide with low ΔEv may be a poor catalyst.

Therefore, while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher oxidizing ability, the overall catalytic activity depends on the balance between the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and the ability to replenish these vacancies from the gas phase.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. 氧化物表面的氧被用来氧化反应物分子。
2. 这在氧化物表面创造了一个氧空位。
3. 还原后的氧化物随后通过与气相中的氧分子反应而重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义：

1. ΔEv作为氧化物氧化能力的指标。较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的氧化能力。

2. 形成氧空位的容易程度（较低的ΔEv）是衡量氧化物在Mars-van Krevelen机制中氧化能力的标准。

3. 掺杂可以影响ΔEv，从而影响氧化物的氧化能力。例如，用Au、Ag或Cu掺杂ZnO会降低ΔEv，增加其氧化能力，而用Al或Ga掺杂会增加ΔEv，降低其氧化能力。

4. 然而，催化活性不仅取决于氧空位形成的容易程度，还取决于氧化物与气相氧反应并恢复捐赠氧的能力。如果这一步骤很慢，即使是具有低ΔEv的氧化物也可能是一个糟糕的催化剂。

因此，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的氧化能力，但整体催化活性取决于氧空位形成的容易程度与从气相补充这些空位的能力之间的平衡。
