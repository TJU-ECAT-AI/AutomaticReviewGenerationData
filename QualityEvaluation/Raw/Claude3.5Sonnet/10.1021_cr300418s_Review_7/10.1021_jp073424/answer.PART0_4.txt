[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas."

[2] "As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[3] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism, doping the ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power and Al and Ga should decrease it."

[4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst the oxide must be able to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction. If this step is very slow the oxide will be a poor catalyst."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The oxygen for the oxidation reaction is supplied from the surface of the oxide catalyst.
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface.
3. The reduced oxide is then reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules from the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. ΔEv is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher oxidizing power.
2. The ease of forming oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.
3. Doping can affect ΔEv and thus the oxidative power. For example, doping ZnO with Au, Ag, or Cu decreases ΔEv, increasing oxidative power, while doping with Al or Ga increases ΔEv, decreasing oxidative power.

However, it's important to note that a lower ΔEv alone does not guarantee a good oxidation catalyst. The oxide must also be able to efficiently react with gaseous oxygen to recover the donated oxygen. If this reoxidation step is very slow, the oxide will be a poor catalyst despite having a low ΔEv.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的运作如下：

1. 氧化反应所需的氧来自氧化物催化剂的表面。
2. 这在氧化物表面创造了一个氧空位。
3. 然后，还原的氧化物通过与气相中的氧分子反应而重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义：

1. ΔEv通常是氧化物氧化能力的良好指标。较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的氧化能力。
2. 形成氧空位的容易程度（较低的ΔEv）是Mars-van Krevelen机制中氧化物氧化能力的衡量标准。
3. 掺杂可以影响ΔEv，从而影响氧化能力。例如，用Au、Ag或Cu掺杂ZnO会降低ΔEv，增加氧化能力，而用Al或Ga掺杂会增加ΔEv，降低氧化能力。

然而，值得注意的是，仅仅较低的ΔEv并不能保证是一个好的氧化催化剂。氧化物还必须能够有效地与气态氧反应以恢复捐赠的氧。如果这个再氧化步骤非常缓慢，尽管ΔEv较低，氧化物仍将是一个较差的催化剂。
