[1] "Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas."

[2] "As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide."

[3] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism, doping the ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power and Al and Ga should decrease it."

[4] "To be a good oxidation catalyst the oxide must be able to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction. If this step is very slow the oxide will be a poor catalyst."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates by supplying oxygen from the surface of the oxide to the molecule being oxidized. The reduced oxide is then reoxidized by reacting with oxygen molecules in the gas phase.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. It serves as a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide. A lower ΔEv generally indicates a higher oxidizing power, as it means oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, allowing the oxide to more readily supply oxygen for the oxidation reaction.

The ease of forming oxygen vacancies directly relates to the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Doping can influence this property - for example, doping ZnO with Au, Ag, or Cu can increase its oxidative power by lowering the energy required for vacancy formation, while doping with Al or Ga can decrease it.

However, it's important to note that a good oxidation catalyst must not only be able to supply oxygen easily (low ΔEv) but also be able to efficiently recover that oxygen by reacting with gaseous oxygen. If the reoxidation step is very slow, even an oxide with low ΔEv may be a poor catalyst overall. Therefore, both the ability to form oxygen vacancies and the ability to refill them are crucial for effective catalytic performance in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过从氧化物表面供应氧气来氧化被氧化的分子。然后，还原后的氧化物通过与气相中的氧分子反应而重新氧化。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义。它是氧化物氧化能力的良好指标。较低的ΔEv通常表示较高的氧化能力，因为这意味着氧空位更容易形成，使氧化物能够更容易地为氧化反应提供氧气。

在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，形成氧空位的难易程度直接关系到氧化物的氧化能力。掺杂可以影响这一特性 - 例如，用Au、Ag或Cu掺杂ZnO可以通过降低空位形成所需的能量来增加其氧化能力，而用Al或Ga掺杂则可以降低其氧化能力。

然而，需要注意的是，一个好的氧化催化剂不仅要能够容易地供应氧气（低ΔEv），还必须能够通过与气态氧反应有效地恢复氧气。如果再氧化步骤非常缓慢，即使是ΔEv较低的氧化物也可能是一个较差的催化剂。因此，形成氧空位的能力和重新填充空位的能力对于氧化反应中的有效催化性能都至关重要。
