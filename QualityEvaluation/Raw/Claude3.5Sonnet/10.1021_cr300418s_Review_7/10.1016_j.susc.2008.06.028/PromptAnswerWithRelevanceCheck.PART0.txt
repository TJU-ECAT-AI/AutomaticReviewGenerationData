[1] "In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen molecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the catalytic cycle."

[2] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[3] "It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria [412] by weakening CeO bonds around the dopant. A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr [3,4,11]."

[4] "The key finding is that upon doping of the (110) and (100) surfaces with Au, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is negative, indicating that if the system is in equilibrium, oxygen vacancies will be thermodynamically favourable."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle where:

1. The molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.

2. Oxygen from the gas phase then fills these vacancies, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen can be more easily removed from the surface, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

2. Ceria's effectiveness as a catalyst stems from its relatively small ΔEv, which is related to its ability to change oxidation states.

3. Doping, such as with Au, can further lower ΔEv by weakening metal-oxygen bonds, making oxygen removal even easier.

4. In some cases, like Au-doped ceria (110) and (100) surfaces, ΔEv becomes negative, indicating that oxygen vacancy formation becomes thermodynamically favorable.

5. However, an optimal balance is needed - if oxygen is removed too easily, the surface may not effectively take oxygen from the gas phase to heal vacancies, potentially limiting its effectiveness as an oxidation catalyst.

Thus, ΔEv serves as a key indicator of a material's potential as an oxidation catalyst, with lower values generally indicating higher activity, but with the caveat that extremely low values may impair the catalyst's ability to complete the full oxidation cycle.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过以下循环运作：

1. 待氧化的分子从氧化物表面获取氧，在表面形成氧空位。

2. 气相中的氧分子随后填补这些空位，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要：

1. 较低的ΔEv表明氧可以更容易从表面移除，可能增加催化活性。

2. 氧化铈作为催化剂的有效性源于其相对较小的ΔEv，这与其能够改变氧化态的能力有关。

3. 掺杂（如用Au）可以通过削弱金属-氧键进一步降低ΔEv，使氧的移除更加容易。

4. 在某些情况下，如Au掺杂的氧化铈(110)和(100)表面，ΔEv变为负值，表明氧空位形成在热力学上变得有利。

5. 然而，需要一个最佳平衡 - 如果氧被移除得太容易，表面可能无法有效地从气相中获取氧来愈合空位，可能限制其作为氧化催化剂的有效性。

因此，ΔEv作为材料作为氧化催化剂潜力的关键指标，较低的值通常表示较高的活性，但需要注意的是，极低的值可能会损害催化剂完成完整氧化循环的能力。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.
2. Oxygen from the gas phase then fills these vacancies, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface can more easily give up oxygen, making it a better oxidant.
2. However, if ΔEv is too low, the surface may not be able to effectively take oxygen from the gas phase to heal the vacancies.
3. The ideal catalyst strikes a balance - it should be able to give up oxygen easily enough to oxidize the target molecule, but not so easily that it cannot be re-oxidized by gas phase oxygen.

Ceria is particularly effective because it has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, due to its ability to change oxidation state from Ce4+ to Ce3+. Doping can further enhance this property by weakening Ce-O bonds around the dopant, facilitating the reduction of ceria and potentially improving its catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制的运作如下：

1. 待氧化的分子从氧化物表面获取氧，形成氧空位。
2. 气相中的氧然后填充这些空位，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要，因为：

1. 较低的ΔEv表明表面更容易释放氧，使其成为更好的氧化剂。
2. 然而，如果ΔEv过低，表面可能无法有效地从气相中获取氧来修复空位。
3. 理想的催化剂需要在两者之间取得平衡 - 它应该能够足够容易地释放氧以氧化目标分子，但又不能过于容易以至于无法被气相氧重新氧化。

氧化铈之所以特别有效，是因为它具有相对较小的氧空位形成能，这归因于其从Ce4+到Ce3+的氧化态变化能力。掺杂可以进一步增强这一特性，通过削弱掺杂剂周围的Ce-O键，促进氧化铈的还原，从而可能提高其催化性能。

[1] "Since at sufficiently high temperature and an oxygen pressure of 1 atm almost all dopants have an oxygen vacancy next to them, it is the formation of a second oxygen vacancy that determines the oxidation activity of the doped surface."

[2] "A good oxidant needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase."

[3] "The vacancy formation energies show that the dopant facilitates the formation of a second oxygen vacancy on (110) but not on (100), revealing a notable surface dependence that could be exploited in the design of nanostructured ceria catalysts."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface to oxidize adsorbed reactants, followed by the replenishment of these oxygen vacancies by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more easily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction, potentially increasing catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be able to effectively replenish its oxygen from the gas phase, limiting its long-term catalytic performance. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv should strike a balance between these two factors.

The significance of ΔEv is demonstrated in the study of doped ceria surfaces. For example, on the Au-doped ceria (110) surface, the formation of a second oxygen vacancy is facilitated, potentially enhancing oxidation activity. However, this effect is not observed on the (100) surface, highlighting the importance of surface structure in determining catalytic properties.

In summary, ΔEv plays a critical role in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by influencing both the ability of the oxide to provide oxygen for reactions and its capacity to regenerate oxygen vacancies. Tailoring ΔEv through strategies such as doping or controlling surface structure can lead to the development of more efficient oxidation catalysts.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及从催化剂表面移除晶格氧原子以氧化吸附的反应物，然后由气相氧补充这些氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv通常表明氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，可能会增加催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能无法有效地从气相补充氧，限制其长期催化性能。因此，最佳的ΔEv应在这两个因素之间取得平衡。

ΔEv的重要性在掺杂的氧化铈表面研究中得到了证明。例如，在Au掺杂的氧化铈（110）表面上，第二个氧空位的形成被促进，可能增强氧化活性。然而，在（100）表面上没有观察到这种效应，突出了表面结构在决定催化性能方面的重要性。

总之，ΔEv在Mars-van Krevelen机理中起着关键作用，它影响氧化物提供氧气进行反应的能力以及再生氧空位的能力。通过掺杂或控制表面结构等策略调整ΔEv可以导致开发更高效的氧化催化剂。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

2. An oxygen molecule from the gas phase fills the vacancy, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A smaller ΔEv indicates that the surface can more easily give up oxygen atoms, making it a better oxidant.

2. However, if ΔEv is too small, the surface may not be effective at taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the vacancy.

3. An optimal catalyst must balance these two factors - it should be able to give up oxygen easily enough to oxidize the target molecule, but not so easily that it cannot be reoxidized by gas phase oxygen.

4. Ceria's effectiveness as a catalyst is partly due to its relatively small ΔEv, which is related to its ability to change oxidation states.

5. Doping can further reduce ΔEv by weakening metal-oxygen bonds, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

Thus, ΔEv is a crucial parameter in determining the effectiveness of an oxide as an oxidation catalyst, influencing both its ability to donate oxygen and to be reoxidized in the catalytic cycle.
