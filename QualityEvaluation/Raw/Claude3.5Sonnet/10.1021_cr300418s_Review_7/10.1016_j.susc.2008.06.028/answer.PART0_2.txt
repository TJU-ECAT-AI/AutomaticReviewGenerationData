[1] "Since at sufficiently high temperature and an oxygen pressure of 1 atm almost all dopants have an oxygen vacancy next to them, it is the formation of a second oxygen vacancy that determines the oxidation activity of the doped surface."

[2] "A good oxidant needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase."

[3] "The vacancy formation energies show that the dopant facilitates the formation of a second oxygen vacancy on (110) but not on (100), revealing a notable surface dependence that could be exploited in the design of nanostructured ceria catalysts."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface to oxidize adsorbed reactants, followed by the replenishment of these oxygen vacancies by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more easily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction, potentially increasing catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be able to effectively replenish its oxygen from the gas phase, limiting its long-term catalytic performance. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv should strike a balance between these two factors.

The significance of ΔEv is demonstrated in the study of doped ceria surfaces. For example, on the Au-doped ceria (110) surface, the formation of a second oxygen vacancy is facilitated, potentially enhancing oxidation activity. However, this effect is not observed on the (100) surface, highlighting the importance of surface structure in determining catalytic properties.

In summary, ΔEv plays a critical role in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by influencing both the ability of the oxide to provide oxygen for reactions and its capacity to regenerate oxygen vacancies. Tailoring ΔEv through strategies such as doping or controlling surface structure can lead to the development of more efficient oxidation catalysts.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及从催化剂表面移除晶格氧原子以氧化吸附的反应物，然后由气相氧补充这些氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv通常表明氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，可能会增加催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能无法有效地从气相补充氧，限制其长期催化性能。因此，最佳的ΔEv应在这两个因素之间取得平衡。

ΔEv的重要性在掺杂的氧化铈表面研究中得到了证明。例如，在Au掺杂的氧化铈（110）表面上，第二个氧空位的形成被促进，可能增强氧化活性。然而，在（100）表面上没有观察到这种效应，突出了表面结构在决定催化性能方面的重要性。

总之，ΔEv在Mars-van Krevelen机理中起着关键作用，它影响氧化物提供氧气进行反应的能力以及再生氧空位的能力。通过掺杂或控制表面结构等策略调整ΔEv可以导致开发更高效的氧化催化剂。
