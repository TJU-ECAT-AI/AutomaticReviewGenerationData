[1] "In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen molecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the catalytic cycle."

[2] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[3] "It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria [412] by weakening CeO bonds around the dopant."

[4] "A good oxidant needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.
2. Oxygen from the gas phase then fills these vacancies, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface can more easily give up oxygen, making it a better oxidant.
2. However, if ΔEv is too low, the surface may not be able to effectively take oxygen from the gas phase to heal the vacancies.
3. The ideal catalyst strikes a balance - it should be able to give up oxygen easily enough to oxidize the target molecule, but not so easily that it cannot be re-oxidized by gas phase oxygen.

Ceria is particularly effective because it has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, due to its ability to change oxidation state from Ce4+ to Ce3+. Doping can further enhance this property by weakening Ce-O bonds around the dopant, facilitating the reduction of ceria and potentially improving its catalytic performance.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制的运作如下：

1. 待氧化的分子从氧化物表面获取氧，形成氧空位。
2. 气相中的氧然后填充这些空位，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都很重要，因为：

1. 较低的ΔEv表明表面更容易释放氧，使其成为更好的氧化剂。
2. 然而，如果ΔEv过低，表面可能无法有效地从气相中获取氧来修复空位。
3. 理想的催化剂需要在两者之间取得平衡 - 它应该能够足够容易地释放氧以氧化目标分子，但又不能过于容易以至于无法被气相氧重新氧化。

氧化铈之所以特别有效，是因为它具有相对较小的氧空位形成能，这归因于其从Ce4+到Ce3+的氧化态变化能力。掺杂可以进一步增强这一特性，通过削弱掺杂剂周围的Ce-O键，促进氧化铈的还原，从而可能提高其催化性能。
