[1] "In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen molecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the catalytic cycle."

[2] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[3] "It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria [412] by weakening CeO bonds around the dopant. A number of computational studies have demonstrated that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is lower when the surface is doped with Zr [3,4,11]."

[4] "Thus, assuming the energetics of vacancy formation are reasonably described with DFT (we have computed a lowering of the formation energy by 0.41 eV with DFT + U on the undoped (100) surface, compared to DFT [21]), then gold doping of ceria surfaces will make oxygen vacancies thermodynamically favourable."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a cycle where:

1. The molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the oxide surface, creating oxygen vacancies.

2. Oxygen from the gas phase then fills these vacancies, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, potentially increasing catalytic activity.

2. However, if ΔEv is too low, the surface may be over-reduced and unable to effectively reoxidize, limiting its oxidizing ability.

3. Doping, such as with gold, can lower ΔEv by weakening metal-oxygen bonds, making oxygen vacancies thermodynamically favorable and potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

4. The ability of ceria to change oxidation states (Ce4+ to Ce3+) contributes to its relatively low ΔEv, making it an effective catalyst for oxidation reactions.

5. The balance between ease of oxygen removal and ability to reoxidize is crucial for an effective oxidation catalyst.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式如下：

1. 待氧化分子从氧化物表面获取氧，形成氧空位。

2. 气相中的氧随后填补这些空位，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力很重要，原因如下：

1. 较低的ΔEv表示从表面移除氧更容易，可能会增加催化活性。

2. 然而，如果ΔEv过低，表面可能会过度还原，无法有效地重新氧化，从而限制其氧化能力。

3. 掺杂（如金）可以通过削弱金属-氧键来降低ΔEv，使氧空位在热力学上更有利，从而可能提高催化活性。

4. 氧化铈能够改变氧化态（Ce4+到Ce3+）的能力导致其相对较低的ΔEv，使其成为有效的氧化反应催化剂。

5. 氧的易移除性与重新氧化能力之间的平衡对于有效的氧化催化剂至关重要。
