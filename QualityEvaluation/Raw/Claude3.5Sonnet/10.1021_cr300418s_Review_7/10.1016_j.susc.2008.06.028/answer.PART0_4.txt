[1] "In most cases the molecule to be oxidized takes oxygen from the surface creating oxygen vacancies on it. The oxygen molecule from the gas phase annihilates the vacancies closing thus the catalytic cycle."

[2] "Ceria surfaces have a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which arises from the ability of ceria to change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[3] "It is believed that doping facilitates the reduction of ceria [412] by weakening CeO bonds around the dopant."

[4] "A good oxidant needs to give away oxygen easily. A good oxidation catalyst must strike a balance [12]: if it gives oxygen too easily it will not be effective in taking oxygen from the gas phase."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The molecule to be oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.

2. An oxygen molecule from the gas phase fills the vacancy, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. A smaller ΔEv indicates that the surface can more easily give up oxygen atoms, making it a better oxidant.

2. However, if ΔEv is too small, the surface may not be effective at taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the vacancy.

3. An optimal catalyst must balance these two factors - it should be able to give up oxygen easily enough to oxidize the target molecule, but not so easily that it cannot be reoxidized by gas phase oxygen.

4. Ceria's effectiveness as a catalyst is partly due to its relatively small ΔEv, which is related to its ability to change oxidation states.

5. Doping can further reduce ΔEv by weakening metal-oxygen bonds, potentially enhancing catalytic activity.

Thus, ΔEv is a crucial parameter in determining the effectiveness of an oxide as an oxidation catalyst, influencing both its ability to donate oxygen and to be reoxidized in the catalytic cycle.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的操作如下：

1. 待氧化的分子从氧化物表面获取氧原子，形成氧空位。

2. 气相中的氧分子填补空位，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义，因为：

1. 较小的ΔEv表明表面可以更容易地释放氧原子，使其成为更好的氧化剂。

2. 然而，如果ΔEv太小，表面可能无法有效地从气相中获取氧气来修复空位。

3. 最佳催化剂必须平衡这两个因素 - 它应该能够足够容易地释放氧气以氧化目标分子，但又不能过于容易以至于无法被气相氧气再氧化。

4. 氧化铈作为催化剂的有效性部分归因于其相对较小的ΔEv，这与其能够改变氧化态有关。

5. 掺杂可以通过削弱金属-氧键进一步降低ΔEv，可能增强催化活性。

因此，ΔEv是决定氧化物作为氧化催化剂有效性的关键参数，影响其捐赠氧气和在催化循环中被再氧化的能力。
