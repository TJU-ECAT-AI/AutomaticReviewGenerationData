[1] "For bulk ceria, most oxidation occurs over a very narrow range of P(O2) in this temperature range because there are two ceria phases, a reduced phase and a more oxidized phase, in equilibrium at 973 K and below [42]."

[2] "Assuming that the results for the LA-supported ceria are indicative of the surface ceria, oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

[3] "While it is tempting to associate surface oxygen with high catalytic activity, it is important to remember that, at least for some reactions, the activity of the ceria does not scale with surface area [2023]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower ΔEv generally indicates easier removal of lattice oxygen, which can lead to higher catalytic activity. However, the relationship is not always straightforward. The quoted literature suggests that for ceria, surface oxygen has lower binding energies compared to bulk oxygen, which could potentially facilitate the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. 

However, the document also notes that catalytic activity does not always scale with surface area, implying that factors beyond just the ease of oxygen removal are important. The significance of ΔEv lies in its influence on the oxide's ability to provide oxygen for the reaction and then replenish that oxygen from the gas phase. A balance is needed - the oxide must be able to release oxygen readily enough to facilitate the reaction, but not so readily that it becomes irreversibly reduced under reaction conditions.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or ΔEv, so this answer is limited in scope and largely inferred from the information provided about ceria's redox properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。

较低的ΔEv通常表示晶格氧更容易被移除，这可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，这种关系并不总是直接的。引用的文献表明，对于氧化铈来说，表面氧的结合能比体相氧低，这可能有利于Mars-van Krevelen机理的进行。

然而，文献也指出催化活性并不总是与表面积成正比，这意味着除了氧的易移除性之外，还有其他重要因素。ΔEv的重要性在于它影响氧化物为反应提供氧并从气相补充氧的能力。需要一个平衡 - 氧化物必须能够足够容易地释放氧以促进反应，但又不能过于容易以至于在反应条件下不可逆地被还原。

文献并未对Mars-van Krevelen机理或ΔEv进行全面讨论，因此这个回答的范围有限，主要是从提供的关于氧化铈氧化还原性质的信息中推断出来的。
