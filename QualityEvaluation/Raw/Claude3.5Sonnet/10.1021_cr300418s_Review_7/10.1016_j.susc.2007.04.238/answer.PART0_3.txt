[1] "In all of these applications, it is likely that the ability of cerium to cycle between Ce+3 and Ce+4 is crucial."

[2] "Since the reducibility of ceria is strongly affected by the presence of dopants and the structure of the material, much of the catalyst literature has focused on developing ways to tailor the properties of ceria."

[3] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."

[4] "Assuming that the results for the LA-supported ceria are indicative of the surface ceria, oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen oxidizes the reactant and creates an oxygen vacancy, which is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally leads to higher catalytic activity, as it makes lattice oxygen more readily available for reaction. The quoted literature shows that surface ceria has lower oxygen binding energies compared to bulk ceria, with a difference of over 200 kJ/mol O2. This suggests that surface ceria would have a lower ΔEv and thus potentially higher catalytic activity.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A lower ΔEv means the oxide can more easily release oxygen, enhancing its oxidizing power. The literature indicates that oxidation enthalpies for ceria/LA vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 to 760 kJ/mol O2. This variability in oxidation enthalpies suggests that the oxidizing ability of ceria can be tuned depending on the degree of reduction.

The significance of ΔEv is further emphasized by the focus in catalyst literature on tailoring ceria properties through dopants and structural modifications. These modifications likely aim to optimize ΔEv and other related properties to enhance catalytic performance in various applications.

The ability of cerium to cycle between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states is crucial for its catalytic applications, and this redox behavior is directly related to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and refilling. Therefore, understanding and controlling ΔEv is key to developing more effective ceria-based catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物催化剂晶格氧的参与。在这个机理中，晶格氧氧化反应物并产生氧空位，然后由气相氧填补。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为它使晶格氧更容易参与反应。引用的文献显示，表面氧化铈的氧结合能比体相氧化铈低200多kJ/mol O2。这表明表面氧化铈可能具有较低的ΔEv，从而可能具有更高的催化活性。

氧化物表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv影响。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物可以更容易地释放氧，增强其氧化能力。文献表明，氧化铈/LA的氧化焓随还原程度的不同而变化，范围从500到760 kJ/mol O2。这种氧化焓的可变性表明氧化铈的氧化能力可以根据还原程度进行调节。

ΔEv的重要性还体现在催化剂文献对通过掺杂和结构修饰来调整氧化铈性质的关注上。这些修饰可能旨在优化ΔEv和其他相关性质，以提高各种应用中的催化性能。

铈在Ce3+和Ce4+状态之间循环的能力对其催化应用至关重要，这种氧化还原行为直接关系到氧空位形成和填补的难易程度。因此，理解和控制ΔEv是开发更有效的基于氧化铈的氧化反应催化剂的关键。
