[1] "In all of these applications, it is likely that the ability of cerium to cycle between Ce+3 and Ce+4 is crucial."

[2] "Even with pure ceria, there is evidence that the redox properties of nano-crystallites used in catalysis are very different from the thermodynamic properties of the ceria that was used for the data tabulated in the handbooks."

[3] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."

[4] "Assuming that the results for the LA-supported ceria are indicative of the surface ceria, oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

Lower ΔEv values generally lead to higher catalytic activity, as it becomes easier to remove lattice oxygen for reaction with adsorbed species. This is evident from the lower oxidation enthalpies observed for surface ceria compared to bulk ceria, with differences of over 200 kJ/mol O2. The ability of cerium to cycle between Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states is critical for this process.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv. Lower vacancy formation energies allow for easier removal of lattice oxygen, potentially increasing the oxidizing power of the catalyst. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may lead to over-reduction of the catalyst and loss of activity.

The study shows that the redox properties of catalytically relevant ceria nanocrystallites differ significantly from bulk ceria. Surface ceria exhibits lower oxygen binding energies, which likely contributes to its enhanced catalytic activity. Additionally, the oxidation enthalpies for supported ceria vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents.

These findings highlight the importance of studying the thermodynamic properties of catalytically relevant materials rather than relying solely on bulk data from handbooks. Understanding the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic performance can guide the design of more effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv值通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为这使得移除晶格氧与吸附物种反应变得更容易。这从表面氧化铈与体相氧化铈相比观察到的较低氧化焓中可以看出，差异超过200 kJ/mol O2。铈在Ce3+和Ce4+氧化态之间循环的能力对这个过程至关重要。

氧化物表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。较低的空位形成能使得晶格氧更容易被移除，可能会增加催化剂的氧化能力。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会导致催化剂过度还原和活性损失。

研究表明，具有催化相关性的氧化铈纳米晶体的氧化还原性质与体相氧化铈显著不同。表面氧化铈表现出较低的氧结合能，这可能有助于其增强的催化活性。此外，负载氧化铈的氧化焓随还原程度的变化而变化，在低还原程度时为500 kJ/mol O2，在高还原程度时接近体相值760 kJ/mol O2。

这些发现强调了研究具有催化相关性材料的热力学性质的重要性，而不是仅仅依赖于手册中的体相数据。理解ΔEv与催化性能之间的关系可以指导设计更有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应。
