[1] "For example, only recently has it been shown that the thermodynamic properties, not simply the reduction kinetics, of ceriazirconia solid solutions differ dramatically from those of pure ceria [17,18]."

[2] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."

[3] "Oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical parameter that influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally corresponds to higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen to participate in the oxidation reaction. This is exemplified by the lower oxidation enthalpies observed for surface ceria compared to bulk ceria. The oxidation enthalpies for ceria supported on La-modified alumina ranged from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents, with surface oxygen binding energies being more than 200 kJ/mol O2 lower than bulk values.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also related to ΔEv. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide can more readily release oxygen, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be able to effectively replenish its lattice oxygen, potentially limiting its long-term catalytic performance.

The significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic properties is further highlighted by the observation that thermodynamic properties, not just reduction kinetics, can dramatically affect the behavior of catalytic materials. This emphasizes the importance of studying the thermodynamic properties of catalytically relevant materials, as bulk properties may not accurately represent the behavior of high-surface-area or supported catalysts.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及到来自氧化物催化剂的晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是一个关键参数，它影响着氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

较低的ΔEv通常对应着更高的催化活性，因为它允许晶格氧更容易被移除以参与氧化反应。这一点在表面氧化铈与体相氧化铈的氧化焓对比中得到了体现。对于负载在镧改性氧化铝上的氧化铈，其氧化焓在低还原程度时为500 kJ/mol O2，在高还原程度时接近体相值760 kJ/mol O2，表面氧结合能比体相值低200多kJ/mol O2。

氧化物表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易地释放氧，可能使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能无法有效地补充其晶格氧，可能会限制其长期催化性能。

ΔEv在决定催化性质方面的重要性进一步体现在热力学性质，而不仅仅是还原动力学，可以显著影响催化材料的行为这一观察结果上。这强调了研究具有催化相关性的材料的热力学性质的重要性，因为体相性质可能无法准确地代表高比表面积或负载型催化剂的行为。

[1] "For bulk ceria, most oxidation occurs over a very narrow range of P(O2) in this temperature range because there are two ceria phases, a reduced phase and a more oxidized phase, in equilibrium at 973 K and below [42]."

[2] "Assuming that the results for the LA-supported ceria are indicative of the surface ceria, oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

[3] "While it is tempting to associate surface oxygen with high catalytic activity, it is important to remember that, at least for some reactions, the activity of the ceria does not scale with surface area [2023]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower ΔEv generally indicates easier removal of lattice oxygen, which can lead to higher catalytic activity. However, the relationship is not always straightforward. The quoted literature suggests that for ceria, surface oxygen has lower binding energies compared to bulk oxygen, which could potentially facilitate the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. 

However, the document also notes that catalytic activity does not always scale with surface area, implying that factors beyond just the ease of oxygen removal are important. The significance of ΔEv lies in its influence on the oxide's ability to provide oxygen for the reaction and then replenish that oxygen from the gas phase. A balance is needed - the oxide must be able to release oxygen readily enough to facilitate the reaction, but not so readily that it becomes irreversibly reduced under reaction conditions.

The literature does not provide a comprehensive discussion of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or ΔEv, so this answer is limited in scope and largely inferred from the information provided about ceria's redox properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。

较低的ΔEv通常表示晶格氧更容易被移除，这可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，这种关系并不总是直接的。引用的文献表明，对于氧化铈来说，表面氧的结合能比体相氧低，这可能有利于Mars-van Krevelen机理的进行。

然而，文献也指出催化活性并不总是与表面积成正比，这意味着除了氧的易移除性之外，还有其他重要因素。ΔEv的重要性在于它影响氧化物为反应提供氧并从气相补充氧的能力。需要一个平衡 - 氧化物必须能够足够容易地释放氧以促进反应，但又不能过于容易以至于在反应条件下不可逆地被还原。

文献并未对Mars-van Krevelen机理或ΔEv进行全面讨论，因此这个回答的范围有限，主要是从提供的关于氧化铈氧化还原性质的信息中推断出来的。

[1] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."

[2] "While it is tempting to associate surface oxygen with high catalytic activity, it is important to remember that, at least for some reactions, the activity of the ceria does not scale with surface area [2023]."

[3] "It is likely that high temperatures change the structure of the surface in such a way that the oxygen is more strongly bound and that factors other than surface versus bulk are involved in the catalytic properties of ceria."

[4] "It is also possible that factors other than oxygen binding energy are important for understanding the catalytic properties of ceria. Indeed, factors other than binding energy must be important. There are other oxides with multiple oxidation states and similar oxidation enthalpies that are not as active as ceria for oxidation of hydrocarbons."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen of the oxide reacts with the substrate, creating an oxygen vacancy, which is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its relationship to the ease of oxygen release from the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more readily release oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic activity is not always straightforward.

For ceria, the study shows that surface oxygen has lower oxidation enthalpies compared to bulk oxygen, which could facilitate easier oxygen release and potentially enhance catalytic activity. However, the research also highlights that catalytic activity does not always scale with surface area, suggesting that other factors beyond just the energy of oxygen vacancy formation are important.

The study emphasizes that factors such as surface structure, crystallographic geometry, and the exposure of metal cations can also play significant roles in determining catalytic properties. Additionally, the presence of hydroxyl groups or specific site geometries may influence the oxygen binding and catalytic behavior.

In conclusion, while the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation is an important factor in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and can influence catalytic activity, it is not the sole determinant. The overall catalytic performance of oxide surfaces involves a complex interplay of various factors, including surface structure, site geometry, and potentially other electronic or structural properties that are not fully understood yet.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，氧化物的表面氧与底物反应，形成氧空位，然后由气相氧重新填充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物表面释放氧的容易程度有关。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧化物可以更容易地释放氧，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，ΔEv与催化活性之间的关系并不总是简单直接的。

对于氧化铈，研究表明表面氧比体相氧具有较低的氧化焓，这可能有利于更容易释放氧气，从而可能提高催化活性。然而，研究也强调催化活性并不总是与表面积成正比，这表明除了氧空位形成能量之外，还有其他因素很重要。

研究强调，表面结构、晶体学几何形状和金属阳离子的暴露等因素也在决定催化性能中起着重要作用。此外，羟基的存在或特定的位点几何形状可能影响氧结合和催化行为。

总之，虽然氧空位形成所需的能量是Mars-van Krevelen机制中的一个重要因素，并且可以影响催化活性，但它并不是唯一的决定因素。氧化物表面的整体催化性能涉及各种因素的复杂相互作用，包括表面结构、位点几何形状以及可能还有其他尚未完全理解的电子或结构特性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen oxidizes the reactant and creates an oxygen vacancy, which is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally leads to higher catalytic activity, as it makes lattice oxygen more readily available for reaction. The quoted literature shows that surface ceria has lower oxygen binding energies compared to bulk ceria, with a difference of over 200 kJ/mol O2. This suggests that surface ceria would have a lower ΔEv and thus potentially higher catalytic activity.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A lower ΔEv means the oxide can more easily release oxygen, enhancing its oxidizing power. The literature indicates that oxidation enthalpies for ceria/LA vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 to 760 kJ/mol O2. This variability in oxidation enthalpies suggests that the oxidizing ability of ceria can be tuned depending on the degree of reduction.

The significance of ΔEv is further emphasized by the focus in catalyst literature on tailoring ceria properties through dopants and structural modifications. These modifications likely aim to optimize ΔEv and other related properties to enhance catalytic performance in various applications.

The ability of cerium to cycle between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states is crucial for its catalytic applications, and this redox behavior is directly related to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation and refilling. Therefore, understanding and controlling ΔEv is key to developing more effective ceria-based catalysts for oxidation reactions.

ΔEv的重要性还体现在催化剂文献对通过掺杂和结构修饰来调整氧化铈性质的关注上。这些修饰可能旨在优化ΔEv和其他相关性质，以提高各种应用中的催化性能。

铈在Ce3+和Ce4+状态之间循环的能力对其催化应用至关重要，这种氧化还原行为直接关系到氧空位形成和填补的难易程度。因此，理解和控制ΔEv是开发更有效的基于氧化铈的氧化反应催化剂的关键。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

Lower ΔEv values generally lead to higher catalytic activity, as it becomes easier to remove lattice oxygen for reaction with adsorbed species. This is evident from the lower oxidation enthalpies observed for surface ceria compared to bulk ceria, with differences of over 200 kJ/mol O2. The ability of cerium to cycle between Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states is critical for this process.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv. Lower vacancy formation energies allow for easier removal of lattice oxygen, potentially increasing the oxidizing power of the catalyst. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may lead to over-reduction of the catalyst and loss of activity.

The study shows that the redox properties of catalytically relevant ceria nanocrystallites differ significantly from bulk ceria. Surface ceria exhibits lower oxygen binding energies, which likely contributes to its enhanced catalytic activity. Additionally, the oxidation enthalpies for supported ceria vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents.

These findings highlight the importance of studying the thermodynamic properties of catalytically relevant materials rather than relying solely on bulk data from handbooks. Understanding the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic performance can guide the design of more effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

较低的ΔEv值通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为这使得移除晶格氧与吸附物种反应变得更容易。这从表面氧化铈与体相氧化铈相比观察到的较低氧化焓中可以看出，差异超过200 kJ/mol O2。铈在Ce3+和Ce4+氧化态之间循环的能力对这个过程至关重要。

研究表明，具有催化相关性的氧化铈纳米晶体的氧化还原性质与体相氧化铈显著不同。表面氧化铈表现出较低的氧结合能，这可能有助于其增强的催化活性。此外，负载氧化铈的氧化焓随还原程度的变化而变化，在低还原程度时为500 kJ/mol O2，在高还原程度时接近体相值760 kJ/mol O2。

这些发现强调了研究具有催化相关性材料的热力学性质的重要性，而不是仅仅依赖于手册中的体相数据。理解ΔEv与催化性能之间的关系可以指导设计更有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应。
