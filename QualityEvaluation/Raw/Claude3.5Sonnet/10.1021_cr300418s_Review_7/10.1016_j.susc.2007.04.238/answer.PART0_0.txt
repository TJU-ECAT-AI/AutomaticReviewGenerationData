[1] "For example, only recently has it been shown that the thermodynamic properties, not simply the reduction kinetics, of ceriazirconia solid solutions differ dramatically from those of pure ceria [17,18]."

[2] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical parameter that influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally corresponds to higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen to participate in the oxidation reaction. This is exemplified by the lower oxidation enthalpies observed for surface ceria compared to bulk ceria. The oxidation enthalpies for ceria supported on La-modified alumina ranged from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents, with surface oxygen binding energies being more than 200 kJ/mol O2 lower than bulk values.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also related to ΔEv. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide can more readily release oxygen, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be able to effectively replenish its lattice oxygen, potentially limiting its long-term catalytic performance.

The significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic properties is further highlighted by the observation that thermodynamic properties, not just reduction kinetics, can dramatically affect the behavior of catalytic materials. This emphasizes the importance of studying the thermodynamic properties of catalytically relevant materials, as bulk properties may not accurately represent the behavior of high-surface-area or supported catalysts.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及到来自氧化物催化剂的晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是一个关键参数，它影响着氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

较低的ΔEv通常对应着更高的催化活性，因为它允许晶格氧更容易被移除以参与氧化反应。这一点在表面氧化铈与体相氧化铈的氧化焓对比中得到了体现。对于负载在镧改性氧化铝上的氧化铈，其氧化焓在低还原程度时为500 kJ/mol O2，在高还原程度时接近体相值760 kJ/mol O2，表面氧结合能比体相值低200多kJ/mol O2。

氧化物表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易地释放氧，可能使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能无法有效地补充其晶格氧，可能会限制其长期催化性能。

ΔEv在决定催化性质方面的重要性进一步体现在热力学性质，而不仅仅是还原动力学，可以显著影响催化材料的行为这一观察结果上。这强调了研究具有催化相关性的材料的热力学性质的重要性，因为体相性质可能无法准确地代表高比表面积或负载型催化剂的行为。
