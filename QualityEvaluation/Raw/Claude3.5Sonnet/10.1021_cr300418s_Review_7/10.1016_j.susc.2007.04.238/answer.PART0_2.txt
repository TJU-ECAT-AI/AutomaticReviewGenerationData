[1] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."

[2] "While it is tempting to associate surface oxygen with high catalytic activity, it is important to remember that, at least for some reactions, the activity of the ceria does not scale with surface area [2023]."

[3] "It is likely that high temperatures change the structure of the surface in such a way that the oxygen is more strongly bound and that factors other than surface versus bulk are involved in the catalytic properties of ceria."

[4] "It is also possible that factors other than oxygen binding energy are important for understanding the catalytic properties of ceria. Indeed, factors other than binding energy must be important. There are other oxides with multiple oxidation states and similar oxidation enthalpies that are not as active as ceria for oxidation of hydrocarbons."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen of the oxide reacts with the substrate, creating an oxygen vacancy, which is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its relationship to the ease of oxygen release from the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more readily release oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic activity is not always straightforward.

For ceria, the study shows that surface oxygen has lower oxidation enthalpies compared to bulk oxygen, which could facilitate easier oxygen release and potentially enhance catalytic activity. However, the research also highlights that catalytic activity does not always scale with surface area, suggesting that other factors beyond just the energy of oxygen vacancy formation are important.

The study emphasizes that factors such as surface structure, crystallographic geometry, and the exposure of metal cations can also play significant roles in determining catalytic properties. Additionally, the presence of hydroxyl groups or specific site geometries may influence the oxygen binding and catalytic behavior.

In conclusion, while the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation is an important factor in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and can influence catalytic activity, it is not the sole determinant. The overall catalytic performance of oxide surfaces involves a complex interplay of various factors, including surface structure, site geometry, and potentially other electronic or structural properties that are not fully understood yet.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，氧化物的表面氧与底物反应，形成氧空位，然后由气相氧重新填充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物表面释放氧的容易程度有关。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧化物可以更容易地释放氧，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，ΔEv与催化活性之间的关系并不总是简单直接的。

对于氧化铈，研究表明表面氧比体相氧具有较低的氧化焓，这可能有利于更容易释放氧气，从而可能提高催化活性。然而，研究也强调催化活性并不总是与表面积成正比，这表明除了氧空位形成能量之外，还有其他因素很重要。

研究强调，表面结构、晶体学几何形状和金属阳离子的暴露等因素也在决定催化性能中起着重要作用。此外，羟基的存在或特定的位点几何形状可能影响氧结合和催化行为。

总之，虽然氧空位形成所需的能量是Mars-van Krevelen机制中的一个重要因素，并且可以影响催化活性，但它并不是唯一的决定因素。氧化物表面的整体催化性能涉及各种因素的复杂相互作用，包括表面结构、位点几何形状以及可能还有其他尚未完全理解的电子或结构特性。
