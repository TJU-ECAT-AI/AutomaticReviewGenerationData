          [1] "For example, only recently has it been shown that the thermodynamic properties, not simply the reduction kinetics, of ceriazirconia solid solutions differ dramatically from those of pure ceria [17,18]."

[2] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."

[3] "Oxygen binding energies at the surface are lower than those associated with the bulk by more than 200 kJ/mol O2."

[4] "For bulk ceria, most oxidation occurs over a very narrow range of P(O2) in this temperature range because there are two ceria phases, a reduced phase and a more oxidized phase, in equilibrium at 973 K and below [42]."

[5] "While it is tempting to associate surface oxygen with high catalytic activity, it is important to remember that, at least for some reactions, the activity of the ceria does not scale with surface area [2023]."

[6] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."

[7] "It is likely that high temperatures change the structure of the surface in such a way that the oxygen is more strongly bound and that factors other than surface versus bulk are involved in the catalytic properties of ceria."

[8] "It is also possible that factors other than oxygen binding energy are important for understanding the catalytic properties of ceria. Indeed, factors other than binding energy must be important. There are other oxides with multiple oxidation states and similar oxidation enthalpies that are not as active as ceria for oxidation of hydrocarbons."

[9] "In all of these applications, it is likely that the ability of cerium to cycle between Ce+3 and Ce+4 is crucial."

[10] "Since the reducibility of ceria is strongly affected by the presence of dopants and the structure of the material, much of the catalyst literature has focused on developing ways to tailor the properties of ceria."

[11] "Even with pure ceria, there is evidence that the redox properties of nano-crystallites used in catalysis are very different from the thermodynamic properties of the ceria that was used for the data tabulated in the handbooks."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, lattice oxygen oxidizes the reactant and creates an oxygen vacancy, which is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv generally corresponds to higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen to participate in the oxidation reaction. This is exemplified by the lower oxidation enthalpies observed for surface ceria compared to bulk ceria. The oxidation enthalpies for ceria supported on La-modified alumina ranged from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents, with surface oxygen binding energies being more than 200 kJ/mol O2 lower than bulk values.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also related to ΔEv. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide can more readily release oxygen, potentially making it a stronger oxidizing agent. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be able to effectively replenish its lattice oxygen, potentially limiting its long-term catalytic performance.

The significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic properties is highlighted by several factors:

1. Thermodynamic properties, not just reduction kinetics, can dramatically affect the behavior of catalytic materials.
2. The redox properties of catalytically relevant ceria nanocrystallites differ significantly from bulk ceria.
3. The ability of cerium to cycle between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states is crucial for its catalytic applications.
4. The presence of dopants and the structure of the material strongly affect the reducibility of ceria.

However, it's important to note that factors other than ΔEv also play a role in determining catalytic activity:

1. Catalytic activity does not always scale with surface area.
2. High temperatures can change the surface structure, affecting oxygen binding.
3. Other oxides with similar oxidation enthalpies are not as active as ceria for hydrocarbon oxidation, suggesting that additional factors are involved.

In conclusion, while ΔEv is a critical parameter in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and influences both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, it is part of a complex interplay of factors that determine the overall catalytic performance of oxide surfaces.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及到氧化物催化剂晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，晶格氧氧化反应物并产生氧空位，然后由气相氧填补。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv通常对应着更高的催化活性，因为它允许晶格氧更容易被移除以参与氧化反应。这一点在表面氧化铈与体相氧化铈的氧化焓对比中得到了体现。对于负载在镧改性氧化铝上的氧化铈，其氧化焓在低还原程度时为500 kJ/mol O2，在高还原程度时接近体相值760 kJ/mol O2，表面氧结合能比体相值低200多kJ/mol O2。

氧化物表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物可以更容易地释放氧，可能使其成为更强的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能无法有效地补充其晶格氧，可能会限制其长期催化性能。

ΔEv在决定催化性质方面的重要性体现在以下几个方面：

1. 热力学性质，而不仅仅是还原动力学，可以显著影响催化材料的行为。
2. 具有催化相关性的氧化铈纳米晶体的氧化还原性质与体相氧化铈显著不同。
3. 铈在Ce3+和Ce4+状态之间循环的能力对其催化应用至关重要。
4. 掺杂剂的存在和材料的结构强烈影响氧化铈的可还原性。

然而，需要注意的是，除了ΔEv之外，其他因素也在决定催化活性中起作用：

1. 催化活性并不总是与表面积成正比。
2. 高温可以改变表面结构，影响氧的结合。
3. 其他具有类似氧化焓的氧化物在烃类氧化反应中并不像氧化铈那样活跃，这表明还有其他因素参与其中。

总之，虽然ΔEv是Mars-van Krevelen机制中的一个关键参数，并影响着催化活性和氧化能力，但它是决定氧化物表面整体催化性能的复杂因素相互作用中的一部分。
