[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

[2] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface. Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

[3] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) - E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This process creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide lattice.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which in turn increases the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms. This enhanced oxygen mobility leads to higher catalytic activity.

In the case of ceria, doping with Zr significantly reduces the Evac. For example, on the CeO2 (111) surface, Evac is 2.87 eV, while on the Zr-doped Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface, it decreases by about 20% to 2.35 eV. This reduction in Evac explains why Zr-doped ceria shows improved catalytic performance compared to pure ceria.

The lower Evac in Zr-doped ceria not only facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies but also enhances the overall oxidation process. It allows for more efficient attraction of CO molecules from the gas phase and increases the ease with which lattice oxygen can participate in the oxidation reaction. These factors combined contribute to the higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the Zr-doped ceria surface.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合。这个过程在氧化物晶格中创造了一个氧空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的Evac表明更容易创造氧空位，这反过来又增加了晶格氧原子的移动性。这种增强的氧移动性导致更高的催化活性。

在氧化铈的情况下，掺杂Zr显著降低了Evac。例如，在CeO2（111）表面，Evac为2.87 eV，而在Zr掺杂的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2（111）表面，它下降了约20%至2.35 eV。这种Evac的降低解释了为什么Zr掺杂的氧化铈比纯氧化铈表现出更好的催化性能。

Zr掺杂氧化铈中较低的Evac不仅促进了氧空位的形成，还增强了整体氧化过程。它允许更有效地吸引气相中的CO分子，并增加晶格氧参与氧化反应的便利性。这些因素共同作用，使Zr掺杂的氧化铈表面具有更高的催化活性和氧化能力。
