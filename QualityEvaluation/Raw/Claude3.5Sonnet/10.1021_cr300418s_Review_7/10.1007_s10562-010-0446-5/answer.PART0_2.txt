[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism [7]."

[2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) − E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

[3] "Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface. Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This process creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide lattice.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the lattice, which can lead to higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to remove oxygen, the more readily the oxide can participate in oxidation reactions.

The significance of Evac is demonstrated in the comparison between undoped CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2. The Evac for undoped CeO2 (111) is 2.87 eV, while for Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) it is reduced to 2.35 eV. This 20% reduction in Evac indicates that the Zr-doped surface is more active for oxidation reactions.

The lower Evac in Zr-doped ceria leads to increased mobility of lattice oxygen atoms and more efficient attraction of CO molecules from the gas phase. These factors contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity of the doped surface for CO oxidation.

In summary, a lower Evac generally correlates with higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface in the context of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This parameter helps in understanding and predicting the relative activities of different oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合。这个过程在氧化物晶格中创造了一个氧空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的Evac表明从晶格中移除氧原子更容易，这可能导致更高的催化活性。这是因为越容易移除氧，氧化物就越容易参与氧化反应。

Evac的重要性在未掺杂CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2的比较中得到了证明。未掺杂CeO2(111)的Evac为2.87 eV，而Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)的Evac降低到2.35 eV。这20%的Evac降低表明Zr掺杂表面对氧化反应更加活跃。

Zr掺杂CeO2中较低的Evac导致晶格氧原子的流动性增加，并且能更有效地吸引气相中的CO分子。这些因素共同促进了掺杂表面对CO氧化的催化活性增强。

总之，在Mars-van Krevelen机制的背景下，较低的Evac通常与氧化物表面更高的催化活性和氧化能力相关。这个参数有助于理解和预测不同氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的相对活性。
