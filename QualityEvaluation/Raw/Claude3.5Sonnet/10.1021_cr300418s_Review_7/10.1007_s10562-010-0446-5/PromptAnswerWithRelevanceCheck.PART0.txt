[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism"

[2] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface. Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

[3] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) - E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This process creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide lattice.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which in turn increases the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms. This enhanced oxygen mobility leads to higher catalytic activity.

In the case of ceria, doping with Zr significantly reduces the Evac. For example, on the CeO2 (111) surface, Evac is 2.87 eV, while on the Zr-doped Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface, it decreases by about 20% to 2.35 eV. This reduction in Evac explains why Zr-doped ceria shows improved catalytic performance compared to pure ceria.

The lower Evac in Zr-doped ceria not only facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies but also enhances the overall oxidation process. It allows for more efficient attraction of CO molecules from the gas phase and increases the ease with which lattice oxygen can participate in the oxidation reaction. These factors combined contribute to the higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the Zr-doped ceria surface.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合。这个过程在氧化物晶格中创造了一个氧空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的Evac表明更容易创造氧空位，这反过来又增加了晶格氧原子的移动性。这种增强的氧移动性导致更高的催化活性。

在氧化铈的情况下，掺杂Zr显著降低了Evac。例如，在CeO2（111）表面，Evac为2.87 eV，而在Zr掺杂的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2（111）表面，它下降了约20%至2.35 eV。这种Evac的降低解释了为什么Zr掺杂的氧化铈比纯氧化铈表现出更好的催化性能。

Zr掺杂氧化铈中较低的Evac不仅促进了氧空位的形成，还增强了整体氧化过程。它允许更有效地吸引气相中的CO分子，并增加晶格氧参与氧化反应的便利性。这些因素共同作用，使Zr掺杂的氧化铈表面具有更高的催化活性和氧化能力。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of a reactant (in this case, CO) with a lattice oxygen atom from the oxide surface. This process creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide, which is later refilled by oxygen from the gas phase to complete the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a lower energy barrier for oxygen removal makes the lattice oxygen more readily available for reaction with adsorbed molecules.

In the study, the Evac for undoped CeO2 (111) was calculated to be 2.87 eV, while for Zr-doped ceria (Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111)), it was reduced to 2.35 eV. This 20% reduction in Evac suggests that Zr-doping enhances the catalytic activity of ceria by making lattice oxygen more easily accessible for reaction.

The significance of Evac extends beyond just the ease of oxygen removal. It also influences the oxide's ability to regenerate oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity. A lower Evac often correlates with improved oxygen mobility within the oxide, allowing for faster replenishment of surface oxygen and sustained catalytic performance.

However, it's important to note that while a lower Evac generally indicates higher activity, it's not the only factor determining catalytic performance. Other aspects, such as the strength of reactant adsorption and the overall reaction energetics, also play significant roles in the catalytic process.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及反应物（在本例中为CO）与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合。这个过程在氧化物中创造了一个氧空位，随后由气相中的氧填补，从而完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的Evac表明从晶格中移除氧原子更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为氧移除的能量障碍较低，使得晶格氧更容易与吸附分子反应。

在这项研究中，未掺杂的CeO2(111)的Evac计算为2.87 eV，而对于Zr掺杂的氧化铈（Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)），它降低到2.35 eV。这20%的Evac减少表明，Zr掺杂通过使晶格氧更容易参与反应来增强氧化铈的催化活性。

Evac的重要性不仅限于氧的易移除性。它还影响氧化物再生氧空位的能力，这对于维持催化活性至关重要。较低的Evac通常与氧化物内部改善的氧移动性相关，允许更快地补充表面氧并维持催化性能。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的Evac通常表示更高的活性，但它并不是决定催化性能的唯一因素。其他方面，如反应物吸附强度和整体反应能量学，在催化过程中也起着重要作用。

总之，在Mars-van Krevelen机制的背景下，较低的Evac通常与氧化物表面更高的催化活性和氧化能力相关。这个参数有助于理解和预测不同氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的相对活性。

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which in turn suggests higher oxygen mobility and potentially greater catalytic activity. In the case of ceria, doping with Zr reduces the Evac, making it easier to form oxygen vacancies and thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.

The significance of Evac lies in its relationship to several key factors:

1. Oxygen mobility: A lower Evac typically correlates with higher oxygen mobility, which is crucial for the catalytic process.

2. Redox properties: The ease of oxygen vacancy formation relates to the redox properties of the oxide, affecting its ability to participate in oxidation reactions.

3. Structural changes: The formation of oxygen vacancies can lead to local structural changes, such as the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in ceria, which can influence catalytic properties.

4. Dopant effects: As seen with Zr-doping in ceria, dopants can significantly alter Evac, thereby modifying the oxide's catalytic performance.

In summary, Evac serves as an important indicator of an oxide's potential catalytic activity in oxidation reactions, with lower values generally suggesting higher activity due to increased oxygen mobility and enhanced redox properties.

较低的Evac表明更容易创建氧空位，这反过来意味着更高的氧移动性和潜在的更大催化活性。在氧化铈的情况下，掺杂Zr降低了Evac，使得形成氧空位更容易，从而增强了催化活性。

Evac的重要性在于它与几个关键因素的关系：

1. 氧移动性：较低的Evac通常与更高的氧移动性相关，这对催化过程至关重要。

2. 氧化还原性质：氧空位形成的容易程度与氧化物的氧化还原性质有关，影响其参与氧化反应的能力。

3. 结构变化：氧空位的形成可能导致局部结构变化，例如在氧化铈中Ce4+还原为Ce3+，这可能影响催化性能。

4. 掺杂效应：如在氧化铈中掺杂Zr所见，掺杂剂可以显著改变Evac，从而改变氧化物的催化性能。

总之，Evac作为氧化物在氧化反应中潜在催化活性的重要指标，较低的值通常表明由于氧移动性增加和氧化还原性质增强而具有更高的活性。
