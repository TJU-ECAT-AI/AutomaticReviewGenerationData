[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism [7]."

[2] "Apparently, Zr dopants strongly change the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation on the ceria (111) surface. Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol. On the other hand, Zr dopants reduce the energy cost for the formation of oxygen vacancy [4, 29] and thus increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms nearby [30]."

[3] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) − E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This process creates oxygen vacancies in the oxide lattice.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the lattice, which can increase the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms and enhance the oxide's catalytic activity.

In the case of ceria, doping with Zr significantly reduces the Evac. For example, the Evac of undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy, while for Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface, it is reduced by about 20% to 2.35 eV. This reduction in Evac leads to increased oxygen mobility and enhanced catalytic activity.

The lower Evac also contributes to the oxide's oxidizing ability by making it easier for the surface to release oxygen atoms for reaction with adsorbed molecules. Additionally, the presence of dopants like Zr can change the reaction mechanism, affecting how molecules like CO interact with the surface. For instance, Zr-doped ceria more efficiently attracts CO molecules from the gas phase compared to undoped ceria.

In summary, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the associated Evac play crucial roles in determining the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces, with lower Evac generally corresponding to higher activity and oxidizing ability.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及CO与氧化物表面晶格氧原子的直接结合。这个过程在氧化物晶格中创造了氧空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的Evac表明从晶格中移除氧原子更容易，这可以增加晶格氧原子的移动性并增强氧化物的催化活性。

在氧化铈的情况下，掺杂Zr显著降低了Evac。例如，未掺杂的CeO2（111）表面的Evac为每个空位2.87 eV，而对于Ce0.75Zr0.25O2（111）表面，它降低了约20%至2.35 eV。这种Evac的降低导致氧移动性增加和催化活性增强。

较低的Evac也通过使表面更容易释放氧原子与吸附分子反应来提高氧化物的氧化能力。此外，像Zr这样的掺杂剂的存在可以改变反应机制，影响CO等分子与表面的相互作用。例如，与未掺杂的氧化铈相比，掺Zr的氧化铈更有效地吸引气相中的CO分子。

总之，Mars-van Krevelen机制和相关的Evac在决定氧化物表面的催化性能方面起着至关重要的作用，较低的Evac通常对应于较高的活性和氧化能力。
