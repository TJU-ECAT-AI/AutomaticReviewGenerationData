[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism [7]."

[2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) − E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

[3] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which in turn suggests higher oxygen mobility and potentially greater catalytic activity. In the case of ceria, doping with Zr reduces the Evac, making it easier to form oxygen vacancies and thereby enhancing the catalytic activity.

The significance of Evac lies in its relationship to several key factors:

1. Oxygen mobility: A lower Evac typically correlates with higher oxygen mobility, which is crucial for the catalytic process.

2. Redox properties: The ease of oxygen vacancy formation relates to the redox properties of the oxide, affecting its ability to participate in oxidation reactions.

3. Structural changes: The formation of oxygen vacancies can lead to local structural changes, such as the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ in ceria, which can influence catalytic properties.

4. Dopant effects: As seen with Zr-doping in ceria, dopants can significantly alter Evac, thereby modifying the oxide's catalytic performance.

In summary, Evac serves as an important indicator of an oxide's potential catalytic activity in oxidation reactions, with lower values generally suggesting higher activity due to increased oxygen mobility and enhanced redox properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

较低的Evac表明更容易创建氧空位，这反过来意味着更高的氧移动性和潜在的更大催化活性。在氧化铈的情况下，掺杂Zr降低了Evac，使得形成氧空位更容易，从而增强了催化活性。

Evac的重要性在于它与几个关键因素的关系：

1. 氧移动性：较低的Evac通常与更高的氧移动性相关，这对催化过程至关重要。

2. 氧化还原性质：氧空位形成的容易程度与氧化物的氧化还原性质有关，影响其参与氧化反应的能力。

3. 结构变化：氧空位的形成可能导致局部结构变化，例如在氧化铈中Ce4+还原为Ce3+，这可能影响催化性能。

4. 掺杂效应：如在氧化铈中掺杂Zr所见，掺杂剂可以显著改变Evac，从而改变氧化物的催化性能。

总之，Evac作为氧化物在氧化反应中潜在催化活性的重要指标，较低的值通常表明由于氧移动性增加和氧化还原性质增强而具有更高的活性。
