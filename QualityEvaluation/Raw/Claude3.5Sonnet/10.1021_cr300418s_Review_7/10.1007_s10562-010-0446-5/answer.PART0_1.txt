[1] "It is widely believed that CO directly combines with lattice oxygen atom on ceria, through the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism [7]."

[2] "If we define the formation energy of an O vacancy as: Evac = E(cellvac) + 1/2E(O2) − E(cell), where the E (cellvac) and E (cell) are total energies of the optimized surfaces with and without an oxygen vacancy, and E (O2) is the total energy of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase, the calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2 (111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy. By contrast, Evac of the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) surface is reduced by approximately 20% to 2.35 eV."

[3] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the direct combination of a reactant (in this case, CO) with a lattice oxygen atom from the oxide surface. This process creates an oxygen vacancy in the oxide, which is later refilled by oxygen from the gas phase to complete the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evac) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Evac indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a lower energy barrier for oxygen removal makes the lattice oxygen more readily available for reaction with adsorbed molecules.

In the study, the Evac for undoped CeO2 (111) was calculated to be 2.87 eV, while for Zr-doped ceria (Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111)), it was reduced to 2.35 eV. This 20% reduction in Evac suggests that Zr-doping enhances the catalytic activity of ceria by making lattice oxygen more easily accessible for reaction.

The significance of Evac extends beyond just the ease of oxygen removal. It also influences the oxide's ability to regenerate oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for maintaining catalytic activity. A lower Evac often correlates with improved oxygen mobility within the oxide, allowing for faster replenishment of surface oxygen and sustained catalytic performance.

However, it's important to note that while a lower Evac generally indicates higher activity, it's not the only factor determining catalytic performance. Other aspects, such as the strength of reactant adsorption and the overall reaction energetics, also play significant roles in the catalytic process.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及反应物（在本例中为CO）与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合。这个过程在氧化物中创造了一个氧空位，随后由气相中的氧填补，从而完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evac）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的Evac表明从晶格中移除氧原子更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为氧移除的能量障碍较低，使得晶格氧更容易与吸附分子反应。

在这项研究中，未掺杂的CeO2(111)的Evac计算为2.87 eV，而对于Zr掺杂的氧化铈（Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)），它降低到2.35 eV。这20%的Evac减少表明，Zr掺杂通过使晶格氧更容易参与反应来增强氧化铈的催化活性。

Evac的重要性不仅限于氧的易移除性。它还影响氧化物再生氧空位的能力，这对于维持催化活性至关重要。较低的Evac通常与氧化物内部改善的氧移动性相关，允许更快地补充表面氧并维持催化性能。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的Evac通常表示更高的活性，但它并不是决定催化性能的唯一因素。其他方面，如反应物吸附强度和整体反应能量学，在催化过程中也起着重要作用。
