[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation is described by the reaction of Ce1xMxO2  Ce1xMxO2δ + 1/2O2."

[2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."

[3] "Compared to CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, the smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, which is consistent with the experimental results."

[4] "The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without any activation energy leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption. Molecular O2 adsorbs at the O vacancy forming O adspecies that then drive CO oxidation and recover the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species (e.g., CO), creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the surface can participate in oxidation reactions.

In the case of Ru-doped CeO2, the lower vacancy formation energy compared to pure CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 indicates a higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and potentially higher catalytic activity. The Ru dopant facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, which promotes CO oxidation without an activation barrier. This leads to efficient CO2 formation and desorption, followed by the adsorption of molecular O2 at the vacancy site to regenerate the surface.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to predict and explain the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces. Materials with lower ΔEv values are generally more active in oxidation reactions, as they can more easily provide lattice oxygen for the reaction and subsequently replenish it from the gas phase. This property is particularly important in applications such as automotive catalytic converters and other environmental catalysis processes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及晶格氧从氧化物表面参与反应。在这个机制中，表面氧与吸附物种（如CO）反应，产生氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的空位形成能表明更容易从晶格中移除氧，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为创建氧空位越容易，表面就越容易参与氧化反应。

在Ru掺杂CeO2的情况下，与纯CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2相比，较低的空位形成能表明其具有更高的氧存储容量（OSC）和潜在的更高催化活性。Ru掺杂剂促进了氧空位的形成，这促进了无活化能障碍的CO氧化。这导致了高效的CO2形成和脱附，随后分子O2在空位处吸附以再生表面。

ΔEv的重要性在于其能够预测和解释氧化物表面的催化性能。ΔEv值较低的材料在氧化反应中通常更活跃，因为它们可以更容易地为反应提供晶格氧，并随后从气相中补充。这一特性在汽车催化转化器和其他环境催化过程等应用中尤为重要。
