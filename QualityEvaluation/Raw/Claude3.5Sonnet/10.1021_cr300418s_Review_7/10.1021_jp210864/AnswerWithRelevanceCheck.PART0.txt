          [1] "The oxygen vacancy formation is described by the reaction of Ce1xMxO2  Ce1xMxO2δ + 1/2O2."
          [2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."
          [3] "Compared to CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, the smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, which is consistent with the experimental results."
          [4] "The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without any activation energy leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption. Molecular O2 adsorbs at the O vacancy forming O adspecies that then drive CO oxidation and recover the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface."
          [5] "The reaction mechanisms for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration are depicted in Figure 7, consisting of three steps: (a) the oxidation of the first CO molecule on the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2(111) surface through participation of a lattice oxygen, leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption (Figure 7a); (b) the adsorption of molecular O2 at the O vacancy, leading to the formation of surface O adspecies (Figure 7b); and (c) the interaction of a CO molecule with these O adspecies, which drives CO oxidation and regeneration of the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 surface (Figure 7c)."
          [6] "The reduced catalysts can be sealed by an O2 molecule from the gas phase. The adsorption energy of the O2 molecule on the O vacancy is calculated to be 1.18 eV."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen reacts with adsorbed species (e.g., CO), creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

          The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity and oxygen storage capacity (OSC).

          In the case of Ru-doped CeO2 (Ce0.875Ru0.125O2), the lower Ef (1.03 eV) compared to pure CeO2 (3.20 eV) and Zr-doped CeO2 (2.03 eV) indicates higher OSC and potentially higher catalytic activity. The Ru dopant facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, promoting CO oxidation without an activation barrier.

          The reaction mechanism for CO oxidation on Ru-doped CeO2 consists of three steps:
          1. Oxidation of CO using lattice oxygen, forming an oxygen vacancy and CO2.
          2. Adsorption of O2 at the oxygen vacancy, forming surface O adspecies.
          3. Reaction of another CO molecule with these O adspecies, regenerating the oxide surface.

          The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to predict and explain the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces. Materials with lower ΔEv values are generally more active in oxidation reactions, as they can more easily provide lattice oxygen for the reaction and subsequently replenish it from the gas phase. However, an optimal ΔEv value is desired to balance high catalytic activity with catalyst stability, as extremely low values might lead to structural instability.

          Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及晶格氧从氧化物表面参与反应。在这个机制中，表面氧与吸附物种（如CO）反应，产生氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

          氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的空位形成能表明更容易从晶格中移除氧，这通常与更高的催化活性和氧存储容量（OSC）相关。

          在Ru掺杂CeO2（Ce0.875Ru0.125O2）的情况下，与纯CeO2（3.20 eV）和Zr掺杂CeO2（2.03 eV）相比，较低的Ef（1.03 eV）表明其具有更高的OSC和潜在的更高催化活性。Ru掺杂剂促进了氧空位的形成，促进了无活化能障碍的CO氧化。

          Ru掺杂CeO2上CO氧化的反应机制包括三个步骤：
          1. 使用晶格氧氧化CO，形成氧空位和CO2。
          2. O2在氧空位处吸附，形成表面O吸附物种。
          3. 另一个CO分子与这些O吸附物种反应，再生氧化物表面。

          ΔEv的重要性在于其能够预测和解释氧化物表面的催化性能。ΔEv值较低的材料在氧化反应中通常更活跃，因为它们可以更容易地为反应提供晶格氧，并随后从气相中补充。然而，需要一个最佳的ΔEv值来平衡高催化活性和催化剂稳定性，因为过低的值可能导致结构不稳定。
