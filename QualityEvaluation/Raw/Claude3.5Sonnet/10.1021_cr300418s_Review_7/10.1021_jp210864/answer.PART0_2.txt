[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."

[2] "The calculated Ef of Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 is 1.03 and 1.58 eV depending on the different coordination shell of the RuO bond."

[3] "Compared to CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, the smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2"

[4] "Thus, substitution with Ru metal ions activates lattice oxygen by the creation of longer CeO and RuO bond lengths compared to those in CeO2 and RuO2 metal oxides."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the lattice oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species on the surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower Ef indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to remove lattice oxygen, the more readily it can participate in oxidation reactions.

In the case of Ru-doped CeO2, the lower Ef compared to pure CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 indicates that Ru doping enhances the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and potentially the catalytic activity. The substitution of Ce with Ru ions activates lattice oxygen by creating longer metal-oxygen bonds, which makes it easier for these oxygen atoms to participate in reactions.

The significance of Ef in determining oxidizing ability lies in the fact that more easily removable lattice oxygen (lower Ef) generally means the oxide can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions. However, if Ef is too low, it might lead to structural instability of the catalyst. Therefore, an optimal Ef value is desired for balancing high catalytic activity with catalyst stability.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，晶格氧与表面上吸附的物种反应，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的Ef表明更容易创建氧空位，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为晶格氧越容易被移除，它就越容易参与氧化反应。

在Ru掺杂CeO2的情况下，与纯CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2相比，较低的Ef表明Ru掺杂增强了氧储存能力（OSC）和潜在的催化活性。用Ru离子取代Ce可以通过创建更长的金属-氧键来活化晶格氧，这使得这些氧原子更容易参与反应。

Ef在确定氧化能力方面的重要性在于，更容易移除的晶格氧（较低的Ef）通常意味着氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。然而，如果Ef太低，可能会导致催化剂的结构不稳定。因此，需要一个最佳的Ef值来平衡高催化活性和催化剂稳定性。
