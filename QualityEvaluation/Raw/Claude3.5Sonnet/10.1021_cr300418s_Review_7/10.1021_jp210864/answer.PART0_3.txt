[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation is described by the reaction of Ce1xMxO2  Ce1xMxO2δ + 1/2O2."

[2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."

[3] "The calculated Ef of Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 is 1.03 and 1.58 eV depending on the different coordination shell of the RuO bond."

[4] "Compared to CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, the smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, which is consistent with the experimental results."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, a reactant molecule is oxidized by removing an oxygen atom from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the oxide can participate in the oxidation reaction.

In the case of Ru-doped CeO2, the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (Ef) compared to pure CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 suggests that Ru-doping enhances the catalytic activity of CeO2. This lower Ef value indicates a higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and likely translates to improved performance in oxidation reactions.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher activity, extremely low values can lead to over-reduction of the catalyst and potential instability. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv value is typically sought that balances high activity with catalyst stability.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，反应分子通过从氧化物表面移除一个氧原子而被氧化，从而创建一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从晶格中移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为创建氧空位越容易，氧化物就越容易参与氧化反应。

在Ru掺杂CeO2的情况下，与纯CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2相比，较低的氧空位形成能（Ef）表明Ru掺杂增强了CeO2的催化活性。这个较低的Ef值表明有更高的氧储存容量（OSC），并可能转化为氧化反应中的更好性能。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的活性，但极低的值可能导致催化剂的过度还原和潜在的不稳定性。因此，通常寻求一个平衡高活性和催化剂稳定性的最佳ΔEv值。
