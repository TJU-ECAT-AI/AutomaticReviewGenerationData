The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species (e.g., CO), creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the surface can participate in oxidation reactions.

In the case of Ru-doped CeO2, the lower vacancy formation energy compared to pure CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 indicates a higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and potentially higher catalytic activity. The Ru dopant facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, which promotes CO oxidation without an activation barrier. This leads to efficient CO2 formation and desorption, followed by the adsorption of molecular O2 at the vacancy site to regenerate the surface.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to predict and explain the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces. Materials with lower ΔEv values are generally more active in oxidation reactions, as they can more easily provide lattice oxygen for the reaction and subsequently replenish it from the gas phase. This property is particularly important in applications such as automotive catalytic converters and other environmental catalysis processes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及晶格氧从氧化物表面参与反应。在这个机制中，表面氧与吸附物种（如CO）反应，产生氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的空位形成能表明更容易从晶格中移除氧，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为创建氧空位越容易，表面就越容易参与氧化反应。

在Ru掺杂CeO2的情况下，与纯CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2相比，较低的空位形成能表明其具有更高的氧存储容量（OSC）和潜在的更高催化活性。Ru掺杂剂促进了氧空位的形成，这促进了无活化能障碍的CO氧化。这导致了高效的CO2形成和脱附，随后分子O2在空位处吸附以再生表面。

ΔEv的重要性在于其能够预测和解释氧化物表面的催化性能。ΔEv值较低的材料在氧化反应中通常更活跃，因为它们可以更容易地为反应提供晶格氧，并随后从气相中补充。这一特性在汽车催化转化器和其他环境催化过程等应用中尤为重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves a cyclic process where lattice oxygen from the oxide surface participates in the oxidation of adsorbed molecules, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, regenerating the oxide surface.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates:

1. Higher catalytic activity: Easier removal of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions.
2. Better oxidizing ability: More readily available lattice oxygen for reaction.
3. Higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC): Ability to release and store oxygen more easily.

In the case of Ru-doped CeO2, the lower Ef (equivalent to ΔEv) compared to pure CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 indicates its superior catalytic properties for CO oxidation. This correlation between lower vacancy formation energy and higher catalytic activity demonstrates the significance of ΔEv in determining the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及一个循环过程，其中氧化物表面的晶格氧参与吸附分子的氧化，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，从而再生氧化物表面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明：

1. 更高的催化活性：更容易移除晶格氧进行氧化反应。
2. 更好的氧化能力：反应所需的晶格氧更容易获得。
3. 更高的氧储存能力（OSC）：更容易释放和储存氧。

在Ru掺杂CeO2的情况下，与纯CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2相比，较低的Ef（相当于ΔEv）表明其具有优越的CO氧化催化性能。空位形成能量较低与催化活性较高之间的这种相关性，证明了ΔEv在确定氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的性能方面的重要性。

The substitution of Ce with Ru ions activates lattice oxygen by creating longer metal-oxygen bonds, which makes it easier for these oxygen atoms to participate in reactions.

The significance of Ef in determining oxidizing ability lies in the fact that more easily removable lattice oxygen (lower Ef) generally means the oxide can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions. However, if Ef is too low, it might lead to structural instability of the catalyst. Therefore, an optimal Ef value is desired for balancing high catalytic activity with catalyst stability.

Ef在确定氧化能力方面的重要性在于，更容易移除的晶格氧（较低的Ef）通常意味着氧化物可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。然而，如果Ef太低，可能会导致催化剂的结构不稳定。因此，需要一个最佳的Ef值来平衡高催化活性和催化剂稳定性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, a reactant molecule is oxidized by removing an oxygen atom from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the oxide can participate in the oxidation reaction.

In the case of Ru-doped CeO2, the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (Ef) compared to pure CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 suggests that Ru-doping enhances the catalytic activity of CeO2. This lower Ef value indicates a higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and likely translates to improved performance in oxidation reactions.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates higher activity, extremely low values can lead to over-reduction of the catalyst and potential instability. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv value is typically sought that balances high activity with catalyst stability.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower Ef indicates that it is easier to remove lattice oxygen, which can then participate in the oxidation of adsorbed species. This leads to higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and greater catalytic activity. For example, Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 has a lower Ef (1.03 eV) compared to CeO2 (3.20 eV) and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2 (2.03 eV), resulting in higher OSC and better catalytic performance.

The significance of Ef extends to the regeneration of the catalyst. After the lattice oxygen is consumed in the oxidation reaction, the resulting oxygen vacancy can be filled by oxygen from the gas phase. The adsorption energy of O2 on the vacancy (1.18 eV in this case) is related to how easily the catalyst can be regenerated.

In summary, a lower Ef facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions, while also allowing easier regeneration of the catalyst, both of which contribute to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

较低的Ef表明更容易移除晶格氧，这些氧可以参与吸附物种的氧化。这导致了更高的氧存储能力（OSC）和更大的催化活性。例如，Ce0.875Ru0.125O2的Ef（1.03 eV）比CeO2（3.20 eV）和Ce0.875Zr0.125O2（2.03 eV）低，resulting in更高的OSC和更好的催化性能。

Ef的重要性还延伸到催化剂的再生。在氧化反应中消耗晶格氧之后，由此产生的氧空位可以被气相氧填充。O2在空位上的吸附能（在这种情况下为1.18 eV）与催化剂可以多容易地再生有关。

总之，较低的Ef有利于释放晶格氧用于氧化反应，同时也允许更容易地再生催化剂，这两者都有助于提高氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
