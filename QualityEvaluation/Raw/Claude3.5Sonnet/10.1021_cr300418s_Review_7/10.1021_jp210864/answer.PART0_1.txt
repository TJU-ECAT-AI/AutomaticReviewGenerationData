[1] "Low-temperature CO oxidation is needed and important in many processes, such as automotive exhaust purification and preferential CO oxidation."

[2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."

[3] "The smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, which is consistent with the experimental results."

[4] "The reaction mechanisms for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration are depicted in Figure 7, consisting of three steps: (a) the oxidation of the first CO molecule on the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2(111) surface through participation of a lattice oxygen, leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption (Figure 7a); (b) the adsorption of molecular O2 at the O vacancy, leading to the formation of surface O adspecies (Figure 7b); and (c) the interaction of a CO molecule with these O adspecies, which drives CO oxidation and regeneration of the stoichiometric Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 surface (Figure 7c)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves a cyclic process where lattice oxygen from the oxide surface participates in the oxidation of adsorbed molecules, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, regenerating the oxide surface.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates:

1. Higher catalytic activity: Easier removal of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions.
2. Better oxidizing ability: More readily available lattice oxygen for reaction.
3. Higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC): Ability to release and store oxygen more easily.

In the case of Ru-doped CeO2, the lower Ef (equivalent to ΔEv) compared to pure CeO2 and Zr-doped CeO2 indicates its superior catalytic properties for CO oxidation. This correlation between lower vacancy formation energy and higher catalytic activity demonstrates the significance of ΔEv in determining the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及一个循环过程，其中氧化物表面的晶格氧参与吸附分子的氧化，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，从而再生氧化物表面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明：

1. 更高的催化活性：更容易移除晶格氧进行氧化反应。
2. 更好的氧化能力：反应所需的晶格氧更容易获得。
3. 更高的氧储存能力（OSC）：更容易释放和储存氧。

在Ru掺杂CeO2的情况下，与纯CeO2和Zr掺杂CeO2相比，较低的Ef（相当于ΔEv）表明其具有优越的CO氧化催化性能。空位形成能量较低与催化活性较高之间的这种相关性，证明了ΔEv在确定氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的性能方面的重要性。
