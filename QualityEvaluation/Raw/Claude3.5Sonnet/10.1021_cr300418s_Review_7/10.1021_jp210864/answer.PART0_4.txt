[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy, Ef, was computed according to the eq 1."

[2] "Compared to CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, the smaller Ef (1.03 for Ce0.875Ru0.125O2; 3.20 and 2.03 eV (37) for CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2) indicates that Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 shows higher OSC property than CeO2 and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2, which is consistent with the experimental results."

[3] "The reduced catalysts can be sealed by an O2 molecule from the gas phase. The adsorption energy of the O2 molecule on the O vacancy is calculated to be 1.18 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

A lower Ef indicates that it is easier to remove lattice oxygen, which can then participate in the oxidation of adsorbed species. This leads to higher oxygen storage capacity (OSC) and greater catalytic activity. For example, Ce0.875Ru0.125O2 has a lower Ef (1.03 eV) compared to CeO2 (3.20 eV) and Ce0.875Zr0.125O2 (2.03 eV), resulting in higher OSC and better catalytic performance.

The significance of Ef extends to the regeneration of the catalyst. After the lattice oxygen is consumed in the oxidation reaction, the resulting oxygen vacancy can be filled by oxygen from the gas phase. The adsorption energy of O2 on the vacancy (1.18 eV in this case) is related to how easily the catalyst can be regenerated.

In summary, a lower Ef facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions, while also allowing easier regeneration of the catalyst, both of which contribute to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面晶格氧的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的Ef表明更容易移除晶格氧，这些氧可以参与吸附物种的氧化。这导致了更高的氧存储能力（OSC）和更大的催化活性。例如，Ce0.875Ru0.125O2的Ef（1.03 eV）比CeO2（3.20 eV）和Ce0.875Zr0.125O2（2.03 eV）低，resulting in更高的OSC和更好的催化性能。

Ef的重要性还延伸到催化剂的再生。在氧化反应中消耗晶格氧之后，由此产生的氧空位可以被气相氧填充。O2在空位上的吸附能（在这种情况下为1.18 eV）与催化剂可以多容易地再生有关。

总之，较低的Ef有利于释放晶格氧用于氧化反应，同时也允许更容易地再生催化剂，这两者都有助于提高氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
