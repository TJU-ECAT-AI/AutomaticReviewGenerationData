[1] "Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

[2] "When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface of rutile TiO2(110), to make an oxygen vacancy, two unpaired electrons are left in the oxide."

[3] "The oxygen-vacancy formation energy (Evf) was calculated as

Evf = 1/2E[O2] + E[TiO2(S)] - E[TiO2(R)]

where E[O2] is the total energy of O2 in gas phase, E[TiO2(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[TiO2(R)] is the total energy of a relaxed, partially reduced TiO2 slab having one bridging O vacancy on the surface of the supercell."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. In this mechanism, an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice participates in the oxidation of the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more easily release lattice oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may be overly reducible and lose its structural integrity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. Oxides with moderate ΔEv values tend to be good oxidation catalysts because they can release oxygen relatively easily but not so easily that they become unstable. The balance between these factors determines the overall effectiveness of the oxide as an oxidation catalyst.

In the context of TiO2, the formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves behind two unpaired electrons, which can affect the electronic structure and reactivity of the surface. The location and behavior of these electrons can influence the catalytic properties of the reduced oxide surface.

The calculation of ΔEv, as described in the literature, takes into account the energies of the stoichiometric and reduced oxide slabs, as well as the energy of gas-phase oxygen. This calculation provides a quantitative measure of the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which is essential for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面上氧空位的形成和消除。在这个机制中，氧化物晶格中的一个氧原子参与反应物的氧化，创造了一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧化物可以更容易地释放晶格氧，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能过于易还原，失去其结构完整性。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv相关。具有适中ΔEv值的氧化物往往是良好的氧化催化剂，因为它们可以相对容易地释放氧，但不会过于容易以至于变得不稳定。这些因素之间的平衡决定了氧化物作为氧化催化剂的整体效果。

在TiO2的背景下，氧空位的形成会留下两个未配对的电子，这可能影响表面的电子结构和反应性。这些电子的位置和行为可以影响还原氧化物表面的催化性质。

文献中描述的ΔEv计算考虑了化学计量和还原氧化物片的能量，以及气相氧的能量。这种计算提供了氧空位形成容易程度的定量测量，这对于理解和预测氧化反应中的催化行为至关重要。
