[1] "Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

[2] "When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface of rutile TiO2(110), to make an oxygen vacancy, two unpaired electrons are left in the oxide."

[3] "The oxygen-vacancy formation energy (Evf) was calculated as

Evf = 1/2E[O2] + E[TiO2(S)] - E[TiO2(R)]

where E[O2] is the total energy of O2 in gas phase, E[TiO2(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[TiO2(R)] is the total energy of a relaxed, partially reduced TiO2 slab having one bridging O vacancy on the surface of the supercell."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. In this process, an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice participates in the oxidation of the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more easily release lattice oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may be overly reducible and unstable under reaction conditions.

Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the oxide holds its oxygen more tightly, which can result in lower catalytic activity but potentially higher selectivity in certain reactions. The optimal ΔEv value depends on the specific reaction and desired product selectivity.

The formation of oxygen vacancies also creates unpaired electrons in the oxide, which can affect the electronic properties of the surface and its interaction with adsorbates. These factors further influence the catalytic properties of the oxide.

In summary, ΔEv is a key parameter in understanding and predicting the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions, balancing activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及催化剂表面氧空位的形成和消除。在这个过程中，氧化物晶格中的一个氧原子参与反应物的氧化，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧化物可以更容易地释放晶格氧，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能在反应条件下过度还原和不稳定。

相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧化物对其氧的结合更紧密，这可能导致较低的催化活性，但在某些反应中可能具有更高的选择性。最佳的ΔEv值取决于特定的反应和所需的产品选择性。

氧空位的形成还会在氧化物中产生未配对电子，这可能影响表面的电子性质及其与吸附质的相互作用。这些因素进一步影响氧化物的催化性能。

总之，ΔEv是理解和预测氧化物表面在氧化反应中催化行为的关键参数，平衡催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
