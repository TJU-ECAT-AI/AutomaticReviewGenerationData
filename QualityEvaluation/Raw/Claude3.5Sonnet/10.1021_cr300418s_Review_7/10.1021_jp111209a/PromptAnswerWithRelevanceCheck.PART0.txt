[1] "Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

[2] "When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface of rutile TiO2(110), to make an oxygen vacancy, two unpaired electrons are left in the oxide."

[3] "The oxygen-vacancy formation energy (Evf) was calculated as

Evf = 1/2E[O2] + E[TiO2(S)] - E[TiO2(R)]

where E[O2] is the total energy of O2 in gas phase, E[TiO2(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[TiO2(R)] is the total energy of a relaxed, partially reduced TiO2 slab having one bridging O vacancy on the surface of the supercell."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. In this mechanism, an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice participates in the oxidation of the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the oxide can more easily release lattice oxygen, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may be overly reducible and lose its structural integrity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv. Oxides with moderate ΔEv values tend to be good oxidation catalysts because they can release oxygen relatively easily but not so easily that they become unstable. The balance between these factors determines the overall effectiveness of the oxide as an oxidation catalyst.

In the context of TiO2, the formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves behind two unpaired electrons, which can affect the electronic structure and reactivity of the surface. The location and behavior of these electrons can influence the catalytic properties of the reduced oxide surface.

The calculation of ΔEv, as described in the literature, takes into account the energies of the stoichiometric and reduced oxide slabs, as well as the energy of gas-phase oxygen. This calculation provides a quantitative measure of the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which is essential for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面上氧空位的形成和消除。在这个机制中，氧化物晶格中的一个氧原子参与反应物的氧化，创造了一个氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧化物可以更容易地释放晶格氧，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能过于易还原，失去其结构完整性。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv相关。具有适中ΔEv值的氧化物往往是良好的氧化催化剂，因为它们可以相对容易地释放氧，但不会过于容易以至于变得不稳定。这些因素之间的平衡决定了氧化物作为氧化催化剂的整体效果。

在TiO2的背景下，氧空位的形成会留下两个未配对的电子，这可能影响表面的电子结构和反应性。这些电子的位置和行为可以影响还原氧化物表面的催化性质。

文献中描述的ΔEv计算考虑了化学计量和还原氧化物片的能量，以及气相氧的能量。这种计算提供了氧空位形成容易程度的定量测量，这对于理解和预测氧化反应中的催化行为至关重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. In this process, an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice participates in the oxidation of the reactant molecule, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evf) is a crucial parameter in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates a more active catalyst, as it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice to participate in the oxidation reaction. However, if the vacancy formation energy is too low, the oxide may become unstable or over-reduced, potentially leading to a loss of catalytic activity.

The vacancy formation energy also influences the oxidizing ability of the surface. A higher ΔEv typically corresponds to a stronger oxidizing power, as the oxide holds onto its oxygen more tightly. Conversely, a lower ΔEv may indicate a weaker oxidizing ability but potentially higher activity for certain reactions.

Understanding and controlling the oxygen vacancy formation energy is crucial for designing and optimizing oxide catalysts for specific oxidation reactions. It allows researchers to balance the trade-off between catalytic activity and oxidizing power, tailoring the catalyst properties to the desired reaction.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及催化剂表面氧空位的形成和消除。在这个过程中，氧化物晶格中的一个氧原子参与反应物分子的氧化，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evf）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键参数。较低的空位形成能通常表示催化剂更活跃，因为从晶格中移除氧以参与氧化反应更容易。然而，如果空位形成能太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或过度还原，潜在导致催化活性的损失。

空位形成能也影响表面的氧化能力。较高的ΔEv通常对应于更强的氧化能力，因为氧化物更紧密地保持其氧。相反，较低的ΔEv可能表示较弱的氧化能力，但对某些反应可能具有更高的活性。

理解和控制氧空位形成能对于设计和优化特定氧化反应的氧化物催化剂至关重要。它允许研究人员平衡催化活性和氧化能力之间的权衡，根据所需的反应调整催化剂性质。

A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen to participate in the reaction. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable or over-reduced.

The formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves behind two unpaired electrons, which can localize on nearby metal cations (in this case, Ti atoms), reducing them from their formal oxidation state. This reduction of metal cations and the associated structural changes (such as polaron formation) can significantly affect the surface chemistry and reactivity.

The precise value of ΔEv and the behavior of the unpaired electrons depend on various factors, including the oxide composition, surface structure, and computational methods used to study the system (such as the choice of U parameter in DFT+U calculations). Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting and optimizing the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions.

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许晶格氧更容易被移除参与反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或过度还原。

氧空位的形成会留下两个未配对电子，这些电子可以局域化在附近的金属阳离子上（在这种情况下是Ti原子），将它们从正式氧化态还原。这种金属阳离子的还原以及相关的结构变化（如极化子形成）可以显著影响表面化学和反应性。

ΔEv的精确值和未配对电子的行为取决于多种因素，包括氧化物成分、表面结构以及用于研究该系统的计算方法（如DFT+U计算中U参数的选择）。理解这些因素对于预测和优化氧化物表面在氧化反应中的催化性能至关重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies as essential steps. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are active sites for the reaction. The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv, as it affects the ease with which the surface can release oxygen to participate in the oxidation reaction. The paper calculates ΔEv using density functional theory, considering the energies of the gas-phase oxygen molecule, the stoichiometric oxide slab, and the reduced oxide slab with an oxygen vacancy. This calculation helps in understanding the energetics of vacancy formation and its implications for catalytic behavior.

The formation of oxygen vacancies also creates unpaired electrons in the oxide, which can affect the electronic properties of the surface and its interaction with adsorbates. These factors further influence the catalytic properties of the oxide.

In summary, ΔEv is a key parameter in understanding and predicting the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions, balancing activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst.
