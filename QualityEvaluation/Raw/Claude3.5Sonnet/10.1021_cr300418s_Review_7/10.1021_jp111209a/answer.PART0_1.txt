[1] "Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

[2] "The removal of a neutral oxygen atom leaves behind two electrons that had been engaged in two TiO bonds that were broken when the vacancy was formed."

[3] "The oxygen-vacancy formation energy (Evf) was calculated as

Evf = 1/2E[O2] + E[TiO2(S)] - E[TiO2(R)]

where E[O2] is the total energy of O2 in gas phase, E[TiO2(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[TiO2(R)] is the total energy of a relaxed, partially reduced TiO2 slab having one bridging O vacancy on the surface of the supercell."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. In this process, an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice participates in the oxidation of the reactant molecule, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Evf) is a crucial parameter in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates a more active catalyst, as it is easier to remove oxygen from the lattice to participate in the oxidation reaction. However, if the vacancy formation energy is too low, the oxide may become unstable or over-reduced, potentially leading to a loss of catalytic activity.

The vacancy formation energy also influences the oxidizing ability of the surface. A higher ΔEv typically corresponds to a stronger oxidizing power, as the oxide holds onto its oxygen more tightly. Conversely, a lower ΔEv may indicate a weaker oxidizing ability but potentially higher activity for certain reactions.

Understanding and controlling the oxygen vacancy formation energy is crucial for designing and optimizing oxide catalysts for specific oxidation reactions. It allows researchers to balance the trade-off between catalytic activity and oxidizing power, tailoring the catalyst properties to the desired reaction.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及催化剂表面氧空位的形成和消除。在这个过程中，氧化物晶格中的一个氧原子参与反应物分子的氧化，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Evf）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键参数。较低的空位形成能通常表示催化剂更活跃，因为从晶格中移除氧以参与氧化反应更容易。然而，如果空位形成能太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或过度还原，潜在导致催化活性的损失。

空位形成能也影响表面的氧化能力。较高的ΔEv通常对应于更强的氧化能力，因为氧化物更紧密地保持其氧。相反，较低的ΔEv可能表示较弱的氧化能力，但对某些反应可能具有更高的活性。

理解和控制氧空位形成能对于设计和优化特定氧化反应的氧化物催化剂至关重要。它允许研究人员平衡催化活性和氧化能力之间的权衡，根据所需的反应调整催化剂性质。
