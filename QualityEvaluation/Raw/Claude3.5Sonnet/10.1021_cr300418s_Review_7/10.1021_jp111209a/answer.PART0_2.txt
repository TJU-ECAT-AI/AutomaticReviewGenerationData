[1] "Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

[2] "The removal of a neutral oxygen atom leaves behind two electrons that had been engaged in two Ti–O bonds that were broken when the vacancy was formed. In what follows we call these the unpaired electrons (UPEs)."

[3] "Forming the vacancy reduces the two 6c-Ti* atoms from a formal charge of 4+ to a formal charge of 3+."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. In this process, an oxygen atom from the oxide lattice participates in the oxidation of the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen to participate in the reaction. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable or over-reduced.

The formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves behind two unpaired electrons, which can localize on nearby metal cations (in this case, Ti atoms), reducing them from their formal oxidation state. This reduction of metal cations and the associated structural changes (such as polaron formation) can significantly affect the surface chemistry and reactivity.

The precise value of ΔEv and the behavior of the unpaired electrons depend on various factors, including the oxide composition, surface structure, and computational methods used to study the system (such as the choice of U parameter in DFT+U calculations). Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting and optimizing the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面氧空位的形成和消除。在这个过程中，氧化物晶格中的一个氧原子参与反应物的氧化，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧重新填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许晶格氧更容易被移除参与反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或过度还原。

氧空位的形成会留下两个未配对电子，这些电子可以局域化在附近的金属阳离子上（在这种情况下是Ti原子），将它们从正式氧化态还原。这种金属阳离子的还原以及相关的结构变化（如极化子形成）可以显著影响表面化学和反应性。

ΔEv的精确值和未配对电子的行为取决于多种因素，包括氧化物成分、表面结构以及用于研究该系统的计算方法（如DFT+U计算中U参数的选择）。理解这些因素对于预测和优化氧化物表面在氧化反应中的催化性能至关重要。
