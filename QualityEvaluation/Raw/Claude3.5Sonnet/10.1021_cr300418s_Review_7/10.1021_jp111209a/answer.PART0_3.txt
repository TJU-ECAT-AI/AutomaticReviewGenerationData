[1] "Moreover, the formation and the annihilation of oxygen vacancies are essential steps in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (8-10) for catalytic oxidation."

[2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evf) was calculated as
Evf = 1/2E[O2] + E[TiO2(S)] - E[TiO2(R)]
where E[O2] is the total energy of O2 in gas phase, E[TiO2(S)] is the total energy of the stoichiometric slab, and E[TiO2(R)] is the total energy of a relaxed, partially reduced TiO2 slab having one bridging O vacancy on the surface of the supercell."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation and annihilation of oxygen vacancies as essential steps. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are active sites for the reaction. The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv, as it affects the ease with which the surface can release oxygen to participate in the oxidation reaction. The paper calculates ΔEv using density functional theory, considering the energies of the gas-phase oxygen molecule, the stoichiometric oxide slab, and the reduced oxide slab with an oxygen vacancy. This calculation helps in understanding the energetics of vacancy formation and its implications for catalytic behavior.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧空位的形成和消除作为关键步骤。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许更容易形成氧空位，这些空位是反应的活性位点。表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv影响，因为它影响表面释放氧以参与氧化反应的难易程度。该论文使用密度泛函理论计算ΔEv，考虑气相氧分子、化学计量比氧化物板条和带有氧空位的还原氧化物板条的能量。这种计算有助于理解空位形成的能量学及其对催化行为的影响。
