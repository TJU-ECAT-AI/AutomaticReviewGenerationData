[1] "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."

[2] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide some relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is an important aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the catalyst's lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

The literature mentions that oxygen ion migration and reduction of ceria are energetically favorable on the low index surfaces compared to the bulk. This suggests that these surfaces may be more active for catalytic oxidation reactions.

The text also provides a specific value for the oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria, calculated using DFT+U as 4.55 eV. This energy represents the cost of removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to remove lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction.

However, the literature does not provide direct information on how this vacancy formation energy relates to the catalytic activity or oxidizing ability of ceria surfaces. To fully answer the question, additional information about the relationship between vacancy formation energy and catalytic properties would be needed.

文献中并未明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，文本确实提供了一些关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的一个重要方面。

在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，催化剂的晶格氧参与氧化反应。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

文献提到，与体相相比，氧离子迁移和氧化铈还原在低指数表面上是能量有利的。这表明这些表面可能对催化氧化反应更活跃。

文本还提供了氧化铈中氧空位形成能的具体值，使用DFT+U计算为4.55 eV。这个能量代表了从晶格中移除一个氧原子的成本，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的关键步骤。较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为更容易移除晶格氧用于氧化反应。

然而，文献并未直接提供这种空位形成能与氧化铈表面催化活性或氧化能力关系的信息。要完整回答这个问题，还需要有关空位形成能与催化性能关系的额外信息。
