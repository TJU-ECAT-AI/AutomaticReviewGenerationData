[1] "For the present study, we consider the electronic structure of the partially reduced (100) surface. To enable investigation of the oxygen vacancy a 2 × 2 expansion of the pure (100) surface was created with two vacancies, one on each of the surfaces, thus ensuring that the slab has no net dipole moment, Fig. 5."

[2] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in this literature. However, the study does investigate oxygen vacancies on the ceria (100) surface, which is relevant to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is calculated to be 4.55 eV using the DFT+U method. This value is significant as it represents the energy needed to remove an oxygen atom from the surface, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it is easier to create oxygen vacancies on the surface. These vacancies can then participate in oxidation reactions. Conversely, a higher vacancy formation energy suggests stronger oxygen binding to the surface, which could indicate a higher oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The study shows that the choice of computational method (GGA vs. DFT+U) significantly affects the calculated vacancy formation energy, with DFT+U giving a lower value. This highlights the importance of using appropriate computational methods when studying these systems to accurately predict catalytic behavior.

本文献中并未明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，该研究确实调查了氧化铈(100)表面的氧空位，这与Mars-van Krevelen机制相关。

使用DFT+U方法计算的氧空位形成能(ΔEv)为4.55 eV。这个值很重要，因为它代表了从表面移除一个氧原子所需的能量，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的关键步骤。

较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为在表面上更容易形成氧空位。这些空位随后可以参与氧化反应。相反，较高的空位形成能表明氧与表面结合更强，这可能表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力。

研究表明，计算方法的选择(GGA vs. DFT+U)显著影响计算得到的空位形成能，DFT+U给出了较低的值。这突出了在研究这些系统时使用适当的计算方法的重要性，以准确预测催化行为。
