[1] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The document does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or its significance in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. However, it does provide information on oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria, which is relevant to the oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in ceria was calculated using both GGA-DFT and DFT+U methods. The DFT+U approach, which is considered more accurate for strongly correlated systems like ceria, yielded a vacancy formation energy of 4.55 eV. This value is lower than the GGA-DFT result by 0.83 eV.

While the document does not explicitly link this to catalytic activity or oxidizing ability, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is generally an important parameter in determining these properties. A lower vacancy formation energy typically indicates that the oxide surface can more easily release oxygen, which is crucial for oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, without more specific information from the text, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about how this particular value affects the catalytic activity or oxidizing ability of ceria surfaces.

该文档并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或其在氧化物催化氧化反应中的重要性。但是，它确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成能的信息，这与氧化物表面的氧化能力有关。

使用GGA-DFT和DFT+U方法计算了氧化铈中氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。对于强相关系统（如氧化铈）被认为更准确的DFT+U方法得出的空位形成能为4.55 eV。这个值比GGA-DFT的结果低0.83 eV。

虽然文档没有明确将此与催化活性或氧化能力联系起来，但氧空位形成能通常是决定这些性质的一个重要参数。较低的空位形成能通常表明氧化物表面可以更容易地释放氧，这对于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化反应至关重要。然而，由于文本中缺乏更具体的信息，我们无法对这个特定值如何影响氧化铈表面的催化活性或氧化能力得出明确的结论。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst participates in the oxidation reaction, creating an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The literature reports a calculated oxygen vacancy formation energy of 4.55 eV for ceria using the DFT+U method. This value represents the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, creating an oxygen vacancy and reducing two Ce4+ ions to Ce3+.

A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to remove lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide might lose its structural integrity or have poor oxidizing ability. The reported value of 4.55 eV for ceria suggests a balance between these factors, contributing to its effectiveness as a catalyst in oxidation reactions.

The study also highlights the importance of using appropriate computational methods (like DFT+U) to accurately describe the electronic structure of reduced ceria, which is crucial for understanding its catalytic properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在给定的文献中没有被明确讨论。然而，文本确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这是Mars-van Krevelen机理的一个关键方面。

在这个机制中，来自氧化物催化剂的晶格氧参与氧化反应，创造出氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

文献报道了使用DFT+U方法计算的氧化铈的氧空位形成能为4.55 eV。这个值代表了从晶格中移除一个氧原子，创造一个氧空位并将两个Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+的能量成本。

较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为更容易移除晶格氧进行氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会失去其结构完整性或氧化能力变差。氧化铈报告的4.55 eV值表明在这些因素之间取得了平衡，这有助于其作为氧化反应催化剂的有效性。

这项研究还强调了使用适当的计算方法（如DFT+U）来准确描述还原氧化铈的电子结构的重要性，这对于理解其催化性质至关重要。

[1] "For the present study, we consider the electronic structure of the partially reduced (100) surface. To enable investigation of the oxygen vacancy a 2 × 2 expansion of the pure (100) surface was created with two vacancies, one on each of the surfaces, thus ensuring that the slab has no net dipole moment, Fig. 5."

[2] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in this literature. However, the study does investigate oxygen vacancies on the ceria (100) surface, which is relevant to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is calculated to be 4.55 eV using the DFT+U method. This value is significant as it represents the energy needed to remove an oxygen atom from the surface, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it is easier to create oxygen vacancies on the surface. These vacancies can then participate in oxidation reactions. Conversely, a higher vacancy formation energy suggests stronger oxygen binding to the surface, which could indicate a higher oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The study shows that the choice of computational method (GGA vs. DFT+U) significantly affects the calculated vacancy formation energy, with DFT+U giving a lower value. This highlights the importance of using appropriate computational methods when studying these systems to accurately predict catalytic behavior.

本文献中并未明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，该研究确实调查了氧化铈(100)表面的氧空位，这与Mars-van Krevelen机制相关。

使用DFT+U方法计算的氧空位形成能(ΔEv)为4.55 eV。这个值很重要，因为它代表了从表面移除一个氧原子所需的能量，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的关键步骤。

较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为在表面上更容易形成氧空位。这些空位随后可以参与氧化反应。相反，较高的空位形成能表明氧与表面结合更强，这可能表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力。

研究表明，计算方法的选择(GGA vs. DFT+U)显著影响计算得到的空位形成能，DFT+U给出了较低的值。这突出了在研究这些系统时使用适当的计算方法的重要性，以准确预测催化行为。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide some relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is an important aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the catalyst's lattice oxygen participates in the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. 

The literature mentions that oxygen ion migration and reduction of ceria are energetically favorable on the low index surfaces compared to the bulk. This suggests that these surfaces may be more active for catalytic oxidation reactions.

The text also provides a specific value for the oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria, calculated using DFT+U as 4.55 eV. This energy represents the cost of removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to remove lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction.

However, the literature does not provide direct information on how this vacancy formation energy relates to the catalytic activity or oxidizing ability of ceria surfaces. To fully answer the question, additional information about the relationship between vacancy formation energy and catalytic properties would be needed.
