[1] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

The document does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or its significance in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. However, it does provide information on oxygen vacancy formation energy in ceria, which is relevant to the oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in ceria was calculated using both GGA-DFT and DFT+U methods. The DFT+U approach, which is considered more accurate for strongly correlated systems like ceria, yielded a vacancy formation energy of 4.55 eV. This value is lower than the GGA-DFT result by 0.83 eV.

While the document does not explicitly link this to catalytic activity or oxidizing ability, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is generally an important parameter in determining these properties. A lower vacancy formation energy typically indicates that the oxide surface can more easily release oxygen, which is crucial for oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, without more specific information from the text, we cannot draw definitive conclusions about how this particular value affects the catalytic activity or oxidizing ability of ceria surfaces.

该文档并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或其在氧化物催化氧化反应中的重要性。但是，它确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成能的信息，这与氧化物表面的氧化能力有关。

使用GGA-DFT和DFT+U方法计算了氧化铈中氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。对于强相关系统（如氧化铈）被认为更准确的DFT+U方法得出的空位形成能为4.55 eV。这个值比GGA-DFT的结果低0.83 eV。

虽然文档没有明确将此与催化活性或氧化能力联系起来，但氧空位形成能通常是决定这些性质的一个重要参数。较低的空位形成能通常表明氧化物表面可以更容易地释放氧，这对于遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化反应至关重要。然而，由于文本中缺乏更具体的信息，我们无法对这个特定值如何影响氧化铈表面的催化活性或氧化能力得出明确的结论。
