[1] "Upon reduction of ceria, CeIV ions are formally reduced to CeIII, Eq. (1), and it is expected that these ions will be localised around the oxygen vacancy sites."

[2] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

In this mechanism, lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst participates in the oxidation reaction, creating an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The literature reports a calculated oxygen vacancy formation energy of 4.55 eV for ceria using the DFT+U method. This value represents the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, creating an oxygen vacancy and reducing two Ce4+ ions to Ce3+.

A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to remove lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide might lose its structural integrity or have poor oxidizing ability. The reported value of 4.55 eV for ceria suggests a balance between these factors, contributing to its effectiveness as a catalyst in oxidation reactions.

The study also highlights the importance of using appropriate computational methods (like DFT+U) to accurately describe the electronic structure of reduced ceria, which is crucial for understanding its catalytic properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在给定的文献中没有被明确讨论。然而，文本确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这是Mars-van Krevelen机理的一个关键方面。

在这个机制中，来自氧化物催化剂的晶格氧参与氧化反应，创造出氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

文献报道了使用DFT+U方法计算的氧化铈的氧空位形成能为4.55 eV。这个值代表了从晶格中移除一个氧原子，创造一个氧空位并将两个Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+的能量成本。

较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为更容易移除晶格氧进行氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会失去其结构完整性或氧化能力变差。氧化铈报告的4.55 eV值表明在这些因素之间取得了平衡，这有助于其作为氧化反应催化剂的有效性。

这项研究还强调了使用适当的计算方法（如DFT+U）来准确描述还原氧化铈的电子结构的重要性，这对于理解其催化性质至关重要。
