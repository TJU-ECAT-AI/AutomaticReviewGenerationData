          "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

          "Upon reduction of ceria, CeIV ions are formally reduced to CeIII, Eq. (1), and it is expected that these ions will be localised around the oxygen vacancy sites."

          "For the present study, we consider the electronic structure of the partially reduced (100) surface. To enable investigation of the oxygen vacancy a 2 × 2 expansion of the pure (100) surface was created with two vacancies, one on each of the surfaces, thus ensuring that the slab has no net dipole moment, Fig. 5."

          "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."

          Although the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature, the provided information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria is relevant to understanding this mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

          The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in ceria was calculated using DFT+U to be 4.55 eV. This value represents the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, creating an oxygen vacancy and reducing two Ce4+ ions to Ce3+. The vacancy formation energy is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

          A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to remove lattice oxygen for the oxidation reaction. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide might lose its structural integrity or have poor oxidizing ability. The reported value of 4.55 eV for ceria suggests a balance between these factors, contributing to its effectiveness as a catalyst in oxidation reactions.

          The study also highlights that oxygen ion migration and reduction of ceria are energetically favorable on the low index surfaces compared to the bulk. This suggests that these surfaces may be more active for catalytic oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

          The research emphasizes the importance of using appropriate computational methods (like DFT+U) to accurately describe the electronic structure of reduced ceria, which is crucial for understanding its catalytic properties. The choice of computational method significantly affects the calculated vacancy formation energy, with DFT+U giving a lower value than GGA.

          While the literature provides valuable insights into oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, it does not directly link this to catalytic activity or oxidizing ability. To fully understand the significance of ΔEv in determining these properties, additional information about the relationship between vacancy formation energy and catalytic performance would be needed.

          尽管给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供的关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的信息与理解氧化物催化氧化反应中的这一机制相关。

          使用DFT+U方法计算的氧化铈中氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）为4.55 eV。这个值代表了从晶格中移除一个氧原子，创造一个氧空位并将两个Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+的能量成本。空位形成能对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。

          较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为更容易移除晶格氧进行氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能会失去其结构完整性或氧化能力变差。氧化铈报告的4.55 eV值表明在这些因素之间取得了平衡，这有助于其作为氧化反应催化剂的有效性。

          研究还强调，与体相相比，氧离子迁移和氧化铈还原在低指数表面上是能量有利的。这表明这些表面可能对遵循Mars-van Krevelen机制的催化氧化反应更活跃。

          研究强调了使用适当的计算方法（如DFT+U）来准确描述还原氧化铈的电子结构的重要性，这对于理解其催化性质至关重要。计算方法的选择显著影响计算得到的空位形成能，DFT+U给出的值比GGA低。

          虽然文献为理解氧化铈中的氧空位形成提供了宝贵的见解，但并未直接将其与催化活性或氧化能力联系起来。要充分理解ΔEv在确定这些性质中的重要性，还需要有关空位形成能与催化性能关系的额外信息。
