[1] "Upon reduction of ceria, CeIV ions are formally reduced to CeIII, Eq. (1), and it is expected that these ions will be localised around the oxygen vacancy sites."

[2] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV, which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the document provides information relevant to oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is a key step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, oxygen from the oxide lattice participates in the oxidation reaction, creating an oxygen vacancy. The energy required to form this vacancy (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalyst's activity and oxidizing ability.

The literature reports a vacancy formation energy of 4.55 eV for ceria using DFT+U calculations. This value represents the energy cost of removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, creating an oxygen vacancy and reducing two Ce4+ ions to Ce3+.

A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it's easier to remove oxygen from the lattice for the oxidation reaction. However, if the energy is too low, the oxide might be over-reduced and lose its oxidizing ability.

The specific vacancy formation energy of 4.55 eV for ceria suggests a balance between stability and reactivity, which contributes to ceria's effectiveness as an oxidation catalyst. This energy value helps explain ceria's ability to store and release oxygen, which is central to its catalytic applications.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在给定的文献中并没有被明确讨论。然而，该文档提供了与氧化铈中氧空位形成相关的信息，这是Mars-van Krevelen机理中的一个关键步骤。

在Mars-van Krevelen机理中，氧化物晶格中的氧参与氧化反应，形成氧空位。形成这个空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定催化剂的活性和氧化能力至关重要。

文献报道了使用DFT+U计算得到的氧化铈的空位形成能为4.55 eV。这个值代表了从晶格中移除一个氧原子，形成氧空位并将两个Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+所需的能量成本。

较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为从晶格中移除氧用于氧化反应更容易。但是，如果能量太低，氧化物可能会过度还原并失去其氧化能力。

氧化铈4.55 eV的特定空位形成能表明了稳定性和反应性之间的平衡，这有助于氧化铈作为氧化催化剂的有效性。这个能量值有助于解释氧化铈储存和释放氧的能力，这是其催化应用的核心。
