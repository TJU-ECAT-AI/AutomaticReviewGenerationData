First-principles pseudopotential calculations are reported for the lattice distortion and electronic properties of
the Al substitutional defect in a quartz. We determine microscopical properties of the center such as Al
coordination, symmetry of the distorted lattice and defect-induced electronic states. The localization properties
of the electronic spin density of this paramagnetic color center are investigated. Our results show that the spin
density is evenly distributed on the four oxygen nearest neighbors to Al in contrast to phenomenological model
results.
I. INTRODUCTION
Silicon dioxide (SiO2) is widely employed, both in amor-
phous and crystalline form, for technological and scientific
applications. The presence of point defects affects the opti-
cal, electrical, and piezoelectrical properties of this material.
One of the most important class of defects is related to the
presence of Al impurities. Al is always present as a substi-
tutional impurity in both synthetic and natural quartz. In an
ionic model, an Al31 ion replaces a Si41 ion, the resulting
charge imbalance is usually neutralized by an alkali metal
ion M1 or an hydrogen ion H1. These neutral complexes are
indicated respectively with Al-M or @AlO4 /M1#0 and Al-H
or @AlO4 /H1#0. In irradiated samples a complex of substi-
tutional Al with a hole h1, called Al-h or @AlO4#0 center, is
observed as well. This defect is paramagnetic and has been
detected with EPR techniques1 since the 1960. It is believed
that Al-h centers are formed from Al-M or Al-H centers in
which the M1 or H1 ion is displaced by irradiation.2,3
Much experimental work has been done on Al-related de-
fects in natural and synthetic quartz due to their detrimental
effects on electrical and optical properties.1,2,4,5 Relatively
little is known instead on the microscopic structure of Al-
related defects. Previous theoretical work has been mostly
done at the Hartree-Fock level using a small cluster to simu-
late the defect.6 The accuracy of such approaches is not al-
ways satisfactory in solids. Supercell calculations using
density-functional theory DFT! have been mostly performed
on other types of defects, such as oxygen vacancies.7 The
only previous work of this type8 is an all-electron calculation
on the Al-h center that does not take into account atomic
relaxation from the ideal structure.
In this paper, we present our results on the electronic and
structural properties of the Al-h center. Using DFT and a
supercell approach we are able to study the lattice distortion,
density of states and electronic spin density localization.
Some of our results are quite different from previous results
and challenge the conventional picture of the Al-h center.
II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
The perfect a quartz lattice is hexagonal with nine atoms
per unit cell (D4
3 space group for the left-handed enanti-
omer!. The crystal can be described as a network of SiO4
tetrahedral units that are connected through a common oxy-
gen atom. The local symmetry of the Si site is only C2 be-
cause the four Si-O bonds are equal two by two, with two
bonds called Si-O. bonds! slightly longer than the other
two (Si-O, bonds!.2 The positions of the atoms in the unit
cell can be expressed in terms of four parameters uxyz as in
Ref. 18.
The defect was simulated by a supercell of 72 atoms,
obtained by doubling the lengths of all crystal axis and re-
placing one of the Si atoms with an Al atom. The minimum
distance between periodic replica of the impurity is 9.85 A
 .
We performed our calculations using DFT both in the
local density LDA! and in the local spin density approxima-
tion LSDA!. We used Perdew and Zunger parametrization9
of Ceperley and Alder10 data for exchange-correlation en-
ergy. Norm-conserving pseudopotentials11 were used for Si
and for Al the parameters are given respectively in Refs. 12
and 13!. For oxygen atoms an ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudo-
potential with rc
s5rc
p51.5 a.u.) was used.14 For LSDA cal-
culations, pseudopotentials with nonlinear core corrections15
were generated.
Plane waves up to a kinetic-energy cutoff of 25 Ry were
used for the expansion of the Kohn-Sham orbitals. Conver-
gence checks showed that for a quartz this gives conver-
gence to better than 1% for the unit-cell volume V0 and for
the axis ratio c/a, better than 2% for the uxyz parameters.
In pure a quartz we used a set of 8 k points in the Bril-
louin zone BZ!. This set folds into the G point (k50) of the
supercell BZ. Very small differences in the total energy less
than 25 meV per formula unit! and in the structural param-

The equilibrium structure of the defect is determined by
relaxing the atomic positions until the minimum energy is
found. To this end Hellmann-Feynman forces acting on at-
oms are calculated. The relaxation was stopped when all
forces were smaller than 1023 Ry/a.u., corresponding to an
accuracy in calculated positions better than 1023 a.u. All
atoms in the supercell were allowed to move. The search of
the equilibrium positions was performed within LSDA be-
cause the supercell for the Al-h defect has an unpaired elec-
tron. However, test LDA calculations, using a broadening19
of the partially occupied state equivalent to half occupancy
of spin-up and spin-down states if only the G point is used!
yielded very close results to those obtained with LSDA re-
laxed atomic distances changed less then 0.1%!.
III. RESULTS
A. Equilibrium ionic positions
In order to reduce the possibility of being trapped into a
local minimum we started the relaxation process from differ-
ent initial configurations. In the first one, an Al atom replaces
a Si atom at a Si lattice site, with all other atoms fixed at
their perfect crystal positions. The local C2 symmetry of the
site is preserved. This is the configuration used without re-
laxation! in Ref. 8. In the second configuration, the Al is
placed closer to three oxygens, at Al-O distances that are
identical to those found in Ref. 6 in a Hartree-Fock cluster
calculation. In the third configuration, the Al is placed out of
the tetrahedron formed by the nearest-neighbor oxygens of
the substituted Si atom, close to a face of the tetrahedron,
with three oxygens as nearest-neighbors see Fig. 1!. All the
starting points result in the same final equilibrium configu-
ration, in which the Al atom is tetrahedrically coordinated. A
test LDA! calculation starting from a completely unsym-
metrical Al position yielded the same result.
The AlO4 tetrahedron is very similar to the original SiO4
tetrahedron. The C2-site symmetry is conserved: two Al-O
bonds are about 0.4% longer than the two others. The calcu-
lated Al-O, bond is 1.670 A
 , 2.64% longer than the origi-
nal Si-O, bond and the Al-O. bond is 1.678 A
 , 2.69%
longer than Si-O. bond. The lattice disruption, depicted in
Fig. 2, is small and short ranged: the four oxygens of the
AlO4 tetrahedron decrease their distances from their nearest-
neighbors Si of about 1% (.0.025 A
 ), other bonds of the
latter Si atoms change less than 0.5% from their perfect lat-
tice values. The structural optimization produces a 0.135 eV
energy gain with respect to the starting structure with an Al
replacing a Si at a Si lattice site.
Chemical intuition suggests a ground state in which the
Al is threefold coordinated preferentially bound to three
oxygens!, rather than fourfold coordinated with four almost
equal Al-O bonds! as we found. It turns out that fourfold
coordination is favored by electrostatic interactions. Let us
consider the partition of the total energy as:

found that the former is .1.48 eV higher in the quantum-
mechanical terms one electron and exchange correlation!,
but .2.38 eV lower in the electrostatic terms Hartree and
Ewald!, so the fourfold coordination has overall a lower en-
ergy.
B. Electronic properties
We calculated the density of electronic states DOS! for
the Al-h supercell and we made a comparison with the DOS
of the perfect crystal. We used the tetrahedron method20 to
sample the energy spectrum at 27 k points in the supercell
BZ.
Valence states of a quartz are known to be divided into
three zones separated by two forbidden gaps.21 States in each
zone have different spatial distributions. In Fig. 3 states
named B1 are bonding states localized on oxygen 2s orbit-
als, states named B2 are bonding states localized mainly on
oxygen 2p bonding orbitals and states named A1 are anti-
bonding 2p oxygen orbitals. All electronic states are local-
ized near oxygen sites: in a simple ionic bond model we have
Si41 bound to O22.
As previously found in Ref. 8 the DOS for the Al-h center
presents two zones of major changes from the DOS of the
perfect crystal. The impurity induces two groups of deep
states in the valence band, named here D1 and D2. The
charge density maps for states D1 and D2 have the same
bonding character respectively of crystal states B1 and B2
and are localized only on the four oxygens of the AlO4 tet-
rahedron Fig. 4!. States D1 and D2 have slightly higher
energy than B1 and B2 states because their charge density
feels the Al31 atom core that is less attractive than the Si41
atom core.
The total number of bonding states B1, D1, B2, and D2
in the supercell is the same as in the perfect crystal. Contrary
to what is claimed in Ref. 8 there is no dangling bond
around Al: the Al is bonded to the four nearest-neighbors
oxygens with the same number of electrons in bonding states
as Si. The change in the ionic charge of the atomic core
reflects in a rearrangement of electronic charge density of
bonding states around Al with respect to Si. The rearrange-
ment is depicted in Fig. 5. We stress that the difference in
bonding charge density integrates to a zero charge depletion.
The elongation of the Al-O bonds with respect to the Si-O
bonds mentioned in Sec. III A is due to electrostatic effects
related to the ionic character of the bonds: the Al31 core is
less bound to oxygens than the Si41 core.
The DOS exhibits a third feature near the upper valence
band edge that was not discussed in Ref. 8. The upper elec-
tronic state in the A1 zone must be unoccupied because the

energy correspond to the valence band maximum of a-quartz. The
labels B1, B2, A1, D1, and D2 are defined in the text.

reduced valence of Al with respect to silicon lowers the
Fermi level. In our LSDA calculations at k50 a set of im-
purity states containing one unoccupied level acceptor level!
appears. In other words a hole is found in an antibonding
impurity state near the band edge of a quartz Fig. 6!. In Fig.
5, one can indeed see that a net charge depletion exists on
antibonding directions on the two oxygens defining the
O.-Al-O. plane.22 This charge depletion correctly inte-
grates to one electron.
The transition of the hole to lower states in the valence
band is at the origin of the color properties of the Al-h cen-
ter. Transitions to lower states in the A1 zone Fig. 3! are
possible in the range from 0.1 to 3.3 eV and this accounts for
the smoky color of quartz samples containing Al-h defects.23
Transitions to even lower energy states can induce absorp-
tion also in the UV range.
C. Localization of spin density
The localization and symmetry properties of the spin den-
sity of the Al-h center are important for interpreting EPR
data. Until now these data have been interpreted using a
phenomenological model in which the hole was supposed to
be located on one oxygen 2p antibonding orbital and to os-
cillate between two oxygens because of thermal motion.1,2
Our results do not support this model: the calculated spin
density in the ground electronic state, depicted in Fig. 7, is
localized in antibonding 2p oxygen orbitals but is evenly
distributed on all the four oxygens. Comparison of the spin
density with the square modulus of the unoccupied state of
Fig. 6 shows that the spin density equals the charge density
of the hole. The spin density has C2 local symmetry the C2
axis bisects the O.-Al-O. and O,-Al-O, angles!. Orbitals
localized on O. atoms have their axis perpendicular to the
Al-O. bond and are lying on the plane containing the two
bonds. The C2 symmetry interchanges the O. 2p orbitals.
The axis of the O, 2p antibonding orbitals are not lying on
the plane containing the two bonds: they are perpendicular to
their respective Si-O,-Al plane. Again the C2 symmetry in-
terchanges the two orbitals.
Dielectric relaxation and acoustic loss experiments sug-
gest that the Al-h center can tunnel between different orien-
tation under applied electric field or induced phonon excita-
tion. A coupling between hole motion and lattice relaxation
is observed as well.1,4 It is not straightforward to reconcile
such observations with our findings. If the hole is localized
on a single oxygen, a simple reorientation mechanism can be
proposed, but this does not apply to our case. We remark
however that transitions to excited states have a quite low-
activation energy (.0.1) eV! and could explain at least par-
tially the observed phenomenology.

In Fig. 8, we present the square modulus of the lowest-
lying excited state of the hole i.e., the highest occupied state
of Fig. 6!. Comparison with Fig. 7 shows that the localiza-
tion and the orientation of the 2p antibonding oxygen orbit-
als change with respect to the ground state. Orbitals lying on
the O.-Al-O. plane in the ground state are out of plane in
the excited state, and vice versa for O, orbitals. The excited
state is less localized than the ground state: the hole partially
transfers to two oxygens in the third shell of nearest-
neighbors to Al.
Due to the ionic character of the bonds, the transfer of the
hole to the two oxygens will couple with an increase of the
respective Si-O bonds and with a decrease of the Al-O.-Si
and Al-O,-Si bonds. This establishes a coupling mechanism
between hole motion and lattice relaxation.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we found that in the Al-h center the Al atom
substitutes the Si atom with little lattice distortion and main-
taining the local C2 symmetry of the Si site. The presence of
the Al impurity induces deep defect states and an acceptor
level hosting a hole responsible of the coloring properties of
the center. The hole is found to produce a spin density
equally localized on the four nearest-neighbors oxygens of
the impurity atom.
