I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

PREFACE TO THE SERIES 
Catalysis is important academically and industrially. It plays an essential role in 
the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to 
fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or 
prohibitively expensive. There are few chemical- or oil-based material items in 
modern society that do not depend in some way on a catalytic stage in their 
manufacture. Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other 
important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of 
catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are 
certain to increase in the future. 
The commercial importance of catalysis and the diverse intellectual 
challenges of catalytic phenomena have stimulated study by a broad spectrum of 
scientists, including chemists, physicists, chemical engineers, and material 
scientists. Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels 
of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing 
amount of published material. As recently as sixty years ago, Rideal and Taylor 
could still treat the subject comprehensively in a single volume, but by the 
1950s. Emmett required six volumes, and no conventional multivolume text 
could now cover the whole of catalysis in any depth. In view of this situation, 
we felt there was a need for a collection of monographs, each one of which 
would deal at an advanced level with a selected topic, so as to build a catalysis

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How does the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operate in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, and what is the significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
