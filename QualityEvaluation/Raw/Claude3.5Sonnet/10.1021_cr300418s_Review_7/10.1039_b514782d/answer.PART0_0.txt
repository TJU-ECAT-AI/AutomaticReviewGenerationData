[1] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT."

[2] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[3] "To understand the origin of this result, we have carried out an electronic relaxation of the surfaces upon formation of the oxygen vacancy; in these calculations, the atomic positions are not relaxed. The vacancy formation energies from the electronic relaxation show that the ordering of the vacancy formation energies follows the stability of the pure surface."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, an oxygen vacancy is created when a lattice oxygen atom is removed to oxidize the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The significance of ΔEv is twofold:

1. Catalytic activity: Lower vacancy formation energies generally lead to higher catalytic activity. This is because it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The study shows that ceria has relatively low vacancy formation energies at high temperatures, making it a good catalyst for oxidation reactions.

2. Oxidizing ability: The vacancy formation energy is directly related to the oxide's ability to donate oxygen for the oxidation reaction. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide can more readily provide oxygen, enhancing its oxidizing ability.

The research demonstrates that the vacancy formation energy is not necessarily related to the stability of the pure surface, but rather determines the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions. This finding is crucial for understanding and predicting the catalytic behavior of different oxide surfaces.

Furthermore, the study highlights that the surface with the lowest vacancy formation energy (in this case, the (110) surface of ceria) may be the most suitable for studying these catalytic reactions, as it would likely exhibit the highest catalytic activity.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，当晶格氧原子被移除以氧化反应物时，会产生氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

ΔEv的重要性体现在两个方面：

1. 催化活性：较低的空位形成能量通常会导致更高的催化活性。这是因为更容易创建氧空位，而氧空位对Mars-van Krevelen机制至关重要。研究表明，在高温下，氧化铈的空位形成能量相对较低，使其成为氧化反应的良好催化剂。

2. 氧化能力：空位形成能量直接与氧化物提供氧气进行氧化反应的能力有关。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物可以更容易地提供氧气，从而增强其氧化能力。

研究表明，空位形成能量不一定与纯表面的稳定性相关，而是决定了催化反应的表面敏感性。这一发现对理解和预测不同氧化物表面的催化行为至关重要。

此外，研究强调，具有最低空位形成能量的表面（在本例中为氧化铈的(110)表面）可能最适合研究这些催化反应，因为它可能表现出最高的催化活性。
