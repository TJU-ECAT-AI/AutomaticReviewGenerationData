[1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis. However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support. In particular, the reduction of ceria surfaces provides oxygen atoms so that carbon monoxide can be oxidised to CO2."

[2] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT. This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy formation energies are thus an underestimation."

[3] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface through the formation of oxygen vacancies, which then provide oxygen atoms for the oxidation of reactants. In the case of ceria (CeO2), this mechanism is evident in the oxidation of carbon monoxide to CO2.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, making the surface more active for catalytic oxidation reactions. The literature suggests that ceria has relatively favorable vacancy formation energies at high temperatures, which explains its effectiveness as a catalyst in automotive exhaust systems.

The surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions on ceria is determined by the oxygen vacancy formation energy, rather than the stability of the pure surface. This means that surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are likely to be more catalytically active, even if they are not the most stable surfaces overall.

It's important to note that the actual vacancy formation energies may be underestimated in the study due to limitations in the DFT calculations. However, the relative differences between surfaces and the overall trends in catalytic activity are still valid and consistent with experimental observations of ceria's catalytic behavior.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及通过形成氧空位来还原氧化物表面，然后这些氧空位为反应物的氧化提供氧原子。在二氧化铈（CeO2）的情况下，这种机制在一氧化碳氧化为二氧化碳的过程中很明显。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以更容易形成，使表面对催化氧化反应更加活跃。文献表明，在高温下，二氧化铈具有相对有利的空位形成能，这解释了它在汽车尾气系统中作为催化剂的有效性。

二氧化铈上催化反应的表面敏感性是由氧空位形成能决定的，而不是纯表面的稳定性。这意味着具有较低空位形成能的表面可能具有更高的催化活性，即使它们不是整体上最稳定的表面。

需要注意的是，由于DFT计算的限制，研究中的实际空位形成能可能被低估。然而，表面之间的相对差异和催化活性的整体趋势仍然有效，并与二氧化铈催化行为的实验观察一致。
