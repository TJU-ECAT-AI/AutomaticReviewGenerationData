[1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis. However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support. In particular, the reduction of ceria surfaces provides oxygen atoms so that carbon monoxide can be oxidised to CO2."

[2] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT. This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy formation energies are thus an underestimation."

[3] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface through the formation of oxygen vacancies, which then provide reactive oxygen atoms for the oxidation of adsorbed molecules. In the case of ceria (CeO2), the surface can be readily reduced, forming oxygen vacancies that allow for the oxidation of carbon monoxide to CO2.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, making the surface more reactive for oxidation reactions. The study shows that the vacancy formation energies for ceria surfaces are relatively low, especially at high temperatures typical in automotive exhausts, which explains ceria's known catalytic behavior.

The surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions is determined by the oxygen vacancy formation energy, rather than the stability of the pure surface. This means that surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are likely to be more catalytically active, as they can more readily participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by providing reactive oxygen species.

It's important to note that the actual vacancy formation energies may be slightly higher than reported in the study due to known errors in DFT calculations of O2 binding energy. However, this doesn't affect the relative comparisons between different surfaces or the overall conclusions about ceria's catalytic behavior.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及通过形成氧空位来还原氧化物表面，然后这些氧空位为吸附分子的氧化提供反应性氧原子。对于二氧化铈（CeO2）来说，其表面可以容易地被还原，形成氧空位，从而允许一氧化碳被氧化成二氧化碳。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以更容易形成，使表面在氧化反应中更具反应性。研究表明，二氧化铈表面的空位形成能相对较低，特别是在汽车尾气中典型的高温下，这解释了二氧化铈已知的催化行为。

催化反应的表面敏感性是由氧空位形成能决定的，而不是纯表面的稳定性。这意味着具有较低空位形成能的表面可能具有更高的催化活性，因为它们可以更容易地参与Mars-van Krevelen机制，提供反应性氧物种。

需要注意的是，由于DFT计算O2结合能时存在已知误差，实际的空位形成能可能略高于研究中报告的值。然而，这并不影响不同表面之间的相对比较或关于二氧化铈催化行为的整体结论。
