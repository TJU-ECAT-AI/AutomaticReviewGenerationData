[1] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT."

[2] "Vacancy formation energies will also be influenced by the value of U; however, testing of U values from 17 eV,5 shows that too small a value of U leads to the wrong description of the atomic and electronic structure of reduced ceria and the vacancy formation and reaction energies so computed will be influenced by this error."

[3] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly mentioned in the given literature. However, the text discusses the importance of oxygen vacancy formation in ceria-catalyzed oxidation reactions, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature indicates that:

1. Lower vacancy formation energies lead to more favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, especially at high temperatures like those in automotive exhausts. This contributes to the catalytic behavior of ceria.

2. The vacancy formation energy determines the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions. Different surfaces of ceria (e.g., (111), (110), (100)) have different vacancy formation energies, which affects their catalytic activity.

3. The stability of vacancy sites is driven by atomic relaxations, rather than the stability of the pure surface.

4. Accurate calculation of vacancy formation energies is critical for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior. The literature discusses the challenges in calculating these energies accurately using density functional theory (DFT) methods.

In summary, while not explicitly discussing the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the literature emphasizes the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energies in determining the catalytic properties of ceria surfaces, which is consistent with this mechanism's principles.

虽然文献中没有明确提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但它讨论了氧空位形成在二氧化铈催化氧化反应中的重要性，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的一个关键方面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。文献指出：

1. 较低的空位形成能量导致氧空位的形成更加有利，特别是在汽车尾气等高温环境下。这有助于二氧化铈的催化行为。

2. 空位形成能量决定了催化反应的表面敏感性。二氧化铈的不同表面（如(111)，(110)，(100)）具有不同的空位形成能量，这影响了它们的催化活性。

3. 空位位点的稳定性是由原子弛豫驱动的，而不是纯表面的稳定性。

4. 准确计算空位形成能量对于理解和预测催化行为至关重要。文献讨论了使用密度泛函理论（DFT）方法准确计算这些能量的挑战。

总之，虽然没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文献强调了氧空位形成能量在决定二氧化铈表面催化性质方面的重要性，这与该机制的原理一致。
