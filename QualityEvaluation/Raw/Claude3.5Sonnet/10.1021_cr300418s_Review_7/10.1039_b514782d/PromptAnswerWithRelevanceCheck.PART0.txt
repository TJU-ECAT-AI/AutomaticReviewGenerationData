[1] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT."

[2] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[3] "To understand the origin of this result, we have carried out an electronic relaxation of the surfaces upon formation of the oxygen vacancy; in these calculations, the atomic positions are not relaxed. The vacancy formation energies from the electronic relaxation show that the ordering of the vacancy formation energies follows the stability of the pure surface."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, an oxygen vacancy is created when a lattice oxygen atom is removed to oxidize the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The significance of ΔEv is twofold:

1. Catalytic activity: Lower vacancy formation energies generally lead to higher catalytic activity. This is because it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The study shows that ceria has relatively low vacancy formation energies at high temperatures, making it a good catalyst for oxidation reactions.

2. Oxidizing ability: The vacancy formation energy is directly related to the oxide's ability to donate oxygen for the oxidation reaction. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide can more readily provide oxygen, enhancing its oxidizing ability.

The research demonstrates that the vacancy formation energy is not necessarily related to the stability of the pure surface, but rather determines the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions. This finding is crucial for understanding and predicting the catalytic behavior of different oxide surfaces.

Furthermore, the study highlights that the surface with the lowest vacancy formation energy (in this case, the (110) surface of ceria) may be the most suitable for studying these catalytic reactions, as it would likely exhibit the highest catalytic activity.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，当晶格氧原子被移除以氧化反应物时，会产生氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

ΔEv的重要性体现在两个方面：

1. 催化活性：较低的空位形成能量通常会导致更高的催化活性。这是因为更容易创建氧空位，而氧空位对Mars-van Krevelen机制至关重要。研究表明，在高温下，氧化铈的空位形成能量相对较低，使其成为氧化反应的良好催化剂。

2. 氧化能力：空位形成能量直接与氧化物提供氧气进行氧化反应的能力有关。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物可以更容易地提供氧气，从而增强其氧化能力。

研究表明，空位形成能量不一定与纯表面的稳定性相关，而是决定了催化反应的表面敏感性。这一发现对理解和预测不同氧化物表面的催化行为至关重要。

此外，研究强调，具有最低空位形成能量的表面（在本例中为氧化铈的(110)表面）可能最适合研究这些催化反应，因为它可能表现出最高的催化活性。

[1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis. However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support. In particular, the reduction of ceria surfaces provides oxygen atoms so that carbon monoxide can be oxidised to CO2."

[2] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT. This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy formation energies are thus an underestimation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface through the formation of oxygen vacancies, which then provide oxygen atoms for the oxidation of reactants. In the case of ceria (CeO2), this mechanism is evident in the oxidation of carbon monoxide to CO2.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, making the surface more active for catalytic oxidation reactions. The literature suggests that ceria has relatively favorable vacancy formation energies at high temperatures, which explains its effectiveness as a catalyst in automotive exhaust systems.

The surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions on ceria is determined by the oxygen vacancy formation energy, rather than the stability of the pure surface. This means that surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are likely to be more catalytically active, even if they are not the most stable surfaces overall.

It's important to note that the actual vacancy formation energies may be underestimated in the study due to limitations in the DFT calculations. However, the relative differences between surfaces and the overall trends in catalytic activity are still valid and consistent with experimental observations of ceria's catalytic behavior.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及通过形成氧空位来还原氧化物表面，然后这些氧空位为反应物的氧化提供氧原子。在二氧化铈（CeO2）的情况下，这种机制在一氧化碳氧化为二氧化碳的过程中很明显。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以更容易形成，使表面对催化氧化反应更加活跃。文献表明，在高温下，二氧化铈具有相对有利的空位形成能，这解释了它在汽车尾气系统中作为催化剂的有效性。

二氧化铈上催化反应的表面敏感性是由氧空位形成能决定的，而不是纯表面的稳定性。这意味着具有较低空位形成能的表面可能具有更高的催化活性，即使它们不是整体上最稳定的表面。

需要注意的是，由于DFT计算的限制，研究中的实际空位形成能可能被低估。然而，表面之间的相对差异和催化活性的整体趋势仍然有效，并与二氧化铈催化行为的实验观察一致。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface through the formation of oxygen vacancies, which then provide reactive oxygen atoms for the oxidation of adsorbed molecules. In the case of ceria (CeO2), the surface can be readily reduced, forming oxygen vacancies that allow for the oxidation of carbon monoxide to CO2.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, making the surface more reactive for oxidation reactions. The study shows that the vacancy formation energies for ceria surfaces are relatively low, especially at high temperatures typical in automotive exhausts, which explains ceria's known catalytic behavior.

The surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions is determined by the oxygen vacancy formation energy, rather than the stability of the pure surface. This means that surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are likely to be more catalytically active, as they can more readily participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by providing reactive oxygen species.

It's important to note that the actual vacancy formation energies may be slightly higher than reported in the study due to known errors in DFT calculations of O2 binding energy. However, this doesn't affect the relative comparisons between different surfaces or the overall conclusions about ceria's catalytic behavior.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及通过形成氧空位来还原氧化物表面，然后这些氧空位为吸附分子的氧化提供反应性氧原子。对于二氧化铈（CeO2）来说，其表面可以容易地被还原，形成氧空位，从而允许一氧化碳被氧化成二氧化碳。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以更容易形成，使表面在氧化反应中更具反应性。研究表明，二氧化铈表面的空位形成能相对较低，特别是在汽车尾气中典型的高温下，这解释了二氧化铈已知的催化行为。

催化反应的表面敏感性是由氧空位形成能决定的，而不是纯表面的稳定性。这意味着具有较低空位形成能的表面可能具有更高的催化活性，因为它们可以更容易地参与Mars-van Krevelen机制，提供反应性氧物种。

需要注意的是，由于DFT计算O2结合能时存在已知误差，实际的空位形成能可能略高于研究中报告的值。然而，这并不影响不同表面之间的相对比较或关于二氧化铈催化行为的整体结论。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen of the catalyst oxidizes the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen or another oxidizing agent.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the catalyst surface, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the catalyst can participate in oxidation reactions.

The significance of ΔEv is highlighted in the context of ceria (CeO2) catalysts. The relatively low vacancy formation energies of ceria surfaces make them favorable for catalytic reactions, especially at high temperatures like those in automotive exhausts. This property is consistent with ceria's known catalytic behavior.

Moreover, the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions is determined by the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Different crystal facets of the same oxide can have different ΔEv values, leading to varying catalytic activities. This understanding is crucial for developing and optimizing new catalysts, as it allows for the rational design of catalysts with specific surface structures that promote the desired reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，催化剂的表面氧会氧化反应物，在催化剂表面创造一个氧空位。然后，这个空位会被气相氧或其他氧化剂重新填充。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表示从催化剂表面移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为创造氧空位越容易，催化剂就越容易参与氧化反应。

ΔEv的重要性在氧化铈（CeO2）催化剂的背景下得到了突出体现。氧化铈表面相对较低的空位形成能使其有利于催化反应，特别是在汽车排气等高温环境下。这一特性与氧化铈已知的催化行为一致。

此外，催化反应的表面敏感性由氧空位形成能决定。同一氧化物的不同晶面可能具有不同的ΔEv值，导致不同的催化活性。这种理解对于开发和优化新催化剂至关重要，因为它允许合理设计具有特定表面结构的催化剂，以促进所需的反应。

[2] "Vacancy formation energies will also be influenced by the value of U; however, testing of U values from 17 eV,5 shows that too small a value of U leads to the wrong description of the atomic and electronic structure of reduced ceria and the vacancy formation and reaction energies so computed will be influenced by this error."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly mentioned in the given literature. However, the text discusses the importance of oxygen vacancy formation in ceria-catalyzed oxidation reactions, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature indicates that:

1. Lower vacancy formation energies lead to more favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, especially at high temperatures like those in automotive exhausts. This contributes to the catalytic behavior of ceria.

2. The vacancy formation energy determines the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions. Different surfaces of ceria (e.g., (111), (110), (100)) have different vacancy formation energies, which affects their catalytic activity.

3. The stability of vacancy sites is driven by atomic relaxations, rather than the stability of the pure surface.

4. Accurate calculation of vacancy formation energies is critical for understanding and predicting catalytic behavior. The literature discusses the challenges in calculating these energies accurately using density functional theory (DFT) methods.

In summary, while not explicitly discussing the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the literature emphasizes the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energies in determining the catalytic properties of ceria surfaces, which is consistent with this mechanism's principles.

虽然文献中没有明确提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但它讨论了氧空位形成在二氧化铈催化氧化反应中的重要性，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制的一个关键方面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。文献指出：

1. 较低的空位形成能量导致氧空位的形成更加有利，特别是在汽车尾气等高温环境下。这有助于二氧化铈的催化行为。

2. 空位形成能量决定了催化反应的表面敏感性。二氧化铈的不同表面（如(111)，(110)，(100)）具有不同的空位形成能量，这影响了它们的催化活性。

3. 空位位点的稳定性是由原子弛豫驱动的，而不是纯表面的稳定性。

4. 准确计算空位形成能量对于理解和预测催化行为至关重要。文献讨论了使用密度泛函理论（DFT）方法准确计算这些能量的挑战。

总之，虽然没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文献强调了氧空位形成能量在决定二氧化铈表面催化性质方面的重要性，这与该机制的原理一致。
