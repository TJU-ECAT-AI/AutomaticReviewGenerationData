[1] "Knowledge of the mechanism of these reactions, their energetics and any surface sensitivity would be of great help in developing and optimising new ceria-containing catalysts."

[2] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT."

[3] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the surface oxygen of the catalyst oxidizes the reactant, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen or another oxidizing agent.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the catalyst surface, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more readily the catalyst can participate in oxidation reactions.

The significance of ΔEv is highlighted in the context of ceria (CeO2) catalysts. The relatively low vacancy formation energies of ceria surfaces make them favorable for catalytic reactions, especially at high temperatures like those in automotive exhausts. This property is consistent with ceria's known catalytic behavior.

Moreover, the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions is determined by the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Different crystal facets of the same oxide can have different ΔEv values, leading to varying catalytic activities. This understanding is crucial for developing and optimizing new catalysts, as it allows for the rational design of catalysts with specific surface structures that promote the desired reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，催化剂的表面氧会氧化反应物，在催化剂表面创造一个氧空位。然后，这个空位会被气相氧或其他氧化剂重新填充。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表示从催化剂表面移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为创造氧空位越容易，催化剂就越容易参与氧化反应。

ΔEv的重要性在氧化铈（CeO2）催化剂的背景下得到了突出体现。氧化铈表面相对较低的空位形成能使其有利于催化反应，特别是在汽车排气等高温环境下。这一特性与氧化铈已知的催化行为一致。

此外，催化反应的表面敏感性由氧空位形成能决定。同一氧化物的不同晶面可能具有不同的ΔEv值，导致不同的催化活性。这种理解对于开发和优化新催化剂至关重要，因为它允许合理设计具有特定表面结构的催化剂，以促进所需的反应。
