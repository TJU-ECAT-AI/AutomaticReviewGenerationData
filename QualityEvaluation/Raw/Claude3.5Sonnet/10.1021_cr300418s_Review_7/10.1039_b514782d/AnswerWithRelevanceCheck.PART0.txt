          [1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis. However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support. In particular, the reduction of ceria surfaces provides oxygen atoms so that carbon monoxide can be oxidised to CO2."

[2] "The vacancy formation energies reported will be affected by known errors in the binding energy of O2 calculated using DFT. This overstabilises O2 and the present vacancy formation energies are thus an underestimation."

[3] "The magnitude of the vacancy formation energies in Table 1 is such that at the high temperatures present in an automotive exhaust, formation of oxygen vacancies will be relatively favourable, compared to other oxides, such as MgO. This is consistent with the known catalytic behaviour of ceria."

[4] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."

[5] "Knowledge of the mechanism of these reactions, their energetics and any surface sensitivity would be of great help in developing and optimising new ceria-containing catalysts."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reduction of the oxide surface through the formation of oxygen vacancies, which then provide reactive oxygen atoms for the oxidation of adsorbed molecules. In the case of ceria (CeO2), this mechanism is evident in the oxidation of carbon monoxide to CO2.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, making the surface more reactive for oxidation reactions. The study shows that ceria has relatively favorable vacancy formation energies at high temperatures, which explains its effectiveness as a catalyst in automotive exhaust systems.

The significance of ΔEv is twofold:

1. Catalytic activity: Lower vacancy formation energies generally lead to higher catalytic activity because it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

2. Oxidizing ability: The vacancy formation energy is directly related to the oxide's ability to donate oxygen for the oxidation reaction. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide can more readily provide oxygen, enhancing its oxidizing ability.

The surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions on ceria is determined by the oxygen vacancy formation energy, rather than the stability of the pure surface. This means that surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies are likely to be more catalytically active, even if they are not the most stable surfaces overall.

It's important to note that the actual vacancy formation energies may be underestimated in the study due to limitations in the DFT calculations. However, the relative differences between surfaces and the overall trends in catalytic activity are still valid and consistent with experimental observations of ceria's catalytic behavior.

Understanding the relationship between vacancy formation energies and catalytic activity is crucial for developing and optimizing new ceria-containing catalysts, as it allows for the rational design of catalysts with specific surface structures that promote the desired reactions.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及通过形成氧空位来还原氧化物表面，然后这些氧空位为吸附分子的氧化提供反应性氧原子。对于二氧化铈（CeO2）来说，这种机制在一氧化碳被氧化成二氧化碳的过程中很明显。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位可以更容易形成，使表面在氧化反应中更具反应性。研究表明，在汽车尾气中典型的高温下，二氧化铈具有相对有利的空位形成能，这解释了它在汽车尾气系统中作为催化剂的有效性。

ΔEv的重要性体现在两个方面：

1. 催化活性：较低的空位形成能量通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为更容易创建氧空位，而氧空位对Mars-van Krevelen机制至关重要。

2. 氧化能力：空位形成能量直接与氧化物提供氧气进行氧化反应的能力有关。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物可以更容易地提供氧气，从而增强其氧化能力。

二氧化铈上催化反应的表面敏感性是由氧空位形成能决定的，而不是纯表面的稳定性。这意味着具有较低空位形成能的表面可能具有更高的催化活性，即使它们不是整体上最稳定的表面。

需要注意的是，由于DFT计算的限制，研究中的实际空位形成能可能被低估。然而，表面之间的相对差异和催化活性的整体趋势仍然有效，并与二氧化铈催化行为的实验观察一致。

理解空位形成能与催化活性之间的关系对于开发和优化新的含二氧化铈催化剂至关重要，因为它允许合理设计具有特定表面结构的催化剂，以促进所需的反应。
