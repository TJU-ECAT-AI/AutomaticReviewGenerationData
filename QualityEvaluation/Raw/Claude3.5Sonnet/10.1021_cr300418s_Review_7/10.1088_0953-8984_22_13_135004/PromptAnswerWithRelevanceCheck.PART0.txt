[1] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."

[2] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in doped ceria is given by (for the example of the (111) surface)"

[3] "To investigate if the compensated defect formed when 2La
Ce +
O·
O holes are accompanied by a single oxygen vacancy, which
is the classical defect compensation mechanism, is more
stable than the uncompensated defect, we investigate two 2La
dopants incorporated into the ceria surfaces and the formation
of an oxygen vacancy."

[4] "All oxygen vacancies show an energy cost, while that of dopant
vacancy distribution I is the lowest, at 0.90 eV. These energies
do indicate that an oxygen vacancy will not necessarily form
to compensate for the formation of the electronic hole state. At
the same time, a formation energy of 0.90 eV is much reduced
over the undoped surface (computed to be 2.60 eV [12])
and suggests that formation of this oxygen vacancy will be
enhanced over the undoped surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria surfaces, which is crucial for understanding catalytic oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. In this study, the authors calculate oxygen vacancy formation energies for different ceria surfaces. For the undoped (110) surface, ΔEv is computed to be 1.18 eV. When doped with La, the formation energy decreases significantly. On the La-doped (111) surface, the lowest ΔEv is 0.90 eV, which is much lower than the 2.60 eV for the undoped surface.

This reduction in oxygen vacancy formation energy is significant because it suggests that oxygen vacancies will form more easily on the doped surface compared to the undoped surface. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies generally indicates enhanced catalytic activity, as these vacancies often serve as active sites for oxidation reactions. The lower ΔEv also implies a higher oxidizing ability of the surface, as it can more readily release oxygen for reactions.

However, the study notes that even with the reduced formation energy, there is still an energy cost to form oxygen vacancies in the La-doped ceria surfaces. This indicates that while vacancy formation is enhanced, it may not occur spontaneously under all conditions. The balance between vacancy formation and stability of the surface structure likely plays a role in determining the overall catalytic performance of the material.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供了与氧空位形成相关的重要信息，这对理解催化氧化反应至关重要。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。在这项研究中，作者计算了不同二氧化铈表面的氧空位形成能。对于未掺杂的(110)表面，ΔEv计算值为1.18 eV。当掺杂La后，形成能显著降低。在La掺杂的(111)表面上，最低ΔEv为0.90 eV，远低于未掺杂表面的2.60 eV。

氧空位形成能的这种降低非常重要，因为它表明在掺杂表面上形成氧空位比在未掺杂表面上更容易。氧空位形成更容易通常表明催化活性增强，因为这些空位常常作为氧化反应的活性位点。较低的ΔEv还意味着表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。

然而，研究指出，即使形成能降低，在La掺杂的二氧化铈表面上形成氧空位仍然需要能量成本。这表明虽然空位形成得到增强，但在所有条件下可能不会自发发生。空位形成与表面结构稳定性之间的平衡可能在决定材料的整体催化性能中起着重要作用。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the document does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature indicates that lower oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the reactivity of the oxide surface. Specifically for ceria, the oxygen vacancy formation energies increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111), suggesting that the (110) surface would be more reactive.

The document discusses how doping ceria with lanthanum affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy. For the La-doped ceria (111) surface, the lowest oxygen vacancy formation energy is calculated to be 0.90 eV, which is significantly lower than the 2.60 eV for the undoped surface. This reduction in formation energy suggests that oxygen vacancies will form more easily on the doped surface, potentially enhancing its catalytic activity.

While the literature doesn't directly address the oxidizing ability of the surface, the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy in the doped ceria implies that it would be easier for the surface to participate in oxidation reactions, as the energy barrier for releasing lattice oxygen is reduced. This could lead to improved catalytic performance in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在给定的文献中并没有被明确讨论。然而，该文档确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这是氧化物催化氧化反应中Mars-van Krevelen机制的一个关键方面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义。文献表明，较低的氧空位形成能会增强氧化物表面的反应活性。具体到氧化铈，氧空位形成能按(110) < (100) < (111)的顺序增加，这表明(110)表面可能更具反应性。

该文档讨论了用镧掺杂氧化铈如何影响氧空位形成能。对于镧掺杂的氧化铈(111)表面，计算得出的最低氧空位形成能为0.90 eV，这比未掺杂表面的2.60 eV低得多。这种形成能的降低表明，在掺杂表面上氧空位将更容易形成，可能会增强其催化活性。

虽然文献没有直接讨论表面的氧化能力，但掺杂氧化铈中较低的氧空位形成能意味着表面参与氧化反应会更容易，因为释放晶格氧的能量障碍降低了。这可能会导致按照Mars-van Krevelen机制进行的氧化反应中催化性能的改善。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does highlight the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

The literature suggests that lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is associated with higher reactivity and catalytic activity of oxide surfaces. Specifically for ceria, the (110) surface has the lowest oxygen vacancy formation energy, followed by (100) and then (111). This implies that the (110) surface would be more reactive and have higher catalytic activity compared to the other surfaces.

The text also mentions that lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria is a potential means of enhancing its reactivity. This indicates that ΔEv plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

While not directly addressing the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, these insights suggest that easier formation of oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) would facilitate the oxidation-reduction cycle typical of this mechanism, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但确实强调了氧空位形成能在决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性。

文献表明，较低的氧空位形成能（ΔEv）与氧化物表面的更高反应性和催化活性相关。特别是对于氧化铈，(110)表面具有最低的氧空位形成能，其次是(100)和(111)。这意味着(110)表面比其他表面具有更高的反应性和催化活性。

文本还提到，降低氧化铈的氧空位形成能是提高其反应性的一种潜在方法。这表明ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

虽然没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但这些见解表明，更容易形成氧空位（较低的ΔEv）将有助于该机制典型的氧化还原循环，可能导致催化性能的改善。

[1] "In each of these areas, the formation (and migration) of oxygen vacancies plays a key role. Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[2] "Given that the (111) surface is the most stable surface of bulk ceria [11] and is predominant in nanoparticles, it is worth investigating how the reactivity of this surface can be enhanced. To briefly recall, the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of enhancing the reactivity."

[3] "We compute that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can be present."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is crucial for understanding oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature indicates that ceria has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which is attributed to the ease with which cerium can change its oxidation state from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This property makes ceria an active material in catalytic reactions.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct relationship to the reactivity of the oxide surface. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy generally leads to enhanced reactivity. This is evidenced by the fact that different surfaces of ceria have different oxygen vacancy formation energies, with the (110) surface having the lowest energy and thus being more reactive than the (111) surface.

The text also suggests that doping ceria with other elements, such as lanthanum, can further reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy. For La-doped ceria, the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy is reduced to 0.90 eV on the (111) surface and 0.64 eV on the (110) surface, which is significantly lower than in undoped ceria. This reduction in vacancy formation energy is expected to enhance the catalytic activity of the material.

In summary, while the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly addressed, the literature emphasizes the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy in determining the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces. Lower ΔEv values generally correspond to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability, making materials like ceria and its doped variants particularly interesting for catalytic applications.

虽然文献中没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这对理解氧化物催化的氧化反应至关重要。

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，氧空位形成能（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。文献指出，氧化铈具有相对较小的氧空位形成能，这归因于铈易于从Ce4+变为Ce3+的氧化态。这一特性使氧化铈成为催化反应中的活性材料。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物表面反应活性直接相关。较低的氧空位形成能通常会导致更高的反应活性。这一点从氧化铈不同表面具有不同的氧空位形成能得到证实，其中(110)表面具有最低的能量，因此比(111)表面更具反应性。

文献还表明，用其他元素（如镧）掺杂氧化铈可以进一步降低氧空位形成能。对于镧掺杂的氧化铈，在(111)表面形成氧空位所需的能量降低到0.90 eV，在(110)表面降低到0.64 eV，这比未掺杂的氧化铈显著降低。这种空位形成能的降低预计将增强材料的催化活性。

总之，虽然没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文献强调了氧空位形成能在决定氧化物表面催化性质中的重要性。较低的ΔEv值通常对应于更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，使得氧化铈及其掺杂变体在催化应用中特别有趣。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the document does emphasize the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces, particularly for ceria.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy generally corresponds to higher reactivity and catalytic activity.

2. The ease of forming oxygen vacancies is related to the ability of the metal cation (in this case, cerium) to change its oxidation state.

3. The structure of the surface and the relative oxygen vacancy formation energy contribute to the different reactivities observed for various crystal faces of ceria.

4. Doping with other metal cations can enhance the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria.

5. The oxygen vacancy formation energy can vary depending on the surface structure and computational methods used, as exemplified by the difference in values obtained for the (110) surface with and without certain computational corrections.

These points suggest that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is a crucial factor in determining the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces, particularly for oxidation reactions that may follow a Mars-van Krevelen-like mechanism.

氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 较低的氧空位形成能通常对应于较高的反应性和催化活性。

2. 形成氧空位的容易程度与金属阳离子（在本例中为铈）改变其氧化态的能力有关。

3. 表面结构和相对氧空位形成能有助于解释氧化铈不同晶面上观察到的不同反应活性。

4. 用其他金属阳离子掺杂可以增强氧化铈的氧空位形成能和反应活性。

5. 氧空位形成能可能因表面结构和所使用的计算方法而异，这一点由(110)表面在有无某些计算校正时获得的不同数值所例证。

这些要点表明，氧空位形成能是决定氧化物表面催化性能的关键因素，特别是对于可能遵循类Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化反应。
