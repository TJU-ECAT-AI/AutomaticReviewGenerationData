[1] "The origin of the different relativities to CO was attributed to the structure of the surface and the relative oxygen vacancy formation energy [9]."

[2] "Given that the (111) surface is the most stable surface of bulk ceria [11] and is predominant in nanoparticles, it is worth investigating how the reactivity of this surface can be enhanced. To briefly recall, the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of enhancing the reactivity."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does highlight the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces.

The literature suggests that lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is associated with higher reactivity and catalytic activity of oxide surfaces. Specifically for ceria, the (110) surface has the lowest oxygen vacancy formation energy, followed by (100) and then (111). This implies that the (110) surface would be more reactive and have higher catalytic activity compared to the other surfaces.

The text also mentions that lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria is a potential means of enhancing its reactivity. This indicates that ΔEv plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

While not directly addressing the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, these insights suggest that easier formation of oxygen vacancies (lower ΔEv) would facilitate the oxidation-reduction cycle typical of this mechanism, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但确实强调了氧空位形成能在决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性。

文献表明，较低的氧空位形成能（ΔEv）与氧化物表面的更高反应性和催化活性相关。特别是对于氧化铈，(110)表面具有最低的氧空位形成能，其次是(100)和(111)。这意味着(110)表面比其他表面具有更高的反应性和催化活性。

文本还提到，降低氧化铈的氧空位形成能是提高其反应性的一种潜在方法。这表明ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。

虽然没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但这些见解表明，更容易形成氧空位（较低的ΔEv）将有助于该机制典型的氧化还原循环，可能导致催化性能的改善。
