[1] "In each of these areas, the formation (and migration) of oxygen vacancies plays a key role. Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[2] "Given that the (111) surface is the most stable surface of bulk ceria [11] and is predominant in nanoparticles, it is worth investigating how the reactivity of this surface can be enhanced. To briefly recall, the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of enhancing the reactivity."

[3] "We compute that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can be present."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is crucial for understanding oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature indicates that ceria has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which is attributed to the ease with which cerium can change its oxidation state from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This property makes ceria an active material in catalytic reactions.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct relationship to the reactivity of the oxide surface. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy generally leads to enhanced reactivity. This is evidenced by the fact that different surfaces of ceria have different oxygen vacancy formation energies, with the (110) surface having the lowest energy and thus being more reactive than the (111) surface.

The text also suggests that doping ceria with other elements, such as lanthanum, can further reduce the oxygen vacancy formation energy. For La-doped ceria, the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy is reduced to 0.90 eV on the (111) surface and 0.64 eV on the (110) surface, which is significantly lower than in undoped ceria. This reduction in vacancy formation energy is expected to enhance the catalytic activity of the material.

In summary, while the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not directly addressed, the literature emphasizes the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy in determining the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces. Lower ΔEv values generally correspond to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability, making materials like ceria and its doped variants particularly interesting for catalytic applications.

虽然文献中没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这对理解氧化物催化的氧化反应至关重要。

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，氧空位形成能（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。文献指出，氧化铈具有相对较小的氧空位形成能，这归因于铈易于从Ce4+变为Ce3+的氧化态。这一特性使氧化铈成为催化反应中的活性材料。

ΔEv的重要性在于它与氧化物表面反应活性直接相关。较低的氧空位形成能通常会导致更高的反应活性。这一点从氧化铈不同表面具有不同的氧空位形成能得到证实，其中(110)表面具有最低的能量，因此比(111)表面更具反应性。

文献还表明，用其他元素（如镧）掺杂氧化铈可以进一步降低氧空位形成能。对于镧掺杂的氧化铈，在(111)表面形成氧空位所需的能量降低到0.90 eV，在(110)表面降低到0.64 eV，这比未掺杂的氧化铈显著降低。这种空位形成能的降低预计将增强材料的催化活性。

总之，虽然没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文献强调了氧空位形成能在决定氧化物表面催化性质中的重要性。较低的ΔEv值通常对应于更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，使得氧化铈及其掺杂变体在催化应用中特别有趣。
