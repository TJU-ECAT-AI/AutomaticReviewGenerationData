[1] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."

[2] "The origin of the different relativities to CO was attributed to the structure of the surface and the relative oxygen vacancy formation energy [9]."

[3] "Recent experimental work has shown that many metal dopants enhance the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria."

[4] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the document does emphasize the importance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces, particularly for ceria.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because:

1. Lower oxygen vacancy formation energy generally corresponds to higher reactivity and catalytic activity.

2. The ease of forming oxygen vacancies is related to the ability of the metal cation (in this case, cerium) to change its oxidation state.

3. The structure of the surface and the relative oxygen vacancy formation energy contribute to the different reactivities observed for various crystal faces of ceria.

4. Doping with other metal cations can enhance the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria.

5. The oxygen vacancy formation energy can vary depending on the surface structure and computational methods used, as exemplified by the difference in values obtained for the (110) surface with and without certain computational corrections.

These points suggest that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is a crucial factor in determining the catalytic properties of oxide surfaces, particularly for oxidation reactions that may follow a Mars-van Krevelen-like mechanism.

该文献中并未明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制。然而，文档确实强调了氧空位形成能(ΔEv)在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性，特别是对于氧化铈而言。

氧空位形成所需的能量(ΔEv)在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义，原因如下：

1. 较低的氧空位形成能通常对应于较高的反应性和催化活性。

2. 形成氧空位的容易程度与金属阳离子（在本例中为铈）改变其氧化态的能力有关。

3. 表面结构和相对氧空位形成能有助于解释氧化铈不同晶面上观察到的不同反应活性。

4. 用其他金属阳离子掺杂可以增强氧化铈的氧空位形成能和反应活性。

5. 氧空位形成能可能因表面结构和所使用的计算方法而异，这一点由(110)表面在有无某些计算校正时获得的不同数值所例证。

这些要点表明，氧空位形成能是决定氧化物表面催化性能的关键因素，特别是对于可能遵循类Mars-van Krevelen机制的氧化反应。
