[1] "To briefly recall, the oxygen vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces of ceria increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111) [12] and thus lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energy of ceria should be a means of enhancing the reactivity."

[2] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in doped ceria is given by (for the example of the (111) surface)
Evac = [E(La0.016Ce1.984O1.992) + E(1/2O2)] - E(La0.016Ce1.984O2)"

[3] "All oxygen vacancies show an energy cost, while that of dopant vacancy distribution I is the lowest, at 0.90 eV. These energies do indicate that an oxygen vacancy will not necessarily form to compensate for the formation of the electronic hole state. At the same time, a formation energy of 0.90 eV is much reduced over the undoped surface (computed to be 2.60 eV [12]) and suggests that formation of this oxygen vacancy will be enhanced over the undoped surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the document does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The literature indicates that lower oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the reactivity of the oxide surface. Specifically for ceria, the oxygen vacancy formation energies increase in the order (110) < (100) < (111), suggesting that the (110) surface would be more reactive.

The document discusses how doping ceria with lanthanum affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy. For the La-doped ceria (111) surface, the lowest oxygen vacancy formation energy is calculated to be 0.90 eV, which is significantly lower than the 2.60 eV for the undoped surface. This reduction in formation energy suggests that oxygen vacancies will form more easily on the doped surface, potentially enhancing its catalytic activity.

While the literature doesn't directly address the oxidizing ability of the surface, the lower oxygen vacancy formation energy in the doped ceria implies that it would be easier for the surface to participate in oxidation reactions, as the energy barrier for releasing lattice oxygen is reduced. This could lead to improved catalytic performance in oxidation reactions following the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在给定的文献中并没有被明确讨论。然而，该文档确实提供了关于氧化铈中氧空位形成的相关信息，这是氧化物催化氧化反应中Mars-van Krevelen机制的一个关键方面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义。文献表明，较低的氧空位形成能会增强氧化物表面的反应活性。具体到氧化铈，氧空位形成能按(110) < (100) < (111)的顺序增加，这表明(110)表面可能更具反应性。

该文档讨论了用镧掺杂氧化铈如何影响氧空位形成能。对于镧掺杂的氧化铈(111)表面，计算得出的最低氧空位形成能为0.90 eV，这比未掺杂表面的2.60 eV低得多。这种形成能的降低表明，在掺杂表面上氧空位将更容易形成，可能会增强其催化活性。

虽然文献没有直接讨论表面的氧化能力，但掺杂氧化铈中较低的氧空位形成能意味着表面参与氧化反应会更容易，因为释放晶格氧的能量障碍降低了。这可能会导致按照Mars-van Krevelen机制进行的氧化反应中催化性能的改善。
