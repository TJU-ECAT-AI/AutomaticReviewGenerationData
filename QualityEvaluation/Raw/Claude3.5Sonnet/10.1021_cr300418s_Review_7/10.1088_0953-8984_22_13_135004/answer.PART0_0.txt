[1] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."

O holes are accompanied by a single oxygen vacancy, which

[4] "All oxygen vacancies show an energy cost, while that of dopant
vacancy distribution I is the lowest, at 0.90 eV. These energies
do indicate that an oxygen vacancy will not necessarily form
to compensate for the formation of the electronic hole state. At
the same time, a formation energy of 0.90 eV is much reduced
over the undoped surface (computed to be 2.60 eV [12])

enhanced over the undoped surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text does provide relevant information about oxygen vacancy formation in ceria surfaces, which is crucial for understanding catalytic oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. In this study, the authors calculate oxygen vacancy formation energies for different ceria surfaces. For the undoped (110) surface, ΔEv is computed to be 1.18 eV. When doped with La, the formation energy decreases significantly. On the La-doped (111) surface, the lowest ΔEv is 0.90 eV, which is much lower than the 2.60 eV for the undoped surface.

This reduction in oxygen vacancy formation energy is significant because it suggests that oxygen vacancies will form more easily on the doped surface compared to the undoped surface. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies generally indicates enhanced catalytic activity, as these vacancies often serve as active sites for oxidation reactions. The lower ΔEv also implies a higher oxidizing ability of the surface, as it can more readily release oxygen for reactions.

However, the study notes that even with the reduced formation energy, there is still an energy cost to form oxygen vacancies in the La-doped ceria surfaces. This indicates that while vacancy formation is enhanced, it may not occur spontaneously under all conditions. The balance between vacancy formation and stability of the surface structure likely plays a role in determining the overall catalytic performance of the material.

虽然文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但提供了与氧空位形成相关的重要信息，这对理解催化氧化反应至关重要。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。在这项研究中，作者计算了不同二氧化铈表面的氧空位形成能。对于未掺杂的(110)表面，ΔEv计算值为1.18 eV。当掺杂La后，形成能显著降低。在La掺杂的(111)表面上，最低ΔEv为0.90 eV，远低于未掺杂表面的2.60 eV。

氧空位形成能的这种降低非常重要，因为它表明在掺杂表面上形成氧空位比在未掺杂表面上更容易。氧空位形成更容易通常表明催化活性增强，因为这些空位常常作为氧化反应的活性位点。较低的ΔEv还意味着表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。

然而，研究指出，即使形成能降低，在La掺杂的二氧化铈表面上形成氧空位仍然需要能量成本。这表明虽然空位形成得到增强，但在所有条件下可能不会自发发生。空位形成与表面结构稳定性之间的平衡可能在决定材料的整体催化性能中起着重要作用。
