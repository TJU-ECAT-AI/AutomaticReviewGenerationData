[1] "The goal of this study is to pinpoint how Zr doping affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy at the surface and to what extent this effect differs from the bulk."

[2] "Here, the vacancy formation energy (Evac) is calculated by Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab"

[3] "On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation energy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy is created next to the Zr ion (Evac is 2.35 eV for Vb)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text focuses on oxygen vacancy formation energy, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is highly significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen atoms to participate in oxidation reactions. The study shows that Zr doping of ceria reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy at the surface by about 20% or 0.52 eV when the vacancy is created next to a Zr ion. This suggests that Zr-doped ceria would have enhanced catalytic activity compared to pure ceria.

The lowered vacancy formation energy in Zr-doped ceria indicates that lattice oxygen is more readily available for oxidation reactions, potentially increasing the oxide's oxidizing ability. However, if the vacancy formation energy becomes too low, it could negatively impact the material's stability or ability to re-oxidize, which are also important factors in catalytic cycles.

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本重点关注氧空位形成能，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的一个关键方面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许晶格氧原子更容易被移除以参与氧化反应。研究表明，当在Zr离子附近创建空位时，Zr掺杂的氧化铈表面的氧空位形成能降低了约20%或0.52 eV。这表明Zr掺杂的氧化铈与纯氧化铈相比，可能具有更高的催化活性。

Zr掺杂氧化铈中降低的空位形成能表明晶格氧更容易参与氧化反应，可能会增加氧化物的氧化能力。然而，如果空位形成能变得过低，可能会对材料的稳定性或再氧化能力产生负面影响，这些因素在催化循环中也很重要。
