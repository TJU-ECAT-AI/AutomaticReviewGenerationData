The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen from the catalyst surface to oxidize the reactant, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove lattice oxygen, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity as the surface oxygen becomes more reactive. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable or lose its oxidizing power. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger binding of lattice oxygen, potentially resulting in lower catalytic activity but maintaining the oxide's oxidizing ability.

In this study, Zr doping of ceria was found to lower the oxygen vacancy formation energy at the surface by about 20% (0.52 eV) when the vacancy is created next to a Zr ion. This reduction in ΔEv suggests that Zr doping enhances the catalytic activity of the ceria surface by making lattice oxygen more readily available for oxidation reactions, while still maintaining sufficient stability of the oxide structure.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及从催化剂表面移除晶格氧以氧化反应物，随后通过气相氧补充氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明更容易移除晶格氧，这通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为表面氧变得更具反应性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或失去其氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv表明晶格氧结合更强，可能导致较低的催化活性，但保持氧化物的氧化能力。

在这项研究中，发现当在Zr离子附近创建空位时，Zr掺杂的氧化铈在表面的氧空位形成能降低了约20%（0.52 eV）。ΔEv的这种降低表明，Zr掺杂通过使晶格氧更容易用于氧化反应来增强氧化铈表面的催化活性，同时仍然保持氧化物结构的足够稳定性。
