[1] "Ceria plays very important roles in various catalytic reactions [1], for example, the water gas shift (WGS) reaction, CO oxidation reaction or automotive exhaust abatement reactions, soot removal reaction from diesel engines and other redox and electrochemical reactions."

[2] "The most critical role that ceria plays in three-way catalysts (TWCs) in automobiles [24] is to consume excess oxygen under fuel-lean conditions and to release oxygen under fuel-rich conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states, that is to say, ceria has an oxygen storage capacity (OSC)."

[3] "Here, the vacancy formation energy (Evac) is calculated by Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab"

[4] "The calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2(111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy, close to the corresponding DFT + U result of Nolan et al. (2.60 eV). On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation energy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy is created next to the Zr ion (Evac is 2.35 eV for Vb)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can be more easily created, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because:

1. Easier vacancy formation allows for more facile release of lattice oxygen to participate in oxidation reactions.
2. Lower ΔEv often corresponds to higher oxygen mobility within the catalyst, facilitating the redox processes.
3. Surfaces with lower ΔEv can more readily accommodate and release oxygen, enhancing their oxygen storage capacity (OSC).

However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become overly reducible, potentially compromising its stability or leading to excessive oxygen loss. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv balances reactivity with stability.

In the context of the study, Zr doping of ceria lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which explains the enhanced redox properties and catalytic activity of ceria-zirconia mixed oxides compared to pure ceria. This illustrates how modifying ΔEv through doping can be a strategy to tune catalytic performance in oxide catalysts operating via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在催化剂表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表示氧空位可以更容易形成，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为：

1. 更容易的空位形成允许晶格氧更容易释放参与氧化反应。
2. 较低的ΔEv通常对应于催化剂内部更高的氧移动性，促进氧化还原过程。
3. ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地吸收和释放氧，增强其氧存储能力（OSC）。

然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能变得过度可还原，可能会影响其稳定性或导致过度的氧损失。因此，最佳的ΔEv在反应性和稳定性之间取得平衡。

在这项研究中，锆掺杂氧化铈降低了氧空位形成能，这解释了铈锆混合氧化物相比纯氧化铈具有增强的氧化还原性质和催化活性。这说明了如何通过掺杂修改ΔEv可以作为一种策略来调节通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运作的氧化物催化剂的催化性能。
