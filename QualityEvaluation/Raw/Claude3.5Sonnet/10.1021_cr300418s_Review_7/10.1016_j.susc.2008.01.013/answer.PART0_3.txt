[1] "The formation of each oxygen vacancy results in the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the O vacancy."

[2] "Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab"

[3] "A positive value for Evac means that energy is needed to create an oxygen vacancy."

[4] "It is found that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is greatly facilitated at the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface close to the Zr centers, with a reduction of the formation energy by as much as 0.52 eV per vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can be more easily created, which facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions. This leads to higher catalytic activity. The study shows that Zr doping in ceria reduces the vacancy formation energy by up to 0.52 eV, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity.

However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide surface may become overly reducible, potentially limiting its oxidizing ability. The ideal catalyst should have a balanced ΔEv that allows for facile oxygen release while maintaining sufficient oxidizing power.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as a descriptor for catalyst performance. By tuning ΔEv through strategies like doping (as demonstrated with Zr in ceria), researchers can optimize oxide catalysts for specific oxidation reactions, balancing activity and oxidizing ability.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及从氧化物表面移除晶格氧以氧化反应物，然后由气相氧补充氧空位。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以更容易地形成，这有助于释放晶格氧进行氧化反应。这导致更高的催化活性。研究表明，在氧化铈中掺杂Zr可将空位形成能降低多达0.52 eV，这表明催化活性得到了提高。

然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物表面可能变得过于易还原，可能会限制其氧化能力。理想的催化剂应该具有平衡的ΔEv，既能方便氧的释放，又能保持足够的氧化能力。

ΔEv的重要性在于它作为催化剂性能描述符的作用。通过诸如掺杂（如在氧化铈中使用Zr所示）等策略调整ΔEv，研究人员可以针对特定的氧化反应优化氧化物催化剂，平衡活性和氧化能力。
