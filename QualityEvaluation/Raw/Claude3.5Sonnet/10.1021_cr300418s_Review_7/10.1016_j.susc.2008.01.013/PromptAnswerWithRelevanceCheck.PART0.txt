The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen from the catalyst surface to oxidize the reactant, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove lattice oxygen, which generally leads to higher catalytic activity as the surface oxygen becomes more reactive. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable or lose its oxidizing power. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger binding of lattice oxygen, potentially resulting in lower catalytic activity but maintaining the oxide's oxidizing ability.

In this study, Zr doping of ceria was found to lower the oxygen vacancy formation energy at the surface by about 20% (0.52 eV) when the vacancy is created next to a Zr ion. This reduction in ΔEv suggests that Zr doping enhances the catalytic activity of the ceria surface by making lattice oxygen more readily available for oxidation reactions, while still maintaining sufficient stability of the oxide structure.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及从催化剂表面移除晶格氧以氧化反应物，随后通过气相氧补充氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

较低的ΔEv表明更容易移除晶格氧，这通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为表面氧变得更具反应性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能变得不稳定或失去其氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv表明晶格氧结合更强，可能导致较低的催化活性，但保持氧化物的氧化能力。

在这项研究中，发现当在Zr离子附近创建空位时，Zr掺杂的氧化铈在表面的氧空位形成能降低了约20%（0.52 eV）。ΔEv的这种降低表明，Zr掺杂通过使晶格氧更容易用于氧化反应来增强氧化铈表面的催化活性，同时仍然保持氧化物结构的足够稳定性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the catalyst surface. In this process, an oxygen vacancy is created when a lattice oxygen atom oxidizes the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the catalyst surface, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a more easily removable oxygen is more reactive and can more readily participate in oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, it might lead to over-reduction of the catalyst, potentially degrading its performance.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A moderate ΔEv ensures that the oxide can release oxygen to oxidize reactants but also allows for the re-oxidation of the reduced catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle. 

In the context of the study, the Zr-doped ceria surface showed a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to the undoped surface, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity. This demonstrates how modifying the composition of oxide catalysts can tune their redox properties and potentially improve their catalytic performance in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及催化剂表面晶格氧的参与。在这个过程中，当晶格氧原子氧化反应物时，会产生一个氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv表明从催化剂表面移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为更容易移除的氧更具反应性，可以更容易地参与氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，可能会导致催化剂过度还原，潜在地降低其性能。

氧化物表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。适度的ΔEv确保氧化物可以释放氧来氧化反应物，但也允许还原后的催化剂重新氧化，完成催化循环。

在这项研究中，掺Zr的氧化铈表面相比未掺杂的表面显示出较低的氧空位形成能，表明催化活性增强。这证明了通过修改氧化物催化剂的组成可以调节其氧化还原性质，并可能提高其在氧化反应中的催化性能。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly discussed in the given literature. However, the text focuses on oxygen vacancy formation energy, which is a key aspect of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is highly significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it allows for easier removal of lattice oxygen atoms to participate in oxidation reactions. The study shows that Zr doping of ceria reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy at the surface by about 20% or 0.52 eV when the vacancy is created next to a Zr ion. This suggests that Zr-doped ceria would have enhanced catalytic activity compared to pure ceria.

The lowered vacancy formation energy in Zr-doped ceria indicates that lattice oxygen is more readily available for oxidation reactions, potentially increasing the oxide's oxidizing ability. However, if the vacancy formation energy becomes too low, it could negatively impact the material's stability or ability to re-oxidize, which are also important factors in catalytic cycles.

虽然给定的文献中没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制，但文本重点关注氧空位形成能，这是Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的一个关键方面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。较低的空位形成能通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它允许晶格氧原子更容易被移除以参与氧化反应。研究表明，当在Zr离子附近创建空位时，Zr掺杂的氧化铈表面的氧空位形成能降低了约20%或0.52 eV。这表明Zr掺杂的氧化铈与纯氧化铈相比，可能具有更高的催化活性。

Zr掺杂氧化铈中降低的空位形成能表明晶格氧更容易参与氧化反应，可能会增加氧化物的氧化能力。然而，如果空位形成能变得过低，可能会对材料的稳定性或再氧化能力产生负面影响，这些因素在催化循环中也很重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface to oxidize reactants, followed by the replenishment of the oxygen vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can be more easily created, which facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for oxidation reactions. This leads to higher catalytic activity. The study shows that Zr doping in ceria reduces the vacancy formation energy by up to 0.52 eV, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity.

However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide surface may become overly reducible, potentially limiting its oxidizing ability. The ideal catalyst should have a balanced ΔEv that allows for facile oxygen release while maintaining sufficient oxidizing power.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as a descriptor for catalyst performance. By tuning ΔEv through strategies like doping (as demonstrated with Zr in ceria), researchers can optimize oxide catalysts for specific oxidation reactions, balancing activity and oxidizing ability.

较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以更容易地形成，这有助于释放晶格氧进行氧化反应。这导致更高的催化活性。研究表明，在氧化铈中掺杂Zr可将空位形成能降低多达0.52 eV，这表明催化活性得到了提高。

然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物表面可能变得过于易还原，可能会限制其氧化能力。理想的催化剂应该具有平衡的ΔEv，既能方便氧的释放，又能保持足够的氧化能力。

ΔEv的重要性在于它作为催化剂性能描述符的作用。通过诸如掺杂（如在氧化铈中使用Zr所示）等策略调整ΔEv，研究人员可以针对特定的氧化反应优化氧化物催化剂，平衡活性和氧化能力。

[2] "The most critical role that ceria plays in three-way catalysts (TWCs) in automobiles [24] is to consume excess oxygen under fuel-lean conditions and to release oxygen under fuel-rich conditions via the facile conversion between Ce4+ and Ce3+ oxidation states, that is to say, ceria has an oxygen storage capacity (OSC)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide catalyst. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the catalyst surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can be more easily created, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because:

1. Easier vacancy formation allows for more facile release of lattice oxygen to participate in oxidation reactions.
2. Lower ΔEv often corresponds to higher oxygen mobility within the catalyst, facilitating the redox processes.
3. Surfaces with lower ΔEv can more readily accommodate and release oxygen, enhancing their oxygen storage capacity (OSC).

However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become overly reducible, potentially compromising its stability or leading to excessive oxygen loss. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv balances reactivity with stability.

In the context of the study, Zr doping of ceria lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy, which explains the enhanced redox properties and catalytic activity of ceria-zirconia mixed oxides compared to pure ceria. This illustrates how modifying ΔEv through doping can be a strategy to tune catalytic performance in oxide catalysts operating via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物催化剂中晶格氧的参与。在这个机制中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在催化剂表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv表示氧空位可以更容易形成，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为：

1. 更容易的空位形成允许晶格氧更容易释放参与氧化反应。
2. 较低的ΔEv通常对应于催化剂内部更高的氧移动性，促进氧化还原过程。
3. ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地吸收和释放氧，增强其氧存储能力（OSC）。

然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能变得过度可还原，可能会影响其稳定性或导致过度的氧损失。因此，最佳的ΔEv在反应性和稳定性之间取得平衡。

在这项研究中，锆掺杂氧化铈降低了氧空位形成能，这解释了铈锆混合氧化物相比纯氧化铈具有增强的氧化还原性质和催化活性。这说明了如何通过掺杂修改ΔEv可以作为一种策略来调节通过Mars-van Krevelen机制运作的氧化物催化剂的催化性能。
