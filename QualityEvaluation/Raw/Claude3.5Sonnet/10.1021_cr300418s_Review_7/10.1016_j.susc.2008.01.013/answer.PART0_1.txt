[1] "It is clear that in heterogeneous catalysis the redox character at the surface is of essential importance."

[2] "Here, the vacancy formation energy (Evac) is calculated by
Evac  Eslabvac  1=2EO2  Eslab"

[3] "The calculated value of Evac for the undoped CeO2(111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy, close to the corresponding DFT + U result of Nolan et al. (2.60 eV). On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation energy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy is created next to the Zr ion (Evac is 2.35 eV for Vb)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the catalyst surface. In this process, an oxygen vacancy is created when a lattice oxygen atom oxidizes the reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the catalyst surface, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because a more easily removable oxygen is more reactive and can more readily participate in oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, it might lead to over-reduction of the catalyst, potentially degrading its performance.

The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A moderate ΔEv ensures that the oxide can release oxygen to oxidize reactants but also allows for the re-oxidation of the reduced catalyst, completing the catalytic cycle. 

In the context of the study, the Zr-doped ceria surface showed a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to the undoped surface, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity. This demonstrates how modifying the composition of oxide catalysts can tune their redox properties and potentially improve their catalytic performance in oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及催化剂表面晶格氧的参与。在这个过程中，当晶格氧原子氧化反应物时，会产生一个氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv表明从催化剂表面移除氧更容易，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为更容易移除的氧更具反应性，可以更容易地参与氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv太低，可能会导致催化剂过度还原，潜在地降低其性能。

氧化物表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。适度的ΔEv确保氧化物可以释放氧来氧化反应物，但也允许还原后的催化剂重新氧化，完成催化循环。

在这项研究中，掺Zr的氧化铈表面相比未掺杂的表面显示出较低的氧空位形成能，表明催化活性增强。这证明了通过修改氧化物催化剂的组成可以调节其氧化还原性质，并可能提高其在氧化反应中的催化性能。
