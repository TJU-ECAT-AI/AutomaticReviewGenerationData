The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by using surface lattice oxygen as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies in the process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it relates directly to the ease with which the surface can provide oxygen for reactions. 

A lower ΔEv generally indicates that oxygen can be more readily removed from the surface, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be stable enough to maintain its structure during reactions. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the surface holds onto its oxygen more tightly, which could result in lower reactivity but potentially higher stability and selectivity in certain reactions.

Understanding the nature of oxygen vacancies, including their formation energies, is crucial for elucidating the roles of oxides like ceria in various applications. The study uses density-functional theory calculations to investigate the stability and formation energies of different types of oxygen vacancies, which can provide insights into the oxide's behavior in catalytic processes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过使用表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂来操作，这个过程中会创造氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义，因为它直接关系到表面提供氧气进行反应的难易程度。

较低的ΔEv通常表明氧气可以更容易地从表面移除，可能导致氧化反应的更高催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能不够稳定，无法在反应过程中维持其结构。相反，较高的ΔEv表明表面更牢固地保持其氧气，这可能导致反应性降低，但在某些反应中可能具有更高的稳定性和选择性。

理解氧空位的性质，包括它们的形成能量，对于阐明像氧化铈这样的氧化物在各种应用中的作用至关重要。该研究使用密度泛函理论计算来研究不同类型氧空位的稳定性和形成能量，这可以为氧化物在催化过程中的行为提供洞察。
