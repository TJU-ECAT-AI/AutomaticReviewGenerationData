The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves surface lattice oxygen acting as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial factor in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the surface oxygen is more reactive and easier to remove, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be stable enough to maintain its structure during reactions. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the surface oxygen is less reactive and harder to remove, which could result in lower catalytic activity but potentially better stability and selectivity in certain reactions. Understanding the nature of oxygen vacancies, including their formation energy, is therefore critical for elucidating the roles of oxides like ceria in various catalytic applications.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂，从而在氧化物表面创造氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv通常表明表面氧更具反应性且更容易移除，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能不够稳定，无法在反应过程中维持其结构。相反，较高的ΔEv表明表面氧反应性较低且更难移除，这可能导致较低的催化活性，但在某些反应中可能具有更好的稳定性和选择性。因此，理解氧空位的性质，包括它们的形成能量，对于阐明像氧化铈这样的氧化物在各种催化应用中的作用至关重要。
