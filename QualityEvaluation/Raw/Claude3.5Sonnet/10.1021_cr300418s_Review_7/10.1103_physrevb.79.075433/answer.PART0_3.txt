The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves surface lattice oxygen acting as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that oxygen can be more easily removed from the surface, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be stable enough to maintain its structure during reactions. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger oxygen binding, which may result in better oxidizing ability but could potentially limit the rate of oxygen removal and thus catalytic activity. Understanding the nature of oxygen vacancies and their formation energies is crucial for elucidating the roles of oxides like ceria in various catalytic applications.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂，从而在表面上创造氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧可以更容易地从表面移除，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能不够稳定，无法在反应过程中维持其结构。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧结合更强，这可能导致更好的氧化能力，但可能会限制氧移除的速率，从而限制催化活性。理解氧空位的性质及其形成能量对于阐明像氧化铈这样的氧化物在各种催化应用中的作用至关重要。
