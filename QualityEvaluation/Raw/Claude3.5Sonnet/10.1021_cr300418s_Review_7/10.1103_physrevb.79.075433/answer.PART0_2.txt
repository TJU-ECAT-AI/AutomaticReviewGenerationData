The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves surface lattice oxygen acting as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, which can enhance the catalytic activity as these vacancies often serve as active sites. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may reduce the oxidizing power of the surface. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger oxygen binding, which can increase the oxidizing ability of the surface but may limit vacancy formation and thus catalytic activity. Therefore, an optimal ΔEv value is crucial for balancing catalytic activity and oxidizing ability in oxide catalysts.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂，从而在氧化物表面创造氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧空位可以更容易形成，这可以增强催化活性，因为这些空位通常作为活性位点。然而，如果ΔEv太低，可能会降低表面的氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧结合更强，这可以增加表面的氧化能力，但可能限制空位形成，从而限制催化活性。因此，最佳的ΔEv值对于在氧化物催化剂中平衡催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。
