The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by using surface lattice oxygen as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it represents the stability of the oxygen vacancies. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies form more easily, which can enhance catalytic activity by providing more active sites. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may reduce the oxidizing ability of the surface as oxygen becomes too readily removed. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger binding of oxygen to the surface, which can increase oxidizing ability but may limit catalytic activity if vacancies become too difficult to form. Thus, an optimal ΔEv is crucial for balancing catalytic activity and oxidizing ability in oxide catalysts.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过使用表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂来运作，这在氧化物表面创造了氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义，因为它代表了氧空位的稳定性。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更容易形成，这可以通过提供更多活性位点来增强催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会降低表面的氧化能力，因为氧变得太容易被移除。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧与表面结合更强，这可以增加氧化能力，但如果空位变得太难形成，可能会限制催化活性。因此，最佳的ΔEv对于平衡氧化物催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves surface lattice oxygen acting as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial factor in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that the surface oxygen is more reactive and easier to remove, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be stable enough to maintain its structure during reactions. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the surface oxygen is less reactive and harder to remove, which could result in lower catalytic activity but potentially better stability and selectivity in certain reactions. Understanding the nature of oxygen vacancies, including their formation energy, is therefore critical for elucidating the roles of oxides like ceria in various catalytic applications.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂，从而在氧化物表面创造氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv通常表明表面氧更具反应性且更容易移除，可能导致更高的催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能不够稳定，无法在反应过程中维持其结构。相反，较高的ΔEv表明表面氧反应性较低且更难移除，这可能导致较低的催化活性，但在某些反应中可能具有更好的稳定性和选择性。因此，理解氧空位的性质，包括它们的形成能量，对于阐明像氧化铈这样的氧化物在各种催化应用中的作用至关重要。

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates that oxygen vacancies can form more easily, which can enhance the catalytic activity as these vacancies often serve as active sites. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may reduce the oxidizing power of the surface. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger oxygen binding, which can increase the oxidizing ability of the surface but may limit vacancy formation and thus catalytic activity.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by using surface lattice oxygen as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies in the process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it relates directly to the ease with which the surface can provide oxygen for reactions. 

A lower ΔEv generally indicates that oxygen can be more readily removed from the surface, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may not be stable enough to maintain its structure during reactions. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the surface holds onto its oxygen more tightly, which could result in lower reactivity but potentially higher stability and selectivity in certain reactions.

Understanding the nature of oxygen vacancies, including their formation energies, is crucial for elucidating the roles of oxides like ceria in various applications. The study uses density-functional theory calculations to investigate the stability and formation energies of different types of oxygen vacancies, which can provide insights into the oxide's behavior in catalytic processes.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过使用表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂来操作，这个过程中会创造氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面都具有重要意义，因为它直接关系到表面提供氧气进行反应的难易程度。

较低的ΔEv通常表明氧气可以更容易地从表面移除，可能导致氧化反应的更高催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv太低，氧化物可能不够稳定，无法在反应过程中维持其结构。相反，较高的ΔEv表明表面更牢固地保持其氧气，这可能导致反应性降低，但在某些反应中可能具有更高的稳定性和选择性。

理解氧空位的性质，包括它们的形成能量，对于阐明像氧化铈这样的氧化物在各种应用中的作用至关重要。该研究使用密度泛函理论计算来研究不同类型氧空位的稳定性和形成能量，这可以为氧化物在催化过程中的行为提供洞察。
