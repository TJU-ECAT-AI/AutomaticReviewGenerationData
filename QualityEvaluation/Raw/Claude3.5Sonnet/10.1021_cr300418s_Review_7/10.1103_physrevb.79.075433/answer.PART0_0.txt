The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by using surface lattice oxygen as an oxidant for adsorbates, which creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it represents the stability of the oxygen vacancies. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies form more easily, which can enhance catalytic activity by providing more active sites. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may reduce the oxidizing ability of the surface as oxygen becomes too readily removed. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests stronger binding of oxygen to the surface, which can increase oxidizing ability but may limit catalytic activity if vacancies become too difficult to form. Thus, an optimal ΔEv is crucial for balancing catalytic activity and oxidizing ability in oxide catalysts.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过使用表面晶格氧作为吸附物的氧化剂来运作，这在氧化物表面创造了氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都具有重要意义，因为它代表了氧空位的稳定性。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更容易形成，这可以通过提供更多活性位点来增强催化活性。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会降低表面的氧化能力，因为氧变得太容易被移除。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧与表面结合更强，这可以增加氧化能力，但如果空位变得太难形成，可能会限制催化活性。因此，最佳的ΔEv对于平衡氧化物催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。
