[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

[2] "Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxygen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy."

[3] "We use ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the dependence of rate-determining steps and the overall reaction mechanism on catalytic operating conditions including temperature and partial pressure of reactants and products."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, surface oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for reaction. This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to CeO2(1 1 1) and correspondingly shows a lower methane activation barrier.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv, as surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable under reaction conditions.

The overall catalytic performance is influenced by the balance between vacancy formation and refilling rates, which depend on reaction conditions such as temperature and partial pressures of reactants and products. Understanding these relationships allows for the design of more effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在此机理中，表面氧与吸附物种反应，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它有利于晶格氧的释放参与反应。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，与CeO2(1 1 1)相比，它具有较低的氧空位形成能，相应地表现出较低的甲烷活化能垒。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关，因为具有较低空位形成能的表面可以更容易地提供氧用于氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能在反应条件下变得不稳定。

整体催化性能受空位形成和填充速率平衡的影响，这些速率取决于反应条件，如温度和反应物及产物的分压。理解这些关系有助于设计更有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应。

This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to CeO2(1 1 1) and consequently shows a lower methane activation barrier.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A surface with a lower ΔEv can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions, potentially leading to higher oxidation rates. However, if ΔEv is too low, it may result in over-oxidation of reactants or products, potentially reducing selectivity.

In the context of methane oxidation, the cycling of Pd oxidation states (between Pd0/Pd2+ or Pd2+/Pd4+) during the reaction turnover illustrates the dynamic nature of the catalyst surface and the importance of redox processes in the overall mechanism. This cycling, coupled with the formation and filling of oxygen vacancies, highlights the complexity of the catalytic process and the critical role of the oxide surface in facilitating the reaction.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及催化剂表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机理中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在表面产生氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它有利于晶格氧的释放以进行氧化反应。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，它比CeO2(1 1 1)具有更低的氧空位形成能，因此表现出更低的甲烷活化能垒。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地提供氧用于氧化反应，可能导致更高的氧化速率。然而，如果ΔEv过低，可能会导致反应物或产物的过度氧化，可能降低选择性。

在甲烷氧化的背景下，Pd氧化态在反应周转过程中的循环（在Pd0/Pd2+或Pd2+/Pd4+之间）说明了催化剂表面的动态性质以及氧化还原过程在整个机理中的重要性。这种循环，加上氧空位的形成和填充，突出了催化过程的复杂性以及氧化物表面在促进反应中的关键作用。

These steps are crucial for completing the catalytic cycle and maintaining the catalyst's activity over time. The sequential consideration of these steps throughout the reaction mechanism, as opposed to treating them as final steps, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the oxidation process and the role of oxygen vacancies in catalysis.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, surface oxygen atoms react with adsorbed species and are then replenished by gas-phase oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, which can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst. This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to pure CeO2(1 1 1), correlating with its lower methane activation barrier and potentially higher catalytic activity.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its influence on:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally leads to higher catalytic activity as it facilitates the participation of lattice oxygen in reactions.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ease of oxygen removal from the surface (lower ΔEv) can enhance the oxide's ability to oxidize adsorbed species.

3. Reaction mechanism: ΔEv affects the likelihood of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism occurring versus other possible reaction pathways.

4. Catalyst stability: While a lower ΔEv can increase activity, it may also lead to faster degradation of the catalyst if oxygen vacancies are not efficiently refilled.

5. Oxygen mobility: Lower ΔEv often correlates with higher oxygen mobility in the lattice, which can be beneficial for catalytic processes.

Understanding and tuning ΔEv is therefore crucial in the design and optimization of oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机制中，表面氧原子与吸附物种反应，然后被气相氧补充。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧更容易，这可以增强催化剂的反应活性。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，与纯CeO2(1 1 1)相比，它具有较低的氧空位形成能，这与其较低的甲烷活化能垒相关，可能具有更高的催化活性。

ΔEv的重要性体现在其对以下方面的影响：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为它促进了晶格氧参与反应。

2. 氧化能力：表面氧的容易移除（较低的ΔEv）可以增强氧化物氧化吸附物种的能力。

3. 反应机制：ΔEv影响Mars-van Krevelen机制发生的可能性与其他可能的反应途径相比。

4. 催化剂稳定性：虽然较低的ΔEv可以增加活性，但如果氧空位不能有效填充，也可能导致催化剂更快降解。

5. 氧移动性：较低的ΔEv通常与晶格中更高的氧移动性相关，这对催化过程可能有益。

因此，理解和调节ΔEv对于氧化反应的氧化物催化剂的设计和优化至关重要。
