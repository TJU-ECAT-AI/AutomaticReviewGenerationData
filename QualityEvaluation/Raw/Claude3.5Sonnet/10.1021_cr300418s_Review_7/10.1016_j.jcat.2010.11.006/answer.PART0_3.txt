[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

[2] "Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxygen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy."

[3] "The consideration of product formation and vacancy filling sequentially throughout the mechanism can be contrasted with the approach of Knapp et al. [18]. Knapp et al. included all water formation energies at the final step and neglected vacancy filling in their analysis of the reaction energy diagram for methane oxidation over pure CeO2(1 1 1)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface. In this mechanism, surface oxygen reacts with adsorbed species to form products, creating oxygen vacancies on the surface. These vacancies are then refilled by gas-phase oxygen or bulk oxygen diffusion.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it facilitates the participation of lattice oxygen in the reaction. This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to CeO2(1 1 1), correlating with its lower methane activation barrier.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv. A surface with lower ΔEv can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, the strong oxidizing power may lead to over-oxidation of reactants or products, potentially reducing selectivity.

The sequential consideration of product formation and vacancy filling throughout the reaction mechanism, as opposed to including all water formation energies at the final step and neglecting vacancy filling, provides a more accurate representation of the catalytic cycle in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及催化剂表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机理中，表面氧与吸附物种反应形成产物，在表面上创造氧空位。这些空位随后被气相氧或体相氧扩散所填充。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它促进了晶格氧参与反应。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，与CeO2(1 1 1)相比，它具有较低的氧空位形成能，与其较低的甲烷活化能垒相关。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv影响。ΔEv较低的表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧。但是，如果ΔEv过低，强大的氧化能力可能导致反应物或产物过度氧化，可能降低选择性。

在整个反应机理中sequential考虑产物形成和空位填充，而不是在最后一步包括所有水形成能量并忽略空位填充，为氧化物催化的氧化反应提供了更准确的催化循环表示。
