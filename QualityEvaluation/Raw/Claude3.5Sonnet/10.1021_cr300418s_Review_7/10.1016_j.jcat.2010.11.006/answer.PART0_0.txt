[1] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

[2] "Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxygen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy."

[3] "We use ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the dependence of rate-determining steps and the overall reaction mechanism on catalytic operating conditions including temperature and partial pressure of reactants and products."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, surface oxygen reacts with the adsorbed species, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it facilitates the release of lattice oxygen for reaction. This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to CeO2(1 1 1) and correspondingly shows a lower methane activation barrier.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also related to ΔEv, as surfaces with lower vacancy formation energies can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions. However, if ΔEv is too low, the oxide may become unstable under reaction conditions.

The overall catalytic performance is influenced by the balance between vacancy formation and refilling rates, which depend on reaction conditions such as temperature and partial pressures of reactants and products. Understanding these relationships allows for the design of more effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在此机理中，表面氧与吸附物种反应，形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力都至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它有利于晶格氧的释放参与反应。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，与CeO2(1 1 1)相比，它具有较低的氧空位形成能，相应地表现出较低的甲烷活化能垒。

表面的氧化能力也与ΔEv有关，因为具有较低空位形成能的表面可以更容易地提供氧用于氧化反应。然而，如果ΔEv过低，氧化物可能在反应条件下变得不稳定。

整体催化性能受空位形成和填充速率平衡的影响，这些速率取决于反应条件，如温度和反应物及产物的分压。理解这些关系有助于设计更有效的氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应。
