[1] "We present a computational investigation, utilizing density functional theory, into methane complete oxidation over the CeO2(1 1 1), PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1), and PdO(1 0 0) surfaces, in comparison with CH activation on Pd metal surfaces."

[2] "The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

[3] "Water is formed by adsorption of H atoms on surface oxygen atoms followed by desorption of H2O(g) to leave a surface oxygen vacancy."

[4] "The consideration of product formation and vacancy filling sequentially throughout the mechanism can be contrasted with the approach of Knapp et al. [18]. Knapp et al. included all water formation energies at the final step and neglected vacancy filling in their analysis of the reaction energy diagram for methane oxidation over pure CeO2(1 1 1)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the catalyst surface. In this mechanism, surface oxygen atoms react with adsorbed species, creating oxygen vacancies that are subsequently refilled by gas-phase oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv generally indicates higher catalytic activity, as it facilitates the participation of lattice oxygen in the reaction. This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to pure CeO2(1 1 1), correlating with its lower methane activation barrier and thus higher activity.

The oxidizing ability of the surface is also influenced by ΔEv, as it affects the ease with which lattice oxygen can be removed and participate in oxidation reactions. Surfaces with lower ΔEv values tend to have stronger oxidizing capabilities.

The significance of ΔEv extends to the overall reaction mechanism, including product formation and vacancy refilling steps. These steps are crucial for completing the catalytic cycle and maintaining the catalyst's activity over time. The sequential consideration of these steps throughout the reaction mechanism, as opposed to treating them as final steps, provides a more comprehensive understanding of the oxidation process and the role of oxygen vacancies in catalysis.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及催化剂表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机制中，表面氧原子与吸附物种反应，产生氧空位，随后由气相氧重新填充。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性，因为它有利于晶格氧参与反应。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，与纯CeO2(1 1 1)相比，它具有较低的氧空位形成能，这与其较低的甲烷活化能垒相关，因此具有更高的活性。

表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响，因为它影响晶格氧被移除并参与氧化反应的难易程度。ΔEv值较低的表面往往具有更强的氧化能力。

ΔEv的重要性还延伸到整个反应机制，包括产物形成和空位填充步骤。这些步骤对于完成催化循环和维持催化剂的长期活性至关重要。在整个反应机制中sequential考虑这些步骤，而不是将它们作为最后步骤处理，可以更全面地理解氧化过程和氧空位在催化中的作用。
