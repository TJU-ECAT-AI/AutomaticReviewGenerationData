[1] "Our previous study used ab initio thermodynamics to evaluate the stability of different Pd species on CeO2(1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (1 0 0) surfaces. Under varying operating conditions, the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface is stable with respect to other single atom states of Pd on the CeO2(1 1 1) surface [13]. The oxygen vacancy formation energy on PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) is less endothermic than on CeO2(1 1 1), and the methane activation barrier is lower over PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) than over CeO2(1 1 1)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, surface oxygen atoms react with adsorbed species and are then replenished by gas-phase oxygen.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, which can enhance the reactivity of the catalyst. This is exemplified by the PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1) surface, which has a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy compared to pure CeO2(1 1 1), correlating with its lower methane activation barrier and potentially higher catalytic activity.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its influence on:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally leads to higher catalytic activity as it facilitates the participation of lattice oxygen in reactions.

2. Oxidizing ability: The ease of oxygen removal from the surface (lower ΔEv) can enhance the oxide's ability to oxidize adsorbed species.

3. Reaction mechanism: ΔEv affects the likelihood of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism occurring versus other possible reaction pathways.

4. Catalyst stability: While a lower ΔEv can increase activity, it may also lead to faster degradation of the catalyst if oxygen vacancies are not efficiently refilled.

5. Oxygen mobility: Lower ΔEv often correlates with higher oxygen mobility in the lattice, which can be beneficial for catalytic processes.

Understanding and tuning ΔEv is therefore crucial in the design and optimization of oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这种机制中，表面氧原子与吸附物种反应，然后被气相氧补充。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧更容易，这可以增强催化剂的反应活性。PdxCe1xO2(1 1 1)表面就是一个例子，与纯CeO2(1 1 1)相比，它具有较低的氧空位形成能，这与其较低的甲烷活化能垒相关，可能具有更高的催化活性。

ΔEv的重要性体现在其对以下方面的影响：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常会导致更高的催化活性，因为它促进了晶格氧参与反应。

2. 氧化能力：表面氧的容易移除（较低的ΔEv）可以增强氧化物氧化吸附物种的能力。

3. 反应机制：ΔEv影响Mars-van Krevelen机制发生的可能性与其他可能的反应途径相比。

4. 催化剂稳定性：虽然较低的ΔEv可以增加活性，但如果氧空位不能有效填充，也可能导致催化剂更快降解。

5. 氧移动性：较低的ΔEv通常与晶格中更高的氧移动性相关，这对催化过程可能有益。

因此，理解和调节ΔEv对于氧化反应的氧化物催化剂的设计和优化至关重要。
