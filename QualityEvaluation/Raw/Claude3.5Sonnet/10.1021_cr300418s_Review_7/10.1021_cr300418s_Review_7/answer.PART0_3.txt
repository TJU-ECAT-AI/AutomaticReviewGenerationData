[1] "It is widely accepted (224, 225) that most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (226) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies."

[2] "The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface). In most cases, the reoxidation of the surface is very fast, and therefore the rate-limiting step is the reaction of the reductant with the surface oxygen."

[3] "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction [...] where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."

[4] "Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller. However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The reductant (e.g., alkane, CO, H2) is oxidized by oxygen atoms from the oxide's surface layer, not by adsorbed or gas-phase oxygen.

2. When oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies on the surface.

3. The gas-phase oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O) then reoxidizes the surface by filling these vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. ΔEv is assumed to be inversely related to the oxidizing power of the surface - the smaller the ΔEv, the better the oxidant.

2. ΔEv can be calculated to quickly screen the oxidative power of various oxides, both doped and undoped.

3. To improve an oxide's oxidizing ability, modifications that decrease ΔEv should be sought.

4. However, a very small ΔEv, while indicating a good oxidant, does not necessarily mean a good oxidation catalyst. If oxygen is too easily removed from the surface, it may be difficult to reoxidize the surface and complete the catalytic cycle.

5. The rate-limiting step in most cases is the reaction of the reductant with surface oxygen, not the reoxidation of the surface.

Thus, ΔEv serves as a crucial parameter in understanding and optimizing oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions, balancing the need for both good oxidizing ability and catalyst regeneration.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制的运作如下：

1. 还原剂（如烷烃、CO、H2）被氧化物表面层的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附氧或气相氧氧化。

2. 当氧化产物脱附时，它们在表面留下氧空位。

3. 气相氧化剂（如O2、CO2、N2O）随后通过填充这些空位来重新氧化表面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义：

1. ΔEv被假定与表面的氧化能力呈反比关系 - ΔEv越小，氧化剂越好。

2. 可以计算ΔEv来快速筛选各种氧化物（掺杂的和未掺杂的）的氧化能力。

3. 为了提高氧化物的氧化能力，应该寻求能降低ΔEv的改性方法。

4. 然而，很小的ΔEv虽然表明是一个好的氧化剂，但并不一定意味着是一个好的氧化催化剂。如果氧气太容易从表面移除，可能难以重新氧化表面并完成催化循环。

5. 在大多数情况下，限速步骤是还原剂与表面氧的反应，而不是表面的重新氧化。

因此，ΔEv作为理解和优化氧化反应的氧化物催化剂的关键参数，平衡了良好氧化能力和催化剂再生的需求。
