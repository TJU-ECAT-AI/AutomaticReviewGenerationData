[1] "It is widely accepted (224, 225) that most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (226) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface)."

[2] "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction

where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."

[3] "Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller. However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface. If oxygen is too easy to remove from the surface layer, it will be difficult to put back."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The reductant (e.g., alkane, CO, H2) is oxidized by oxygen atoms from the oxide's surface layer, not by adsorbed or gas-phase oxygen.

2. When oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies on the surface.

3. The gas-phase oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O) then reoxidizes the surface by filling these vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. ΔEv is assumed to be inversely related to the oxidizing power of the surface - a smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant.

2. ΔEv can be calculated to quickly screen the oxidative power of various oxides, both doped and undoped.

3. To improve an oxide's oxidizing ability, modifications that decrease ΔEv should be sought.

4. However, a very small ΔEv, while indicating a good oxidant, doesn't necessarily mean a good oxidation catalyst. If oxygen is too easily removed from the surface, it may be difficult to reoxidize the surface and complete the catalytic cycle.

Thus, ΔEv serves as a key descriptor for understanding and optimizing oxide catalysts, balancing the need for facile oxygen removal with the ability to reoxidize the surface.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理的运作方式如下：

1. 还原剂（如烷烃、CO、H2）被氧化物表面层的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附氧或气相氧氧化。

2. 当氧化产物脱附时，它们在表面留下氧空位。

3. 气相氧化剂（如O2、CO2、N2O）随后通过填充这些空位重新氧化表面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义：

1. ΔEv被假定与表面的氧化能力呈反比关系 - 较小的ΔEv表示更好的氧化剂。

2. 可以计算ΔEv来快速筛选各种氧化物（掺杂或未掺杂）的氧化能力。

3. 为了提高氧化物的氧化能力，应寻求能降低ΔEv的修饰方法。

4. 然而，非常小的ΔEv虽然表明是好的氧化剂，但并不一定意味着是好的氧化催化剂。如果氧气从表面太容易被移除，可能难以重新氧化表面并完成催化循环。

因此，ΔEv作为理解和优化氧化物催化剂的关键描述符，平衡了容易移除氧气和能够重新氧化表面的需求。

3. However, a very small ΔEv does not necessarily mean the oxide is a good oxidation catalyst. While it may be a good oxidant, the surface must also be able to be reoxidized by the gaseous oxidant to complete the catalytic cycle.

4. Thus, there is a balance to be struck - ΔEv should be small enough to allow for effective oxidation, but not so small that reoxidation of the surface becomes difficult.

This mechanism and the role of ΔEv highlight the complexity of designing effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions, as both the oxidation and reoxidation steps must be considered.

3. 然而，非常小的ΔEv并不一定意味着氧化物是好的氧化催化剂。虽然它可能是一个好的氧化剂，但表面还必须能够被气相氧化剂重新氧化以完成催化循环。

4. 因此，需要取得平衡 - ΔEv应该足够小以允许有效的氧化，但不能太小以至于使表面的重新氧化变得困难。

这种机理和ΔEv的作用突出了设计有效氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应的复杂性，因为必须同时考虑氧化和重新氧化步骤。
