[1] "It is widely accepted (224, 225) that most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (226) mechanism."

[2] "In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies."

[3] "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy."

[4] "The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."

[5] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst. To complete the catalytic cycle, the gaseous oxidant (oxygen, CO2, N2O) must be able to reoxidize the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates as follows:

1. The reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) is oxidized by oxygen atoms from the oxide's surface layer, not by adsorbed or gas-phase oxygen.

2. When oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies on the surface.

3. The gas-phase oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O) then reoxidizes the surface by filling these vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. There is an assumed connection between ΔEv and the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent.

2. A smaller ΔEv generally indicates that the surface is a better oxidant.

3. However, a very small ΔEv does not necessarily mean the oxide is a good oxidation catalyst. While it may be a good oxidant, the surface must also be able to be reoxidized by the gaseous oxidant to complete the catalytic cycle.

4. Thus, there is a balance to be struck - ΔEv should be small enough to allow for effective oxidation, but not so small that reoxidation of the surface becomes difficult.

This mechanism and the role of ΔEv highlight the complexity of designing effective oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions, as both the oxidation and reoxidation steps must be considered.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中的运作如下：

1. 还原剂（如烷烃、CO、H2）被氧化物表面层的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附氧或气相氧氧化。

2. 当氧化产物脱附时，它们在表面留下氧空位。

3. 气相氧化剂（如O2、CO2、N2O）随后通过填充这些空位来重新氧化表面。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义：

1. 假设ΔEv与表面氧作为氧化剂的能力之间存在联系。

2. 较小的ΔEv通常表明表面是更好的氧化剂。

3. 然而，非常小的ΔEv并不一定意味着氧化物是好的氧化催化剂。虽然它可能是一个好的氧化剂，但表面还必须能够被气相氧化剂重新氧化以完成催化循环。

4. 因此，需要取得平衡 - ΔEv应该足够小以允许有效的氧化，但不能太小以至于使表面的重新氧化变得困难。

这种机理和ΔEv的作用突出了设计有效氧化物催化剂用于氧化反应的复杂性，因为必须同时考虑氧化和重新氧化步骤。
