[1] "If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

[2] "The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect Ef has been calculated as:
Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) E(MTi35O72)"

[3] "As already shown by theory [31] and experiment [32], the presence of Fe reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation to 1.24 eV, and the effect is still more pronounced when doping with Au, in which case formation of the vacancy is slightly exothermic."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of an oxygen atom from the oxide surface by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy defect. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower vacancy formation energy generally corresponds to higher catalytic activity, as it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface to participate in the reaction. The oxidation activity of a catalyst is inversely related to the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Doping the oxide (e.g. TiO2) with metals like Fe or Au can significantly reduce the vacancy formation energy, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. In some cases, such as Au-doped TiO2, the vacancy formation can even become exothermic, potentially leading to very high oxidation activity.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及反应物（如CO）从氧化物表面移除一个氧原子，从而创建氧空位缺陷。这个空位随后被气相氧补充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的空位形成能通常对应于较高的催化活性，因为从表面移除氧以参与反应更容易。催化剂的氧化活性与氧空位形成能成反比。用金属（如Fe或Au）掺杂氧化物（如TiO2）可以显著降低空位形成能，从而提高催化活性。在某些情况下，例如Au掺杂的TiO2，空位形成甚至可能变成放热过程，潜在地导致非常高的氧化活性。
