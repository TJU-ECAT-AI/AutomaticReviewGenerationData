[1] "If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

[2] "Although formation of an oxygen vacancy defect close to a Au atom is exothermic, the stability of the Au-doped surfaces is low, and it will probably be difficult to obtain TiO2 crystals doped with gold."

[3] "Doping with Fe decreases the Ef value in 1.5 eV, suggesting that the concentration of active vacancy defects might be much higher on the Fe-doped system."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO taking an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to form CO2, creating an oxygen vacancy defect. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is inversely related to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv value indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, leading to a higher concentration of active vacancy defects and potentially enhanced catalytic activity.

For example, doping TiO2 with Fe decreases the ΔEv by 1.5 eV compared to undoped TiO2, suggesting a higher concentration of active vacancy defects in the Fe-doped system. This implies that Fe-doped TiO2 may have improved oxidation catalytic performance. In contrast, while Au doping makes oxygen vacancy formation exothermic, the low stability of Au-doped surfaces may limit their practical application in TiO2 crystals.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to predict the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Lower ΔEv values generally indicate higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as they facilitate the creation and regeneration of oxygen vacancies necessary for the catalytic cycle.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO从氧化物表面取走一个氧原子形成CO2，从而创建一个氧空位缺陷。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）与氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力呈反比关系。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位更容易形成，导致活性空位缺陷的浓度更高，可能增强催化活性。

例如，用Fe掺杂TiO2会使ΔEv比未掺杂的TiO2降低1.5 eV，这表明Fe掺杂系统中活性空位缺陷的浓度更高。这意味着Fe掺杂的TiO2可能具有更好的氧化催化性能。相比之下，虽然Au掺杂使氧空位形成变为放热过程，但Au掺杂表面的低稳定性可能限制其在TiO2晶体中的实际应用。

ΔEv的重要性在于它能够预测氧空位形成的难易程度，这对Mars-van Krevelen机制至关重要。较低的ΔEv值通常表示更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它们有助于创建和再生催化循环所需的氧空位。
