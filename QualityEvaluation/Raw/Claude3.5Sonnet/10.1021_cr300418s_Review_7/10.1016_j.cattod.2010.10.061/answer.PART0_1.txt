[1] "If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

[2] "The finding that formation of a oxygen vacancy defect close to a Au atom is exothermic, but the stability of the Au-doped surfaces is low, and it will probably be difficult to obtain TiO2 crystals doped with gold."

[3] "As previously reported for ceria and rutile, doping of TiO2 anatase with Au or Fe weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, decreases the energy necessary to form an oxygen vacancy defect from 2.7 eV in TiO2 to 1.24 eV in the Fe-doped system, and makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of Au-doped TiO2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface by reactants like CO, creating oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are then replenished by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the formation of oxygen vacancies is often the rate-limiting step in oxidation reactions.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its inverse relationship with the oxidation activity of the catalyst. A lower ΔEv means that the oxide surface can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Additionally, a lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide surface has a higher oxidizing ability, as it can more easily release oxygen to participate in reactions.

Doping oxide surfaces with certain metals can significantly affect ΔEv. For instance, doping TiO2 with Fe or Au weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, thereby decreasing ΔEv. This modification of the surface properties can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates better catalytic performance, other factors such as the stability of the doped surface and the interaction with reactant molecules also play crucial roles in determining the overall catalytic efficiency.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及反应物（如CO）从氧化物表面移除氧原子，从而创造氧空位。这些空位随后被气相氧补充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明更容易创造氧空位，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为氧空位的形成通常是氧化反应中的速率限制步骤。

ΔEv的重要性在于其与催化剂氧化活性的反比关系。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物表面能更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，从而增强其催化性能。此外，较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。

用某些金属掺杂氧化物表面可以显著影响ΔEv。例如，用Fe或Au掺杂TiO2会削弱掺杂剂周围的金属-氧键，从而降低ΔEv。这种表面性质的修改可以导致氧化反应的催化活性增强。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示更好的催化性能，但其他因素如掺杂表面的稳定性和与反应物分子的相互作用也在决定整体催化效率中起着关键作用。
