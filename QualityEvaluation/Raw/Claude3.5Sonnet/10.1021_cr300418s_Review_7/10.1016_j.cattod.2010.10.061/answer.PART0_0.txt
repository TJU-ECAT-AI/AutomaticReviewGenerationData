[1] "If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

[2] "The finding that doping with Au results in thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies had already been reported for the (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces of ceria [20,21], but to our knowledge it is the first time that this result is reported for titania."

[3] "Doping of anatase TiO2 with Au or Fe weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, decreases the energy necessary to form an oxygen vacancy defect from 2.7 eV in TiO2 to 1.24 eV in the Fe-doped system, and makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of Au-doped TiO2."

[4] "Since the energy changes involved in the creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase, an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the following steps:

1. CO takes an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to form CO2
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy defect on the surface
3. The vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates:

1. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies
2. Higher concentration of active sites
3. Enhanced oxidation activity

The oxidation activity of a catalyst is inversely related to ΔEv. Doping oxides with certain metals (e.g., Au, Fe) can decrease ΔEv by weakening metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant. This leads to more easily formed oxygen vacancies and potentially higher catalytic activity.

For example, doping TiO2 with Fe decreases ΔEv from 2.7 eV to 1.24 eV, while Au doping makes the process exothermic. These changes in energy requirements for vacancy formation and subsequent O2 adsorption/vacancy healing can significantly enhance the oxidation activity of the doped materials compared to undoped oxides.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理包括以下步骤：

1. CO从氧化物表面取走一个氧原子形成CO2
2. 这在表面上创造了一个氧空位缺陷
3. 然后气相中的氧填补这个空位

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明：

1. 更容易形成氧空位
2. 更高的活性位点浓度
3. 增强的氧化活性

催化剂的氧化活性与ΔEv成反比。用某些金属（如Au、Fe）掺杂氧化物可以通过削弱掺杂剂周围的金属-氧键来降低ΔEv。这导致氧空位更容易形成，可能会提高催化活性。

例如，用Fe掺杂TiO2将ΔEv从2.7 eV降低到1.24 eV，而Au掺杂使这个过程变成放热的。这些空位形成和随后的O2吸附/空位愈合能量要求的变化可以显著增强掺杂材料相对于未掺杂氧化物的氧化活性。
