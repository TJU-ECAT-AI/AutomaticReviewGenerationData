[1] "If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

[2] "The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect Ef has been calculated as:
Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) E(MTi35O72)"

[3] "As already shown by theory [31] and experiment [32], the presence of Fe reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation to 1.24 eV, and the effect is still more pronounced when doping with Au, in which case formation of the vacancy is slightly exothermic."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of a surface oxygen atom by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by the replenishment of this vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is inversely related to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. 

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to predict and explain the oxidation activity of different oxide catalysts. Dopants or modifications that reduce ΔEv, such as Fe or Au doping in TiO2, can enhance the oxidation activity of the oxide. For instance, Fe doping reduces ΔEv in TiO2 from 2.70 eV to 1.24 eV, while Au doping makes vacancy formation slightly exothermic. This suggests that doped oxides with lower ΔEv values would be more active oxidation catalysts, as they can more readily participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by providing lattice oxygen to reactants.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及反应物（如CO）移除表面氧原子，形成氧空位，然后由气相氧补充这个空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv或Ef）与氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力成反比。较低的ΔEv表明从表面移除氧更容易，这通常与氧化反应的更高催化活性相关。

ΔEv的重要性在于其能够预测和解释不同氧化物催化剂的氧化活性。降低ΔEv的掺杂剂或修饰，如在TiO2中掺杂Fe或Au，可以增强氧化物的氧化活性。例如，Fe掺杂将TiO2的ΔEv从2.70 eV降低到1.24 eV，而Au掺杂使空位形成略微放热。这表明ΔEv值较低的掺杂氧化物将是更活跃的氧化催化剂，因为它们可以更容易地参与Mars-van Krevelen机制，向反应物提供晶格氧。
