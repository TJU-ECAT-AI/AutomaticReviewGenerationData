[1] "If a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is accepted for CO oxidation on Au/CeO2, then CO2 is formed when CO takes a oxygen atom from the oxide surface creating a oxygen vacancy defect, and therefore the oxidation activity of a catalyst should be inversely related to the oxygen vacancy energy formation."

[2] "The finding that doping with Au results in thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies had already been reported for the (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces of ceria [20,21], but to our knowledge it is the first time that this result is reported for titania."

[3] "Doping of anatase TiO2 with Au or Fe weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, decreases the energy necessary to form an oxygen vacancy defect from 2.7 eV in TiO2 to 1.24 eV in the Fe-doped system, and makes the reduction process exothermic in the case of Au-doped TiO2."

[4] "Since the energy changes involved in the creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase, an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the following steps:

1. CO takes an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to form CO2
2. This creates an oxygen vacancy defect on the surface
3. The vacancy is then filled by oxygen from the gas phase

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates:

1. Easier formation of oxygen vacancies
2. Higher concentration of active sites
3. Enhanced oxidation activity

The oxidation activity of a catalyst is inversely related to ΔEv. Doping oxides with certain metals (e.g., Au, Fe) can decrease ΔEv by weakening metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant. This leads to more easily formed oxygen vacancies and potentially higher catalytic activity.

For example, doping TiO2 with Fe decreases ΔEv from 2.7 eV to 1.24 eV, while Au doping makes the process exothermic. These changes in energy requirements for vacancy formation and subsequent O2 adsorption/vacancy healing can significantly enhance the oxidation activity of the doped materials compared to undoped oxides.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理包括以下步骤：

1. CO从氧化物表面取走一个氧原子形成CO2
2. 这在表面上创造了一个氧空位缺陷
3. 然后气相中的氧填补这个空位

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明：

1. 更容易形成氧空位
2. 更高的活性位点浓度
3. 增强的氧化活性

催化剂的氧化活性与ΔEv成反比。用某些金属（如Au、Fe）掺杂氧化物可以通过削弱掺杂剂周围的金属-氧键来降低ΔEv。这导致氧空位更容易形成，可能会提高催化活性。

例如，用Fe掺杂TiO2将ΔEv从2.7 eV降低到1.24 eV，而Au掺杂使这个过程变成放热的。这些空位形成和随后的O2吸附/空位愈合能量要求的变化可以显著增强掺杂材料相对于未掺杂氧化物的氧化活性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface by reactants like CO, creating oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are then replenished by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the formation of oxygen vacancies is often the rate-limiting step in oxidation reactions.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its inverse relationship with the oxidation activity of the catalyst. A lower ΔEv means that the oxide surface can more readily provide oxygen for the oxidation reaction, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Additionally, a lower ΔEv suggests that the oxide surface has a higher oxidizing ability, as it can more easily release oxygen to participate in reactions.

Doping oxide surfaces with certain metals can significantly affect ΔEv. For instance, doping TiO2 with Fe or Au weakens the metal-oxygen bonds around the dopant, thereby decreasing ΔEv. This modification of the surface properties can lead to enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

However, it's important to note that while a lower ΔEv generally indicates better catalytic performance, other factors such as the stability of the doped surface and the interaction with reactant molecules also play crucial roles in determining the overall catalytic efficiency.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及反应物（如CO）从氧化物表面移除氧原子，从而创造氧空位。这些空位随后被气相氧补充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明更容易创造氧空位，这通常与更高的催化活性相关。这是因为氧空位的形成通常是氧化反应中的速率限制步骤。

ΔEv的重要性在于其与催化剂氧化活性的反比关系。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物表面能更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，从而增强其催化性能。此外，较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为它可以更容易地释放氧参与反应。

用某些金属掺杂氧化物表面可以显著影响ΔEv。例如，用Fe或Au掺杂TiO2会削弱掺杂剂周围的金属-氧键，从而降低ΔEv。这种表面性质的修改可以导致氧化反应的催化活性增强。

然而，需要注意的是，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示更好的催化性能，但其他因素如掺杂表面的稳定性和与反应物分子的相互作用也在决定整体催化效率中起着关键作用。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO taking an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to form CO2, creating an oxygen vacancy defect. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is inversely related to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv value indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, leading to a higher concentration of active vacancy defects and potentially enhanced catalytic activity.

For example, doping TiO2 with Fe decreases the ΔEv by 1.5 eV compared to undoped TiO2, suggesting a higher concentration of active vacancy defects in the Fe-doped system. This implies that Fe-doped TiO2 may have improved oxidation catalytic performance. In contrast, while Au doping makes oxygen vacancy formation exothermic, the low stability of Au-doped surfaces may limit their practical application in TiO2 crystals.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to predict the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Lower ΔEv values generally indicate higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as they facilitate the creation and regeneration of oxygen vacancies necessary for the catalytic cycle.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO从氧化物表面取走一个氧原子形成CO2，从而创建一个氧空位缺陷。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）与氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力呈反比关系。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位更容易形成，导致活性空位缺陷的浓度更高，可能增强催化活性。

例如，用Fe掺杂TiO2会使ΔEv比未掺杂的TiO2降低1.5 eV，这表明Fe掺杂系统中活性空位缺陷的浓度更高。这意味着Fe掺杂的TiO2可能具有更好的氧化催化性能。相比之下，虽然Au掺杂使氧空位形成变为放热过程，但Au掺杂表面的低稳定性可能限制其在TiO2晶体中的实际应用。

ΔEv的重要性在于它能够预测氧空位形成的难易程度，这对Mars-van Krevelen机制至关重要。较低的ΔEv值通常表示更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它们有助于创建和再生催化循环所需的氧空位。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the removal of a surface oxygen atom by the reactant (e.g. CO), creating an oxygen vacancy, followed by the replenishment of this vacancy by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv or Ef) is inversely related to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen from the surface, which generally correlates with higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions. 

The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to predict and explain the oxidation activity of different oxide catalysts. Dopants or modifications that reduce ΔEv, such as Fe or Au doping in TiO2, can enhance the oxidation activity of the oxide. For instance, Fe doping reduces ΔEv in TiO2 from 2.70 eV to 1.24 eV, while Au doping makes vacancy formation slightly exothermic. This suggests that doped oxides with lower ΔEv values would be more active oxidation catalysts, as they can more readily participate in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by providing lattice oxygen to reactants.

ΔEv的重要性在于其能够预测和解释不同氧化物催化剂的氧化活性。降低ΔEv的掺杂剂或修饰，如在TiO2中掺杂Fe或Au，可以增强氧化物的氧化活性。例如，Fe掺杂将TiO2的ΔEv从2.70 eV降低到1.24 eV，而Au掺杂使空位形成略微放热。这表明ΔEv值较低的掺杂氧化物将是更活跃的氧化催化剂，因为它们可以更容易地参与Mars-van Krevelen机制，向反应物提供晶格氧。
