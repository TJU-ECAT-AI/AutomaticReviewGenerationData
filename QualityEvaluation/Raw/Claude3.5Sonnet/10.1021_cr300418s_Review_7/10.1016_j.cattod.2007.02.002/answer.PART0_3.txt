[1] "Their reaction mechanism was written as follows:
I. aromatic compound + oxidized catalyst → oxidation products + reduced catalyst
II. reduced catalyst + oxygen → oxidized catalyst"

[2] "Based on these assumptions, these two steps above can be more correctly represented by the following two equations:
R + x O • S → Products + x S
x/2 S + O2 → 2O • S"

[3] "As a result of this analysis, one concludes that, although a surface redox mechanism may properly describe the oxidation process, the rate expression derived by Mars and van Krevelen is inconsistent and incorrect, and it must be viewed only as a mathematical data-fitting function with no physical relevance."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process. In the first step, the reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen from the catalyst, resulting in the formation of oxidation products and the reduction of the catalyst surface. In the second step, the reduced catalyst is re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen, restoring the catalyst to its original state.

However, the analysis in this paper reveals that the Mars-van Krevelen rate expression derived from this mechanism is inconsistent and incorrect. The paper does not directly discuss the significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The focus is primarily on critiquing the kinetic model and rate expression rather than exploring the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation.

The paper concludes that while a surface redox mechanism may correctly describe the oxidation process, the Mars-van Krevelen rate expression should be viewed only as a mathematical data-fitting function without physical relevance. Alternative kinetic models, such as Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Hougen-Watson-type catalytic sequences, are suggested as potentially more accurate representations of the oxidation process.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两步过程进行操作。第一步，反应物被催化剂的晶格氧氧化，形成氧化产物并使催化剂表面还原。第二步，还原的催化剂被气相氧重新氧化，使催化剂恢复到原始状态。

然而，本文的分析揭示，从这一机理推导出的Mars-van Krevelen速率表达式是不一致且不正确的。文章并未直接讨论氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）在决定催化活性和氧化物表面氧化能力方面的重要性。文章主要集中在批评动力学模型和速率表达式，而不是探讨氧空位形成的能量学。

文章得出结论，虽然表面氧化还原机理可能正确描述了氧化过程，但Mars-van Krevelen速率表达式应该只被视为一个没有物理相关性的数学数据拟合函数。文章建议，诸如Langmuir-Hinshelwood和Hougen-Watson型催化序列等替代动力学模型可能更准确地表示氧化过程。
