[1] "An analysis of the mechanism and the assumptions incorporated into the derivation of the Marsvan Krevelen rate expression for heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions reveals a number of inconsistencies."

[2] "The expression as derived is properly applicable only for a reaction involving molecular oxygen adsorbed on a single site; however, the model assumes that lattice O ions (or atoms) react with the substrate being oxidized."

[3] "As a result of this analysis, one concludes that, although a surface redox mechanism may properly describe the oxidation process, the rate expression derived by Mars and van Krevelen is inconsistent and incorrect, and it must be viewed only as a mathematical data-fitting function with no physical relevance."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions is described as inconsistent and incorrect in this analysis. The document points out that while the mechanism assumes lattice oxygen ions or atoms react with the substrate being oxidized, the derived expression is only applicable for reactions involving molecular oxygen adsorbed on a single site. This fundamental contradiction undermines the physical relevance of the model.

The document does not discuss the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) or its significance in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. These aspects are not addressed in the provided literature.

根据这项分析，Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化氧化反应中被描述为不一致且不正确的。文献指出，尽管该机理假设晶格氧离子或原子与被氧化的底物反应，但推导出的表达式仅适用于涉及单个位点上吸附的分子氧的反应。这一基本矛盾削弱了该模型的物理相关性。

文献没有讨论氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）或其在决定催化活性和氧化物表面氧化能力方面的重要性。提供的文献中未涉及这些方面。
