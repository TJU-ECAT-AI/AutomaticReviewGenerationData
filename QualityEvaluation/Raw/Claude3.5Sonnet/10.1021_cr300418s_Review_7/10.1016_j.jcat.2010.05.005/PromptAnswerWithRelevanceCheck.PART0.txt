[1] "It is suspected that the rate-limiting step, in the low temperature range, is the activation of methane. It is however conceivable that at higher temperature the reoxidation of the catalyst may become rate-limiting, especially when the oxidant is CO2."

[2] "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

[3] "In a nutshell, the dopant enhances the first step in a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This is not a general feature of doped oxides. For other oxide-dopant pairs, the dopant may increase the binding energy of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by the lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen atoms are more easily removed from the surface, making them more reactive towards reductants. This easier removal of oxygen atoms enhances the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its use as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Oxides with lower ΔEv values are generally more active catalysts for oxidation reactions, as they can more readily provide oxygen to the reactants. However, it's important to note that this is not a universal rule for all doped oxides. In some cases, dopants may increase the binding energy of neighboring oxygen atoms, potentially altering the catalytic behavior.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the importance of ΔEv also explain why the rate-limiting step can change with temperature. At lower temperatures, the activation of the reactant (e.g., methane) by lattice oxygen may be rate-limiting. However, at higher temperatures, especially with less reactive oxidants like CO2, the reoxidation of the catalyst (refilling of oxygen vacancies) may become the rate-limiting step.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面的晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机理中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子更容易从表面移除，使它们对还原剂更具反应性。这种氧原子更容易移除的特性增强了Mars-van Krevelen机理的第一步，即反应物被晶格氧氧化的过程。

ΔEv的重要性在于它被用作材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。ΔEv值较低的氧化物通常是更活跃的氧化反应催化剂，因为它们可以更容易地向反应物提供氧。然而，需要注意的是，这并不是所有掺杂氧化物的普遍规律。在某些情况下，掺杂剂可能会增加邻近氧原子的结合能，可能改变催化行为。

Mars-van Krevelen机理和ΔEv的重要性还解释了为什么速率限制步骤可能随温度变化。在较低温度下，反应物（如甲烷）被晶格氧活化可能是速率限制步骤。然而，在较高温度下，特别是使用像CO2这样反应性较低的氧化剂时，催化剂的再氧化（氧空位的填补）可能成为速率限制步骤。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by removing oxygen from the oxide lattice, creating an oxygen vacancy. The oxide is then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide lattice, making them more reactive towards reductants. This increased reactivity translates to higher catalytic activity.

In the case of Pt-doped ceria, the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms. This is evidenced by the lower energy required to create oxygen vacancies in Pt-doped ceria (2.15 eV) compared to pure ceria (3.00 eV). The weakened oxygen bonds make these atoms more reactive and easier to remove, enhancing the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The ΔEv is used as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Lower ΔEv values suggest that the oxide surface can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions, leading to improved catalytic performance. This principle applies not only to methane activation but also to other oxidation reactions, such as CO oxidation by doped oxides.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及晶格氧参与反应。在这个机理中，反应物通过从氧化物晶格中移除氧来被氧化，从而产生氧空位。然后，氧化物被气相氧重新氧化，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物晶格中移除氧原子更容易，使它们对还原剂的反应性更强。这种增加的反应性转化为更高的催化活性。

在铂掺杂的氧化铈中，表面层中铂的存在削弱了邻近氧原子的键合。这一点从铂掺杂的氧化铈（2.15 eV）比纯氧化铈（3.00 eV）创建氧空位所需的能量更低可以得到证实。削弱的氧键使这些原子更具反应性且更容易移除，增强了Mars-van Krevelen机理的第一步。

ΔEv被用作材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，从而提高催化性能。这一原理不仅适用于甲烷活化，也适用于其他氧化反应，如掺杂氧化物对CO的氧化。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial parameter in this mechanism. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, which in turn suggests that these oxygen atoms are more reactive when exposed to a reductant.

The significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is twofold:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, the more readily they can participate in oxidation reactions with adsorbed species.

2. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv serves as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Oxygen atoms that are easier to remove (lower ΔEv) are typically more reactive and have a greater oxidizing ability.

In the context of doped oxides, such as Pt-doped ceria, the presence of the dopant can significantly influence ΔEv. For instance, Pt in the surface layer of ceria weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms, lowering the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies. This enhancement of the first step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism contributes to the improved catalytic performance of the doped oxide.

It's important to note that while ΔEv is a useful indicator, experimental measurements of this value can vary due to differences in preparation methods, making direct comparisons between calculated and experimental values challenging.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是这一机制中的关键参数。较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，这反过来意味着这些氧原子在暴露于还原剂时更具反应性。

ΔEv在决定催化活性和氧化物表面氧化能力方面的重要性体现在两个方面：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常与较高的催化活性相关。这是因为从表面移除氧原子越容易，它们就越容易参与与吸附物种的氧化反应。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv作为材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。更容易移除的氧原子（较低的ΔEv）通常更具反应性，具有更强的氧化能力。

在掺杂氧化物（如铂掺杂的氧化铈）的背景下，掺杂剂的存在可以显著影响ΔEv。例如，氧化铈表面层中的铂会削弱邻近氧原子的键合，降低创建氧空位所需的能量。这种对Mars-van Krevelen机制第一步的增强contributes到掺杂氧化物改进的催化性能。

需要注意的是，虽然ΔEv是一个有用的指标，但由于制备方法的差异，这个值的实验测量可能会有所不同，使得计算值和实验值之间的直接比较具有挑战性。

As a result, the activation energy for the dissociative adsorption of methane, which is the rate-limiting step in methane oxidation, is decreased.

The energy of oxygen vacancy formation serves as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive when exposed to a reductant. This principle explains why doped oxides with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies often exhibit enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

By lowering the energy barrier for the first step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, dopants like Pt can significantly improve the catalytic performance of oxide materials in oxidation reactions.

[1] "We find that catalysts in which a larger fraction of Pt is ionic are more effective in activating methane. This is true for the reaction of methane with oxygen and for the reaction with CO2."

[2] "The fact that both reactions start at the same temperature strongly suggests that the rate-limiting step, in the low temperature range, is the activation of methane. It is however conceivable that at higher temperature the reoxidation of the catalyst may become rate-limiting, especially when the oxidant is CO2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. The reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
2. The vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is highly significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates:

1. Easier removal of lattice oxygen, making the oxide a more effective oxidant.
2. Higher reactivity of surface oxygen atoms when exposed to reductants.
3. Enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

In the case of Pt-doped ceria, the presence of ionic Pt weakens the bonds of neighboring oxygen atoms, lowering ΔEv and thus increasing the catalytic activity for methane activation. This demonstrates how dopants can be used to modify the chemical activity of host oxides, potentially creating a rich class of catalysts with tunable properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两步过程运作：

1. 反应物被氧化物表面的晶格氧氧化，形成氧空位。
2. 空位随后被气相中的氧填充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明：

1. 晶格氧更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更有效的氧化剂。
2. 表面氧原子在接触还原剂时具有更高的反应性。
3. 氧化反应的催化活性增强。

在铂掺杂的氧化铈情况下，离子态铂的存在削弱了邻近氧原子的键合，降低了ΔEv，从而增加了甲烷活化的催化活性。这展示了如何利用掺杂剂来修饰宿主氧化物的化学活性，潜在地创造出一类具有可调性能的丰富催化剂。
