          "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

"In a nutshell, the dopant enhances the first step in a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."

"We find that the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."

"To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase, costs 3.00 eV. [...] For the Pt-doped ceria, the formation of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV."

"It is suspected that the rate-limiting step, in the low temperature range, is the activation of methane. It is however conceivable that at higher temperature the reoxidation of the catalyst may become rate-limiting, especially when the oxidant is CO2."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by the lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen atoms are more easily removed from the surface, making them more reactive towards reductants. This translates to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its use as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Oxides with lower ΔEv values are generally more active catalysts for oxidation reactions, as they can more readily provide oxygen to the reactants. For example, in Pt-doped ceria, the presence of Pt weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms, lowering the energy needed to create oxygen vacancies from 3.00 eV in pure ceria to 2.15 eV in Pt-doped ceria.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the importance of ΔEv also explain why the rate-limiting step can change with temperature. At lower temperatures, the activation of the reactant (e.g., methane) by lattice oxygen may be rate-limiting. However, at higher temperatures, especially with less reactive oxidants like CO2, the reoxidation of the catalyst (refilling of oxygen vacancies) may become the rate-limiting step.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面的晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机理中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子更容易从表面移除，使它们对还原剂更具反应性。这转化为氧化反应的更高催化活性。

ΔEv的重要性在于它被用作材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。ΔEv值较低的氧化物通常是更活跃的氧化反应催化剂，因为它们可以更容易地向反应物提供氧。例如，在铂掺杂的氧化铈中，铂的存在削弱了邻近氧原子的键合，将创建氧空位所需的能量从纯氧化铈的3.00 eV降低到铂掺杂氧化铈的2.15 eV。

Mars-van Krevelen机理和ΔEv的重要性还解释了为什么速率限制步骤可能随温度变化。在较低温度下，反应物（如甲烷）被晶格氧活化可能是速率限制步骤。然而，在较高温度下，特别是使用像CO2这样反应性较低的氧化剂时，催化剂的再氧化（氧空位的填补）可能成为速率限制步骤。
