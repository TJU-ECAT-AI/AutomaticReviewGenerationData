[1] "It is suspected that the rate-limiting step, in the low temperature range, is the activation of methane. It is however conceivable that at higher temperature the reoxidation of the catalyst may become rate-limiting, especially when the oxidant is CO2."

[2] "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

[3] "In a nutshell, the dopant enhances the first step in a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. This is not a general feature of doped oxides. For other oxide-dopant pairs, the dopant may increase the binding energy of the neighboring oxygen atoms to the oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by the lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen atoms are more easily removed from the surface, making them more reactive towards reductants. This easier removal of oxygen atoms enhances the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its use as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Oxides with lower ΔEv values are generally more active catalysts for oxidation reactions, as they can more readily provide oxygen to the reactants. However, it's important to note that this is not a universal rule for all doped oxides. In some cases, dopants may increase the binding energy of neighboring oxygen atoms, potentially altering the catalytic behavior.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the importance of ΔEv also explain why the rate-limiting step can change with temperature. At lower temperatures, the activation of the reactant (e.g., methane) by lattice oxygen may be rate-limiting. However, at higher temperatures, especially with less reactive oxidants like CO2, the reoxidation of the catalyst (refilling of oxygen vacancies) may become the rate-limiting step.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及氧化物表面的晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机理中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在表面形成氧空位。然后，这个空位被气相中的氧填补，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子更容易从表面移除，使它们对还原剂更具反应性。这种氧原子更容易移除的特性增强了Mars-van Krevelen机理的第一步，即反应物被晶格氧氧化的过程。

ΔEv的重要性在于它被用作材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。ΔEv值较低的氧化物通常是更活跃的氧化反应催化剂，因为它们可以更容易地向反应物提供氧。然而，需要注意的是，这并不是所有掺杂氧化物的普遍规律。在某些情况下，掺杂剂可能会增加邻近氧原子的结合能，可能改变催化行为。

Mars-van Krevelen机理和ΔEv的重要性还解释了为什么速率限制步骤可能随温度变化。在较低温度下，反应物（如甲烷）被晶格氧活化可能是速率限制步骤。然而，在较高温度下，特别是使用像CO2这样反应性较低的氧化剂时，催化剂的再氧化（氧空位的填补）可能成为速率限制步骤。
