[1] "We find that catalysts in which a larger fraction of Pt is ionic are more effective in activating methane. This is true for the reaction of methane with oxygen and for the reaction with CO2."

[2] "The fact that both reactions start at the same temperature strongly suggests that the rate-limiting step, in the low temperature range, is the activation of methane. It is however conceivable that at higher temperature the reoxidation of the catalyst may become rate-limiting, especially when the oxidant is CO2."

[3] "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

[4] "This is consistent with the behavior found in other systems for CO oxidation by doped oxides [40,57,58]. In a nutshell, the dopant enhances the first step in a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through a two-step process:

1. The reactant is oxidized by lattice oxygen from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy.
2. The vacancy is then refilled by oxygen from the gas phase, regenerating the catalyst.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is highly significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates:

1. Easier removal of lattice oxygen, making the oxide a more effective oxidant.
2. Higher reactivity of surface oxygen atoms when exposed to reductants.
3. Enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

In the case of Pt-doped ceria, the presence of ionic Pt weakens the bonds of neighboring oxygen atoms, lowering ΔEv and thus increasing the catalytic activity for methane activation. This demonstrates how dopants can be used to modify the chemical activity of host oxides, potentially creating a rich class of catalysts with tunable properties.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过两步过程运作：

1. 反应物被氧化物表面的晶格氧氧化，形成氧空位。
2. 空位随后被气相中的氧填充，使催化剂再生。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明：

1. 晶格氧更容易被移除，使氧化物成为更有效的氧化剂。
2. 表面氧原子在接触还原剂时具有更高的反应性。
3. 氧化反应的催化活性增强。

在铂掺杂的氧化铈情况下，离子态铂的存在削弱了邻近氧原子的键合，降低了ΔEv，从而增加了甲烷活化的催化活性。这展示了如何利用掺杂剂来修饰宿主氧化物的化学活性，潜在地创造出一类具有可调性能的丰富催化剂。
