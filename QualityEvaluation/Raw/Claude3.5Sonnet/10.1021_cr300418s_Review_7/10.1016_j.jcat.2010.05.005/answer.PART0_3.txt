[1] "It was found that the presence of Pt activates the oxygen atoms next to it in the surface layer and this decreases the activation energy for dissociative adsorption of methane (which is the rate-limiting step in the reaction)."

[2] "We find that the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."

[3] "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by the lattice oxygen, creating an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This vacancy is then refilled by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen atoms are more easily removed from the surface, making them more reactive towards reductants. This translates to higher catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

In the case of Pt-doped ceria, the presence of Pt weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms in the surface layer. This lowers the energy needed to create oxygen vacancies, effectively activating these oxygen atoms. As a result, the activation energy for the dissociative adsorption of methane, which is the rate-limiting step in methane oxidation, is decreased.

The energy of oxygen vacancy formation serves as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive when exposed to a reductant. This principle explains why doped oxides with lower oxygen vacancy formation energies often exhibit enhanced catalytic activity for oxidation reactions.

By lowering the energy barrier for the first step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, dopants like Pt can significantly improve the catalytic performance of oxide materials in oxidation reactions.

Mars-van Krevelen机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。在这个机理中，反应物被晶格氧氧化，在表面创造一个氧空位。然后这个空位被气相氧填充，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子更容易从表面移除，使它们对还原剂更具反应性。这转化为氧化反应的更高催化活性。

在Pt掺杂的氧化铈情况下，Pt的存在削弱了表面层相邻氧原子的键合。这降低了创建氧空位所需的能量，有效地激活了这些氧原子。因此，甲烷解离吸附的活化能（这是甲烷氧化的速率限制步骤）降低了。

氧空位形成能量作为材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。更容易移除的氧原子在暴露于还原剂时更具反应性。这一原理解释了为什么具有较低氧空位形成能的掺杂氧化物通常表现出增强的氧化反应催化活性。

通过降低Mars-van Krevelen机理第一步的能量障碍，像Pt这样的掺杂剂可以显著改善氧化物材料在氧化反应中的催化性能。
