[1] "It is suspected that the density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) may not describe accurately the behavior of the electrons in the f-orbitals of the Ce atoms in CeO2."

[3] "To remove an O atom from the top layer of the pure oxide, to form a O2 molecule in the gas phase, costs 3.00 eV. [...] For the Pt-doped ceria, the formation of an oxygen vacancy, in the top layer, near the dopant, costs 2.15 eV."

[4] "Our density functional calculations modeled the doped oxide with a ceria slab in which one Ce atom at the surface of the supercell is replaced by Pt. [...] We find that the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."

[5] "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen from the oxide surface. In this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by removing oxygen from the oxide lattice, creating an oxygen vacancy. The oxide is then re-oxidized by gas-phase oxygen, completing the catalytic cycle.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide lattice, making them more reactive towards reductants. This increased reactivity translates to higher catalytic activity.

In the case of Pt-doped ceria, the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms. This is evidenced by the lower energy required to create oxygen vacancies in Pt-doped ceria (2.15 eV) compared to pure ceria (3.00 eV). The weakened oxygen bonds make these atoms more reactive and easier to remove, enhancing the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The ΔEv is used as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Lower ΔEv values suggest that the oxide surface can more readily provide oxygen for oxidation reactions, leading to improved catalytic performance. This principle applies not only to methane activation but also to other oxidation reactions, such as CO oxidation by doped oxides.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机理涉及晶格氧参与反应。在这个机理中，反应物通过从氧化物晶格中移除氧来被氧化，从而产生氧空位。然后，氧化物被气相氧重新氧化，完成催化循环。

氧空位形成能（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物晶格中移除氧原子更容易，使它们对还原剂的反应性更强。这种增加的反应性转化为更高的催化活性。

在铂掺杂的氧化铈中，表面层中铂的存在削弱了邻近氧原子的键合。这一点从铂掺杂的氧化铈（2.15 eV）比纯氧化铈（3.00 eV）创建氧空位所需的能量更低可以得到证实。削弱的氧键使这些原子更具反应性且更容易移除，增强了Mars-van Krevelen机理的第一步。

ΔEv被用作材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物表面可以更容易地为氧化反应提供氧，从而提高催化性能。这一原理不仅适用于甲烷活化，也适用于其他氧化反应，如掺杂氧化物对CO的氧化。
