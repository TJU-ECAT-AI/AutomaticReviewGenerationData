The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the participation of lattice oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a crucial parameter in this mechanism. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, which in turn suggests that these oxygen atoms are more reactive when exposed to a reductant.

The significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is twofold:

1. Catalytic activity: A lower ΔEv generally correlates with higher catalytic activity. This is because the easier it is to remove oxygen atoms from the surface, the more readily they can participate in oxidation reactions with adsorbed species.

2. Oxidizing ability: ΔEv serves as an indicator of the material's ability to act as an oxidant. Oxygen atoms that are easier to remove (lower ΔEv) are typically more reactive and have a greater oxidizing ability.

In the context of doped oxides, such as Pt-doped ceria, the presence of the dopant can significantly influence ΔEv. For instance, Pt in the surface layer of ceria weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms, lowering the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies. This enhancement of the first step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism contributes to the improved catalytic performance of the doped oxide.

It's important to note that while ΔEv is a useful indicator, experimental measurements of this value can vary due to differences in preparation methods, making direct comparisons between calculated and experimental values challenging.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及氧化物表面晶格氧原子的参与。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）是这一机制中的关键参数。较低的ΔEv表明从氧化物表面移除氧原子更容易，这反过来意味着这些氧原子在暴露于还原剂时更具反应性。

ΔEv在决定催化活性和氧化物表面氧化能力方面的重要性体现在两个方面：

1. 催化活性：较低的ΔEv通常与较高的催化活性相关。这是因为从表面移除氧原子越容易，它们就越容易参与与吸附物种的氧化反应。

2. 氧化能力：ΔEv作为材料作为氧化剂能力的指标。更容易移除的氧原子（较低的ΔEv）通常更具反应性，具有更强的氧化能力。

在掺杂氧化物（如铂掺杂的氧化铈）的背景下，掺杂剂的存在可以显著影响ΔEv。例如，氧化铈表面层中的铂会削弱邻近氧原子的键合，降低创建氧空位所需的能量。这种对Mars-van Krevelen机制第一步的增强contributes到掺杂氧化物改进的催化性能。

需要注意的是，虽然ΔEv是一个有用的指标，但由于制备方法的差异，这个值的实验测量可能会有所不同，使得计算值和实验值之间的直接比较具有挑战性。
