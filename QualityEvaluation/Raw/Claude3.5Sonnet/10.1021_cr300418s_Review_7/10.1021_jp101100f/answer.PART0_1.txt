The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) are not directly discussed in the given literature. The text focuses on nickel doping in ceria and its effects on electronic structure and oxygen buffering capacity, but does not cover the specific catalytic mechanism asked about in the question. Therefore, this question cannot be fully answered based solely on the information provided in the given document.

However, the literature does discuss some related concepts that may be relevant:

1. The document mentions the oxygen storage capacity and oxygen buffering effect of ceria-based materials, which are important for catalytic oxidation reactions.

2. It discusses the formation of oxygen vacancies in doped ceria systems and how this affects the electronic structure and stability of the material.

3. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation is indirectly addressed through the calculation of formation energies for different defect structures.

4. The enhanced oxygen buffering capacity of Ni-doped ceria is discussed, which is related to the ease of oxygen release and uptake in these materials.

While these concepts are related to the catalytic properties of oxide materials, the specific Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and its relationship to ΔEv are not explicitly covered in the given text.

Mars-van Krevelen机理和氧空位形成能量（ΔEv）在所给文献中并未直接讨论。文本主要集中于镍掺杂氧化铈及其对电子结构和氧缓冲能力的影响，但并未涉及问题中提到的具体催化机理。因此，仅基于所给文档中的信息无法完整回答这个问题。

然而，文献确实讨论了一些可能相关的概念：

1. 文档提到了基于氧化铈材料的氧储存能力和氧缓冲效应，这些对催化氧化反应很重要。

2. 它讨论了掺杂氧化铈系统中氧空位的形成，以及这如何影响材料的电子结构和稳定性。

3. 通过计算不同缺陷结构的形成能，间接涉及了氧空位形成所需的能量。

4. 讨论了镍掺杂氧化铈增强的氧缓冲能力，这与这些材料中氧的释放和吸收的容易程度有关。

虽然这些概念与氧化物材料的催化性能相关，但给定文本中并未明确涵盖具体的Mars-van Krevelen机理及其与ΔEv的关系。
