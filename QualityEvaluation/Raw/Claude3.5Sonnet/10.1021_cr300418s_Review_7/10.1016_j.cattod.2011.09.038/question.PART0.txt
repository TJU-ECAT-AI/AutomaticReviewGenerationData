The
 interaction
 of  O2 with  reduced
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1 0)(1  ×  1)  has  been
 studied
 by
 means
 of  scanning
 tun-
neling
 microscopy
 (STM),  temperature-programmed
 desorption
 (TPD)  and
 photoelectron
 spectroscopy
(PES).
 It is  found
 that  the  interaction
 of  O2 with  TiO2(1  1 0)
 depends
 strongly
 on  the  reduction
 state
 of
the
 TiO2(1  1 0) crystal.
 High-resolution
 STM  studies
 revealed
 that  the  energy
 barrier
 for
 the
 non-vacancy-
assisted,
 2nd  O2 dissociation
 channel
 decreases
 with  increasing
 crystal
 reduction.
 Additionally,
 it is
 found
in
 the  STM  studies
 that the  Ti interstitial
 diffusion
 is  slightly
 more
 facile  in  high-reduced
 TiO2(1
 1 0)  crys-
tals
 compared
 to  low-reduced
 ones.
 Accompanying
 TPD  studies
 revealed
 that  the  line  shape
 of the  O2-TPD
peak
 occurring
 between
 360
 K  and  450
 K
 depends
 on  the  crystal  reduction
 state.
 For  high-reduced
TiO2(1  1 0)  crystals
 characterized
 by  large  terraces  most  O2 molecules
 desorb
 at  386 K,  whereas
 O2
desorption
 is  peaking
 at  410  K  for  low-  and  medium-reduced
 crystals.
 Furthermore,
 the  O2-TPD  experi-
ments
 revealed
 a  highly
 non-linear
 behavior
 of  the  O2 desorption
 peak  integrals
 as  function
 of the  crystal
reduction
 state.  The  presented
 results
 point  to an  ionosorption
 model
 where
 the  adsorbates
 withdraw
the
 excess  charge
 (Ti3+)
 from  the  near-surface
 region
 at temperatures
 <  360  K and  where
 Ti
 interstitials
react
 with  oxygen
 species
 on  the  surface
 at  temperatures
  360  K.

 Introduction
Titanium
 dioxide
 (TiO2)
 is
 used
 in
 a
 wide
 number
 of
 tech-
nological
 fields
 such
 as
 photocatalysis,
 heterogeneous
 catalysis,
biocompatible
 materials,
 photovoltaic
 cells
 and
 gas
 sensors
 [19].
In
 all
 these
 applications
 the
 interaction
 of
 O2 with
 TiO2 plays
 an
important
 role.
 For
 example,
 O2 is
 a
 common
 oxidant
 and
 is
 used
in
 photocatalysis
 as
 a
 scavenger
 of
 the
 photoexcited
 electrons
 to
prevent
 negative
 charge
 accumulation
 on
 the
 surface
 of
 the
 cata-
lysts
 [1,2,5,9].
 Thus,
 to
 enhance
 the
 efficiencies
 in
 the
 current
 and
future
 applications
 of
 TiO2 it
 is
 essential
 to
 improve
 our
 fundamen-
tal
 understanding
 of
 how
 O2 interacts
 with
 TiO2 surfaces.
It
 is
 generally
 accepted
 that
 adsorbed
 O2 species
 acquire
 nega-
tive
 charge
 upon
 adsorption
 on
 TiO2 surfaces
 [7,918]. Theoretical
calculations
 have
 shown
 that
 excess
 charge
 can
 be
 donated
 by
all
 the
 various
 defects
 that
 are
 associated
 with
 Ti3+ such
 as
 O
vacancies,
 surplus
 H
 and
 interstitial
 Ti
 [12,14,15,1824].

excess
 electrons
 populate
 the
 normally
 empty
 Ti
 3d
 orbitals
 on
cations
 in
 the
 near
 and
 far
 proximity
 of
 the
 structural
 defects,
 lead-
ing
 to
 a
 state
 in
 the
 3.1
 eV
 wide
 band
 gap
 [4,10,13,2529].
 It
 is
this
 excess
 charge
 that
 can
 be
 donated
 to
 O2 species
 on
 the
 TiO2
surface
 [4,7,913,1518,26,27,30,31].
 However,
 which
 particular
structural
 defects
 provide
 most
 of
 the
 Ti3+ excess
 electrons
 and
are
 thus
 most
 relevant
 for
 the
 O2TiO2 interaction
 is
 today
 still
unsettled
 [9,17,30,32].
To
 disentangle
 the
 contributions
 of
 the
 individual
 defects
 for
chemical
 reactions
 on
 TiO2,
 the
 surface
 science
 approach
 [33]
 is
most
 promising.
 For
 surface
 science
 studies
 addressing
 TiO2, the
rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)(1
 ×
 1)
 surface
 has
 been
 often
 preferred
 (Fig.
 1)
[4,7,17,32,34,35].
 Upon
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 sample
 preparation
 in
 ultrahigh
vacuum
 (UHV),
 the
 crystals
 are
 reduced,
 leading
 to
 the
 creation
 of
bulk
 defects
 such
 as
 Ti
 interstitials
 and
 bridging
 O
 (Obr)
 vacancies
on
 the
 surface
 [4,13,35,36].
 Considering
 that
 scanning
 tunneling
microscopy
 (STM)
 studies
 addressing
 the
 anatase
 TiO2(101)
 sur-
face
 revealed
 the
 absence
 of
 surface
 O
 vacancies
 [37],
 the
 formation
of
 surface
 O
 vacancies
 in
 UHV
 may
 be
 a
 peculiar
 feature
 of
 rutile
crystals.
The
 interaction
 of
 O2 with
 rutile
 TiO2(1
 1
 0)
 has
 been
 stud-
ied
 previously
 using
 STM

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English.
