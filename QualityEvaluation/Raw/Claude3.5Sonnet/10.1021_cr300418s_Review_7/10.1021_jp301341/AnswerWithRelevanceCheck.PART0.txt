          [1] "In this mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."

          [2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4)."

          [3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

          The Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through the following steps:

          1. The reductant is oxidized by oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, not by adsorbed oxygen.
          2. This process creates oxygen vacancies on the surface.
          3. Gas-phase oxygen then reoxidizes the reduced surface, filling the vacancies.

          The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

          1. Lower ΔEv makes the surface a better oxidant, as it's easier to remove oxygen atoms for the oxidation reaction.
          2. However, the best oxidant is not necessarily the best catalyst. There needs to be a balance:
             - If ΔEv is too low, it becomes difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen.
             - If ΔEv is too high, the surface won't readily give up oxygen for the oxidation reaction.
          3. The ideal catalyst follows a "moderation principle": ΔEv should be low enough to allow easy removal of oxygen atoms, but not so low that reoxidation becomes difficult.
          4. Doping the oxide surface with low-valence dopants (LVDs) can lower ΔEv, potentially improving its catalytic activity, but care must be taken to maintain the right balance for optimal performance.

          In summary, while a lower ΔEv generally indicates a better oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, the optimal catalytic activity is achieved with a moderate ΔEv that balances the ease of oxygen removal and replenishment in the MvK mechanism.

          在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen（MvK）机理通过以下步骤运作：

          1. 还原剂被氧化物表面的氧原子氧化，而不是被吸附的氧气氧化。
          2. 这个过程在表面创造了氧空位。
          3. 气相氧然后重新氧化还原后的表面，填补空位。

          氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要：

          1. 较低的ΔEv使表面成为更好的氧化剂，因为更容易移除氧原子进行氧化反应。
          2. 然而，最好的氧化剂不一定是最好的催化剂。需要保持平衡：
             - 如果ΔEv太低，用气相氧重新氧化表面变得困难。
             - 如果ΔEv太高，表面不会轻易释放氧进行氧化反应。
          3. 理想的催化剂遵循"适度原则"：ΔEv应该足够低以允许容易移除氧原子，但不能低到使重新氧化变得困难。
          4. 用低价掺杂剂（LVDs）掺杂氧化物表面可以降低ΔEv，潜在地提高其催化活性，但必须注意保持适当的平衡以获得最佳性能。

          总之，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示氧化物表面具有更好的氧化能力，但最佳的催化活性是通过在MvK机制中平衡氧的去除和补充容易程度的适度ΔEv来实现的。
