[1] "In this mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."

[2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4)."

[3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

The Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through the following steps:

1. Surface oxygen atoms from the oxide catalyst oxidize the reductant (e.g., CO or CH4).
2. This process creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface.
3. Gas-phase oxygen then reoxidizes the reduced surface, filling the vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Lower ΔEv makes the surface a better oxidant, as it's easier to remove oxygen atoms for the oxidation reaction.
2. However, if ΔEv is too low, it becomes difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen.
3. The best catalysts strike a balance - oxygen should be easy enough to remove for oxidation, but not so easy that reoxidation becomes problematic.

This balance is referred to as the "moderation principle" in catalyst design. Doping oxides with low-valence dopants (LVDs) can lower ΔEv, potentially improving catalytic activity, but care must be taken not to lower it excessively.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen（MvK）机理通过以下步骤运作：

1. 氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子氧化还原剂（如CO或CH4）。
2. 这个过程在氧化物表面创造氧空位。
3. 气相氧然后重新氧化还原后的表面，填补空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要：

1. 较低的ΔEv使表面成为更好的氧化剂，因为更容易移除氧原子进行氧化反应。
2. 然而，如果ΔEv过低，用气相氧重新氧化表面会变得困难。
3. 最佳催化剂需要在这两者之间取得平衡 - 氧应该足够容易移除以进行氧化，但不能太容易以至于重新氧化成为问题。

这种平衡在催化剂设计中被称为"适度原则"。用低价掺杂剂（LVDs）掺杂氧化物可以降低ΔEv，潜在地提高催化活性，但必须注意不要过度降低它。
