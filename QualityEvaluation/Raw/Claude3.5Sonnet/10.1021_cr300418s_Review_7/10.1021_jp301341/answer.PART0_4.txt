[1] "In the MvK mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."

[2] "This implies that doping an oxide surface with a LVD makes it a better oxidant. This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4)."

[3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

The Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions operates through the following steps:

1. Surface oxygen atoms from the oxide catalyst oxidize the reductant (e.g., CO or CH4).
2. This process creates oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface.
3. Gas-phase oxygen then reoxidizes the reduced surface, filling the vacancies.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface:

1. Lower ΔEv makes the surface a better oxidant, as it's easier to remove oxygen atoms for the oxidation reaction.
2. However, extremely low ΔEv can be detrimental to catalytic activity, as it becomes difficult to reoxidize the surface with gas-phase oxygen.
3. The ideal catalyst follows a "moderation principle" - ΔEv should be low enough to facilitate oxidation but not so low that reoxidation becomes problematic.

Doping the oxide surface, particularly with low-valence dopants (LVDs), can be used to tune ΔEv and optimize catalytic performance. The goal is to find a balance that enhances the oxidizing ability of the surface while maintaining its ability to be reoxidized, thus sustaining the catalytic cycle.

Mars-van Krevelen (MvK)机理在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过以下步骤进行：

1. 氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子氧化还原剂（如CO或CH4）。
2. 这个过程在氧化物表面创造氧空位。
3. 气相氧随后重新氧化还原后的表面，填补空位。

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要：

1. 较低的ΔEv使表面成为更好的氧化剂，因为更容易移除氧原子进行氧化反应。
2. 然而，极低的ΔEv可能对催化活性有害，因为用气相氧重新氧化表面变得困难。
3. 理想的催化剂遵循"适度原则" - ΔEv应该足够低以促进氧化，但不能低到使重新氧化成为问题。

掺杂氧化物表面，特别是使用低价态掺杂剂（LVDs），可以用来调节ΔEv并优化催化性能。目标是找到一个平衡点，既能增强表面的氧化能力，又能保持其被重新氧化的能力，从而维持催化循环。
