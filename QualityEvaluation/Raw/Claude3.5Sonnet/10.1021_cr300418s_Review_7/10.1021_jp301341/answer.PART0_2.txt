[1] "In this mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen). The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."

[2] "This is not to say that the best oxidant is the best oxidation catalyst. In the MvK mechanism, the gas-phase oxygen reoxidizes the surface reduced by the reactant (e.g., CO or CH4)."

[3] "If the oxygen is too easy to remove, it is difficult to put it back. In designing an oxidation catalyst, by doping an oxide, one should aim for the middle ground: the dopant should make it easy to remove an oxygen atom, but not too easy. We call this a moderation principle."

The Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the oxidation of the reductant by oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, rather than by adsorbed oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to create oxygen vacancies, which makes the surface a better oxidant. This is because the surface oxygen atoms are more readily available for the oxidation reaction. However, the relationship between ΔEv and catalytic activity is not straightforward.

The best oxidation catalyst is not necessarily the one with the lowest ΔEv. In the MvK mechanism, after the surface oxygen is consumed in the oxidation reaction, gas-phase oxygen must reoxidize the reduced surface. If the ΔEv is too low, it becomes difficult to replenish the oxygen vacancies with gas-phase oxygen, which can hinder the overall catalytic cycle.

Therefore, an optimal oxidation catalyst should strike a balance in its ΔEv value. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation should be low enough to facilitate the oxidation of the reductant, but not so low that it prevents the reoxidation of the surface by gas-phase oxygen. This concept is referred to as the "moderation principle" in catalyst design.

In summary, while a lower ΔEv generally indicates a better oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, the optimal catalytic activity is achieved with a moderate ΔEv that balances the ease of oxygen removal and replenishment in the MvK mechanism.

在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen（MvK）机制涉及由氧化物表面的氧原子（而不是吸附的氧）氧化还原剂。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。

较低的ΔEv表示更容易创建氧空位，这使得表面成为更好的氧化剂。这是因为表面氧原子更容易参与氧化反应。然而，ΔEv与催化活性之间的关系并不简单。

最佳的氧化催化剂不一定是具有最低ΔEv的催化剂。在MvK机制中，表面氧在氧化反应中被消耗后，气相氧必须重新氧化还原的表面。如果ΔEv太低，就难以用气相氧补充氧空位，这可能会阻碍整个催化循环。

因此，最佳的氧化催化剂应在其ΔEv值上取得平衡。氧空位形成所需的能量应该足够低以促进还原剂的氧化，但又不能低到阻止气相氧对表面的再氧化。这个概念在催化剂设计中被称为"适度原则"。

总之，虽然较低的ΔEv通常表示氧化物表面具有更好的氧化能力，但最佳的催化活性是通过在MvK机制中平衡氧的去除和补充容易程度的适度ΔEv来实现的。
