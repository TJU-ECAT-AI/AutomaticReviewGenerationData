The provided literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). However, it does provide some relevant information about the role of oxygen vacancies in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

The literature suggests that oxygen vacancy formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts. Oxygen vacancies (Ov) are formed when reactive oxygen is removed from ceria during CO oxidation. These oxygen vacancies are generally helpful for activating O2 molecules.

The study found a volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancies and catalytic activity for CO oxidation. The presence of oxygen vacancies is favorable for CO oxidation, with optimal activity achieved at 1.5% oxygen vacancy concentration. However, further increases in oxygen vacancy concentration lead to decreased activity.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly mentioned, the described process of oxygen removal from the catalyst surface to form CO2, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst, is consistent with this mechanism. The literature also mentions that CO can react with active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which can affect CO oxidation either as reaction intermediates or spectators.

Although the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not discussed, the observed relationship between oxygen vacancy concentration and catalytic activity suggests that this energy requirement likely plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

提供的文献并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。但是，它确实提供了一些关于氧空位在基于氧化铈催化剂上进行CO氧化中的作用的相关信息。

文献表明，氧空位的形成是基于氧化铈催化剂上CO氧化的一个重要步骤。当在CO氧化过程中从氧化铈中移除活性氧时，会形成氧空位（Ov）。这些氧空位通常有助于活化O2分子。

研究发现，氧空位的数量与CO氧化的催化活性之间存在火山型关系。氧空位的存在有利于CO氧化，当氧空位浓度达到1.5%时，催化活性最佳。然而，进一步增加氧空位浓度会导致活性下降。

虽然没有明确提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但所描述的从催化剂表面移除氧以形成CO2，然后再氧化催化剂的过程与该机制一致。文献还提到，CO可以与活性氧物种反应生成碳酸盐，这些碳酸盐可以作为反应中间体或旁观者影响CO氧化。

尽管没有讨论氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv），但观察到的氧空位浓度与催化活性之间的关系表明，这种能量需求可能在决定催化活性和氧化物表面的氧化能力方面起着关键作用。
