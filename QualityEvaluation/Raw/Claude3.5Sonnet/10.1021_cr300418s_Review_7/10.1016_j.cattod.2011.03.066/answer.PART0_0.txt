[1] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation [1012]."

[2] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2 [13,14]."

[3] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov [1518]."

[4] "A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained. However, the activity decreases with further increase of oxygen vacancy."

The literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). However, it does provide some insights into the role of oxygen vacancies in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

The text indicates that oxygen vacancy formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria, occurring alongside CO2 production. Oxygen vacancies are generally beneficial for O2 activation. The relationship between oxygen vacancy concentration and catalytic activity is described as "volcano-like", with an optimal oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.5%. Beyond this point, increasing oxygen vacancy concentration leads to decreased activity.

The literature also mentions that CO can react with active oxygen species to form carbonates, which may act as reaction intermediates or spectators in the presence of oxygen vacancies. However, the specific details of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of ΔEv are not addressed in the given text.

这篇文献没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理或氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧空位在基于CeO2催化剂上CO氧化中作用的见解。

文中指出，在CeO2上进行CO氧化时，氧空位的形成是一个重要步骤，伴随着CO2的生成。氧空位通常有利于O2的活化。氧空位浓度与催化活性之间的关系被描述为"火山型"，最佳氧空位浓度为1.5%。超过这个点，增加氧空位浓度会导致活性降低。

文献还提到，CO可以与活性氧物种反应形成碳酸盐，在氧空位存在的情况下，这些碳酸盐可能作为反应中间体或旁观者。然而，给定的文本中没有涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理的具体细节和ΔEv的重要性。
