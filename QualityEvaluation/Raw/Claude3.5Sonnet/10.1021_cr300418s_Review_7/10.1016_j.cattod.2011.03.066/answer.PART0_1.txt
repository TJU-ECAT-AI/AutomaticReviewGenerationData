[1] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation [1012]."

[2] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2 [13,14]."

[3] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov [1518]."

[4] "A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained."

The provided literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. However, the text does provide some relevant information about the role of oxygen vacancies in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

The literature suggests that oxygen vacancy formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts. Oxygen vacancies are formed when reactive oxygen is removed from ceria during CO oxidation. The presence of oxygen vacancies is generally beneficial for the activation of O2, which is a crucial step in oxidation reactions.

The text describes a "volcano-like relationship" between the amount of oxygen vacancy and catalyst activity for CO oxidation. This implies that there is an optimal amount of oxygen vacancies for catalytic activity. Specifically, the best activity was observed when the oxygen vacancy amount was 1.5%. This suggests that while oxygen vacancies are important for catalytic activity, too many vacancies can be detrimental to performance.

The literature also mentions that CO can react with active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which can affect CO oxidation either as a reaction intermediate or as a spectator species. This indicates that the role of oxygen vacancies in oxidation reactions is complex and can involve multiple reaction pathways.

While the text does not explicitly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or ΔEv, the information provided about oxygen vacancies and their role in CO oxidation is consistent with aspects of this mechanism, which involves the participation of lattice oxygen in oxidation reactions and the subsequent regeneration of oxygen vacancies.

提供的文献并没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或氧空位形成能(ΔEv)在决定催化活性和氧化物表面氧化能力方面的作用。然而，文本确实提供了一些关于氧空位在基于CeO2催化剂上CO氧化中作用的相关信息。

文献表明，氧空位的形成是基于CeO2催化剂上CO氧化的重要步骤。当反应性氧从CeO2中移除时，就会形成氧空位。氧空位的存在通常有利于O2的活化，这是氧化反应的关键步骤。

文本描述了氧空位数量和催化剂活性之间的"火山型关系"。这意味着催化活性存在最佳的氧空位数量。具体来说，当氧空位数量为1.5%时，观察到最佳活性。这表明虽然氧空位对催化活性很重要，但过多的空位可能会降低性能。

文献还提到，CO可以与活性氧物种反应生成碳酸盐，这可能会影响CO氧化，要么作为反应中间体，要么作为旁观者存在于氧空位中。这表明氧空位在氧化反应中的作用是复杂的，可能涉及多个反应途径。

虽然文本没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或ΔEv，但提供的关于氧空位及其在CO氧化中作用的信息与该机制的某些方面是一致的。该机制涉及晶格氧参与氧化反应以及随后氧空位的再生。
