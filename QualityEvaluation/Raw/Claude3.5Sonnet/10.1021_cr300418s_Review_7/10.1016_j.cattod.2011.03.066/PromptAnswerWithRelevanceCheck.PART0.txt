<quotes>
[1] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation [1012]."

[2] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2 [13,14]."

[3] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov [1518]."

[4] "A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained. However, the activity decreases with further increase of oxygen vacancy."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). However, it does provide some insights into the role of oxygen vacancies in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

The text indicates that oxygen vacancy formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria, occurring alongside CO2 production. Oxygen vacancies are generally beneficial for O2 activation. The relationship between oxygen vacancy concentration and catalytic activity is described as "volcano-like", with an optimal oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.5%. Beyond this point, increasing oxygen vacancy concentration leads to decreased activity.

The literature also mentions that CO can react with active oxygen species to form carbonates, which may act as reaction intermediates or spectators in the presence of oxygen vacancies. However, the specific details of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and the significance of ΔEv are not addressed in the given text.

这篇文献没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机理或氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。然而，它确实提供了一些关于氧空位在基于CeO2催化剂上CO氧化中作用的见解。

文中指出，在CeO2上进行CO氧化时，氧空位的形成是一个重要步骤，伴随着CO2的生成。氧空位通常有利于O2的活化。氧空位浓度与催化活性之间的关系被描述为"火山型"，最佳氧空位浓度为1.5%。超过这个点，增加氧空位浓度会导致活性降低。

文献还提到，CO可以与活性氧物种反应形成碳酸盐，在氧空位存在的情况下，这些碳酸盐可能作为反应中间体或旁观者。然而，给定的文本中没有涉及Mars-van Krevelen机理的具体细节和ΔEv的重要性。

The provided literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. However, the text does provide some relevant information about the role of oxygen vacancies in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

The literature suggests that oxygen vacancy formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts. Oxygen vacancies are formed when reactive oxygen is removed from ceria during CO oxidation. The presence of oxygen vacancies is generally beneficial for the activation of O2, which is a crucial step in oxidation reactions.

The text describes a "volcano-like relationship" between the amount of oxygen vacancy and catalyst activity for CO oxidation. This implies that there is an optimal amount of oxygen vacancies for catalytic activity. Specifically, the best activity was observed when the oxygen vacancy amount was 1.5%. This suggests that while oxygen vacancies are important for catalytic activity, too many vacancies can be detrimental to performance.

The literature also mentions that CO can react with active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which can affect CO oxidation either as a reaction intermediate or as a spectator species. This indicates that the role of oxygen vacancies in oxidation reactions is complex and can involve multiple reaction pathways.

While the text does not explicitly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or ΔEv, the information provided about oxygen vacancies and their role in CO oxidation is consistent with aspects of this mechanism, which involves the participation of lattice oxygen in oxidation reactions and the subsequent regeneration of oxygen vacancies.

提供的文献并没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或氧空位形成能(ΔEv)在决定催化活性和氧化物表面氧化能力方面的作用。然而，文本确实提供了一些关于氧空位在基于CeO2催化剂上CO氧化中作用的相关信息。

文献表明，氧空位的形成是基于CeO2催化剂上CO氧化的重要步骤。当反应性氧从CeO2中移除时，就会形成氧空位。氧空位的存在通常有利于O2的活化，这是氧化反应的关键步骤。

文本描述了氧空位数量和催化剂活性之间的"火山型关系"。这意味着催化活性存在最佳的氧空位数量。具体来说，当氧空位数量为1.5%时，观察到最佳活性。这表明虽然氧空位对催化活性很重要，但过多的空位可能会降低性能。

文献还提到，CO可以与活性氧物种反应生成碳酸盐，这可能会影响CO氧化，要么作为反应中间体，要么作为旁观者存在于氧空位中。这表明氧空位在氧化反应中的作用是复杂的，可能涉及多个反应途径。

虽然文本没有明确讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或ΔEv，但提供的关于氧空位及其在CO氧化中作用的信息与该机制的某些方面是一致的。该机制涉及晶格氧参与氧化反应以及随后氧空位的再生。

The given literature does not contain information about the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the significance of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. The text primarily focuses on CO oxidation over an Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst and the effects of oxygen vacancies and carbonates on the catalyst's activity. It does not discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the specific energy requirements for oxygen vacancy formation.

The provided literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). However, it does provide some relevant information about the role of oxygen vacancies in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

The literature suggests that oxygen vacancy formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts. Oxygen vacancies (Ov) are formed when reactive oxygen is removed from ceria during CO oxidation. These oxygen vacancies are generally helpful for activating O2 molecules.

The study found a volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancies and catalytic activity for CO oxidation. The presence of oxygen vacancies is favorable for CO oxidation, with optimal activity achieved at 1.5% oxygen vacancy concentration. However, further increases in oxygen vacancy concentration lead to decreased activity.

While the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not explicitly mentioned, the described process of oxygen removal from the catalyst surface to form CO2, followed by re-oxidation of the catalyst, is consistent with this mechanism. The literature also mentions that CO can react with active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which can affect CO oxidation either as reaction intermediates or spectators.

Although the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is not discussed, the observed relationship between oxygen vacancy concentration and catalytic activity suggests that this energy requirement likely plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

提供的文献并未直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。但是，它确实提供了一些关于氧空位在基于氧化铈催化剂上进行CO氧化中的作用的相关信息。

文献表明，氧空位的形成是基于氧化铈催化剂上CO氧化的一个重要步骤。当在CO氧化过程中从氧化铈中移除活性氧时，会形成氧空位（Ov）。这些氧空位通常有助于活化O2分子。

研究发现，氧空位的数量与CO氧化的催化活性之间存在火山型关系。氧空位的存在有利于CO氧化，当氧空位浓度达到1.5%时，催化活性最佳。然而，进一步增加氧空位浓度会导致活性下降。

虽然没有明确提到Mars-van Krevelen机制，但所描述的从催化剂表面移除氧以形成CO2，然后再氧化催化剂的过程与该机制一致。文献还提到，CO可以与活性氧物种反应生成碳酸盐，这些碳酸盐可以作为反应中间体或旁观者影响CO氧化。

尽管没有讨论氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv），但观察到的氧空位浓度与催化活性之间的关系表明，这种能量需求可能在决定催化活性和氧化物表面的氧化能力方面起着关键作用。
