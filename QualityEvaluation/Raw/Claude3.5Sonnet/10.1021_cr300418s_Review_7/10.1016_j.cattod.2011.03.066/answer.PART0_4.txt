[1] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation [1012]."

[2] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2 [13,14]."

[3] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov [1518]."

The provided literature does not directly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). However, it does mention some related concepts in the context of CO oxidation on ceria-based catalysts.

The text indicates that oxygen vacancy (Ov) formation is an important step in CO oxidation on ceria. This process involves the removal of reactive oxygen from ceria, which leads to the formation of CO2. The presence of oxygen vacancies is generally beneficial for activating O2 molecules.

The literature also suggests that CO can react with active oxygen species to form carbonates, which can influence CO oxidation. These carbonates may act either as reaction intermediates or as spectator species in the presence of oxygen vacancies.

While these concepts are related to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the text does not provide specific information about how this mechanism operates or the significance of ΔEv in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

提供的文献并没有直接讨论Mars-van Krevelen机制或氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。然而，它确实在二氧化铈基催化剂上进行CO氧化的背景下提到了一些相关概念。

文中指出，氧空位（Ov）的形成是二氧化铈上CO氧化的一个重要步骤。这个过程涉及从二氧化铈中移除活性氧，从而形成CO2。氧空位的存在通常有利于激活O2分子。

文献还表明，CO可以与活性氧物种反应形成碳酸盐，这可能会影响CO氧化。这些碳酸盐可能作为反应中间体或在氧空位存在的情况下作为旁观者物种。

虽然这些概念与Mars-van Krevelen机制有关，但文本并没有提供关于该机制如何运作或ΔEv在确定催化活性和氧化物表面氧化能力方面的重要性的具体信息。
