Abstract
A number of elementary reactions at metal surfaces show a linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation between the activation energy and
the reaction energy, and reactions belonging to the same class even follow the same relation. We investigate the implications of this finding
on the kinetics of surface-catalyzed chemical processes. We focus in particular on the variation in the activity from one metal to the next.
By analyzing a number of simple microkinetic models we show that the reaction rate under given reaction conditions shows a maximum
as a function of the dissociative adsorption energy of the key reactant, and that for most conditions this maximum is in the same range of
reaction energies. We also provide a database of chemisorption energies calculated using density-functional theory for a number of simple
gas molecules on 13 different transition metals. An important part of the analysis consists of developing a general framework for analyzing
the maximum rate. We use these concepts to rationalize trends in the catalytic activity of a number of metals for the methanation process.

1. Introduction
One of the most fundamental concepts in heterogeneous
catalysis is the volcano curve [1]. It has been established
empirically that a volcano-shaped curve is obtained when
the activity of catalysts for a certain reaction is plotted as a
function of a parameter relating to the ability of the catalyst
surface to form chemical bonds to reactants, reaction inter-
mediates, or products [2,3]. Such relations are interesting
from a scientific point of view since they point to important
aspects of the reaction, and they are also useful as guidelines
in the search for new catalysts [4,5].
An important problem in connection with volcano curves
is which fundamental parameters the catalytic activity de-
pends on. Activities have been correlated with various elec-
tronic properties of the catalyst [1], and it seems natural to
relate the activity to bond energies. Here bond energies de-
rived from bulk carbide or oxide properties [5,6] or various
atomic or molecular chemisorption energies [7] have been

used. The question is which energy is the most relevant. In
addition there is a problem of finding systematic databases
of relevant surface thermo-chemical data. The fact that many
volcano curves are plotted as a function of a bulk heat of
formation is related to the latter problemonly bulk thermo-
chemical data are widely available. In the present paper we
will address both problems. We will discuss in some detail
the choice of the most relevant interaction energy that de-
scribes the catalytic activity of a metal surface, and we will
present extensive surface thermo-chemical databases based
on density-functional theory calculations.
It was recently established that for dissociative chemi-
sorption of a number of molecules the activation energy
depends linearly on the reaction energy1 [811]. Such a
BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relation has often been as-
sumed implicitly to hold for surface reactions, and in a few
cases a BEP relation has been established for a set of cat-
alysts [6]. It is, however, only with the extensive use of

gies), are given with the same sign convention as reaction enthalpies. This
means that an exothermic reaction has negative reaction energy.

density-functional theory (DFT) calculations that it has been
possible to establish such relations firmly for a number of
systems. An unexpected result from these calculations was
the findings that not only do many surface reactions fol-
low BEP relationships, there are classes of similar reactions
which follow the same universal relationship [8]. This is
illustrated for N2, CO, NO, and O2 dissociation in Fig. 1.
Subsequent calculations have confirmed these results and
have shown similar universal BEP relations to hold also for
other surface reactions [12].
In the following it is shown that the linear BEP rela-
tionship in a number of cases leads directly to volcano
curves where the fundamental parameter is the dissociative
chemisorption energy of the key2 reactant. We analyze sev-
eral simple kinetic models to understand how the volcano
curve depends on the mechanism and on the number of pos-
sible rate-determining steps. An important outcome of this
analysis is that for a class of reactions involving key reac-
tants that follows the same BEP relation, the maximum in
the volcano curve is found generally to be in the same range
of reaction energies, independent of the reaction, and that

mining.
variations in the position of the maximum with reaction con-
ditions can be understood in some detail.
The concepts developed here are tested by showing ex-
cellent agreement with experimental results for hydrogena-
tion of CO to hydrocarbons, i.e., methanation and Fischer
Tropsch synthesis. We have synthesized a series of sup-
ported catalysts and determined their activity toward CO
methanation. It is found that the measured activity plotted
against the calculated dissociative CO chemisorption energy
results in a very nice volcano curve with a maximum in the
universal range [8] proposed by our analysis.
The main conclusion of this work is that the dissocia-
tive chemisorption energy is a good descriptor of the cat-
alytic activity for a series of simple catalytic reactions. As
an aid to understanding trends in catalytic activities for other
reactions, we present systematic DFT calculations of reac-
tion energies for molecular and dissociative chemisorption
for a large number of molecules on stepped surfaces of the
13 transition metals most commonly used in heterogeneous
catalysis.
2. Evaluation of four simple kinetic models
In the following the simplest possible surface-catalyzed
reactions are considered. The aim here is not to describe any
particular reaction in detail, but to bring out the basic para-
meters determining the reactivity. Later we will show that
the general principles work well for real catalytic processes.
We will consider reactions, which can be viewed as acti-
vation (dissociation) of a key reactant followed by removal
of the dissociation products by further reaction with a sec-
ondary reactant. Ammonia synthesis can, for instance, be
viewed as activation of N2 followed by removal of adsorbed
N by hydrogen, FischerTropsch synthesis is activation of
CO, NO reduction is activation of NO, and oxidation reac-
tions can be viewed as activation of O2 followed by removal
of oxygen from the surface by the reductant.
2.1. Case 1: Dissociative adsorption as rate-determining
step
1. A2 + 22A
2. A+ B AB + 
It is assumed that A2 binds weakly (or not at all) to the
surface; hence the coverage of A2 is negligible. We write re-
action (2) as if the gas-phase molecule B reacts directly with
an adsorbed atom A, but this reaction may involve several
elementary steps, including adsorption of B. Then, the only
approximation is that the coverage of B is negligible. This
case is for instance analogous to ammonia synthesis under
industrially relevant conditions (with A = N and B = 3
2H2).
Let us assume in analogy with the ammonia synthesis reac-
tion that the first step is rate determining. Then the rate of

for the overall gas-phase reaction A2 + 2B 2AB, and Keq
is the corresponding equilibrium constant.
Since reaction (2) is in equilibrium, the coverage of free
sites is given by

where
(4)
Ki = eSi/kBeEi/kBT
is the equilibrium constant for reaction i, with correspond-
ing reaction entropy, Si, and energy, Ei.3 In Eq. (3) we
express the blocking of sites by adsorption of A atoms in
terms of E1 instead of E2 by introducing the approach
to equilibrium γ . This has the useful effect that all the vari-
ations from one catalyst to the next are described by Ea and
E1 [see Eq. (1)].
The basic premises throughout the present work is that
Ea and E1 are linearly related (Fig. 1),
(5)
Ea = α1E1 + β1,
and we shall use the values α1 = 0.87 and β1 = 1.34 eV as
determined in Ref. [8] but the precise values of these con-
stants are not important in the context presented here. The
linear relationship means that the catalyst can be described
by a single parameter, E1, while the most important effects
having to do with the overall reaction and the reaction con-
ditions are described by γ . Combining Eqs. (1), (2), (4), and
(5) shows that for Case 1 all reactions have the same kinetics
as a function of E1 for a given approach to equilibrium.
Since different reactions may be run with quite differ-
ent approaches to equilibrium, we study the effect of vary-
ing γ . The result is shown in Fig. 2. There is a noticeable
shift in the maximum to stronger bonding (more negative
E1) when the approach to equilibrium becomes smaller.
This means that for a given reaction, the choice of best cat-
alyst depends on the approach to equilibrium as discussed
in Ref. [14]. When comparing different reactions, it is worth
3 In the context of the trends discussed in this paper the difference be-
tween enthalpy and energy is insignificant and we will use energy every-
where.

values of γ = 0.999, 101, 105, 109, and 1013. The parameters used
are typical of a catalytic reaction: T = 600 K, S1 = 200 J/(K mol),
PA2 = 25 bar. For equilibrium-limited reactions, such as ammonia synthe-
sis, the approach to equilibrium will vary from 0 at the inlet of the reactor
bed to ideally 1 at the outlet. The optimal catalyst thus depends on the po-
sition in the reactor bed (see Ref. [14]).
noting that the more exothermic the gas-phase reaction, the
larger Keq, and the smaller the approach to equilibrium for a
given conversion (given by P 2
AB/(PA2P 2
B)). This means that
very exothermic reactions will have a maximum for metals
with stronger binding energies (further to the left in the Pe-
riodic Table, see Table 1).
The results in Fig. 2 are for a typical set of parameters,
T = 600 K, S1 = 200 J/(K mol), PA2 = 25 bar. The en-
tropy loss due to adsorption, S1, is typical for molecular
adsorptionsince most degrees of freedom are frozen out at
the surface, it is roughly given by the gas-phase entropy of
the molecule, which is essentially independent of the mole-
cule in question for simple gas-phase molecules [15].
To ensure that the results are not depending strongly on
the other parameters we show in Fig. 3 how the position
of the volcano depends on reaction conditions. The depen-
dence is modest, but quite interesting. A low temperature
process clearly needs a more noble catalyst (noble being
short for a catalyst with a less negative value of E1) than a
high-temperatureprocess, the decisive factor being the avail-
ability of free sites on the surface rather than the activation
of the reactant molecules. It should be noted, however, that
for the type of active sites (a given BEP line) considered here
it is difficult to exploit a low-temperature process even if a
very noble (high E1) catalyst is used. This is because at
the values of E1 where there are free sites on the surface,
the activation of the reactants is so slow that the absolute val-
ues of the turnover rates are extremely low. Completely new
active sites are needed for such processes, as, for instance,
illustrated recently by the very small gold particles, which
can be active even at room temperature [1618].

2.2. Case 2: Dissociative adsorption as rate-determining
step with a strongly adsorbed molecular precursor
We now include the possibility of a strongly adsorbed
molecular precursor.
1a. A2 + A2
1b. A2+ 2A
2. A+ B AB + 
We still assume A2 dissociation to be rate determining,
but now the rate-determining step is a surface reaction, not
the adsorption process. The rate is

r(T,Px) = 2k1bθA2θ(1 γ ).
The coverage of the molecularly adsorbed state is

and

k1b = ν1be(EaE1a)/kBT ,
where now the activation energy of the dissociation is given
by the transition state energy Ea and the molecular adsorp-
tion energy E1a.
Fig. 4. shows the calculated rate as a function of E1
for values of E1a between 0.75 and 2 eV. For values of
E1a larger than 1 eV there is essentially no effect, but for
stronger precursor bonding energies there is a considerable
shift in the position of the maximum toward more reactive
catalysts (more negative E1).
2.3. Case 3: Dissociative adsorption as rate-determining
step followed by reaction with a strongly adsorbed species
In the cases considered until now, the coverage of B on
the surface has been assumed to be unimportant. We now
include the possibility that B is strongly adsorbed onto the
surface.

We still assume A2 dissociation to be rate determining:

(1 γ ).
The coverage of free sites is now given by

θ=

K1PA2γ + K2aPB
.
In this case a shift in the volcano maximum toward more
negative values of E1 (stronger bonding of A to the sur-
face) appears when B binds stronger to the surface. The shift
simply results from the competition of A and B adsorbates
for sites on the surface, and it turns out that the kinetics be-
haves exactly as if B were a molecular precursor. The same
will be true of any other adsorbate state competing for sites
on the surface.
2.4. Case 4: Dissociative adsorption as rate-determining
step followed by a reaction with two product-channels
We now examine the case of a hetero-nuclear reactant.

For the coverage of free sites we have
(16)
θ=

meaning that we have now separated the coverage term into
a term describing the properties of the reactant (K1 or, equiv-
alently, E1), one describing the overall gas-phase reac-
tion (γ ), and one describing the heterogeneity of the pro-
ducts (ξ). In most cases E1 will capture the main trends
from one catalyst to the next, see Fig. 2. Since in most cases
(CO or NO hydrogenation, for instance) ξ 1, this factor
will tend to compensate γ .
We conclude that the simplest possible kinetic models of
a surface-catalyzed reaction with a single rate-determining
step directly lead to the dissociative chemisorption energy
as the natural measure of the reactivity. The reason is the
obvious one, that the two parameters characterizing the ki-
netics, the activation energy Ea of the rate-determining step
and the dissociative chemisorption energy, E1, are linearly
related.
The assumption of a single rate-determining step, may,
however be too restrictive as discussed for instance by
Campbell [19] and Dumesic [20,21]. We will therefore in the
following discuss how much this picture changes if we relax
the assumption that there is only a single rate-determining
step.
3. Reactions with competing rate-determining steps
We now return to Case 1, but make no assumption about
the relative approaches to equilibrium of steps (1) and (2).
A schematic illustration of the reaction potential energy dia-
gram is shown in Fig. 5. In Case 1 there are only two steps,
but the analysis below will also describe reactions where
there are several steps and two of them, adsorption and some
other surface reaction step following that, can simultane-
ously be rate determining. For the case of CO hydrogenation,
for instance, we could be looking at CO dissociation and an-
other step, such as adsorbed C reacting with hydrogen, see
Fig. 6.

adsorption of A2, dissociation of A2, and two times reaction with B to form

We write the net rates of the two reaction steps as we
assume that the coverage of A2 is negligible:
r1 = 2k1PA2θ2

r2 = k2PBθA k2PABθ= k2PBθA
1 k2PABθ
k2PBθA
(18)
= k2PBθA(1 γ2),
where we have introduced the approaches to equilibrium
for each step, γ1 and γ2. These variables, which are also fre-
quently called the reversibilities [20], describe how close
each reaction step is to equilibrium in the de Donder
sense [22]. In the stationary coverage situation, which we
shall assume throughout, it is evident that the net rate of re-
action (2) is the same as that of reaction (1), as reaction (1)
describes the net production of sites covered with atom A
due to dissociative adsorption, and reaction (2) describes the
net removal of A atoms from the surface due to desorption.
The rates r1 and r2 are thus equivalent descriptions of the
total rate of the catalytic process. The exact solution of the
microkinetic model is obtained by numerically solving the
Eqs. (17), (18) under the constraint of site conservation.
The rate constants, k1 = ν1eEa/kBT , k1 = ν1 ×
eEa/kBT , k2 = ν2eEa2/kBT , and k2 = ν2eEa2/kBT are
given by the activation energies, as indicated in Fig. 5, and
from some simple assumptions about the reaction entropies
which are discussed below. The activation energy for ad-
sorption is discussed above. In the present case we also need
those for the forward and backward surface reaction, Ea2
and Ea2. For the forward rate we assume in analogy with
Eq. (5) that there is a BEP relation,
(19)
Ea2 = α2E1 + β2,
where now α2 is negative, such that the stronger A bonds
to the surface, the higher the activation energy. If step (2)

cases.

Eais given from E1 and Ea and similarly Ea2is given
from Ea2, E1, and the reaction enthalpy of the gas phase
reaction, E0; see Fig. 5.
The surface reaction prefactors ν1 and ν2, for redes-
orption of A2 and forward reaction of AB, respectively,
have both been set to (kBT )/h, which results from as-
suming negligible entropy of the adsorped species and a
strongly constrained transition state with a partition function
of unity [23]. The gas reaction prefactors ν1 and ν2 are then
determined under the assumption of zero reaction entropy of
step (2) and by assuming a gas-phase entropy of diatomic
molecules of 200 J/(K mol). The former assumption turns
out to only have a very limited effect on the position of the
maximum of the volcano curve, while the latter assumption
is approximately valid for all of the relevant diatomic mole-
cules [15].
In Fig. 7 the solutions of the microkinetic model for three
different sets of parameters are shown. The calculated po-
tential energy surfaces in Fig. 6 [2426] show an activation
barrier for further surface reaction, Ea2, of the order 1.0 to
1.5 eV. All the cases included in Fig. 6 are for catalyst sur-
faces close to the optimum, with values of E1 in the range
from 1.0 to 1.5 eV. This limits the variation of α2 and β2,
and the cases included in Fig. 7 all give activation barriers in
the range dictated by the three reactions in Fig. 6.
Comparing the volcano curves of Fig. 7 to those of Fig. 2,
the main difference is that at adequately negative values of
E1 there is a break in the volcano curves because the sur-
face reaction (A + B AB) becomes rate determining. The
more activated the second reaction, the further the maximum
moves to the right. This means that the inclusion of the pos-
sibility of a second rate-limiting step removes a large part of
the shift in the maximum of the volcano curves for reactions
very far from equilibrium and for reactions with strongly
bound molecular precursors. This means that the largest shift
in the maximum of the volcano to negative values of E1 for
reactions very far from equilibrium is eliminated.
We note that independent of the exact value of the para-
meters α2 and β2, the maximum in rate is observed to be
catalysts that provides dissociative chemisorption energies
in the range E1 = 1.0 2.0 eV. While this might ap-
pear as a broad range, it typically spans only two neighbors
in the Periodic Table, cf. Table 1. The differences in E1 for
CO or N2 from one surface to the next surface to the right or
left in the Periodic Table is 0.51.0 eV. This range therefore
defines the best catalysts quite well.
In order to understand the results in Fig. 7 and in order to
be able to treat the general case with more than two possi-
ble rate-determining steps, we consider a limiting behavior
closely related to the Sabatier principle [27]. The Sabatier
principle states that the catalytic activity for a given reaction
follows a volcano curve through the Periodic Table, because
an intermediate binding of reaction intermediates to the sur-
face will give an optimal catalyst. The usual interpretation is
that for very reactive surfaces, the rate-determining step will
be desorption of product molecules from the surface, while
the rate-determining step for more noble surfaces will be the
dissociative chemisorption of reactants [27]. This suggests
that the optimal catalytic surface is a surface where there
is competition between dissociation and desorption, with a
maximum turnover frequency at the point of switching be-
tween free and occupied sites.
Inspecting Case 1 again, a simplified solution, which we
shall denote the Sabatier analysis, is obtained as follows. We
define the approach to equilibrium for the combined reac-
tion,
(20)

and use that
(21)
Keq = K1K2

or
(22)
γ = γ1γ 2

If we limit our interest to net reactions proceeding in the
forward direction, we have
(23)
0 γ 1,
0 γ1 1,
0 γ2 1.
Together with the Eq. (22) above, this implies
(24)
0 γ γ1 1
and
0 γ γ 2
2 1.
Now the Sabatier principle can be stated in mathemati-
cal terms for Case 1. When a reactive surface is used as the
catalyst, the surface coverage will be high (θA 1) and the
desorption reaction will be the rate-determining step (γ1 1
and γ2 γ ). The net turnover frequency of the reaction
should be well approximated by
(25)
r = k2PB
1 γ
.
On the other side of the peak of the volcano, dissociative
chemisorption is rate determining (γ1 γ and γ2 1) and
the coverage of free sites dominates (θ1). The turnover
frequency should here be well described by
(26)
r = 2k1PA2(1 γ ).
Because each coverage has an upper bound of 1, the total
rate must be bounded by both (25) and (26). This gives a
volcano
(27)
r = min
2k1PA2(1 γ ),k2PB
1 γ
,
which we shall refer to as the Sabatier volcano curve.
In Fig. 7, it can be seen that the Sabatier volcano gives
an excellent description of the corresponding microkinetic
model in the case where γ 0. The only discrepancy oc-
curs near the top of the volcano, where the Sabatier analysis,
as we have constructed it here, fails to describe the switch-
ing of coverage. In general the Sabatier principle holds very
well for the simple kinetic model as long as the approach
to equilibrium is small. It is also seen in Fig. 7 that close
to equilibrium, γ 1, the optimal catalyst is not defined
by the position of the maximum of the Sabatier volcano. In
this case the optimum moves toward more noble surfaces,
and the optimum is here well determined by a microkinetic
model that assumes dissociation is the rate-determining step.
For a microkinetic model with more than just two reaction
steps, a Sabatier analysis could be constructed in analogy
with the one presented here:
 Assume optimal coverages of all intermediates going
into the forward rates.
 Calculate the approach to equilibrium for each forward
rate from the given approach to equilibrium for the over-
all reaction, while assuming that all other partial reac-
tions are in equilibrium.
 Calculate the rate-constants going into each forward
rate, from the known BEP relationships for the given
intermediates.
This gives a first approximation to each forward rate, and
the Sabatier volcano is constructed by setting the total rate
equal to the minimum of all forward rates at each value of the
parameter describing the surface reactivity, which in our case
is the dissociative chemisorption energy of the reactant. In
general, such a Sabatier volcano would then be convex and
could have more than just the two usual sides corresponding
to desorption and dissociation limitation. If more than one
independent parameter is needed to describe the model, the
volcano will in general become a prism.
We conclude that the inclusion of more than one rate de-
termining step does not change the general conclusion that
E1 is a good parameter for characterizing the catalytic ac-
tivity of a metal catalyst, given that the reaction follows a
BEP relation as in Eq. (19). With the values chosen here,
corresponding to the universal BEP for the strongly bound
diatomic molecules (that includes N2, CO, O2, and NO), the
optimal catalysts have values of E1 in the range from 1
to 2 eV.
From this analysis it is clearly important to have access to
systematic databases of dissociative chemisorption energies.
In the following we present such a database calculated using
DFT. Even if the absolute accuracy of such calculations is
limited to about 0.20.3 eV [28] trends are generally well
described [11], and that is the most important in the present
context.
4. The surface thermo-chemistry database
The DFT calculations were performed within a plane-
wave pseudopotential implementation [29,30]. We used the
ultrasoft pseudopotentials of Vanderbilt [31] to represent the
ionic cores, allowing for a good treatment of first-row atoms
and transition metals with a relatively limited plane-wave ba-
sis. The plane-wave cutoff in the calculations was 25 Ry in
all cases, except for the cobalt surface, in which case a cutoff
of 35 Ry was chosen, due to the hardness of the correspond-
ing pseudopotential. All calculations were performed with
the RPBE exchange-correlation functional [28] on period-
ically repeated stepped metal slabs. The surface coverage
of the adsorbates was 1/6 in all cases, and the slab thick-
ness was 9 layers in the [211] direction for the fcc metals
and 11 layers in the [210] direction for the bcc metals. In
the case of the hcp metals (Ru and Co), the adsorption was
modeled by using the same type of fcc (211) slabs as for the
fcc metals. The fcc and the bcc surfaces exposed a terrace
of close-packed atoms, the (111) and (110) layers respec-
tively, and the uppermost close-packed layer, including the
step atoms were in all cases fully relaxed together with the
adsorbate atom/molecule. These stepped surfaces have been
chosen for maximal computational ease. Other steps and
crystal structures may lead to slightly different chemisorp-
tion properties. The choice of the bcc (210) surface is ex-
pected to lead to more stable chemisorption states than if a
more close-packed surface was used. N2 for example has a

The adsorption has been calculated on the fcc (211) surface in all cases
except for Fe, Mo, and W, for which the calculations were done on bcc (210)
surfaces. Zero point vibrational energies are not included. All energies are
given in eV.
dissociative chemisorption energy of 2.76 eV on the (210)
Mo surface, whereas the corresponding energy on the (321)
Mo surface is 1.86 eV. The lattice constants were chosen
as the calculated bulk lattice constant for the respective met-
als in their ground state structure using the RPBE functional.
This avoids reminiscent stress in the calculational setup. Be-
tween the metal slabs we introduced at least 8 Å of vacuum,
and the interaction between the dipole moments of the pe-
riodically repeated slabs was decoupled, by the introduction
of a dipole layer in the vacuum between the slabs [32]. We
used a k-point sampling of 4 × 4 × 1 MonkhorstPack spe-
cial points [33] in the x, y, and z directions, respectively;
the number of k points was reduced to 8 k points in the irre-
ducible Brillouin zone by timeinversion symmetry.
In the present calculations we have focused on systemat-
ically using the same accuracy in the calculation in terms of
number of layers, size of the unit cell, number of k points,
etc. Some of the results may therefore differ slightly from
earlier compilations of a number of different calculations [8]
due to differences in the number of layers, in the amount of
relaxation, and whether the self-consistent calculations are
done using one exchange correlation functional or another.
The results for dissociative chemisorption energies for a
number of transition metals are shown in Table 1. In Table 2,
molecular adsorption energies are tabulated for comparison.
A detailed comparison to available experimental values and
a discussion of trends will be presented elsewhere (T. Bli-
gaard, J.K. Nrskov, to be published).
The concepts developed here have already been tested ex-
tensively on ammonia synthesis [11,14]. In order to show
that they are more generally useful, we test them here by
considering another important reaction, the methane synthe-
sis from hydrogen and carbon monoxide. We have made a
systematic series of catalysts and measured their catalytic
activity under comparable conditions and will show that if
these new data are plotted against the calculated dissocia-
tive chemisorption energies for CO from Table 1, a very nice
volcano results with a maximum around 1.4 eV in perfect
agreement with the present analysis.
5. Application to methanation
Most of the catalysts considered here were made by
impregnation of 2-mm tablets of an alumina-stabilized
MgO support material (Mg:Al = 7:1) with a surface
area
of
35
m2/g.
Aqueous
solutions
of
Ni(NO3)2,
Pd(NH3)4(HCO3)2,
Pt(NH3)4(HCO3)2,
Rh(NO3)3,
NH4ReO4, IrCl3, RuNO(NO3)3, Fe(NO3)3, and Co(NO3)2
were used. The impregnated supports were all dried over-
night at 80 C, except for the Ni catalyst, which was heated
to 450 C for 1 h and the Ru catalyst, which was dried
at room temperature to avoid the creation of RuO4. The
metal concentrations were analyzed and were between 1 and
2 wt% metal for all catalysts, except for the Ni catalyst where
the concentration was just over 3 wt%. See Table 3 for exact
metal loadings.
Two different experimental setups were used to determine
the methanation activities of the catalysts. One test unit was
a differential flow reactor system previously described in
detail [34]. A U-tube glass-lined stainless-steel reactor (i.d.
4 mm) was loaded with 100200 mg of the catalysts (parti-
cle size 300600 m), which were fixed between two quartz
wool wads. The inlet gas consisted of 1% CO in hydrogen
and the inlet flow was 100 cm3/min (NTP). The low CO
concentration was chosen in order to suppress formation of
heavier hydrocarbons than methane [35]. A pump delivered
a recirculation flow rate of about 6000 cm3/min (NTP) en-
suring well-mixed conditions. The total pressure in the reac-
tor was set at 1.5 bars and the CO and CO2 concentration in
the reactor effluent was monitored with a calibrated BINOS
infrared detector. A blank test at 500 C showed that the
reactor system itself had no significant CO hydrogenation
activity. Before activity measurements, the catalysts were
reduced in flowing hydrogen (50 ml/min NTP) at 500 C
for 10 h. Each run consisted of a series of measurements
of the steady-state CO and CO2 concentrations at different
temperatures starting at 200 C and stopping when the CO
conversions were close to 100%.
The second test unit was an integral plug-flow reactor sys-
tem. The reactor was a U-tube made of quartz. It was loaded
with 100200 mg of catalyst, 150300 m sieved fraction.
Inlet flows were 60, 120, and 200 cm3/min (NTP) and the
feed gas was again 1% CO in hydrogen. Each run started
with a reduction of the catalyst in hydrogen (100 ml/min
NTP) at 500 C for 2 h. Reducing the Fe catalyst at 500 C
for 30 h instead of 2 had no effect on the activity. The reactor
pressure was about 1.01.2 bar and the reactor effluent com-
positions were determined with a calibrated mass spectrom-
eter. The catalyst activities were measured at temperatures
ranging from 200 to 550 C.

Fig. 8. Activities of different supported transition metals as a function of
the reaction energy for dissociative CO chemisorption. See text for details.
The uncertainty of the calculated adsorption energies is estimated from ex-
perience to be 0.15 eV, while the uncertainty of the activities is mostly
related to not knowing the exact number of active step sites. The disso-
ciative chemisorption energy for CO on Re, which is not included in the
database, has been calculated to be 3.94 eV. The step on the Re surface
was modeled by a fcc (211) slab.
For the differential reactor system, activities were deter-
mined from inlet and effluent CO concentrations (conversion
of CO to CO2 was negligible in all experiments), while for
the integral flow reactor system the activities were deter-
mined from the effluent CH4 concentration. It was evident
from the measurements that methane was the only hydro-
carbon formed in significant amounts; i.e., the two ways of
determining the activity give equal results. The data were
analyzed assuming a reaction order in CO and CH4 equal
to zero for all metals and the reaction order in hydrogen is
not important since the hydrogen pressure is practically con-
stant during the experiments. These assumptions about the
kinetics are supported by the observation that analyzing the
data obtained at different inlet flows from the integral reac-
tor gives rise to very similar results. To enable a comparison
of the activities at the same temperature, activation energies
were determined based on measurements where the CO con-
version was below 80%. All activities were determined with
respect to the quantity of metal contained in the catalyst.
The measured CO methanation activities as a function of
the calculated values of E1 for dissociative CO adsorption
at 550 K are shown in Fig. 8. There is a clear volcano rela-
tion. What is more, the maximum of the volcano is approxi-
mately at a dissociative adsorption energy of 1.4 eV, which
is in very good agreement with the prediction above [8].
Fig. 9. Activities of different supported transition metals as a function of
molecular CO chemisorption energies.
Although obtained for different catalysts (silica-support-
ed transition metals) under different conditions (CO:H2 =
1:3) the experimental CO hydrogenation data of Vannice [7]
show the same trend in activity when plotted against the
same reaction energy showing that the general concept is not
dependent on the details of the catalyst preparation or the
measurement of the catalytic activity. The absolute values of
the activities are also similar indicating that the assumption
of a reaction order in CO of zero is good. Since heavier hy-
drocarbons than methane were formed in the experiments of
Vannice [7] it is evident that the volcano curve is also valid
for FischerTropsch synthesis.
Vannice [7] suggested correlating the catalytic activity to
the molecular CO adsorption energy. When that is done us-
ing molecular adsorption energies from Table 2 there is no
significant correlation; see Fig. 9. This is a clear indication
that the dissociative adsorption energy is the important pa-
rameter in the problemthis is the energy, which is linearly
correlated with the activation barrier for CO dissociation.
It would be more correct to plot the activity as turnover
frequencies. However, this is difficult since the DFT calcu-
lations clearly show that it is only sites similar to the open
sites found at the steps on the most close packed surfaces
that are active for the CO dissociation reaction [8]. Molec-
ular N2 chemisorption at room temperature can be used to
determine the density of such sites in the case of nickel-
based catalysts, but there is no general method that can be
used for all catalysts. Vannice [7] determined the total metal
surface area using both molecular CO and dissociative H2
chemisorption, which, for unknown reasons, for some of the
metals resulted in quite different metal surface areas. How-
216

ever, plotting turnover frequencies based on these areas does
not change the general shape of the volcano curve.
6. Concluding remarks
In the present paper we have investigated the kinetic con-
sequences of the recent quantitative confirmation of the ex-
istence of BrnstedEvansPolanyitype relations between
the activation energy for dissociation and the dissociative
chemisorption energy for a number of diatomic molecules.
Using simple generic models of surface-catalyzed reac-
tions we have shown that the dissociative chemisorption en-
ergy, which is the reaction energy of the rate-determining
reaction, is usually a good descriptor of the catalytic activity
of a given metal in the sense that if the activity is plotted as a
function of this descriptor, a very reasonable volcano-curve
results. There are, however, dependencies on temperature,
pressure, and approach to equilibrium, and we have system-
atically investigated these.
We have also presented extensive databases of the adsorp-
tion energies, calculated using DFT.
It has been shown recently that a class of adsorption reac-
tions follows the same universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi
relation [8]. We have shown that if this relation is used in the
kinetics, it turns out that in most cases the optimal adsorption
energy (giving the largest catalytic activity) is in the range
from 1 to 2 eV. As suggested in Ref. [8] this means that
the universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation turns into a
universal criterion for the optimal catalysts for all reactions
belonging to the class.
The present analysis is simple and qualitative, but it ex-
plains reactivity trends for a number of reactions. We have
shown how it can be used quantitatively to understand the
volcano curve for the methanation reaction. All the best cat-
alysts for CO hydrogenationhave dissociative adsorption en-
ergies in the range from 1.0 to 1.6 eV. Similarly the best
catalysts for N2 hydrogenation (ammonia synthesis) have
dissociative N2 adsorption energies of 0.84 eV (Ru) and
1.27 eV (Fe) [36], the best catalyst for NO hydrogenation
has a dissociative NO adsorption energy of 1.27 (Pt) [37],
and the preferred catalyst for O2 hydrogenation has a disso-
ciative adsorption energy of 2.17 eV (Pt) [38] (there are no
pure metals with an O2 dissociative adsorption energy in the
range from 1 to 2 eV).
The present analysis only deals with catalytic activity.
For reactions where selectivity plays a role, the considera-
tions above cannot be used. While Pt has the largest turnover
for NO hydrogenation, Rh has a much larger selectivity for
N2 formation [37], which makes Rh a more interesting cata-
lyst. Another factor that is not included here is the possibility
that certain sites are poisoned during synthesis. Pt steps bind
CO much stronger than the terraces, while this is less of a
problem for Rh [39] and not a problem at all for Pd [24].
Such factors may, for instance, be important in making Pt
less interesting than the two other metals as catalysts for the
NOCO reaction [4042].
It is interesting to note that the volcano curves generated
from the BEP relations are broada typical width is of the
order 1 eV; see Fig. 7. Whereas the rates of the individual
elementary steps vary on a thermal energy scale (an order
of magnitude in rate corresponds roughly to an energy of
2kBT ), the net rate varies much more slowly. This is a di-
rect consequence of the fact that around the maximum in the
volcano, the net rate is a competition between fast adsorp-
tion (being helped by stronger bonds to the surface) and fast
surface reaction/desorption (being helped by weaker bonds
to the surface). This weak dependence on the adsorption en-
ergy can be directly observed in the experimental data for
CO hydrogenation in Fig. 8, and it is more generally ob-
servable in the fact that if a certain metal is a good catalyst
for a reaction the neighbor in the periodic table is usually
also reasonable. Since typical differences in adsorption en-
ergy between neighbors in the periodic table are also of the
order 1 eV (see Table 1), this is the energy scale over which
the net rate changes. This means that the accuracy we have
in the DFT calculations is ample for obtaining reliable trends
in reactivity.
It has been observed that the inclusion of adsorbate-
adsorbate interactions at higher coverage may simply move
the appropriate point along the BEP line [8,43]. The reason
is that the transition state and the final state in dissociation
are quite alike (this is the reason for the linear relation in
the first place) [8], and the two states are therefore affected
by high coverage in a similar manner. Weak adsorbate-
adsorbate interactions following the BEP line with a strength
considerably smaller than the width of the volcano (a few
tenths of an eV or a few times 10 kJ/mol) will only have a
weak effect on the results. If on the other hand the adsorbate
adsorbate interactions are larger than the width of the vol-
cano, they may shift a metal in the interesting range of
adsorption energies completely out of the interesting win-
dow of energies close to the maximum. This means that sites
on the surface with high coverage are catalytically inactive
and only sites with a low local coverage are active. This is
implicitly what is treated in the simple mean field models
treated above. Very reactive metals (far to the left of the max-
imum) may in a similar way be shifted into the interesting
range by forming, e.g., oxides, nitrides, or carbides.
We also note that deviations from the linear BEP-relation
would mean the breakdown of the compensation between
faster adsorption and surface reactions, which gives rise to
the smooth variation in the rate. There are deviations in the
calculated values (see Fig. 1), but they are all small com-
pared to the inherent accuracy of the calculations and we
therefore cannot attach strong significance to them at the
moment. The fact that many experiments show a smooth be-
havior of the reactivity across the periodic table is further
testament to the notion that the linear BEP relationship is a
very good starting point for understanding trends. It is, how-
ever, extremely important and interesting to look for devi-

217
ations from the linear relationships. One way to outperform
the BEP curve reactions is to find new surface structures with
different BEP lines. Another way is to include promoters.
Adsorbed alkalis thus affect the barrier for N2 dissociation
more than the stability of the dissociation products (because
the former has a larger dipole moment) leading to new active
sites [44].
Finally, we have shown that reactions close to equilib-
rium tend to be dominated by a single rate-determining step
and this determines the volcano curve. Far from equilibrium,
on the other hand, we have introduced the Sabatier analy-
sis, where the optimum is determined by the competition
between fast adsorption and fast further reaction of the dis-
sociation products.
