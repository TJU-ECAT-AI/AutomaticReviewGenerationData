The adsorption of CO and CO, on cerium oxide has been studied by Fourier- 
transform infrared spectroscopy (F.t.i.r.). For CO adsorption at room 
temperature, in addition to linearly adsorbed CO (21 
77 and 21 56 cm-l), 
two kinds of carbonate (unidentate: 854, 1062, 1348 and 1454 cm-* and 
bidentate: 854, 1028, 1286 and 1562 cm-') and inorganic carboxylate (1310 
and l m  
cm-l) species were identified spectroscopically. As for CO, 
adsorption, apart from weak bands at 1728, 1396, 1219 and 11 
32 cm-' 
attributed to bridged carbonate species, bands due to unidentaie carbonate, 
bidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, similar to those 
arising from CO adsorption, were observed. Except for the linearly 
adsorbed-CO, all species arising from CO and CO, are stable at room 
temperature i
n
 uacuo. The desorption of these species at elevated 
temperatures shows that the order of thermal stability is bridged carbonate 
< bidentate carbonate < 
inorganic carboxylate < unidentate carbonate 
species, and the residual of unidentate carbonate species can remain on the 
surface up to 773 K under evacuation. Forming carbonate and inorganic 
carboxylate species proved that the CeO, surface could be partially reduced 
by CO even at room temperature. No bands in the region 2300-800 cm-' 
were detected below 373 K for CO adsorption on hydroxylated CeO,. This 
indicates that CO adsorption depends on the degree of dehydroxylation of 
the surface. The mechanism of CO adsorption is also discussed. 
CO is a useful probe in the characterization of surface properties of both metals' and 
metal oxides2 via adsorption. In addition to surface investigations, the subject of CO 
adsorption is closely related to the studies of reactions involving CO, such as CO 
hydrogenation and CO oxidation. Therefore, studies on CO adsorption are an 
important field and will be continued in the future. Although CO adsorbed on metal 
oxides has been extensively studied by infrared spectroscopy,2. infrared-spectroscopic 
studies of CO adsorption on cerium oxide have not been carried out in detail until now. 
Some authors4* have studied CO adsorption on ceria-supported metal catalysts ; 
however, their main attention was focused on the metals instead of on ceria. Recently, 
Jin et aL6 reported the adsorption of CO and CO, on Pt/Ce02 and CeO, by infrared 
spectroscopy and other techniques, but they failed to find any peaks corresponding to 
CO on pure CeO, in the region 1000-3000 cm-'. 
For the above reasons, i.r. studies of CO adsorption on CeO, have been initiated in

CO and CO, Adsorption on CeO, 
our laboratory. We have found that CO not only is adsorbed in a linear form as on other 
oxides, but also interacts strongly with the CeO, surface, forming a considerable number 
of carbonate species even at room temperature. A similar phenomenon on oxides has 
been discussed previously. 
'-11 
In this paper i.r. spectra of adsorbed CO on cerium oxide are displayed. In order to 
assign those bands arising from adsorbed CO, the adsorption of 13C0 and CO, on 
cerium oxide has also been studied by Fourier-transform i.r. spectroscopy. Furthermore, 
the thermal stability of the species obtained from adsorbed CO and CO, has been 
investigated by i
n
 situ F.t.i.r. Finally, the results of CO adsorption on hydroxylated 
CeO, and the mechanism of forming carbonate and carboxylate species are discussed. 
Experiment

Materials 
Cerium oxide (ceria or CeO,) used in this study was obtained by the thermal 
decomposition of cerium hydroxide gel at 773 K in air for 3 h. The cerium hydroxide was 
prepared through precipitation from an aqueous solution of cerium(Ir1) nitrate with 
NH,OH at pH 8-9, and the resulting precipitate was repeatedly washed with deionized 
water until NH; and NO, ions were eliminated, prior to drying and calcination. 
H, was purified via a Deoxo arrangement and then through a liquid-nitrogen trap. 
0,, 
CO and 13C0 
(99.7%) were refined through a liquid-nitrogen trap in a circulating 
system for 15 min. CO, was prepared from the decomposition of NaHCO,. 
Apparatus 
1.r. spectra were recorded on a JEOL JIR-100 F.t.i.r. spectrometer with 256 scans at 
4 cm-l resolution using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled HgCdTe detector. All the spectra 
shown in the paper are in absorbance, and their backgrounds were recorded before 
admitting the adsorbate gas under corresponding experimental conditions of the spectra. 
The same calcined at 773 K was pressed into a self-supporting disc, weight ca. 150 mg, 
with a diameter of 20 mm. The disc was placed in a conventional i.r. cell with NaCl 
windows and a furnace capable of heating the disc in situ up to 1100 K. The i.r. cell, 
connected to a vacuum system can be kept below lop4 
Torr (1 Torr w 133.3 N m-,) by 
an oil-diffusion pump and a mechanical pump. 
Procedure 
In order to eliminate the species contaminants, adsorbed H,O and hydroxyl groups prior 
to the first experiment, a new disc in the cell was outgassed at 1000 K for 10 min and then 
treated in 0, at 873 K for 3 days (the time was shortened to 12 h for subsequent 
experiments). After pretreatment the sample was outgassed again at 1000 K for 30 min. 
The i.r. spectra showed that no peaks of contaminants, residual water or OH groups 
remained on the surface after pretreatment and outgassing. Therefore, unless noted 
otherwise, the sample used in this study is a dehydroxylated CeO,, symbolized as 
CeO,( 1000 K). Continuing the above processes, the disc was progressively cooled to the 
given temperatures for recording background spectra and finally to room temperature 
for CO or CO, adsorption. The thermal-desorption and CO-adsorption experiments at 
elevated temperatures wee performed in a stepwise way and the temperature rate of an 
interval was ca. 25 K min-l. A given temperature was not changed until the spectra 
reached a steady state. 
A hydroxylated CeQ, surface was obtained by treating the sample which had 
undergone the above pretreatment in water vapour from room temperature to 673 K 
and at 673 K for 1 h, then outgassing for 1 h at the same temperature. The i.r. spectra

of the hydroxylated sample showed that two sharp peaks at 3664(strong)cm-' and 
3629(weak) cm-l, due to different terminal OH groups, and a broad peak centred at ca. 
3427 cm-l, attributed to hydrogen-bonding OH groups, were reproduced, indicating 
that the CeO, surface was truly hydroxylated. 
Results 
CO Adsorption at Room Temperature 
Fig. 1 shows the i.r. spectra of CO adsorbed on CeO, at room temperature, and the 
results are described in two sections as follows. In the range 230&1900 cm-' in fig. 1 A, 
two bands at 2177 and 21 56 cm-', attributed to CO linearly adsorbed on Ce", were 
observed. The intensities of the two bands decrease simultaneously with a decrease in the 
CO pressure [fig. 1 
A(a)-(c)] 
and both bands disappear quickly on evacuation at room 
temperature [fig. 1 
A(d)]. 
The dependence of the band intensities upon the pressure of 
CO agrees with a Langmuir relationship, and the CO pressure for saturated adsorption 
is ca. 100Torr at room temperature. The two bands were gradually weakened at 
elevated temperatures even in a CO atmosphere (1 10 Torr) and completely vanished at 
ca. 350 K. These results suggest that the two bands are associated with weakly adsorbed 
CO and are similar to those on other oxides. 
In the region 1800-800 cm-', as soon as CO was introduced into the i.r. cell, nine 
distinct peaks at 854, 1028, 1062, 1286, 1310, 1348, 1454, 1510 and 1562 cm-' were 
detected as shown in fig. 1 B(a). 
All the bands grew slowly with time (fig. 1 B) 
and it took 
ca. 200 min to reach saturated adsorption at room temperature. Various CO pressures 
in the range 1&100 Torr made no apparent difference both to the spectra and to the time 
of saturated adsorption (thus hereafter pressures of 10-20 Torr of CO and 13C0 
were

adopted). All the bands become stronger and more distinguishable with prolonged 
adsorption time, except that at 1310 cm-l, which was submerged by two intense 
neighbouring bands at 1286 and 1348 cm-l. Comparing the bands in the two regions, 
2300-1900 and 1800-800 cm-', the former are rapidly formed in a CO atmosphere and 
easily outgassed by pumping; however, the latter are produced slowly and cannot be 
removed by evacuation at room temperature. This indicates that the surface species 
related to the bands in the two regions are appreciably different from each other in 
nature. 
With a view to distinguishing the species with i.r. bands in the region 1800-800 cm-l, 
the variations of five main bands with adsorption time after admission of CO are 
presented in fig. 2, in which the scale is the ratio of absorbance of the indicated band to 
that of the 1286 
cm-l band. The bands at 1286 and 1562 
cm-l grow at the same rate; 
hence their ratios are parallel. The two curves at 1348 and 1454 cm-' are nearly 
coincident; the two bands keep pace with each other and obviously increase the most 
quickly among the five bands. The curve of 1510 cm-' is different from those of other 
bands in slope. On the basis of a knowledge that the bands from the same species will 
exhibit the same tendency during a variation in the amount of species present, the five 
bands can be reasonably classified into three groups due to three kinds of surface species, 
here termed (A) 1286 and 1562 
cm-l, (B) 1348 and 1454 cm-' and (C) 1510 cm-l. 
Isotopic-shift methods are often used to clarify and confirm problems in the 
interpretation of i.r. spectra. The i.r. spectra of adsorbed 13C0 
on CeO, are basically the 
same as those of adsorbed CO apart from a reasonable isotopic shift. The bands of 
adsorbed 13C0 
correspond to those of adsorbed CO, and the isotopic shifts and ratios, 
are listed in table 1.

significantly strong, such that the 1286 are 1562 cm-' bands are almost overwhelmed at 
573 K. The weak bands at 854 and 1062 cm-l also grow, apparently at the same time. 
This implies that the two bands may be ascribed to species B or C instead of species A. 
The band at 1028 cm-l seems to be in step with the 1286 and 1562 cm-l bands during 
this process. Fig. 4 quantitatively illustrates the enhancement of the three main bands at 
1286, 1348 and 1510 cm-', which are taken as representatives of the three species A, B 
and C, respectively. The bands at 1348 and 1510 cm-l grow steeply with increasing 
adsorption temperature, and their intensities vary more than tenfold in the range 
300-573 K, while the 1286 
cm-l band only doubles in intensity from room temperature 
to 473 K, and shows no obvious change above 473 K. These results clearly suggest that 
the activation energies for formation of species B and C are higher than that for species 
A, and that species A might reach saturated adsorption at 473 K. 
CO, Adsorption at Room Temperature 
In an attempt to assign the bands arising from CO adsorption, an i.r. study of CO, 
adsorption on CeO, was performed under the same conditions as in CO adsorption, and 
the spectra of CO, adsorbed at room temperature are presented in fig. 5. Adsorbed 
CO, gives more and stronger bands than adsorbed CO in the region 2000-800 cm-', but 
the main peaks in the spectra for CO, and CO adsorption are very similar, i.e. bands at

four weak bands at 1 132, 1219, 1396 and 1728 cm-l appear for CO, adsorption but are 
absent for CO adsorption. Another apparent feature is that all the bands increase in 
intensity rapidly with time of exposure of CO,, and reach a maximum within 10 min. 
Desorption of Adsorbed CO and CO, 
An experiment on the desorption of adsorbed CO and CO, was undertaken with a view 
to examining the thermal stability of surface species and to investigate the behaviour of 
different species during the course of desorption. Fig. 6 shows a series of spectra of 
adsorbed CO recorded at the temperatures indicated after achieving a steady state of 
desorption. As shown in fig. 6(a)-(c), bands at 1028, 1286 and 1562 cm-' are reduced 
remarkably in the same step by heating the sample from room temperature to 473 K, 
while in contrast bands at 1062, 1348 and 1454 
cm-' grow slightly instead of decrease, 
and the 1510 cm-l band is almost unaffected. Above 473 K, all the bands decrease with 
further increasing temperature, and the bands at 1062, 1286, 1562 and 15 
10 cm-' are 
almost removed at 673 K, while the bands at 854, 1348 and 1454 cm-' survive a 
thorough elimination even up to 773 K [fig. 6(d)-(f)]. These results confirm the 
conclusion that the bands below 1800 cm-I are due to three kinds of surface species 
distinguished by their variations in behaviour when subjected to warming and degassing. 
The weak bands at 1028 and 1062 
cm-l might belong to species A and B, because their 
behaviour is in accord with bands at 1286, 1562 and 1348 and 1454 cm-I, respectively.

673 K for 30 rnin after (d) and (f) 
773 K for 20 min after (e). 
The band at 854 em-' is unique during desorption. In the range 300-473 K it becomes 
weaker, accompanying the decrease of species A (1028, 1286 and 1562 cm-l); how- 
ever, in the range 473-573 K its behaviour coincides with species B (1062, 1348 and 
1454 cm-l). Therefore it seems reasonable to attribute the 854 cm-l band to both species 
A and B. 
The variations of the three species A, B and C marked by the bands at 1286, 1348 and 
15 
10 cm-l, respectively, are illustrated more clearly in fig. 7. Species B is more stable 
than species A and C, and the order of their thermal stabilities will be B > C > 
A. The 
increase in species B is only due to the conversion of species A, since species C remains 
the same and there is no further addition of CO to the gas phase during the process. By 
combining the results shown in fig. 3 and 4, we concluded that the species A may be an 
intermediate of species B and C. As soon as CO was introduced onto CeO,, only species 
A was formed on the surface initially; it was then converted into species B and C slowly 
(fig. 1 B and 3). As a consequence, a high temperature should facilitate the conversion 
of species A into B and C. This must be the reason why there is an increase of B and no 
loss of species C on going from 300 to 473 K in vacuu (see fig. 7).

The desorption of adsorbed CO, is very like that of adsorbed CO, except for four 
weak bands at 1132, 1219, 1396 and 1728 cm-l which are not present in CO adsorption 
and disappear simultaneously on heating to 373 K. This suggests that, in addition to the 
three species A, B and C which are the same as formed from CO adsorption, at least one 
other species is produced from CO, adsorption ; 
species (named D) may be generated via 
weakly adsorbed CO,, and differs from species A, B and C in its thermal stability. The 
same variation in the spectra of adsorbed CO and CO, strongly supports the view that 
the same species A, B and C could be formed from both CO and CO, adsorption on 
dehydroxylated CeO,. 
CO Adsorption on Hydroxylated CeO, 
As previously described, hydroxylated CeO, was prepared by heating CeO, in the 
presence of H,O vapour. The hydroxylated surface was exposed to 20Torr CO at 
300 K for 120 min and then heated to 373 K for 20 min, while no peaks due to adsorbed 
CO were observed at the two temperatures, as shown in fig. 8(a) and (b). On 
progressively heating the sample above 473 K, besides very weak bands at 2939, 2848, 
1576, 1558, 1369 and 1307 cm-l arising from formate species produced via the reaction 
of adsorbed CO and surface OH groups, similar bands to those in fig. 3 appeared, but 
all the band intensities were much weaker than those on dehydroxylated CeO,. This 
enabled us to suggest that the surface OH groups hinder the CO from forming adsorbed 
species, especially at low temperatures.

On most of the oxides the i.r. bands from CO adsorption appear in the region 
230&2000 cm-l, and their wavenumbers are often substantially higher than that of gas- 
phase CO (2143 cm-'). The explanation of this phenomenon is controversial, but two 
popular corollaries seem reasonable :' (1) these bands are attributed to CO linearly 
adsorbed on surface-exposed metal ions, e.g. Lewis-acid sites; (2) the more positive the 
state of the metal ions, the higher is vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO. In the light 
of these views, we assigned the band at 2177 cm-l to CO linearly adsorbed on Ce4+ 
and 
the band at 21 
56 cm-l to Ce4+ 
in a more unsaturated coordination state created by severe 
degassing at 1000 K. No linearly adsorbed CO was formed on hydroxylated CeO, 
because the surface was almost covered with OH; consequently no metal ions were 
exposed to the surface for CO coordination. 
Assignment of the Bands below 1800 em-' 
Generally speaking, i.r. bands below 1800 cm-' arising from adsorbed CO, are due to 
carbonate-like species. Extensive i.r. studies on the assignment of the spectra in this 
region have been made for CO, and CO adsorption on transition-metal oxides, since the 
pioneer work on NiO by Eichens and Pliskin.12 Fujita et a1.13 calculated the presence 
of two kinds of carbonates in a Co"' complex, and their results have been considered as 
criteria for the assignment of carbonate species3.

species A to a bidentate form and species B to unidentate form, since the bands of species 
A and B in this study are in excellent agreement with those of bidentate and unidentate 
carbonates, respectively, in CoI" carbonate complexes. The band at ca. 854 cm-l has 
been detected in complexes and inorganic  compound,' and was attributed to the out- 
of-plane vibration of the carbonate COi- group, but it is difficult to detect this species 
in adsorption experiments because of the low transmission of oxides below 1000 cm-'. 
Our postulation that the band at 854 cm-l is due to both species A and B is confirmed, 
since both the bidentate and unidentate carbonate species possess a C0:- group. Its 
isotopic shift of 27 cm-' on substitution by 13C 
given in table 1 is also in accord with the 
isotopic shift for Ca13C0, in comparison with Ca12C03.1s

species C, and 1310 cm-l (weak) may be attributed to inorganic carboxylate rather than 
carbonate species, since no band in the 1200-1000 cm-l region is in agreement with 
them. The recognition of inorganic carboxylate species on oxide surfaces is difficult 
because their bands are usually confused with those of carbonate species. Fortunately, 
on CeO, (as shown in fig. 1 
B and 3) the band at 1510 cm-l(l506 cm-l in fig. 5 )  
assigned 
to an asymmetric vibration is well resolved, and the band at 1310 cm-l ascribed to a 
symmetric vibration can be clearly identified at the beginning of CO adsorption, 
although it is very weak and is overwhelmed by neighbouring bands eventually. From 
the table summarized by Little,3 
the inorganic carboxylate species was identified by two 
bands whose positions vary in the regions 1570-1 
510 and 1410-1 
310 cm-l, respectively, 
on different oxides; in addition, the band at 1410-1310 cm-' is weak or absent on some 
oxides. The two bands at 15 
10 and 13 
10 cm-' in our study fit well with the above features 
of inorganic carboxylate species. 
The assignment concerning carbonate-like species on CeO, may be further verified by 
the results (in table 1) for isotopic shifts. Among the three bands of species A, i.e. the 
bidentate carbonate species, the biggest isotopic shift is 44 cm-l for the 15 
18 cm-l band. 
This is close to that for the stretching frequency of the l3C_O molecule, which is 
estimated to be ca. 48 cm-', so the band arises from the C=O stretching vibration in 
bidentate carbonate species. The 1024 cm-l band is hardly shifted; this confirms that the 
carbon atom is unaffected in the vibration. Therefore, it should be ascribed to a 
symmetric vibration. The band at 1256 cm-', with an isotopic shift of 30 cm-I, is due to 
an asymmetric vibration, since the carbon atom participates in the vibration but is not 
involved to the same extent as in the C=O vibration. On the same principle, the isotopic 
shift of the asymmetric vibration is larger than the symmetric vibration in the carbonate; 
the two bands at 1410 
and 1319 
cm-' with isotopic shifts of 44 and 29 cm-l, respectively,

are correspondingly attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of unidentate 
carbonate species. For inorganic carboxylate species the isotopic shifts of 15 
18 and 
1279 cm-l are closed to each other, not as in carbonate species. As the inorganic 
carboxylate is a triatomic group the carbon atom is not at the centre as in the carbonate; 
therefore the carbon atom takes part in both the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations, 
as is the case for the oxygen atom in a water molecule. This is the reason why the 
asymmetric and symmetric vibrations show an isotopic shift to the same extent. 
Species D, with bands at 1728, 1396, 1219 and 1132 cm-', is ascribed to a bridged 
carbonate species by the characteristic band at 1728 cm-l, which is due to the C=O 
vibration of an organic carbonate. Furthermore, species D is weakly adsorbed on 
CeO, and can be eliminated upon heating to 373 K i

 vacuo; similar results have been 
reported for Cr203.19 
By summarizing the above discussions, the assignment of the 
bands below 1800 cm-l arising from adsorbed CO and CO, on dehydroxylated CeO, are 
listed in table 3. 
1.r. spectroscopic studies of CO adsorption on MgO,' CaO and SrOlO well degassed 
at high temperatures have shown that adsorbed CO gives rise to a large number of bands 
in the range 2200-1000 cm-l. These bands were attributed to carbonate species and some 
unusual CO polymeric species, (C0):- (n

..). Although adsorbed 
CO on CeO, also exhibited rich bands in the same region, they were completely different 
from those of the CO polymeric species in terms of their band positions and relative 
intensities. Furthermore, the polymeric species were sensitive to oxygen, being easily 
destroyed by exposure thereto; however, no apparent change in the spectra of CO 
adsorbed on CeO, has been found after dosing 0, on the CeO, surface preadsorbed with 
CO. Apart from these differences, the increase in the intensities of i.r. bands due to CO 
adsorbed on CeO, at room temperature is a function of CO contact time but is 
independent of the CO pressure (10-100 Torr); nevertheless, the formation of the CO 
polymeric species is strongly dependent on the CO pressure. We therefore rule out the 
possibility of existing CO polymeric species on CeO, in the present study. 
Mechanism of CO Adsorption on Hydroxylated CeO, 
The formation of carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species from CO adsorption 
indicates that CO is oxidized by surface oxygen species; in other words, the surface of 
CeO, is partially reduced by CO. It is expected that CO reacts with some oxides to form 
carbonate species at high temperatures, but it seems impossible that the phenomenon 
occurs at temperature. The results on CeO, are not general for all oxides, and imply that 
the CeO, surface might possess either special adsorption sites or very active oxygen 
species, or both. Therefore a short discussion on the mechanism of CO adsorption is 
indispensable to the conclusions of our paper. 
CO oxidation on CeO, above 473 K has been investigated by Breysse et aZ.20*2r 
Their 
results confirmed the participation of lattice oxide ions during the reaction. A 
mechanism was proposed involving cyclic reduction/oxidation of the surface to explain 
CO oxidation on CeO,. Jin2, and his colleagues concluded that the formation of CO, on 
Pt/CeO, from CO temperature-programmed description was due to lattice oxygen from 
the interface between Pt and CeO,. 
From a temperature-programmed reaction study by Yao et aZ.,23 
two peaks at 770 and 
1020 K were ascribed to the reduction of surface-capping oxygen ions and bulk oxygen 
ions, respectively; another t.p.r. peak was due to oxygen species which could be 
converted into the capping and bulk oxygen ions. The oxygen species, i.e. mononuclear 
and molecular oxygen anions, on CeO, have also been identified by e.s.r. spectro- 
In the present case, we are inclined to the view that the surface oxygen species 
and part of the capping oxygen ions (but not the lattice oxide ions) are responsible for the 
formation of carbonate and carboxylate species on CeO, at room temperature, because

CO and CO, Adsorption on CeO, 
the former are more easily reduced than lattice oxide ions. It is not plausible to extract 
lattice oxygen, especially at room temperature. It may be possible that the lattice oxide 
ions migrate to the surface to compensate for the surface oxygen vacancies created by 
CO reduction with increasing temperature; as a result, the surface carbonate and 
carboxylate species are enhanced at elevated temperatures, as shown fig. 3 and 4. 
The surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for forming 
carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, but the more important reason for CO 
oxidation at room temperature should be the presence of surface-active sites that can 
activate CO to be oxidized easily. The large difference in CO adsorption on 
dehydroxylated and hydroxylated CeO, (fig. 1, 3 and 8) leads us to suggest that the 
coordinatively unsaturated surface sites may play a key role for activation of CO to form 
carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, since the surface unsaturated sites can be 
generated via dehydroxylation at high temperature. E.s.r. 
have shown that 
oxygen defect sites could be formed on the CeO, surface by outgassing at high 
temperatures, and similar e.s.r. resultsz6 
postulated that Ce3+ 
sites may be produced after 
pretreatment at 773 K in uacuo. The proposal that the surface-active sites could be 
produced through dehydration has also been made by Zechina, 
on Cr,O,. For 
hydroxylated CeO,, the surface was saturated with OH groups and was hence inactive 
for both CO adsorption and oxidation at room temperature. 
Fig. 1 
B(a) 
and fig. 3 (a) 
clearly show that bidentate carbonate species predominate on 
the surface during the first stage after the admission of CO. It is assumed that CO reacts 
directly with surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions to form bidentate 
carbonate species, and then the bidentate carbonate species as an intermediate are 
converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, as shown in fig. 
2, 4 and 7. 
Conclusions 
The following summarizations can be made from this work. (1) CO adsorption at room 
temperature on the dehydroxylated CeO, surface shows the formation of four adsorbed 
species, linearly adsorbed CO, unidentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate and inorganic 
carboxylate species. (2) The linearly adsorbed CO can be removed at room temperature 
by pumping, and its amount is dependent on the CO pressure. The other three species 
are stable at room temperature and their thermal stability is in the order bidentate < 
carbonate < unidentate carbonate < 
inorganic carboxylate species. (3) The bidentate 
carbonate species can be converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate 
species, especially at high temperature. (4) Adsorbed CO, produces two carbonate and 
inorganic carboxylate species which are the same as those from adsorbed CO and 
bridged carbonate species. (5) Dehydroxylated CeO, can be partially reduced at room 
temperature by CO. 
(6) 
Surface OH groups prohibit CO adsorption. This is interpreted 
as indicating that there are no active sites for CO coordination.
