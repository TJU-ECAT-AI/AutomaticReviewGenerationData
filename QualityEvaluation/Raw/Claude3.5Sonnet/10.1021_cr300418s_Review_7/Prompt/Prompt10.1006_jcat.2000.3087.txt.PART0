Using density functional calculations we show that there is an
essentially linear relationship between the activation energy for N2
dissociation and the binding energy of atomic nitrogen on a range
of transition metal surfaces. This relation, known as the Brnsted
EvansPolanyi relation, is further shown to depend on the structure
of the active site. The consequences of the BrnstedEvansPolanyi
relation in terms of the kinetics of the ammonia synthesis process
under industrial conditions are discussed, and it is shown that the
relation leads to a volcano-type dependence of the catalytic activity
on the nitrogen heat of adsorption. The results show that density
functional calculations can predict the relative catalytic activity of
different transition metals.

I. INTRODUCTION
The BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation (1, 2) is an empiri-
calrulestatingthatthereisalinearrelationshipbetweenthe
activation energy and the reaction energy for an elemen-
tary reaction. It is applied in many areas of chemistry and
biochemistry, including heterogeneous catalysis, where it
is often used to rationalize observed variations in catalytic
activity from one catalyst to the next or to estimate ac-
tivation barriers (3). There is little quantitative evidence
behind the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation in heteroge-
neouscatalysis,becauseitishardtomeasurebothactivation
energies and reaction energies (or rates and equilibrium
constants) reliably for elementary reactions on a surface of
a catalyst. We show here that quantum chemical methods
based on density functional theory (DFT) can be used to
quantify the relation and to understand why it works.
We focus on the ammonia synthesis reaction: N2 +

lysts based on Fe or Ru, N2 dissociation is the rate-limiting
step (46). It is further known that adsorbed N (or NH)
is the most abundant species on the surface during the re-
action under industrially relevant conditions (711). For
this reaction the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation there-
fore does not only provide a method for estimating ac-
tivation barriers from adsorption energies. It governs the
reactivity completely, because it determines the relation be-
tween the rate of the slowest step and the amount of free
sites on the surface. We show in the following that, given
the calculated BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation and a mi-
crokinetic model for the ammonia synthesis, we can calcu-
late the catalytic activity as a function of nitrogen binding
strength. We find a volcano curve with Fe and Ru near the
maximum, closely resembling what is found experimentally
(12).
II. CALCULATIONAL DETAILS
We have applied our plane wave DFT method with a
nonlocal description of exchange and correlation effects to
the calculation of the activation barrier (Ea) for N2 disso-
ciation and the adsorption energy (1E) for dissociative N2
adsorption over a range of transition metals.
We have used three- or four-layer slabs and a 2 × 2 (close-
packed surfaces, c(6 × 2) for Pd(111)) or 2 × 4 (steps, (2 × 1)
for Pd(211)) unit cell to model the surfaces. The wave func-
tions are expanded in plane waves (up to 25 Ry), and the
Brillouin zone is sampled by 18 k-points for the hcp sur-
faces, 16 k-points for the flat bcc surfaces, and 8 k-points
for stepped bcc surfaces. The RPBE exchange correlation
functional is applied (13), and Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseu-
dopotentials (14) are used to describe the core electrons.
The programs employed (DACAPO) are publicly available
at http://www.fysik.dtu.dk/CAMPOS.
Two or more of the top layers are completely relaxed for
the flat and stepped surfaces of Fe(110), Ru(0001), and Pd,
while the surface atoms are kept fixed for the remaining

calculations. This makes no difference for the relation be-
tween the activation energy and adsorption energy, since
we find that the two vary similarly when relaxations are
included (see later). The N atoms are completely relaxed
in all the calculations of the dissociative N2 adsorption
energy (1E). The transition states are identified by cal-
culating the energy for various lengths of the N2 bond,
while the remaining degrees of freedom are completely
relaxed.
III. THE BRNSTEDEVANSPOLANYI RELATION
Consider first dissociation and adsorption of N2 on the
most closely packed surface of the different metals. We find
an essentially linear relationship like that in the Brnsted
EvansPolanyi relation over a broad range of adsorption
energies and barriers (Fig. 1). The slope we find in the acti-
vation barrier vs adsorption energy plot is 0.9.
The calculations show why the BrnstedEvansPolanyi
relation is obeyed in this case. The transition state we find
for N2 dissociation on all the surfaces is so stretched (see
inset in Fig. 1) that the direct interaction between two
N atoms is quite weakthe transition state is final state-
like.
FIG. 1.
Calculated activation energies (transition state potential en-
ergies) for N2 dissociation on a number of different metals plotted as a
function of the calculated N2 dissociative chemisorption potential energy.
All energies are relative to gas-phase N2. Results for close-packed surfaces
(fcc(111), hcp(0001), and bcc(110)) as well as for stepped surfaces are in-
cluded and show the same trends, but group along two different straight
lines. Results for the very open Fe(111)(α α) surface naturally falls on
the step line since this surface has the same kind of reactive five-atom
sites as the steps (15). Results for fcc Fe are also included for different
lattice constants showing the effect of strain on the reactivity (nearest-
neighbor distance from 2.40 to 2.60). Fe/Ru(0001) refers to a pseudomor-
phic overlayer of Fe on Ru(0001). The insets show the calculated geometry
of the transition state for dissociation on the Ru(0001) surface, both on a
flat and on a stepped surface. The geometry of the N2 molecules indicates
the size of the unit cell used in the calculations.
If we consider more open surfaces and steps as the active
site, then a new BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation emerges
(Fig. 1). This adds two new angles to the general description.
First, it is clear that the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation
is not restricted to a single active site. Second, we get a
clear view of two other concepts commonly used in het-
erogeneous catalysis. The two lines separate electronic and
geometrical effects. For a fixed geometry the difference in
electronic structure of the transition metals gives rise to the
variations along each of the BrnstedEvansPolanyi lines.
The difference between the two lines is a manifestation of
the geometrical effect, in the present case the requirement
for dissociation sites with at least five metal atoms in a non-
planar geometry (16).
IV. THE VOLCANO CURVE
The results shown in Fig. 1 can be used to estimate the
relative ammonia synthesis rates over different transition
metals. In order to do this we have combined the Brnsted
EvansPolanyi relation for the most active sites (the lower
curve of Fig. 1) with a microkinetic model for ammonia
synthesis, where N2 dissociation is taken to be the rate-
determining step and all other elementary reaction steps
are assumed to be in equilibrium (7).
As a reference point we use the parameters of the kinetic
model which is known to describe ammonia synthesis over
nonpromoted ruthenium (10) very well. These parameters
are in good agreement with results from the DFT calcula-
tions with respect to the values of the N2 dissociation bar-
rier, the adsorption energy, and the fact that only a small
fraction of the surface sites on a real catalyst will have the
propergeometryforbeingactive.Inordertofindasynthesis
rate for metals where the adsorption energy of N2 and the
dissociation barrier are different from those on ruthenium,
we keep all other parameters of the model constant except
the adsorption energy of NH*, which is taken to change like
the adsorption energy of N*. The adsorption energy of hy-
drogen also changes from one transition metal to the next,
but our calculations show thatthis variation is an order of
magnitude smaller than the variation in adsorption energy
of nitrogen, and we can therefore neglect it here.
The result is a volcano curve describing the ammonia syn-
thesis rate as a function of the adsorption energy as shown
in Fig. 2. This curve indicates that iron and ruthenium are
among the best choices of catalyst, which is in remarkably
good agreement with the experimental findings (12). When
we increase the ammonia concentration in the gas phase, we
find that the maximum in catalytic activity moves toward
smaller N binding energies, reflecting the larger poisoning
of the surface by adsorbed N and NH under such condi-
tions. This is also in agreement with detailed experimental
evidence showing the ammonia order is less negative for
Ru than for Fe catalysts (17).
BRNSTEDEVANSPOLANYI RELATION IN AMMONIA SYNTHESIS

FIG. 2.
Ammonia synthesis rate as a function of the N2 dissociative
chemisorption energy of nitrogen relative to that on ruthenium. The rates
are given as turnover frequencies (TOF), which were calculated by com-
bining the lower BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation in Fig. 1 with the mi-
crokinetic model for ammonia synthesis described in the text. The TOFs
are obtained at 673 K and 100 bar in a stoichiometric H2 : N2 gas mixture
containing 1% or 20% (dashed) of NH3. Below we show the N2 sticking
probability, S0, and the coverage of free sites, θ*, on the surface for each
value of the adsorption energy. These results refer to the case where there
is 1% conversion. It can be seen how the maximum in activity is a compro-
mise between a high sticking probability (low barrier for N2 dissociation)
and a large number of free sites (low N and NH coverage) where reaction
can occur.
V. CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations can be a powerful tool in describing chemical pro-
cesses in heterogeneous catalysis. On the basis of such cal-
culations we have shown that there is an essentially linear
relationship between the activation energy for N2 disso-
ciation and the nitrogen chemisorption energy for a broad
range of transition metals. This confirms that the Brnsted
EvansPolanyi relation is valid also for systems of interest
in heterogeneous catalysis.
The calculations illustrate both the variations in chemical
activity from one transition metal to the next and the effect
of geometry. The latter is found to be independent of the
metal,andtobecruciallyimportantforthecatalyticactivity.
Finally, we have used the calculated variations in activa-
tion barriers and adsorption energies in conjunction with a
well-established microkinetic model for the ammonia syn-
thesis to show that the variation in the synthesis rate under
industrial conditions can be calculated from first principles.
The results show that, even though the accuracy of DFT
calculations is not at present sufficient to predict absolute
chemical reaction rates, it is good enough to predict the
overall variations in rates from one system to the next.
