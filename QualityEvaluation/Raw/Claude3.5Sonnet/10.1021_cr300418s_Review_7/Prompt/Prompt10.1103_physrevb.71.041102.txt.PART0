Modeling multiple-valence compounds using density-functional theory has long been considered a formi-
dable task due to the role that strong electronic correlations play in these systems. We show that, in the case of
defective ceria, the main effect of these correlations is to produce a multitude of metastable low-energy states
among which the one displaying the correct valence of cerium is the most stable. This ground state may be
difficult to access in practice and it has in fact so far escaped a proper identification. The introduction of a
Hubbard-U term in the energy functional stabilizes the physical ground state and makes it easily accessible to
routine calculations. When this contribution is defined in terms of maximally localized Wannier functions, the
calculated energies and structural properties are independent of the value of the parameter U.

The properties of many technologically relevant materials
are determined by the ability of their atomic constituents to
display multiple oxidation statesand hence a different
chemical behaviordepending on the local microscopic en-
vironment. A representative example is given by ceria-based
materials which are key components of many advanced cata-
lysts used to produce hydrogen and to reduce air pollution.
Besides providing a resistant support for chemically active
noble metals, ceria-based substrates take an active role in the
catalytic reaction by controlling the oxygen partial pressure
at the reaction sites, acting effectively as oxygen reservoirs.
There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by
the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by
the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations ssubstitu-
tional CeCe
8 defectsd.1 Our current understanding of this phe-
nomenon relies on the quasidegeneracy of different ionic
configurations in which a highly localized 4f-electron state is
occupied or empty. The importance of electronic correlations
related
with
quasidegeneracy
and
accompanying
the
f-electron localization process has lead to the widespread
belief that conventional density-functional theory sDFTd
techniques based on the local-density approximation sLDAd
or generalized-gradient approximation sGGAd would be un-
able to cope with these systems. For instance, the modeling
of the ag transition in metallic Ce requires sophisticated
variants of the DFT method, such as, e.g., self-interaction-
corrected-DFT
sRef.
2d
and
DFT-dynamical-mean-field
theory.3 This belief is supported by the current literature on
ceria49 which suggests that conventional DFT techniques
fail to provide a unified description of ceria compounds
sCeO2,CeO2x,Ce2O3d. We believe that this conclusion is to
some extent misleading. The purpose of this paper is two-
fold. We first show that the propensity of cerium to display
multiple oxidation states determines the existence of a num-
ber of DFT configurations that are stable at the LDA or GGA
level, and which had not been identified so far. These con-
figurations also comprise those which display the correct
oxidation state of cerium and which are in fact predicted to
be the most stable. The energy differences between different
metastable configurations are so smalland the barriers
separating them so importantthat self-consistent field
sSCFd calculations starting near an unphysical solution tend
to converge to it, so that the very existence of other solutions
had gone so far unnoticed. We then show that the addition of
a Hubbard-U term in the LDA sor GGAd energy functional
substantially enhances the stability of the physical solution,
thus allowing SCF calculations to proceed straight to it.
Moreover, when the Hubbard-U contribution is defined in
terms of maximally localized Wannier functions, the energy
of the stable configuration is independent of U and therefore
coincides with the LDA/GGA values.
Pure cerium oxide has two stable stoichiometries: the cu-
bic fluorite-type CeO2 sFm3md and the hexagonal sesquiox-
ide A-type Ce2O3 sP3m1d. These compounds represent the
oxidation and reduction extremes in which all the Ce ions are
nominally in the 4+ and 3+ oxidation states, respectively. In
the former, all valence Ce states are empty, while in the latter
one electron per cation occupies the Ce 4f-like band swhich
is empty in CeO2d. In terms of the electronic structure, par-
tially reduced ceria CeO2x is simply an intermediate case:10
the presence of oxygen vacancies induces the condensation
of the compensating electrons into the empty 4f states of
neighboring Ce atoms, thus driving the Ce4+Ce3+ reduc-
tion. Electronic correlation, due to the strong localization of
these states in reduced cerias, Ce2O3 and CeO2x, have the
effect of splitting the Ce-4f band upon occupation, resulting
in a fully occupied gap state experimentally1012 detected to
be 1.21.5 eV above the top of the valence band. The elec-
tron population of this state is directly correlated to the num-
ber of Ce3+ ions, and is experimentally employed as an esti-
mator of the concentration of oxygen vacancies.12
Existing first-principles calculations49 adopt either one of
the following two assumptions, which are individually ap-
propriate to different oxidation states of Ce, but conflicting
with one another: sid in the core-state model sCSMd Ce-4f
states are treated as part of the core, and therefore their con-
tribution to the bonding process is totally neglected;4,6 siid

trons explicitly as valence electrons which are therefore al-
lowed to contribute to the chemical bond.4,79 The former
approach provides good structural properties for Ce2O3 but
not for CeO2 ssee Table Id, and it describes the oxide as an
insulator by construction. Most importantly its predictive
power is limited: the distribution of Ce4+ or Ce3+ ions has to
be assumed as an input of the calculation. On the opposite
side, the VBM leads to good structural properties for CeO2
but not for Ce2O3 sTable Id, and describes this latter structure
as a metal. In fact, the VBM does not predict the gap state
experimentally observed in partially reduced ceria CeO2x,
therefore failing to correctly capture the electronic localiza-
tion on the Ce-4f states, which is at the basis of the oxygen-
storage mechanism.
In this work we reconsider this problem in the light of
different ab initio DFT calculations performed either at the
LDA or at the GGA levels13 sthe latter in the Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof flavor16d.
The simulation of CeO2 is a standard and straightforward
problem. The LDA density of electronic states sDOSd is dis-
played in Fig. 1sad. Occupied states are indicated by shaded
areas, and the zero energy is set at the top of the upper
valence band swith prevalent O-2p characterd. The sharp
band centered at 4 eV is formed by fairly localized atomic-
like Ce-4f empty orbitals. The onset of the conduction band
is 5.6 eV above the highest occupied state s5.7 eV in GGAd,
to be compared with the measured17 gap of 6.0 eV sfollowing
Ref. 17 we do not consider the Ce-4f manifold as conduction
statesd. On the opposite, calculations involving Ce atoms in
the formal valency 3+ are much more subtle. Let us start
with Ce2O3: in agreement with previous analysis, we find
that a metallic antiferromagnetic state is smetad stable at the
LDA level. The corresponding DOS is displayed in Fig. 1sbd.
Ce-4f states form a unique, partially occupied band. A pro-
jection on Ce-4f states reveals that one electron is evenly
distributed among three orbitals centered on each Ce atom. A
careful electronic minimization, performed by doing several
SCF calculations starting from different initial conditions,
reveals that this state is not the ground state. In fact, an
electronic configuration resulting from the occupation of one
4f state per Ce sa linear combination of the fz3 and fysy23x2d
orbitalsd, results to be insulating and 0.36 eV/Ce2O3 lower in
energy. The corresponding DOS is shown in Fig. 1scd. This
ground state displays a gap in the 4f band, correctly repro-
ducing the experimentally observed gap state and the mag-
netic moment of 2.29 mB/mole sthe experimental18 value is
2.17 mB/moled. The integrated charge of the gap state is ex-
actly 2 sone electron per Ce3+ atomd. Metallic and insulating
ferromagnetic solutions are also stable, 0.13 and 0.03 eV/
Ce2O3 above the insulating antiferromagnetic ground state,
respectively. GGA calculations display a similar abundance
of local minima, the ground state being insulating and anti-
ferromagnetic, essentially degenerate with the insulating fer-
romagnetic solution. The metallic local minima are 1.1 sfer-
romagneticd and 0.99 santiferromagneticd eV/Ce2O3 higher
in energy. The addition of a Hubbard-U term to the LDA sor
GGAd energy functional removes this quasidegeneracy and
stabilizes electronic-structure calculations towards the physi-
cal solution, thus providing an effective way for coping with
these systems.

effect of EU is to favor the f occupation numbers to be close
to either 0 or 1. At these extremes, EU strictly vanishes and
the total energy is back to the LDA sor GGAd value. In any
actual implementation of the LDA+U energy functionals,
Eq. s1d, the values of the nI matrices depend on the choice of
the localized orbitals, hfms
I j, which define them through Eq.
s2d. Suppose, for instance, that we identify the fs with
atomic Ce-4f orbitals, as it is done in any straightforward
implementation of the LDA+U method. This choice would
lead to an unphysical situation where Ce-4f occupancies are
nonzero even in CeO2, where the nominal valence of all the
Ce atoms is 4+. This apparent paradox is simply due to the
fact that O-2p orbitals swhich are filled in CeO2d are not
orthogonal to neighboring Ce-4f states. We have found that
this spurious occupancy of Ce-4f orbitals results in a dete-
rioration of the overall accuracy of the DFT functional, par-
ticularly so for the structural parameters and the energies,
which strongly depend on the value of the parameter U.
In order to remove both the indetermination in the defini-
tion of the localized 4f-like orbitals and their spurious sand
ill-definedd occupancy, we have decided to identify the fs in
Eq. s2d with the maximally localized Wannier functions
sMLWFsd sRef. 19d resulting from the Ce-4f band. In prac-
tice, we have computed MLWFs using a simple procedure
which takes into account the fact that in the present case they
are very close to the known Ce-4f orbitals, and can thus be
obtained by a subspace alignment procedure.20 The corre-
sponding projector yields a vanishing Hubbard energy cor-
rection EU in case of completely filled or empty states, re-
sulting in energies which are independent of U. The
Hubbard-U parameter was calculated after the formulation of
Cococcioni and de Gironcoli.21 It was estimated to be in the
range 2.53.5 eV for LDA and 1.52 eV for GGA: in the
calculations we used the values ULDA=3 eV and UGGA
=1.5 eV.
By applying this LDA+U approach, the metallic solutions
are strongly disfavored with respect to the insulating antifer-
romagnetic electronic configuration. The resulting ground-
state DOS is displayed in Fig. 1sdd. Note that it is the same
insulating ground state predicted by the LDA calculation. As
a byproduct, the Hubbard term also shifts the gap state to
lower energies resulting in a band-structure closer to the ex-
periments sgap state at 1.21.5 eV above the top of the va-
lence bandd. Similarly, the GGA+U calculations result in the
corresponding insulating GGA ground state.
An analysis of the structural parameters sTable Id shows
that, when the most stable insulating antiferromagnetic solu-
tions sstabilized by the Hubbard termd are considered, tradi-
tional LDA and GGA calculations do capture the structural
properties of both CeO2 and Ce2O3. The self-consistent
MLWF projector yields results that do not depend on the
actual value of U, so the LDA+U and GGA+U structural
parameters are identical to the corresponding LDA and GGA
ones. On the contrary, a standard implementation of the
LDA+U method based on atomic orbitals leads to structural
parameters which depend linearly on U: for example, a0 and
B of both CeO2 and Ce2O3 change by 0.03 Å and 1 GPa,
respectively, when U varies from 0 to 3 eV in LDA and from
0 to 1.5 eV in GGA. For CeO2, our VBM results sGGA and
LDAd are very close to the corresponding VBM ones re-
ported in Ref. 4 sTable Id, but differ from the CSM ones. This
is because the CSM results for CeO2 were obtained by forc-
ing the Ce atoms to be in a trivalent state, hence far from the
more physical description given by the VBM si.e., Ce in the
formal oxidation state 4+d. On the contrary, the CSM triva-
lent state for Ce is a very good approximation for Ce2O3,
thus explaining the success of the CSM for this particular
compound. For Ce2O3, the difference between our VBM re-
sults and those of Ref. 4 is partly due to the different elec-
tronic solutions: insulating and metallic correspondingly.

where the experimental value is 1.97 eV.22 Note that the
LDA results seem to agree considerably better with experi-
ment than the GGA ones. This deserves serious consideration
when simulating chemical reactions on reduced surfaces.
An oxygen vacancy is modeled by removing a neutral
oxygen atom from a CeO2 supercell whose size is deter-
mined by the concentration of defects. As for the totally re-
duced Ce2O3 system, several metastable solutions exist at the
LDA/GGA level. In the metallic solution the two excess
electrons released in the reduction process result to be evenly
distributed among all the four Ce neighbors of the O va-
cancy.
These
four
atoms

occupancy
sTrfnmm8g=0.15d, and they relax symmetrically with respect
to the vacancy s0.18 Å outward, while the six O atoms next
nearest neighbors to the vacancy relax inward by 0.15 Åd.
The Hubbard-U correction to the energy functional results in
a broken-symmetry solution where the two excess electrons
localize on two srather than fourd Ce atoms neighboring the
vacancy sthe ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic solutions
are degenerated. Again, the role of the Hubbard-U term is to
drive the calculation directly toward the insulating solution
which would be stable also at the LDA or GGA level. The
DOS of defective ceria for x=0.125 is shown in Fig. 1sed. It
displays features which are intermediate between those of the
Ce2O3 and CeO2 structures: the gap state at 1.5 eV sdue to
occupied 4f states on Ce3+ atoms as in Ce2O3d and the sharp
unoccupied 4f band of the Ce4+ atoms at 4 eV. The release of
oxygen from the crystal structure has therefore the effect of
formally modifying the valency of Ce from 4+ to 3+ sthe
corresponding value of Trfnmm8g changes from 0.01 to 0.98d.
This result agrees with the experimental evidence that the
compensating defects are CeCe
8 and suggest their tendency to
cluster around the oxygen vacancy. An electronic configura-
tion in which two electrons were initially localized on Ce
atoms far from the vacancy led to the same SCF solution
described above, with two of the Ce nearest neighbors of the
vacancy being formally Ce3+. The neighbors of the vacancy
show a complex relaxation pattern which is not centrosym-
metric: five O atoms relax inward sfour by 0.12 Å, one by
0.25 Åd, one O atom outward by less than 0.03 Å, and the Ce
atoms outward sthe Ce3+ by 0.11 Å, the Ce4+ by 0.17 Åd. All
other atoms in the largest supercell relax by less than 0.05 Å.
As noticed for ceria surfaces8 the relaxed structure is rela-

tively insensitive to the details of the functionals, LDA or
GGA.
The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen va-
cancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the
missing O atom. In line with the calculation of the oxide
formation energies, we use the chemical potential of molecu-
lar oxygen: DHr=mCeOs2xd+x/2mO2sgdmCeO2. The resulting
values are 5.05 eV sLDA+Ud and 2.01 eV sGGA+Ud. Note
that, as in the case of the formation energetics of the bulk
oxides, the LDA+U value seems to be in better agreement
with the experiments s4.75.0 eV from Table 1 in Ref. 23
and references thereind than the GGA+U result. The ener-
getics were converged with respect to the supercell size to
less than 0.3 eV. The binding energy of molecular O, con-
tributing to the reference mO2sgd, is known to be badly pre-
dicted by DFT both in the LDA and the GGA. Another com-
mon reference is the energy of the oxygen atom in the triplet
state mO compensated by half of the experimental O2sgd
binding energy f5.2 eV sRef. 22dg. Even with this reference,
that partially compensates for known errors, the LDA+U
result s6.1 eVd is still closer to the experimental range than
the GGA+U one s2.7 eVd.
In summary, the multiple-valence character of cerium
makes the first-principles simulation of ceria compounds in-
trinsically insidious because of the existence of a large num-
ber of competing local energy minima. We have shown that,
contrary to the common belief based on previous research,
the ground state of these systems as predicted by traditional
LDA and GGA calculations does display the correct insulat-
ing character and oxidation state of the various Ce atoms.
This ground state may be difficult to access in practice. The
addition of a Hubbard-U term to the LDA/GGA energy func-
tional enhances the stability of the physical ground state,
making it easily accessible to routine DFT calculations. Pro-
jection on self-consistent Wannier functions makes the struc-
tural parameters and the energetics independent of U. The
calculated energetics is in overall good agreement with ex-
periments, the LDA results being actually better than the
GGA ones. This issue may have important implications when
studying chemical reactions on reduced ceria surfaces.
