Abstract
Pure zirconia and novel 0.5 wt% La, Mn and Fe doped zirconia powders were synthesized by the solgel method. The samples obtained were
characterized by thermal analysis (DTA/TGA), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The textural properties of the catalysts
were studied through N2 sorption isotherms measured at 77 K. In order to study the influence of the doping metals on the ZrO2 crystalline phase
formation, different doping metal loadings were employed. It was found that the ZrO2 monoclinic phase is favored at 800 C when using a La-Mn
doping combination, while the tetragonal structure was promoted by a La-Fe doping mixture. The morphology of the gel particles was seen to be
influenced by the nature of the doping metal; scanning electron microscopy served to observe this phenomenon.
Textural analysis by N2 sorption revealed that were obtained porous materials. The La-Fe zirconia catalyst resisted the high concentration
trichloroethylene flow and kept its activity as the temperature was increased. The catalytic activity tests showed that the ZrO2 tetragonal phase
stabilized by La, Fe doping agents significantly improved the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene.

1. Introduction
Zirconia is one of the most studied ceramic materials due to
its outstanding thermal, mechanical and chemical stability; in
addition, acidic, basic, oxidizing and reducing surface proper-
ties make this oxide suitable for many catalytic processes [13].
Depending on the preparation method and thermal treatment,
monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic, or a mixture of these phases can
be obtained. The most common method of preparation of ZrO2
is by pyrolysis from very pure zirconium chlorides or alkox-
ides [3]. At room temperature, the stable crystalline phase is
the monoclinic form and the reversible transformation to the
tetragonal phase occurs at 11001200 C, the cubic structure is
only formed at 2373 C [4]. It has also been pointed out that
zirconium oxide is an interesting and useful catalytic support.
La-Mn and La-Fe perovskites supported on ZrO2 have shown
good performances during methane combustion and CO oxi-

dation [5]. Doped ZrO2 catalysts have been prepared by the
solgel method and have showed a high activity in the low
temperature liquid phase cumene oxidation [2]. Alifanti et al.
[6] tested the toluene total oxidation in the temperature range
100500 C over supported LaCoO3 perovskites with 10 and
20 wt% loadings by incipient wetting impregnation of differ-
ent Ce1xZrxO2 substrates. These authors reported that at the
samecatalyticloading,thesupportcompositiondrasticallyinflu-
ences the oxidative abilities. Gutierrez-Ortiz et al. [7] studied the
efficiency of ceria, zirconia, and CexZr1xO2 mixed oxides as
catalysts for the vapor-phase decomposition in air of single chlo-
rinated volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They observed that
a notable improvement of the catalytic activity of CeO2 could
be achieved through structural doping of this substrate with Zr
ions.
The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for
the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are
mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribu-
tion of active metals upon the support [8]. The crystalline phase
obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic
precursor.

Catalyticcombustionisacosteffectivecontroltechnologyfor
theabatementofVOCsandairtoxics[9,10].Alsoforchlorinated
wastes the advantages of catalytic combustion versus thermal
incineration include lower fuel consumption (lower operating
costs), lower NOx emissions, lower CO and products of incom-
plete combustion (PIC) emissions, less CO2 emitted.
All the steps in the cycle of chlorinated compounds from
synthesis, their use as intermediates, recycle and final disposal
areaccompaniedbyemissions,mainlyaschlorinatedVOCs,into
the environment. Even if the noble metals, particularly platinum
and palladium, are active catalysts for destruction of chlorinated
VOCs and deep oxidation of hydrocarbons [10], the durability of
platinum group metals catalysts is affected in several ways in the
abatement of chlorinated VOCs; the active sites can be poisoned,
the dispersion of the platinum group metals can be affected by
the halides, the halides can react with the platinum group metals
and with the substrate affecting its integrity [11]. Recently de
Rivas et al. have proved the catalytic combustion of chlorinated
aliphatic pollutants over ceria-zirconia mixed oxides, observing
the best performance for the mixed oxides with 50 and 85 mol%
of zirconia [12].
In this work, La, Mn and Fe doped zirconia catalysts were
prepared by the solgel method employing a zirconium alkox-
ide and pertinent metallic acetates as precursors. The samples
obtained this way were thoroughly characterized with the pur-
pose of evaluating and comparing them as useful catalysts for
the combustion of trichloroethylene (abbreviated from now as
trieline).
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
In a typical experiment, 25.6 mL of zirconium butoxide was
mixed with 56.0 mL of 1-butanol. Glacial acetic acid was added
under magnetic stirring until reaching a pH of 3. Acetate solu-
tions of the doping metals were then added dropwise to the
butoxide-butanol mixture; the La, Fe or Mn doping species rep-
resented a 0.5 wt% of the ZrO2 mass (all precursors were from
Aldrich). The solution was maintained under refluxing con-
ditions at 60 C until a gel was formed. Xerogels were then
obtained by treating the gel samples at 70 C followed by cal-
cination in an electrical furnace at 800 C for 8 h. The catalysts
were labeled as Z (ZrO2), ZL (for ZrO2 doped with La), ZLM
(for ZrO2 doped with La and Mn), ZLF (for ZrO2 doped with
La and Fe), and ZLMF (for ZrO2 doped with La, Mn and Fe).
2.2. Characterization techniques
The FT-IR spectra of the samples, in the form of KBr mixed
disks, were determined using a Perkin-Elmer Paragon 1000
PC spectrometer. Thermal analyses of the xerogels were car-
ried out at in a TA Instruments SDT-2960 thermal analyzer at
a heating rate of 10 C/min in air. Crystalline phase analyses
were performed by X-ray powder diffraction using a Siemens
D-5000 diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu K radiation in
the 2Î¸ range 1090. Scanning electronic microscopy (SEM)

scope, at 30 kV/50 mA and 9-mm working distance. N2 sorption
isotherms at 77 K were measured via an Autosorb-1 volumetric
instrument (Quantachrome Co.); prior to the adsorption runs
all samples were outgassed overnight at 200 C, the N2 and
He gases required by the adsorption instrument were purchased
UHP grade.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were carried out using a tubular catalytic
micro-reactor. A steady state tubular micro-reactor inserted in
a tubular furnace equipped with a temperature controller was
used for the evaluation of the activity of the catalysts employ-
ing mixtures of trieline in air (1% by volume) [13]. The gas
temperature at the entrance and exit of the tubular reactor was
measured by type-K thermocouples. The compositions of inlet
andoutletgaseswereanalyzedusingaHP5890SeriesGasChro-
matograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. For each
catalyst the tubular catalytic micro-reactor was loaded with one
gram of catalyst. The spatial time was of 500 h1. Fig. 1 shows
the experimental set up employed for the trieline combustion
tests.
3. Results
3.1. Thermal characterization
It was found, based on the thermal analyses proceeding from
pure and doped zirconia xerogels, a very similar TGA behav-
ior of the ZrO2 doped substrates (Fig. 2a ), where the main
weight loss (20%) occurred between 80 and 200 C. This
mass loss can be associated with the evaporation of physically
absorbed water and ethanol from the solid. The second weight
loss (200380 C) can be attributed to volatilization of alkoxy
residual groups proper of zirconia butoxide at the beginning of
the solid dehydroxilation reaction. It is typical of most solgel
solids to retain OH groups up to high temperatures; in the present
case the dehydroxilation process was performed between 380

to 600 C. Regarding DTA analyses (Fig. 2b), two exothermic
peaks were observed for the pure zirconia DTA curve, namely at
350 and 468 C. The first signal can be attributed to the combus-
tion of organic residual groups while the second one indicates
a crystallization process between the amorphous product and
the tetragonal crystalline phase [14,15]. Such assumption was
confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of samples
treated at 500 and 600 C. The sharp exothermic peak at 468 C,
and which is attributed to the ZrO2 crystallization, is exhibited
at similar temperature for ZLF, ZLM and ZLMF samples and
includes both crystal formation and phase transformation. For
the ZLMF substrate the exothermic peak is a very weak one due
to the slow crystallization process that arises when increasing
the amount of metal doping content.
On the solgel process, the partial charge model can be
applied to inorganic and metal-organic precursors [16,17]. Usu-
ally, formation of hydroxo ligands MOH for tetravalent cations
is common at acidic pH while MOH2 bonds are observed
for low-valent cations (z+ = 2, 3). In the case of zirconia
alkoxide precursor, the hydroxo ligands predominate at pH
3, which causes the condensation via olation yielding several
kinds of bridges and infinite network is formed, then the zir-
conia crystalline arrangement is favored at low temperature
(468 C).
Ontheotherhand,thedopingagentshavelowerpartialcharge
which causes aquo ligands M(H2O)6z+ formation; its added per-
centage is very low and this causes the crystallization process
in the doped zirconia to occur at a slightly higher temperature
than pure zirconia. However, the cationic size also has influence
in the involved energy for the phase crystalline formation; the
zirconia doped only with lantane, which has a larger size than
Fe and Mn, exhibits this transformation in the DTA curve dis-

placed to higher temperature (505 C). Shi et al. [14] reported
this peak at the same temperature when they synthesized zir-
conia with yttria which has similar cationic size and the same
partial charge as lantane. Nevertheless, the combination of Fe
and Mn with lantane favored the diffusion of zirconium atoms
to achieve the crystalline arrangement of the structure at low
temperature (481 C). The transformation of tetragonal zirconia
into monoclinic phase is a slow process and cannot be observed
in the DTA curve.
3.2. FT-IR studies
In Fig. 3 , the FT-IR spectra of (a) fresh xerogels and (b) of
calcined samples are presented. It is clear that all samples present
the typical ZrOC pair vibrations around 1450 and 1560 cm1
[18,19]. A broad band observed between 3400 and 3650 cm1
corresponds to the OH stretching vibration [20] due to alco-
hol and water species occluded into the gel. An intermediate
absorption band was observed at 1028 cm1 and corresponded
to CO bond [21]. The calcined samples show the FT-IR spectra
where it can be seen the vanishing of bands related to organic
and hydroxyl groups. The strong and representative broad band
observed at 500700 cm1, is attributed to the ZrO stretching
mode [22,23].
3.3. SEM images
In Fig. 4 scanning electron photomicrographs of undoped and
triple doped zirconia substrates are presented. The pure zirconia
sample Z exhibits an estimated particle size of about 20 m and
well defined crystals; while the ZLMF sample shows particles of
an oval shape and an average particle size of 2 m. It is remark-
able that different morphologies were adopted by the doping
metal agents and caused different crystals aggregation modes
during the xerogel annealing process for all doped samples.
3.4. XRD patterns
The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples calcined at
temperatures lower than 700 C showed only reflections cor-
responding to the tetragonal phase. However, these catalysts are
going to be tested in catalytic combustion reactions arising tem-
peratures upon 650 C, therefore all samples were annealed at
800 C. Fig. 5 presents XRD patterns of the synthesized cata-
lysts thermally treated at 800 C. A mixture of tetragonal and
monoclinic phases is observed in the Z, ZL and ZLMF samples;
only the ZrO2 specimen doped with La-Mn presents the reflec-
tions corresponding to the monoclinic phase. It was reported
for pure zirconia synthesized by the solgel procedure that the
Fig. 4. SEM micrographs showed morphologies of undoped and La, Fe, and Mn doped zirconia. Pure zirconia (Z) presents well-defined macrocrystals (a). Tripled
doped zirconia (ZLMF) portrays oval shapes and crystals not well defined (b).

transformation to the monoclinic phase can only occur above
1200 C [23]; in our case, the combination of La-Mn doping
agents, causes the monoclinic form to appear at 800 C.
In the case of the solids doped with La-Fe, it can be observed
that the tetragonal phase is the dominant one; a similar effect
was reported by Navio et al. [3] stating that the development
of the tetragonal phase by the presence of doping agents could
be due to a decrease in the surface free energy of ZrO2 or to
the creation of anionic vacancies. It is important to emphasize
that the zirconia sample doped with the three metallic doping
oxides (ZLMF), exhibits the same combination of phases that
pure zirconia.
Kriventsov et al. prepared solgel synthesis of nanocompos-
ite system Fe/ZrO2, and found it seems that only isolated and
disordered iron ions locating on the ZrO2 surface are present
at low Fe concentration up to 5%, a mixture of monoclinic and
tetragonal structures was formed [24]. The estimation of unit
cell constant by Bragg law from tetragonal phase of DRX pat-
terns is reported in Table 1 for our samples. Eqs. (1) and (2) were
used to calculate the unit cell constant (a in Eq. (2)).

a = dh k l

Unit cell constant of doping samples are slightly higher than
the pure zirconia sample (Z). Then, we assume that the doping
agents are not inside the zirconia structure.
3.5. Textural analysis of doped ZrO2 substrates from N2
isotherms
Fig. 6 shows the N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K corresponding
toeachoftheZrO2 substratessynthesizedinthiswork.InTable1
is shown the values of some of the most important pore structural
parameters. All the isotherm shapes can be categorized as Type
IV isotherms within the IUPAC classification [25]. Similarly,
most of the hysteresis loops of these N2 isotherms are IUPAC
Type H2 [25]; however, the cycle associated to the ZLM sample
closely resembles the hysteresis shape classified as Type D by
de Boer [26].
In view of the shapes exhibited by the N2 sorption hysteresis
loops, the pore morphology of the different Zr samples can be
classified in two types: the undoped Z and doped ZL, and ZLF
systems can be thought to consist of large chambers delimited
by very narrow necks. The textural characteristic of Z and ZLF
specimens are similar to those found in Gibbsite-205 [27] and
which are due to the creation of pore cavities inside the solid
mass by water vapor during the hydrothermal dehydration of
the precursory gel. At a critical temperature (205 C in the case
of Gibbsite), the water vapor starts inflating large chambers and
subsequently escapes from them by opening up narrow throats
across neighboring cavities. The sharp percolation threshold
shown by the desorption boundary curves (DB) of these sam-
ples around p/p0 = 0.5 indicates that a cavitation phenomenon
[28] is taking place at this pressure. During this phenomenon
bubbles are first nucleated from entrapped gas pockets exist-
ing on the solid surface being in contact with the condensate
phase; at some sufficiently low p/p0 value, full-grown bubbles
are ejected abruptly at a percolation threshold (thus allowing the
liquid phase to escape from the pores while leaving all of them
empty of condensate).
In turn, the ZLM and ZLMF pore systems can also be con-
ceived as large chambers but this time delimited by necks of
different sizes. In particular, the isotherm of sample ZLM cor-
responds, according to de Boer [26], to a collection of spherical
cavities of about the same diameter but possessing a wide range
of interconnecting neck sizes that are somewhat larger than those
arising from samples Z and ZLF.
Thepore-sizedistribution(PSD)functions(Fig.7)ofthevoid
chambers existing in the Z, ZL, ZLF, and ZLMF substrates can
be approximated from the adsorption boundary (AB) isotherm if
it is assumed that the pore structure consists of spherical cavities
surrounded by small throats; the PSD of the cavities existing in

sample ZLM are practically unattainable given the asymptotic
character depicted by the AB isotherm close to p/p0 = 1. The
PSDs of the Z, ZL, ZLF and ZLMF substrates can be approx-
imated from either the classical BJH treatment [29] or from
the much more recent and precise Non-Local Density Func-
tional Theory (NLDFT) approach [30]. In the case of the ZLM
sample, the desorption boundary isotherm can be employed to
acquire an idea about the sizes of the diversity of pore throats
surrounding the cavities. Additionally, in order to illustrate that
an appropriate PSD analysis from the DB isotherm is not feasi-
ble for a sample such as Z; it is included graphical comparison
between the PSD curves obtained from the AB and DB curves
through the NLDFT treatment; the PSD obtained from the DB
isotherm renders a very sharp curve with pore sizes much smaller
than those obtained from the AB curve just because of the
existence of the cavitation phenomenon in the pores of the Z
sample.
From the PSD curves of the Z, ZLF, and ZLMF shown
in Fig. 7, it results evident that both NLDFT and BJH
analyses proceeding from the AB isotherm (when assuming
spherical liquidvapor interfaces) are not extremely different
from each other as it is expected in samples made of big
pores [30].
In summary, the N2 sorption results allow to know that the
Zr substrates prepared in this work correspond to porous solids
denominated as Type I structures [31]. These substrates consist

of two sorts of pore entities: one kind of pores (i.e. cavities or
chambers) has sizes that are much larger than a second class
of voids (i.e. throats, necks, bonds) to which the first ones are
connected; the smallest site is much larger than twice the size of
the biggest bond. This size relationship guarantees an absolute
independence among the condensation processes that occur in
each class of void element. At low vapor pressures, condensa-
tion occurs at throats while the chambers remain empty. After
occupying all throats with condensate, condensation in cavities
starts according to the size of each one of these chambers. Under
these circumstances, the hysteresis loop results extremely wide.
The AB curve begins rising only when p/p0 is close to unity,
while the DB curve shows an extended plateau before that at a
well defined percolation threshold an abrupt descent takes place
due to a cavitation phenomenon.
The specific surface areas of the ZrO2 catalysts range from
1.5 to 5 m2 g1 and the pore size from 5 to 60 nm approximately
(Table 1), this means that a small surface area has a minor influ-
ence on the catalytic combustion of trieline; on the other hand,
the relatively large cavity sizes can facilitate the transport of
reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2
catalysts; which is related to percolation and permeability char-
acteristics of the porous materials. Percolation is the ability of a
structure to allow the penetration of fluids, whereas permeability
the amount of the fluid penetrating through the same structure
[32] (Fig. 6).

catalysts at different metal combination (Cin of hydrocarbon: 1 volume%).
3.6. Catalytic activity
The catalytic tests were carried out using the different cata-
lysts synthesized in this work. Fig. 8 shows the conversion as
a function of temperature for trieline combustion reaction. The
conversion curve observed in blank runs and due to homoge-
neous combustion is shown for comparison (thermal labelled
curve), to evidence the contribution of the catalysts. Zirconia
(Z) pure does not present catalytic activity at 200 C, ZLF and
ZL catalysts show 10% of conversion, while the ZLMF and
ZLM materials present 28% activity. The gain in conversion
is more evident for all doping catalyst at 300 C; the Z cat-
alyst only reaches 18% while the remaining doped catalysts
achieve from 34 to 40% conversions, the homogenous reaction
obtains only 8%. After 350 C the doping catalysts change their
catalytic performance, the reaction of trieline combustion over
ZLM and ZL tend to homogenous reaction curve. It is noticeable
that ZL and tripled doping catalyst (ZLMF) have very simi-
lar activity upper homogenous reaction, but lower than ZLF
behaviour. Only the catalyst doped with La and Fe continues
with an excellent catalytic performance at high temperatures. In
this way the ZLF catalyst reaches almost 100% of conversion at
500 C meanwhile the thermal combustion only achieves 50%
at the same temperature. De Paoli and Barresi [33] reported
that trieline combustion over LaFeO3 perovskite presented an
inhibition effect caused by the strong adsorption of chlorinated
species on the active sites of the catalytic surface. In our exper-
iment the concentration of trieline is very high compared with
other works [33,34], then, is very possible that our catalysts
had lost their catalytic activity after 350 C undergoing a deac-
tivation for effect of the continuous flow of trieline. The ZLF
material shows the best performance of all catalyst at high tem-
perature. The main crystalline phase stabilized for ZLF was the
tetragonal for zirconia support. The monoclinic phase of zirco-
nia present in all rest catalyst different of ZLF, do not present
a good performance at the test conditions of trieline combus-
tion. The manganese component in the doped catalysts seems
to exert an unfavorable influence under these circumstances and
therefore a negative impact during catalytic testing of trieline
combustion.
Even the specific area of ZLF catalyst is lower than Z sam-
ple (Table 1), its great activity can be caused more than a
type of crystalline phase also by the presence of the doping
agents; Fe and La, can influence to create active sites [35].
In the heterogeneous reactions the adsorption and desorption
mechanisms are not favored by low specific areas, but the pore
structural characteristics promote percolation and permeability
phenomena which explain the good catalytic performance in this
experiment [32].
Heterogeneous reactions are favored by increasing perme-
ability. Percolation and permeability are found only in open
pores, then, the value of permeability is larger in the case of
macropores, just for geometrical reasons. For the porous mate-
rials the reaction can be carried out on the surface of the particle
and also significant amount of reactant can be diffused well into
the particle interior with reacting.
4. Conclusion
We have prepared and characterized samples of zirconia sub-
strates doped with La, Mn and Fe. The zirconia crystallization
temperature is affected by the nature and combination of the
metallic doping. The influence of doping was also evidenced by
XRD and SEM analysis both in the morphology of the particles
and in the crystalline phases obtained. The presence of tetrag-
onal and monoclinic crystalline phases for the different doped
samples depends on the combination of metals; it is clear that
the monoclinic structure is favored by the La-Mn combination
while the tetragonal arrangement by the La-Fe doping agents.
The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific
areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes
could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products
combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic
tests. The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration
of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance
of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the
presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase.
