Radiation effects in crystalline Si02: The role of aluminum

(Received 5 June 1980; accepted for publication 17 October 1980) 
Electron spin resonance (ESR) and infrared absorption (IR) experiments have provided 
information about the role of 
aluminum in the radiation response of 
commercially available high-
quality synthetic quartz. Samples obtained from two separate sources were investigated, and 
identical radiation responses were found for the two materials. Interstitial ions such as H+, Li +, 
and Na 
+ as well as radiation-induced holes trapped at oxygen ions act as charge compensators for 
the ever-present substitutional aluminum ions. Usually the charge compensator is located 
adjacent to the aluminum, and this gives rise to AI-OH-, AI-Li+, AI-Na +, and [Ale' ]0 centers. 
Absolute concentrations of these compensated aluminum centers have been determined as a 
function of irradiation and annealing temperature for a variety of samples, both swept and 
unswept. The various treatments simply exchange one type of compensator for another at the 
aluminum sites, and within experimental error, the sum of the aluminum centers remains 
constant for a given sample. This direct accountability of all the aluminum ions in hydrogen-
swept samples strongly suggests that the 3306- and 3367-cm 
-1 infrared bands are associated with 
the AI-OH- center. Also, the ESR and IR results show that the aluminum content of randomly 
selected bars of high-quality quartz can vary by an order of magnitude.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Alpha-quartz is used in a variety of electronic devices 
(e.g., high-precision oscillators, filters, accelerometers, etc.) 
where sensitivity and stability are crucial operating criteria. 
Since many of these applications require operation of the 
device in a radiation environment, considerable effort has 
been directed in recent years toward understanding the radi-
ation response of quartz. It 
is now well-known that quartz-
stabilized oscillators exposed to ionizing radiation (i.e., x 
rays and gamma rays as well as high-energy electrons, pro-
tons, and neutrons) may exhibit transient and steady-state 
changes in frequency and associated reductions in Q. 1-3 Ear-
ly results obtained by King4 and other investigators5- 8 sug-
gested that these deleterious effects in the quartz oscillators 
were associated with the presence of 
impurities. This has led 
to increased study of the general behavior of impurities in 
quartz and there have been attempts to correlate observed 
frequency offsets with specific impurity-related, radiation-
induced defects.9 
Aluminum is the most pervasive impurity in both natu-
ral and synthetic quartz. These aluminum ions exist in the 
3 + valence state in quartz and easily substitute for silicon, 
thus requiring charge compensation (i.e., an aluminum ion 
needs an additional positive-charged entity in the lattice to 
compensate for the charge of 
the replaced silicon). Examples 
of 
such charge compensators in quartz are H + 
, Li + 
, or N 
a + 
ions at interstitial sites or holes trapped at oxygen ions. Be-
cause of the strong Coulombic attraction force of 
the inter-
stitial ions and the holes with the aluminum, and because of 
the high mobility of 
both the interstitial ions and the holes, 
these charge compensators are usually located adjacent to 
the substitutional aluminum ions and this gives rise to either 
AI-OH-, Al-Li +, AI-Na 
+, or [Ale+ ]0 centers. Schematic 
representations of 
these various compensated aluminum 
centers are contained in Fig. 1. 
The defect centers produced by local compensation of 
the substitutional aluminum ions can be experimentally ob-
served by widely varying techniques. In the case of the AI-
OH- center, the interstitial proton bonds to an oxygen ion to 
form an OH- molecule adjacent to the aluminum, and in-
frared absorption provides a direct monitor of 
the center. 
Formation of the [Ale' ]0 center by trapping a hole at an 
oxygen ion adjacent to the aluminum results in an unpaired 
electron, and thus a paramagnetic defect, which can easily be 
detected by electron spin resonance (ESR). The AI-M + cen-
ters (where M + represents an alkali ion) exhibit no charac-
teristic infrared bands and are not paramagnetic, but do 
cause a local lattice deformation. As a result, they can couple 
to external forces acting along certain crystallographic di-
rections, and can undergo a deformation relaxation with an 
attendant mechanical loss. 
The electrodiffusion (sweeping) process initially devel-
oped by King4 provides a method for changing the concen-
tration of 
specific interstitial cations (i.e., H+, Li +, Na 
+, 
etc.) within a given quartz crystal. This technique consists of 
applying an electric field parallel to the c axis of 
the crystal 
while maintaining the sample temperature in the 400--550 'c 
range. Either a vacuum or an inert gas, air, or hydrogen 
atmosphere surrounds the crystal. As positive-charged spe-
cies are pulled along the large c-axis channels and out of 
the 
crystal by the electric field, additional positive-charged spe-
cies of 
a similar or different nature are taken into the crystal 
at the opposite electrode in order to maintain charge neutral-
ity for the sample as a whole. For example, if 
either air or a 
hydrogen atmosphere surrounds the crystal, the sweeping 
process will remove interstitial alkali ions from the crystal 
and replace them with H+ ions. Numerous cases exist in the 
literature where the sweeping process has greatly helped in 
clarifying the behavior of 
various point defects in quartz.

In the present paper, we have combined infrared and 
ESR data to obtain information about the formation and 
decay of the various aluminum centers in both swept and 
unswept high-quality synthetic quartz. By monitoring the 
absolute concentration of each type of compensated alumi-
num center (i.e., AI-OH - , AI-M + or [Ale' ]0) after each step 
of 
a series of 
irradiations and anneals, we have shown, within 
experimental error, that the sum of these centers remains 
constant, and that different treatments simply change one 
type of compensator for another. This direct accountability 
of all the aluminum ions within a crystal strongly suggests 
that the 3306- and 3367-cm- I infrared bands are associated 
with the AI-OH- center, and also reinforces the conviction 
that radiation-induced mobility of 
interstitial ions is the fun-
damental radiation response of quartz. 
II. BACKGROUND 
A. Infrared absorption 
Quartz exhibits a large number of 
infrared absorption 
bands in the.3200- to 3600-cm -\ spectral region, and Kats 
10 
has shown that many of 
these bands are due to OH- stretch-
ing vibrations. However, it has proven extremely difficult to 
3566 
J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 52, No.5, May 1981 
assign specific defect models to each of the OH- absorption 
bands. Many researchers have focused attention on the two 
bands at 3306 and 3367 cm - I. Normally, the 3367-cm . I 
band is approximately three times more intense than the 
3306-cm - I band. Kats 
10 observed these two bands in both 
natural and synthetic quartz and found that x-irradiation at 
room temperature enhanced their intensities. Also, Kats ob-
served that sweeping in air strongly increased the two bands 
in synthetic samples, and he tentatively suggested the two 
bands arise from an OH-- molecule adjacent to a substitu-
tional aluminum. 
Brown and Kahan 
II provided further evidence sup-
porting the model proposed by Kats and also pointed out 
that failure to observe the 3306- and 3367-cm ... I bands did 
not necessarily mean a low aluminum content for the quartz 
crystal. They found that these two bands were not present 
initially in high-quality unswept quartz, but were introduced 
by irradiation at room temperature. This, in turn, led Brown 
and Kahan to conclude that all of the substitutional alumi-
num ions are alkali compensated in the as-grown high-qual-
ity quartz (i.e., before irradiation or sweeping). 
Lipson et al. 12. L' have investigated the polarization of 
the 3306- and 3367-cm 
I bands and have demonstrated the 
strong temperature dependence of their half-widths (i.e., a 
narrowing at lower temperature). They found that heating to 
500C in a nitrogen atmosphere for long periods of time 
without application of 
an electric field did not introduce the 
3306- and 3367-cm -I bands in quartz. They also found that 
sweeping the quartz in a vacuum failed to introduce signifi-
cant 3306- and 3367-cm- I bands. 
Recently, Sibley et al. 14 extended the study of the 3306-
and 3367-cm - I bands to include irradiations at various tem-
peratures from 15 to 300 K and to include thermal anneals 
from 77 to 750 K. They found that although room-tempera-
ture irradiation introduced these two bands in unswept syn-
thetic quartz, a subsequent intense 77-K irradiation de-
stroyed the two bands. Following the room-temperature 
irradiation and subsequent 77-K irradiation, Sibley et al. 
found that the two bands slowly recovered with nearly equal 
intensities up to approximately 200 K, but in the 230-270 K 
anneal region the 3367-cm - I band continued to grow, while 
the 3306-cm -I band decreased in intensity. At room tem-
perature the bands had attained their usual intensity ratio. 
This sudden reversal of intensities in the 230-270 K region 
suggested the two bands arise from OH-- molecules in two 
different but closely related sites, and that a transfer from 
one site to the other (or a reorientation) occurs in the 230-
270 K region. 
B. Electron spin resonance 
The [Ale' r 
center is perhaps the best characterized of 
the point defects in quartz. The first observations of this 
center were by ESR and were reported by Griffiths, Owen, 
and Ward. IS O'Brien 
16 immediately offered an interpreta-
tion of the ESR data in terms of a model having a hole 
trapped primarily in a non 
bonding orbital of an oxygen ion 
adjacent to a substitutional aluminum ion [see Fig. l(c)].

family of [Ale. / M + ] + centers when germanium-doped 
quartz was irradiated at 77 K. The M + represents an inter-
stitial cation (i.e., either H+, Li+, or Na+) which is trapped 
on one side of 
the aluminum ion, while the hole is trapped on 
the other side of the aluminum. These interstitial-compen-
sated, aluminum-hole centers have been further character-
ized by Mackey et a/ 1M and by Nuttall. 19 
In a-quartz, the four oxygens surrounding a silicon (or 
aluminum) atom are only pairwise-equivalent, short- and 
long-bond oxygens. Nuttall19 has shown that the ground 
state of 
the [Ale' ]0 center corresponds to trapping the hole 
on a long-bond oxygen, and Schnadt and Schneider20 have 
shown that only 0.03 e 
V of 
energy is required to transfer the 
hole from one type of 
oxygen to the other. Precise values of 
the [Ale' ]0 center ground-state spin Hamiltonian hyperfine 
parameters have been obtained by Barker21 using electon-
nuclear double-resonance (ENDOR) techniques. Recently, 
Markes and Halliburton22 have investigated the production 
and stabilization conditions for [Ale+ ]0 centers, and Koum-
vakalis23 has correlated the [AI 
•• ]0 center ESR spectrum 
with a visible optical absorption. The comprehensive review 
by Weil24 summarizes much additional work on the alumi-
num-associated hole centers in quartz. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL 
The a-quartz used in the present investigation was all 
pure Z-growth material and included Electronic Grade and 
Premium Q bars25 obtained from Sawyer Research Pro-
ducts, Eastlake, Ohio, and a Supreme Q bar obtained from 
Toyo Communications Equipment Company, Kawasaki, 
Japan. The sample labeling scheme introduced by Markes 
and Halliburton22 has been followed in the present paper. 
Impurity analysis along with autoclave and sweeping infor-
mation for some of the Sawyer samples used in the present 
study are included in Ref. 22. The Toyo bar SQ-A had been 
numbered 40-57 by the manufacturer. Infrared and ESR 
samples were taken from adjacent positions in each of the 
quartz bars, and the same sample number was used for both 
components of 
a pair. For example, the sample number PQ-
EIO actually represents both an infrared and an ESR sample 
in this paper. One of 
the pairs of 
samples cut from the Toyo 
bar was swept at Oklahoma State University (graphite elec-
trodes, hydrogen atmosphere, 1600 V 
/ cm, 500 'C, and 19 h 
duration). All sweeping of 
Electronic Grade and Premium Q 
bars was done by Sawyer in air. 
The infrared samples were cut in the form of plates 
( 
15 X 15 X 3 mm) perpendicular to the c axis of 
the crystal. A 
Beckman 4240 spectrophotometer was used to measure the 
infrared absorption. During the measurements, samples 
were oriented such that the incident monitoring light was 
parallel to the c axis (i.e., the electric vector of the unpolar-
ized incident light was always perpendicular to the c axis). 
AlI the infrared data were obtained near 77 K using a metal 
Dewar equipped with CaF2 windows for the light beam. 
During irradiations, the tail of 
the Dewar was rotated 90', 
thus positioning a 0.005-in.-thick aluminum window in front 
of 
the sample. 
The ESR spectrometer utilized a homodyne microwave 
3567 
J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 52. No.5. May 1981 
bridge of our own design (operating near 9.1 GHz) and a 9-
in. Fieldial-regulated Varian magnet. The magnetic field 
modulation frequency was 100 kHz. All the ESR data were 
taken at 77 K using a glass finger Dewar inserted in a Varian 
V 
-4531 rectangular cavity. The ESR samples were rectangu-
lar in shape (8 X 3 X 2 mm), and during measurements, the 
magnetic field was always aligned parallel to the crystal c 
axis. 
Irradiations were 4 min in duration and used 1.7-MeV 
electrons from a Van de Graaff accelerator. The current on 
the sample was 0.2 /lA/cm2 , corresponding to a dose of 
3 X 107 rad(Si). During a 77-K irradiation, the ESR sample 
was immersed in liquid nitrogen, and then subsequently 
transferred into the glass finger Dewar. For an intermediate-
temperature irradiation, the ESR sample was placed in a 
styrofoam tube, and nitrogen gas at the chosen temperature 
was passed by the sample. Both the 77 K and the intermedi-
ate-temperature irradiations of the infrared samples were 
done with the sample mounted in the metal Dewar. For each 
of 
the anneal steps above room temperature, the infrared and 
ESR samples were removed from their respective Dewars, 
heated simultaneously in a furnace, and then remounted in 
the Dewars. 
A most important feature of 
the present investigation is 
the determination of absolute concentrations of specific de-
fects using the infrared and ESR data. An ESR spin standard 
consisting of a single crystal of 
Al 20 3 
doped with Cr3+ ions 
was obtained from the National Bureau of 
Standards, Office 
of 
Standard Reference Materials. Transfer of 
the known spin 
concentration to an unknown quartz sample was accom-
plished by placing the unknown and standard in the micro-
wave cavity simultaneously, thus eliminating errors due to 
spectrometer operation, and performing double numerical 
integrations of the resulting spectra.26 In the case of the in-
frared measurements, the expression NH = 2.16x 1016 Ham 
was used for concentration determinations. Originally pre-
sented by Kats, to this expression gives the OH- concentra-
tion N 
H (defects/cm3) in terms of the half-width H (cm -I) 
and maximum absorption coefficient am (cm -I) ofthe in-
frared absorption band. A Gaussian shape for the absorption 
curve and an effective charge of 
p = 0.43 for the oscillator 
have been assumed. to The half-widths of 
the 3367- and 3306-
cm 
-I infrared bands were 8.0 and 7.4 cm -I, respectively at 
77-80 K, where our measurements were performed. Smaller 
half-widths have been reported by other researchers using 
higher-resolution instruments. 
IV. RESULTS 
In Fig. 2 the infrared absorption of 
the unswept Premi-
um Q sample PQ-EIO is shown following each step of an 
irradiation and thermal anneal sequence. The initial spec-
trum [Fig. 2(a)] was obtained from the as-received sample, 
without prior irradiation. The broad bands at 3200 and 3300 
cm - I have been attributed to intrinsic overtone vibrations of 
the quartz lattice, to and thus should remain unchanged 
throughout the sequence depicted in Fig. 2. Additional 
smaller bands at 3400,3440, and 3585 cm 
-I 
are due to OH-
molecules stabilized in defect configurations that have not 
yet been identified. 10--14 These latter bands are very pro-

The infrared spectrum shown in Fig. 2(b) was obtained 
after sample PQ-ElO was irradiated at 77 K and maintained 
at this low temperature. This treatment greatly reduced the 
three OH- bands initially present in the sample and left only 
the two intrinsic bands. Warming the sample to room tem-
perature [Fig. 2(c)] failed to restore the OH- bands at 3400, 
3440, and 3585 cm - I. As shown in Fig. 2(d), a room-tem-
perature irradiation introduces the two bands at 3306 and 
3367 cm 
- I. The 3306-cm - 1 band is a shoulder on the side of 
the intrinsic 3300-cm -I band and is sometimes difficult to 
resolve in relatively pure samples. As a final step in the irra-
diation and anneal sequence, the infrared spectrum [Fig. 
2(e)] of sample PQ-ElO was obtained after irradiation at 77 
K. This second irradiation at 77 K eliminated the bands at 
3306 and 3367 cm 
-I, following their introduction by the 
room-temperature irradiation. 
The unswept ESR sample PQ-ElO was subjected to the 
same irradiation and thermal-anneal sequence as the in-
frared sample PQ-ElO; the results being shown in Fig. 3. 
Examination of 
the as-received sample [Fig. 3(a)] revealed no 
ESR spectra. Irradiation at 77 K produced a few very weak 
unidentified ESR spectra [Fig. 3(b)], but these disappeared 
after warming the sample to room temperature [Fig. 3(c)]. 
The irradiation at room temperature introduced an intense 
set of 
closely spaced ESR lines extending over a 30-G region 
when the magnetic field is aligned along the crystal's c axis. 
This spectrum, shown in Fig. 3(d), is centered at gc 
= 2.0183, and has been assigned by previous investigators 
to the [Ale' ]0 center. 15,17,20 The second irradiation at 77 K 
further enhanced the number of [Ale+ ]0 centers [Fig. 3(e)]. 
The other half of the quartz bar from which the un-
swept samples PQ-ElO were taken had been swept by Saw-
yer. An infrared sample and an adjacent ESR sample, both 
labeled PQ-F12, were cut from this swept portion of the 
original bar. They then were subjected to the same irradia-
tion and thermal-anneal sequence as the un 
swept samples.

The ESR spectra obtained from the swept sample PQ-

an intense [Ale' ]0 center spectrum [Fig. SIb)], but nearly all 
of these centers were destroyed during the anneal to room 
temperature [Fig. SIc)]. Additional irradiation at room tem-

the initial concentration of AI- M + centersY Since the AI-
M + centers are not affected by irradiations below 200 K but 
are destroyed by irradiations above this temperature,27 the 
AI-M + center concentration remains constant for the first 
three steps of 
the irradiation and anneal sequence and drops 
to zero for the last two steps. Finally, the total concentration 
of all three aluminum-associated defects is given in the 
fourth column of 
Tables I and II for each step of the se-
quence. 
Similar infrared and ESR measurements were made on 
samples cut from additional quartz bars. The concentrations 
of the various aluminum-associated centers following each 
step of the irradiation and anneal sequence are given in Ta-
bles III-VIII for these latter samples. Results for the uns-
wept sample PQ-A20 and the swept sample PQ-Dl, both 
Sawyer Premium Q material, are presented in Table III and 
IV, respectively. Tables V and VI contain the results from 
unswept sample EG-C20 and swept sample EG-F20, both 
Sawyer Electronic Grade material. The PQ-D and EG-F 
lumbered bars were swept by Sawyer. Finally, for compari-
son, the un 
swept sample SQ-A 1 described in Table VII was 
taken from a bar of Toyo Supreme Q material. Sample SQ-
A2 was cut from an adjacent position in the same Toyo bar 
and then swept in a hydrogen atmosphere at Oklahoma State 
University prior to obtaining the data presented in Table 
VIII. In our ESR and infrared-absorption experiments, we 
have been unable to differentiate between sweeping in hydro-
gen and sweeping in air. Thus, we will use the notation hy-
drogen-swept in the remainder of 
the paper to refer to sweep-
ing in either atmosphere. 
Since the low-temperature irradiations did not always 
destroy all of the AI-OR- centers in these latter samples 
(apparently because of insufficient radiation doses), the AI-
M + center concentrations were determined by taking the 
difference in the sum of the AI-OR - and [Ale' r center

concentrations following the first and second 77-K irradia-
tions. In the case of 
samples PQ-D 
1 and EG-F20, where the 
second 77-K irradiation gave a larger concentration of Al-
OR - plus [Ale' r' centers than the first 77-K irradiation, 
the Al-M + center concentration is arbitrarily set equal to 
zero. 
In all of the unswept samples examined, only a few of 
the [Ale' r' centers and none of the 3306- and 3367-cm- ' 
infrared bands are produced by the initial 77-K irradiation, 
but they appear with significant intensity after the subse-
quent room-temperature irradiation. A second 77-K irradia-
tion further enhances the [Ale' ]0 center ESR spectrum but 
destroys the two infrared bands. In order to determine the 
critical temperature range above which these two infrared 
bands and the [Ale' ]0 center ESR spectrum are initially 
enhanced by radiation, several unswept samples were sub-
jected to a series of 
irradiations at progressively higher tem-
peratures between 77 and 300 K. The growth of the 3367-
cm 
 
I infrared band and the [Ale' ]0 center ESR spectrum 
are shown in Fig. 6 for the unswept Sawyer Premium Q 
sample PQ-Ell and the unswept Toyo Supreme Q sample 
SQ-A3. In this figure, the infrared samples were immediate-
ly measured at 77 K following each intermediate-tempera-
ture irradiation, while the ESR samples were reirradiated at 
77 K each time to insure filling all electron traps before mea-
suring the [Ale' ]0 center ESR spectrum. 
As shown in Fig. 7, an unswept sample irradiated at 
room temperature can be restored to its as-received state by 
simply heating to the 500-650 K region. Un 
swept samples 
PQ-ElO and SQ-Al were first irradiated at room tempera-
ture and then sequentially heated to the indicated higher 
temperatures, where they were held for 15 min before being 
returned to 77 K. Each infrared data point (sum of 
the 3306-
and 3367 
-cm 
 
I bands) in Fig. 7 was taken immediately upon

returning the sample to 77 K, whereas the taking of each 
ESR data point in Fig. 7 was preceded by a 77-K irradiation. 
Thus the infrared data represents a simple pulsed anneal 
experiment describing the thermal stability of the two in-
frared bands; while the ESR data does not necessarily pro-
vide information about the thermal stability of the [Ale' r' 
center, but rather indicates the concentration of [Ale' r' 
centers that can be generated by a 77-K irradiation. The 
results in Fig. 7 show that the ability to enhance the [Ale' r 
center concentration by a second 77-K irradiation in uns-
wept samples disappears in the same temperature region as 
the two infrared bands. Also shown in Fig. 7 are the results of 
similar infrared and ESR measurements on the swept sample 
PQ-FI2. In direct contrast to the unswept samples, no sig-
nificant changes in the 500-650 K temperature region were 
observed for the swept sample. 
V. DISCUSSION 
The present experimental investigation has provided in-
formation about the role of 
aluminum (via its need for charge 
compensation) in the radiation response of high-quality syn-
thetic quartz. Specifically, we have (1) made absolute con-
centration measurements of 
aluminum-associated defects in 
quartz as a function of sample treatment; (2) provided evi-
dence supporting the AI-OR 
model for the 3306- and 3367-
cm 
1 infrared bands; (3) further verified that the radiation-
induced mobility of interstitials is a fundamental radiation 
response of 
quartz, while demonstrating that aluminum is a 
dominant interstitial trap; and (4) compared the radiation 
response of high-quality quartz obtained from two indepen-
dent sources (Sawyer and Toyo). 
In the present investigation, we did not monitor the AI-
M +- centers directly, but inferred their presence from the

absence of AI-OH- and [Ale' ]0 centers. It is important to 
note that this is not a limitation of our results, since the 
recent acoustic loss measurements of 
Doherty et al., 
28 where 
the AI-Na + centers were observed directly, strongly support 
our method of accounting for aluminum ions not found in 
the form of AI-OH- or [Ale' ]0 centers. 
A. Absolute concentration measurements 
The results presented in Tables I-VIII suggest that sub-
stitutional aluminum ions in high-quality quartz have either 
interstitial hydrogen ions, radiation-induced holes, or inter-
stitial alkali ions as charge compensators. The absolute con-
centration of 
aluminum ions possessing a specific compensa-
tor varies in a systematic manner, and depends on what stage 
the sample is at in the irradiation and anneal sequence and on 
whether the sample has been swept or not. As-received uns-
wept samples have only AI-M + centers, whereas as-received 
hydrogen-swept samples have primarily AI-OH- centers. 
Sample PQ-F12 appears to be an exception to this last state-
ment, but that is simply because the sweeping was not com-
pleted. The first 77-K irradiation eliminates AI-OH- cen-
ters and produces [Ale' r centers in hydrogen-swept 
samples, but does not significantly affect unswept samples. 
Returning a sample, either hydrogen-swept or unswept, to 
room temperature following the initial 77-K irradiation re-
stores it to near the as-received condition. Room-tempera-
ture irradiation always leaves AI-OH- and [Ale' ]0 centers;

ANNEAL TEMPERATURE (K) 
FIG. 7. Effect of high-temperature annealing on the stability of the 3306-
and 3367-cm- 1 infrared bands and on the production of 
the [Ale' ]" center 
ESR spectrum by 77-K irradiation. The data are from un 
swept Sawyer 
Premium Q sample PQ-EIO, Sawyer-swept Premium Q sample PQ-FI2, 
and unswept Toyo Supreme Q sample SQ-AI. 
ters are observed after the second 77-K irradiation in both 
swept and unswept samples. 
If 
all of 
the aluminum in a sample can be accounted for 
either as AI-OH-, l 
Ale' ]0, or AI-M +centers, then the totals 
(i.e., the sums of the three centers) for a given sample will 
remain constant as the sample is cycled through the se-
quence of irradiations and anneals. Since the data in Tables 
I-VIII come from two completely independent experiments, 
ESR and infrared absorption, variations in the totals for a 
given sample are not unexpected. However, it is satisfying to 
note that the observed variations are within the expected 
experimental error (including estimates of 
random as well as 
systematic contributions) of25% to 50%. Among the poten-
tial sources of 
error are (1) the choice of 
"effective" oscillator 
strengths for the infrared bands; (2) the possibility that the 
irradiations were not always saturating the concentration of 
defects; and (3) the possibility of 
non 
uniformity of 
aluminum 
content from the ESR sample to the infrared sample even 
though they were taken from adjacent positions in the quartz 
bars. 
In the case of samples PQ-EIO and EG-F20, the mass 
spectroscopy data presented in Ref. 22 provides additional 
confirmation of the aluminum concentrations found in the 
present investigation. Sample PQ-E3 was reported in the 
earlier work to have a total aluminum content of 7 I-lg/g, 
which is equivalent to a concentration of 
41.3 X 10 16 cm 
-3; 
whereas the present ESR and infrared results (Table I) give a 
maximum concentration of 40.4 X 1016 cm 
- 3 for the alumi-
num in sample PQ-E 
1 
0. These two Premium Q samples, PQ-
E3 and PQ-E I 
0, are from the same bar, although from differ-
ent locations, and the fortuitously small difference between 
the mass spectroscopy and ESR-infrared results for the total 
aluminum concentration can easily be attributed to the non-
uniform distribution of the aluminum ions with the quartz 
bar. Samples EG-E39 and EG-E42 were reported in Ref. 22 
to have aluminum concentrations of 3 and 2I-lg/g, respec-
tively (i.e., 17.7X 1016 and 11.8X 10 16 cm- 3 ). Sample EG-
F20 is from the same original bar as samples EG-E39 and 
EG-E42 and should have a similar aluminum content.22 The

ESR and infrared results (Table VI) give concentrations 
ranging from 15.1 X 1016 to 23.7 X 10 16 cm 
-3 for the alumi-
num in sample EG-F20. Again, the agreement between the 
mass spectroscopy and ESR-infrared results as to total alu-
minum content is reasonable, considering that the EG-E and 
EG-F samples were from opposite ends of the original bar. 
B. Infrared band identifications 
In the past, Kats, 10 Brown and Kahan, II and others 
12-14 
have suggested that the 3306- and 3367-cm - I infrared ab-
sorption bands arise from an AI-OH- center (i.e., an OH-
molecule adjacent to a substitutional aluminum). Given the 
behavior of 
these two bands as described by previous investi-
gators, this is a conceptually satisfying explanation of their 
origin, and since there is no significant conflicting data, the 
simple AI-OH- model has not been disputed in the litera-
ture. However, despite this general acceptance of 
the model, 
conclusive evidence has not yet been presented to link direct-
ly the 3306- and 3367-cm -I bands to aluminum. In the case 
of the paramagnetic [Ale' ]0 center, the presence of alumi-
num is clearly indicated by the resolved aluminum hyperfine 
interactions in the ESR spectra. 21 There are, of course, no 
effects analogous to the hyperfine splitting which connect 
the two infrared bands to aluminum. 
In the present investigation, the concentration of de-
fects giving rise to the 3306- and 3367-cm 
-I infrared bands 
in hydrogen-swept samples (Tables II, IV, VI, and VIII) is 
seen to vary inversely with the [Ale' j<J center concentration. 
Whenever the 3306- and 3367-cm -I bands are intense, the 
[Ale' r' center ESR spectrum is relatively weak, and vice 
versa. A similar, although not as pronounced, relationship 
exists for the unswept samples (Tables I, III, V, and VII) 
during the room-temperature and second 77-K irradiations. 
More precisely stated, the sum of 
the [Ale' ]0 centerconcen-
tration and the infrared-active-defect concentration remains 
constant, within experimental error, for a given sample for 
all cases where the AI-M + center concentration is negligible. 
The variable-temperature irradiation data presented in Fig. 
6 and the high-temperature anneal data presented in Fig. 7 
provide additional evidence linking aluminum with the 
3306- and 3367 
-cm - I infrared bands. In both cases, the 
[Ale' ]0 center ESR spectrum and the two infrared bands 
exhibit similar behavior. As shown in Fig. 6, the ESR and 
infrared spectra are enhanced by irradiation temperatures 
above 200 K in previously unirradiated, un 
swept samples. 
The high-temperature anneal data from unswept samples 
(Fig. 7) show that the thermal decay of the two infrared 
bands correlates directly with the disappearance of 
the abili-
ty to enhance the production of [Ale' ]0 centers by 77-K 
reirradiation. The hydrogen-swept sample shows quite dif-
ferent behavior during the high-temperature anneal (Fig. 7) 
when compared to the unswept samples, but the correlation 
between the [Ale' ]0 center spectrum and the two infrared 
bands remains excellent in the case of 
the hydrogen-swept 
sample. All of the results in Figs. 6 and 7 are a consequence 
of the alkali intersititial ions, their presence in the unswept 
samples and their absence in the hydrogen-swept samples. 
There is no doubt that the [Ale' ]0 center is aluminum-
3572 
J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 52, No.5, May 1981 
related and that the [Ale' r 
centers and the 3306- and 3367-
cm -- 1 infrared bands are closely related. The nature of the 
relationship is either correlative or anticorrelative depend-
ing on the specific experiment (e.g., sum of the absolute con-
centrations, variable-temperature irradiations, or high-tem-
perature anneals). Considered as a whole. these results 
strongly suggest that the 3306- and 3367-cm 
I infrared 
bands in quartz are associated with substitutional aluminum 
ions, and the simplest such defect would be the AI-OH 
center. 
C. Radiation response mechanisms 
It was recognized early in the study of quartz that the 
radiation-induced mobility of interstitial cations was an im-
portant factor in the radiation response of both natural and 
synthetic material. O'Brien 
16 suggested that the [Ale' r 
center was formed when ionizing radiation removed both an 
electron and a positive interstitial ion (either alkali or hydro-
gen) from the vicinity of 
the substitutional aluminum. Kats 
II) 
and Brown and Kahan 
II explained the production of the 
3306- and 3367-cm - I infrared absorption bands by irradia-
tion in terms of 
the retrapping of 
interstitial hydrogen ions at 
aluminum sites after an initial radiation-induced release of 
interstitial alkali ions from the aluminum sites and hydrogen 
from other trapping sites. King and Sander 
I have proposed 
that the transient frequency shifts observed in quartz oscilla-
tors result from the radiation-induced motion of interstitial 
hydrogen away from aluminum sites followed immediately 
by a thermally-induced diffusion of 
the hydrogen back to the 
aluminum. The more recent work of Markes and Hallibur-
ton 22 and Sibley et al. 14 has shown that the interstitial hydro-
gen ion can be displaced by irradiation at any temperature, 
whereas interstitial alkalis only become mobile when the ir-
radiation temperature is above 200 K. 
The results from the present study stongly support the 
work of the earlier investigators and thus further verify the 
following description of the response of high-quality syn-
thetic quartz to ionizing radiation. The aluminum in as-re-
ceived unswept quartz normally is only in the form of AI-
M 
f centers and irradiation at 77 K has essentially no effect 
on such samples. At this low temperature, the interstitial 
alkali ion cannot be removed from the aluminum site and 
this, in turn, prevents hydrogen ions released by the radi-
ation from being trapped at the aluminum site. The hydro-
gen ions, instead, become trapped at other unidentified 
sites. 22 Irradiation of 
the un 
swept samples above 200 K gives 
quite different results, since there is then sufficient thermal 
energy available to allow the radiation-induced dissociation 
of the AI-M f centers. As the interstitial alkali ions are re-
moved from the aluminum sites, holes and interstitial hydro-
gen ions are trapped by the aluminum to form [Ale' r 
cen-
ters and AI-OH- centers, respectively. Annealing the 
unswept samples above 600 K destroys the [Ale' r' centers 
and AI-OH -- centers and restores the AI-M + centers. 
In the case of hydrogen-swept quartz, the interstitial 
alkali ions have been replaced by interstitial hydrogen ions, 
and before irradiation, all of the aluminum is in the form of 
AI-OH-- centers. Irradiation at 77 K dissociates the OH-

molecules and allows the hydrogen to move away from the 
aluminum site. The hydrogen then acts as an electron trap 
while the aluminum becomes a hole trap, i.e., hydrogen 
atoms29.30 and [Ale' ]0 centers are formed. If 
the tempera-
ture of the sample is raised above 130 K following the 77-K 
irradiation, the hydrogen atoms thermally decay and the 
[Ale' ]0 center concentration decreases significantly.22 Irra-
diation of 
the hydrogen-swept samples at room temperature 
also dissociates the OH - molecules and moves the hydrogen 
away from the aluminum, but the lack of stable trapping 
sites at this higher temperature forces many of 
the hydrogens 
to return to the aluminum ions. During the short period of 
time the hydrogen is displaced from the aluminum, a hole 
may be trapped by the aluminum in the form of [Ale' ]0 
centers. The return of the hydrogen converts-the [Ale' ]0 
centers back into AI-OH- centers. Thus in hydrogen-swept 
samples, the steady-state concentration of [Ale' ]0 centers 
remaining after the room-temperature irradiation is signifi-
cantly reduced from the value attained during irradiation, 
and it is also considerably less than the steady-state concen-
tration produced by a 77-K irradiation. 
Within the general description of 
the response of 
quartz 
to ionizing radiation, a number of 
questions remain unan-
swered. Thus far, no conclusive experimental evidence has 
been presented regarding the identity of 
the electron traps in 
high-purity quartz. When hydrogen-swept samples are irra-
diated and maintained below 125 K, hydrogen atoms29.30 are 
believed to play the role of 
electron traps.31 In the case of 
unswept quartz and hydrogen-swept quartz above 125 K, 
the data presented in this paper along with additional data to 
be reported,31 although not conclusive suggest that the inter-
stitial alkali ions playa direct role in forming stable electron 
traps. Also, the radiation-induced dissociation mechanisms 
for the Al-OH- centers and the Al-M + centers are not well 
understood. They appear to be quite distinct mechanisms, as 
illustrated by their significantly different temperature de-
pendences, and our preliminary evidence suggests they are 
based on electronic excitation and thermal excitation, 
respectively. 
D. Comparison of quartz 
The quality of 
synthetic quartz samples, as measured by 
the total aluminum content, can vary significantly. In the 
present investigation, four Premium Q and two Electronic 
Grade samples from Sawyer were examined, and the alumi-
num content varied from 1.5 ppm for sample PQ-A20 to 15.3 
ppm for sample PQ-EIO. These aluminum-content values 
are based on the number of 
silicon sites (I ppm = 2.65 X 10 16 
Si/cm3) and are taken from the concentration of [Ale+ ]0 
centers following the second 77-K irradiation, as given in 
Tables I-VIII. It is interesting to note the order-of-magni-
tude range in aluminum content for Premium Q material. In 
fact, the Electronic Grade samples had aluminum contents 
that fell within the range of 
values for the Premium Q mate-
rial. A number of 
reasons exist for the observed variations in 
aluminum content in synthetic quartz and include (a) the 
variation in aluminum content of 
the natural quartz used as 
the nutrient material in the growth process; (b) the hydro-
3573 
J. Appl. Phys., Vol. 52, No.5, May 1981 
thermal growth conditions in the autoclave, i.e., thermal 
gradients, mineralizer, etc.; and (c) the quality and orienta-
tion of the seed crystal. 
Since samples from only one Toyo bar were examined, 
it is impossible to generali-ze about the aluminum content of 
Toyo quartz. However, the one bar yielded samples SQ-A I 
and SQ-A2 with 10.7 and 12.S ppm values, respectively, for 
aluminum content, and these fall within the range of values 
for the Sawyer samples. Thus at this time, there is no reason 
to expect the Toyo material to be significantly better or 
worse than Sawyer material, at least in regard to impurity 
content. 
Finally, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7 and Tables I-VIII, the 
Sawyer and Toyo quartz exhibit nearly identical radiation 
responses. This consistency in material behavior for samples 
obtained from widely separated sources and possibly grown 
under differing conditions strongly suggests that we are ob-
serving the fundamental (i.e., universal) response of 
high-
quality aluminum-containing quartz to ionizing radiation. 
VI. SUMMARY 
The present investigation has made use of infrared ab-
sorption and ESR measurement techniques to monitor the 
absolute concentrations of the various compensated alumi-
num centers in a variety of 
high-quality synthetic quartz 
samples. When these results are coupled with the work of 
previous investigators, a consistent picture of 
the role of 
alu-
minum in the radiation response of quartz emerges and can 
be summarized by the following statements: (1) Aluminum 
in as-received unswept quartz is primarily in the form of AI-
M + centers. (2) Aluminum in as-received hydrogen-swept 
quartz is primarily in the form of AI-OH- centers. (3) AI-
OH 
- centers are converted to [Ale' r' centers by irradiation 
at 77 K. (4) AI-M + centers are not affected by irradiation at 
77 K. (5) AI-M + centers are converted into AI-OH- and 
[Ale' ]0 centers by irradiation at temperatures above 200 K. 
The ratio of 
the resulting AI-OH- and [Ale' r 
centers evi-
dently depends on the types of electron traps present in the 
sample. (6) In unswept quartz, Al-OH- centers are convert-
ed into Al-M + centers by annealing above 600 K. (7) In hy-
drogen-swept quartz, Al-OH- centers are not affected by 
annealing above SOO K. 
Significant questions still remain concerning the identi-
ty of 
electron traps and the nature of the radiation-induced 
dissociation mechanisms for the Al-OH- and AI-M + cen-
ters. Also, the fundamental question of 
why the aluminum in 
as-grown quartz much prefers to be in the form of Al-M 
+ 
centers as opposed to Al-OH- centers has not been 
answered.
