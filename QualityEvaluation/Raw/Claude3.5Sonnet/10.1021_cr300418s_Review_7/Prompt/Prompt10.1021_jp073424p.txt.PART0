Abstract
We use density functional calculations to study the structure and the energy of formation of the surface oxygen vacancy (VO) in a free-standing, very-thin film (VTF) of ZnO and substitutionally doped ZnO VTF. We are interested in this system because the walls of very high area oxides used in catalysis contain VTFs. We find that the structure of the ZnO(0001) VTF is strongly dependent on the film thickness. Decreasing the thickness of the ZnO(0001) VTF increases the distances between the atomic planes along the (0001) direction. At a film thickness of five layers (L), the energy of the VTF with a wurtzite structure is the same as the energy of the VTF with a hexagonal structure. For thickness <5 layers, the hexagonal VTF is more stable than the wurtzite VTF. The formation of VO is exothermic and leads to a decrease in the interplanar distance along the (0001) direction in the entire film, making the structure close to that of wurtzite. The exothermic nature of VO formation suggests that the ZnO(0001) VTF with vacancies is thermodynamically stable at low oxygen pressures in the gas phase. The structure of the ZnO(1010) VTF does not depend strongly on the film thickness. The formation of a VO at the surface of the ZnO(1010) VTF is endothermic and affects the film structure only in the vicinity of the VO. Replacement of some of the Zn atoms at the surface of the stoichiometric ZnO(0001) VTF by a dopant (Au, Ag, Cu, Ga, or Al) decreases the interplanar distance along the (0001) direction in the entire film, making its structure close to that of wurtzite. The formation of a VO at the surface of a doped VTF is endothermic and, therefore, the presence of the dopant stabilizes the stoichiometric wurtzite structure. Doping the surface of the ZnO(1010) VTF with Au, Ag, or Cu lowers the energy of VO formation at the surface and doping with Ga or Al increases it. We also find that Au, Ag, and Cu, which facilitate VO formation, segregate to the surface of the ZnO (1010) VTF and Ga and Al, which hinder VO formation, segregate to the bulk.

1. Introduction
The chemical activity of some oxides can be modified by increasing their area per gram. Klabunde's group has published examples in which the chemistry of MgO, ZnO, and Al2O3 systems with very high surface area is different from that of oxides consisting of larger particles. 1-21 Corma found that the rate of CO oxidation by Au supported on ceria increases by 2 orders of magnitude when the support has a higher area. 22 Such differences in the chemistry of highly dispersed oxides has been observed in other systems. 23,24 It is now fairly common to prepare oxide-containing catalysts having an area of the order of 200 m2/g and areas as high as 1000 m2/g have been reported. Factors such as increased density of the defect sites,1,11 increased extent of adsorption,11 disorder, 11,25 and changes in Lewis and Bronsted acidities in highly dispersed materials11,21 have been invoked as possible explanations for these changes in the reactivity. In a nanoparticle, it is possible to stabilize a structure different from the bulk phase, 26-32 and the differences in structure can also give rise to differences in chemistry.
A qualitative estimate for ZnO particles having surface areas of 250 m2/g suggests a thickness of about 5 layers, assuming that the density of very thin ZnO films is not appreciably different from that of ZnO bulk. The walls in a high-surface area, porous support (or catalysts) have a very contorted shape. Nevertheless, certain parts of the supports (or catalysts) will consist of nearly flat films having a thickness of a few atomic layers.24,33-35 To address the chemistry of such structures, we have used density functional theory to examine some of the properties of free-standing, very thin films (VTF) of ZnO that are a few atoms thick. We have chosen ZnO because it is used as a catalyst by itself 36-42 or in combination with another oxide 43-56 and as a support for the watergas shift reaction and methanol synthesis.44,57,58
Many oxides catalyze oxidation reactions through the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which the oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide. 59 The reduced oxide is reoxidized by reacting with the oxygen molecules in the gas. As the oxygen supplied to the molecule being oxidized comes from the surface of the oxide, the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy (VO) at the surface of the oxide is often a good indicator of the oxidizing power of the oxide. For this reason, we have calculated how this energy depends on the thickness of the VTF.
A method for changing the chemical composition of the catalytic system is to dope the oxide by replacing a small fraction of its cations with another cation.24,60-82 The presence of the dopant modifies the strength of the bond between the surface oxygen atoms and the doped oxide. If the oxygen atoms are bonded more weakly, they are more willing to participate in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism and the doped oxide will be a better oxidant than the undoped oxide. Hence, we have examined how some of the properties of the doped ZnO VTF depend on the film thickness and on the crystal face of the oxide.
We find that the structure of the undoped VTF having a (0001) face shows a strong dependence on the thickness of the film. Thick films have a wurtzite structure but a decrease in the film thickness increases the interplanar distance along the (0001) direction. At a thickness of five layers (L), the energy of the VTF with a wurtzite structure is the same as the VTF with a hexagonal structure. For thicknesses <5 layers, the hexagonal VTF is more stable than the VTF with a wurtzite structure. The calculations show that the structural change is driven by the fact that the surface energy of the (0001) face is lower in the hexagonal structure compared to its value in the wurtzite structure.
The formation of the VO from the surface of the ZnO(0001) VTF decreases the interplanar distance along the (0001) direction in the entire film, making its structure wurtzite-like. The formation of the first oxygen vacancy is exothermic, which means that the thermodynamically stable ZnO(0001) VTF will have a wurtzite structure with oxygen vacancies at its surface. The oxygen vacancy formation is strongly dependent on the thickness of the film and hence, the equilibrium concentration of the oxygen vacancies will be strongly dependent on the thickness of the VTF.
The structure of the ZnO VTF with a (1010) face does not change with thickness. We show that this happens because the surface energy of the (1010) face in the wurtzite structure is lower than its value in the hexagonal structure. The formation of the oxygen vacancies on this film is endothermic.
Replacement of some of the Zn atoms at the surface of the stoichiometric ZnO(0001) VTF by a dopant (Au, Ag, Cu, Ga, or Al) decreases the interplanar distance along the (0001) direction in the entire film, making its structure close to that of wurtzite.
We need to be careful when we compare the oxidizing power of the undoped (0001) VTF with that of the doped VTF. The formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the undoped (0001) VTF is exothermic. Therefore, unless the VTF is exposed to a very high oxygen pressure, this surface will have vacancies on it even in the absence of a reducing agent. If the film is used in an oxidation reaction, the reactant will take up oxygen by forming additional vacancies. Our calculations show that the formation of an additional oxygen vacancy is endothermic and we denote this energy by ΔE. This is the energy characterizing the oxidative power of the undoped VTF. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of the doped (0001) VTF is endothermic and we denote it as ΔEd. At reasonable oxygen pressure and not too high a temperature, and in the absence of a reducing agent, the doped surface has a negligible number of vacancies. When the dopant is Au, or Ag, and or Cu, ΔEd < ΔE, which means that these dopants facilitate oxidation, i.e., the doped VTF is a better oxidant than the undoped VTF. Al and Ga dopants have the opposite effect. Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the MarsVan Krevelen mechanism, doping the ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power and Al and Ga should decrease it.
Calculations of the energy dependence on the dopant's location in the ZnO(1010) VTF indicate that Ag, Cu, and Au prefer to replace a Zn atom at the surface of the VTF, while Ga and Al prefer to be located inside the VTF.
2. Computational Methodology
We used density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in the VASP program.85,86 The electron-ion interactions are described by using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method87 with 12 valence electrons for Zn, 6 valence electrons for O, 11 valence electrons for Cu, Ag, and Au, 13 valence electrons for Ga, and 3 valence electrons for Al. A plane wave cutoff of 280 eV was used for all dopants. A similar cutoff has also been used in previous simulations of ZnO surfaces performed by Kresse's group.88,89 For some systems, we used a cutoff of 400 eV, which changed the surface oxygen vacancy formation energy (SOVFE) by less than 0.05 eV. The exchange-correlation energy was calculated by using the PW-91 GGA functional.90 The electronic energy was converged to within 10-4 eV per supercell and the ionic positions were optimized with the energy-convergence criterion of 10-3 eV. We allowed a fractional occupancy of bands using a Gaussian smearing within an energy window of 0.05 eV. Monopole, dipole, and quadrupole corrections were taken into account by using the Makov and Payne method.91 Bulk ZnO has a wurtzite structure (Figure 1a) with the computed lattice constants a = 3.282 Å, c/a = 1.6176. A vacuum layer of 1.2 Å was used for all calculations; a further increase in vacuum size produced negligible changes in SOVFE. For studying structural transitions, we used a (1 × 1)-ZnO surface unit cell and 12 irreducible k-points distributed by using the MonkhorstPack technique.92 The results for the ZnO(1010) VTF were obtained with a k-points grid of 4 × 4 × 1 and at the Γ-point for the ZnO(0001) VTF. To test convergence with respect to the k-points grid, we have performed calculations with an 8 × 8 × 1 grid for ZnO(1010) and 2 × 2 × 1 grid for the ZnO(0001) VTF and found that the SOVFE changes by less than 0.05 eV.
Figure 1 (a, left) The wurtzite structure of the bulk ZnO. The dark (light) spheres denote O (Zn) atoms. Part b (right) is the hexagonal structure occurring in a ZnO(0001) film of thickness 5 layers. In the hexagonal structure, the oxygen atoms OT are in the same plane as the zinc atoms ZnP and the oxygen atoms OP are in the same plane as the Zn atoms ZnT. In the wurtzite structure these pairs of atoms are not coplanar. In the bulk, these two structures can be differentiated by using the u parameter. u is defined as the ratio of distance between ZnT and OT to the distance between ZnT and ZnE. In the bulk ZnO, the value of u for the hexagonal structure is uH = 0.5 and for the wurtzite structure uW  0.38.
In general, the energy for the formation of an oxygen vacancy will depend on the charge state of the oxygen vacancy.93 When ZnO is in intimate electrical contact with a metal, electrons are exchanged between the two phases until the chemical potentials of the electrons in them become equal. In such a case, the oxygen vacancy may lose or acquire electrons and can become charged. However, in catalysis, ZnO is not in contact with a reservoir of electrons and so the vacancy will be in the neutral charge state. Hence, all the calculations have been performed for the neutral charge state of the defect. There are experiments which show that the catalytic activity of SnO2 nanowire can be modified by introducing or removing electrons from the wire.94 Such effects are not addressed here.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Structural Transitions in Very Thin ZnO Films. The structure parameter u, defined as the distance between ZnT and OT divided by the distance between ZnT and ZnE (Figure 1), is used for characterizing the wurtzite structure. In bulk ZnO, both Zn and O have 4-fold coordination, and the value of u is 0.378. The calculated energy of formation of bulk ZnO from bulk Zn metal and O2 molecules is 3.41 eV per Zn atom. This is close to the values obtained from previous computations 95-97 and to the experimental values for the heat of formation under standard conditions. 98 Our calculation gives the enthalpy of formation at zero Kelvin while the experimental enthalpy of formation is at 298 K. The difference is an integral over the heat capacity, which is a small fraction of the total enthalpy of formation. 99
We have investigated the structure of the VTF oriented along the (0001) direction as a function of the thickness of the VTF. We call the interplanar distance along the (0001) dZnO. When the number of layers (L) in the ZnO(0001) VTF is decreased, the distance dZnO between ZnT and OT along the (0001) direction increases. In bulk ZnO, dZnO is 2.01 Å. The average values of dZnO for different film thicknesses are 2.06 (12 L), 2.06 (11 L), 2.08 (10 L), 2.06 (9 L), 2.09 (8 L), 2.14 (7 L), 2.23 (6 L), and 2.61 (5 L). Up to a thickness of five layers, the structure is still wurtzite as Zn and O still have tetrahedral point group symmetry. However, the film structure is distorted (when compared to the bulk ZnO wurtzite structure) due to an increase in dZnO. At five layers, the energy of the wurtzite VTF is equal to the energy of the VTF with a hexagonal structure. In the hexagonal structure, the oxygen atoms OT (Figure 1) are in the same plane as zinc atom ZnP; the oxygen atoms OP are also in the same plane as the zinc atoms ZnT. For the hexagonal structure, dZnO = 2.65 Å, and the u parameter takes the value uH = 0.5. For the VTF having fewer than 5 atomic layers, the hexagonal structure has lower energy than the VTF having wurtzite structure.
This kind of structural variation in a ZnO (0001) film as a function of film thickness has also been seen in other computational studies on the ZnO(0001) surface.30,87,99 Two of these studies87,99 compare the stability and electronic structure of ZnO thick films oriented along the (0001) direction with the stability and electronic structure of thick films oriented along the (1010) direction. However, the detailed energetic features of very thin ZnO films are not explicitly discussed.87,99 While another study30 uses a criterion based on electronic structure to differentiate between the hexagonal and wurtzite structure, we have used a slightly different criteria based on atomic structure. Though all these studies observed hexagonal structure at low film thicknesses,30,87,99 the aforementioned differences preclude the comparison of the exact film thickness at which the structural transition occurred with that observed in the present work.
We also performed studies for the ZnO(1010) VTF, and it has a wurtzite structure for all thicknesses.
The transition from the hexagonal to the wurtzite-like structure can be explained by the interplay between the bulk and the surface energy of the ZnO(0001) VTF. It is in general difficult to separate the total energy of a thin film into a surface and a bulk contribution. However, for both the wurtzite and hexagonal structures, it so happens that the total cohesive energy of the VTF is a linear function of its thickness (see Figure 2). This suggests that the total cohesive energy can be written as:
Here, Et is the total energy of the film, Es is the energy of the atoms of the outermost atomic layer of the film, Eb is the energy of the atoms in the bulk layer, and L is the total number of atomic layers in the film. These energies are per surface unit cell.
Figure 2 The total cohesive energy of ZnO(0001) film as a function of the number of layers (L). The squares denote the energy of the hexagonal (H-ZnO VTF) film for L  5, and the circles denote the energy of the wurtzite (W-ZnO VTF) film for L  5. The total energy (Et) of the VTF in these two regimes can be fitted to straight lines: Et(hexagonal) = 8.77L + 0.22, Et(wurtzite) = 8.98L +1.43. All energies are per surface unit cell.
We can test whether this partitioning is correct by using DFT to compute Eb from a bulk calculation and comparing it to the slope of the plot of Et versus L (Et is also calculated by DFT). The results in Table 1 show that the slope of the line (obtained by least-square fitting of the calculated Et) is very close to Eb (computed independently by a bulk calculation). Thus, the partitioning proposed in eq 1 is accurate for the system considered here.

wurtziteZnO(0001) 9.02 8.98 8.27
In Table 2, we compare the energy per bulk layer and the energy of a surface layer along different directions for the hexagonal and wurtzite VTFs. The bulk energy Eb of the wurtzite structure is smaller than that of the hexagonal structure; this is expected since wurtzite is the stable bulk structure. However, along the (0001) direction, the hexagonal structure has a smaller surface energy compared to that of the wurtzite structure. As the films thickness decreases, the ratio of the number of surface layers (always two) to the number of bulk layers increases and hence the relative contribution of the surface toward the total energy increases. This tends to favor a structure with a smaller surface energy when the film gets thin enough. When L = 5, the hexagonal and the wurtzite VTFs have equal total energy. For a film with L < 5, the hexagonal VTF becomes more stable due to smaller surface energy.

wurtzite(0001) 8.98 8.27
hexagonal(1010) 8.77 7.39
wurtzite(1010) 9.02 8.64
  This simple argument also explains why this structural change is not observed for the VTF having a (1010) face: the surface energy of the hexagonal VTF in this case is larger than that of the wurtzite VTF. Hence, there will be no thickness at which the total energy of the hexagonal VTF can become more stable than that of the wurtzite VTF.
The low energy of the hexagonal surface layer can be qualitatively interpreted by using a correlation between bond length and bond strength. The tetrahedrally coordinated atoms of the wurtzite structure have four ZnO bonds, which are nearly equivalent. In the hexagonal structure, the tetrahedral symmetry is broken and the bond along the c direction lengthens, whereas the three bonds in the plane parallel to the (0001) direction contract. This can be qualitatively interpreted as a weakening of the bond along the c direction and strengthening of the three bonds parallel to the (0001) surface. One can evaluate the surface energy in terms of the work done to cleave the bulk to form the surface. As surface formation in the (0001) direction involves breaking the bonds along the c direction, the surface energy of the hexagonal structure is lower than that of the wurtzite structure because its formation involves breaking weaker bonds. Furthermore, the strengthening of the three bonds in directions orthogonal to the c direction returns some energy to the agent breaking the solid and this also decreases the surface energy of the hexagonal structure.
When we cleave the crystal to form the hexagonal (1010) surface, we cleave bonds that are stronger (i.e., shorter) in the hexagonal structure than in the wurtzite structure. Therefore, the energy for forming the (1010) face is higher for the hexagonal structure as compared to the wurtzite structure (unlike cleaving to form the (0001) face).
3.2.Oxygen Vacancy Formation at the Surface of the ZnO VTF. In this section, we discuss the energy of forming a VO at the surface of the ZnO VTF (Table 3). The energy needed for removing one in six oxygen atoms from the surface of 5L ZnO(1010) is 3.31 eV/supercell and this process is endothermic.

aPositive values indicate an endothermic process. For the (0001) film, we remove 1 in every 16 surface oxygen atoms; for the (1010) film, we remove 1 in 6 atoms.
The situation is completely different for the ZnO(0001) VTF. The removal of 1 oxygen atom (out of 16 surface O atoms) from the surface to form 1/2O2 is exothermic. We also note the differences in structural response of the ZnO(1010) and the ZnO(0001) VTFs following a vacancy formation (Figure 3). When an oxygen vacancy is formed at the surface of ZnO(1010), the only structural effect is a small shift in the position of the neighboring atoms. In the case of the ZnO(0001) VTF, the formation of a vacancy causes the structure to change globally, going from a hexagonal structure to a wurtzite-like structure. In particular, we note that the creation of oxygen vacancies in the ZnO(0001) VTF is accompanied by formation of bonds between Zn and O along the (0001) direction (Figure 3).
Figure 3 (a) The structure of the ZnO(1010) stoichiometric VTF with five atomic layers. (b) The structure of the ZnO(1010) VTF after removing an oxygen atom (the location of the vacancy is marked by a hexagon). (c) The structure of the stoichiometric ZnO(0001) VTF. (d) The structure of the ZnO(0001) VTF after removing an oxygen atom (the location of the vacancy is marked by a hexagon). Upon VO formation, the structure changes locally in the ZnO(1010) VTF and globally in the ZnO(0001) VTF.
The exothermic nature of SOVFE means that at equilibrium in the absence of gaseous oxygen and at a temperature of 0 K, the surface is much more likely to have 1 oxygen vacancy per 16 surface oxygen sites than to be stoichiometric. If the rate of vacancy formation is very low, it is possible to create a metastable surface with very few vacancies if the VTF is prepared in an oxygen-rich environment and held at a reasonably low temperature.
By partitioning the total energy of the thin film into surface and bulk, we calculated the energy of the surface and bulk layer of the reduced 4L, 5L, and 6L thick Zn(0001) VTFs. We find that the surface energy (for a VO concentration of 0.0625 monolayers) is 8.36 eV per ZnO unit on the surface. This is higher than the surface energy of the stoichiometric (hexagonal) layer, which is 8.77 eV (Table 2). This is consistent with the fact that the reduced VTF has a wurtzite-like structure.
The SOVFE in the ZnO(0001) VTF shows a strong dependence on the film thickness. SOVFE is 0.17, 3.29, and 5.54 eV for 4, 5, or 6 layers, respectively (Table 3).
With the increase in the film thickness, the SOVFE of the film should converge toward the value corresponding to the SOVFE of a semi-infinite surface. Due to the large supercell needed for the (0001) face, we could only calculate the SOVFE for a thickness of up to six layers. It has been shown in other works that the structure in the middle of the slab converges to the bulk structure only if the slab is 18 layers thick.31,88,100 We suspect that the energy of oxygen vacancy formation in such a slab will also converge to a particular value.
The SOVFE in the ZnO(1010) VTF depends weakly on the film thickness. SOVFE is 3.8, 3.5, 3.31, and 3.24 eV for 3, 4, 5, and 6 layer films, respectively. Due to the large supercell, we can only calculate the SOVFE in the ZnO(1010) VTF for a thickness of up to six layers.
As vacancy formation from the ZnO(0001) VTF is exothermic, the film will have oxygen vacancies in its surface layer at thermodynamic equilibrium. Their concentration will depend on the magnitude of the energy of formation, the oxygen pressure, the temperature, and the film thickness.
In the case of the ZnO(0001) VTF, we have also computed the energy for creating the second VO at a distance of 11.36 Å from the first VO. The creation of the second VO is endothermic and is less sensitive to the film thickness (Table 3). Also, the structural change upon creation of the second VO in the ZnO(0001) VTF is local; no large-scale changes in the film structure are observed.
The energy of vacancy formation is a measure of the oxidizing power of an oxide. In a highly dispersed ZnO system, both facets considered here are likely to be present. The oxidizing power of those parts of the system exposing the (1010) face to the reacting gases will not have a strong dependence on the thickness of the material; and hence, increasing the dispersion will not change the reactivity of this surface. A very different situation is encountered for those parts of the system that expose the (0001) face. According to our calculations, removing 1 in 16 oxygen atoms to from 1/2O2 is an exothermic reaction and, therefore, this facet will have oxygen vacancies on it, whose equilibrium concentration will depend on the film thickness. An oxidation reaction will have to generate additional vacancies. Thus, it is the formation of these additional vacancies that controls the oxidizing power of the oxide.
3.3.The Structure of the Doped ZnO VTF. In this section, we discuss how the structure and energy of forming a VO at the surface of the doped ZnO(0001) VTF change when we replace one Zn atom at the surface with another cation. We use a (4 × 4) supercell and we replace 1 in 16 surface Zn atoms with a dopant, which corresponds to a surface dopant concentration of 0.0625 ML. We did not consider higher dopant concentrations, or situations in which the dopants may be adjacent to each other. In the experiments on doped oxide systems, the dopant concentration is kept low, and substantial clustering of the dopants does not occur. The structure of the host oxide is not changed substantially (except for a slight modification of the lattice constant) and no new phase is observed. There are suggestions that in some cases, dopants can be next to each other,65 or the concentration of the dopants in the surface region is greater than the concentration in the bulk region.64 Even in these systems, the dopant and the oxide still form a solid solution, and no phase separation of the dopant oxide or dopant metal particle is observed.
We have studied the effect of doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Al, and Ga. In the case of ZnO(0001), doping converts the structure from hexagonal to wurtzite-like. We interpret this change in structure to mean that doping the surface layer affects the surface energy of the hexagonal and wurtzite structure such that the total energy of the hexagonal VTF is never lower than that of the wurtzite.
3.4.The Energy of Oxygen Vacancy Formation for the Doped ZnO VTF. Table 4 gives the energies of formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the doped ZnO VTF. Removing an oxygen atom from the surface of the VTF to form half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase and a surface VO is an endothermic process for all thicknesses and for all dopants studied here. This endothermic nature of SOVFE is markedly different from that of the stoichiometric, undoped ZnO(0001) VTF, which loses one oxygen atom spontaneously (i.e., the reaction is exothermic). As doping reduces the probability of vacancy formation, one might rush to infer that the doped VTF is a less active oxidant than the undoped VTF. However, this is not the correct interpretation. The stable state of the undoped ZnO(0001) VTF has a VO on it. Therefore, a reducing agent (e.g., CO) coming in contact with this surface will react with a surface that already has an oxygen vacancy on it and will have to create a second VO. The energy needed for the second VO is indicative of the oxidizing power of the ZnO(0001) face. The energy for creating a second VO from the undoped ZnO(0001) VTF is given in parentheses in the fifth row of Table 4. The energy for creating the second VO from the undoped ZnO(0001) VTF is larger than the energy required to form the first VO in the ZnO(0001) VTF doped with Cu, Ag, or Au. Therefore, we conclude that these dopants facilitate the oxidation reaction by the ZnO(0001) VTF. Doping with Al or Ga makes this reaction more difficult.

In the row labeled no dopant, the energies given in parentheses are for the formation of a second oxygen vacancy from a ZnO(0001) VTF.
Ag and Cu form oxides (Ag2O and Cu2O) in which they have +1 oxidation state, and these decrease VO formation energy. Au forms oxides that are either very weak or metastable 101 and Au decreases the SOVFE. Ga and Al that have +3 oxidation states in their oxide (Ga2O3 and Al2O3) form oxides that are quite strong101 and these dopants hinder VO formation. We note, however, that this qualitative interpretation based on the oxidation state and the oxide strength is not valid for other doped systems we have studied so far.62,63
3.5.Dopant Location: Surface or Bulk? To influence catalytic activity, a dopant must be located in the surface layer of the oxide or perhaps in the subsurface layer. To determine this preference for the dopants investigated here, we have computed the energy of the doped oxide with the dopant in the top layer or in the middle of the ZnO(1010) VTF. The results are shown in Table 5 where a negative value indicates that the dopant has the lowest energy when it is substituting the Zn atom in the surface layer and a positive value indicates preference for substituting the Zn atom inside the VTF. The dopants Au, Ag, and Cu, which facilitate oxygen-vacancy formation, prefer to be located at the surface; Al and Ga would rather be in the bulk. For this limited set of dopants, it seems that these propensities are dictated by the strength of the dopantoxygen bonds. The oxides of Au, Ag, and Cu are less stable than ZnO and, therefore, replacing a Zn atom at the surface changes fewer ZnO bonds into dopantO bonds compared to making the same replacement in the bulk. The opposite situation holds for Al and Ga.

aNegative values indicate that the dopant prefers to be located at the surface.
These calculations are relevant only for preparative conditions that ensure that the doped oxide has reached thermodynamic equilibrium. Many interesting materials are in a metastable state and in the case of doped oxides this might mean that some of the dopants may be entrapped in the bulk even though they would prefer to be at the surface. The calculations indicate that the dopants that facilitate VO formation, which are located at the surface after the preparation, will not have a propensity to migrate into the bulk.
4. Conclusions
The present study was motivated by various experimental observations that chemical properties of some oxides with a very large surface area differ from those of the same oxide prepared to possess a smaller surface area. In addition, we wanted to test how the properties of very thin oxide films change when they are doped with other cations. We find that the structure of stoichiometric ZnO(0001) films shows a strong dependence on the thickness of the film. A decrease in the thickness of the stoichiometric ZnO(0001) VTF increases the distance between the atomic planes along the (0001) direction. At a thickness of five layers, the energy of the VTF with a wurtzite-like structure is the same as that of the VTF with a hexagonal structure. For thicknesses less than five layers, the film with a hexagonal structure is more stable than a film with a wurtzite-like structure. A simple model shows that this change in structure is due to the competition between the bulk energy and the surface energy of the VTF. The surface energy of the hexagonal ZnO(0001) VTF is less than that of the wurtzite ZnO(0001) VTF, and with decreasing thickness the total energy of the VTF can be decreased by adopting the structure with a lower surface energy.
The stoichiometric ZnO(0001) VTF is not stable with respect to oxygen vacancy formation: removing one oxygen atom from the surface to form the VTF with a vacancy and 1/2O2 in the gas-phase is an exothermic process. The creation of surface oxygen vacancy causes a decrease in the interplanar distances along the (0001) direction. The energy for forming an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the film shows a strong dependence on film thickness. This suggests that the equilibrium concentration of oxygen vacancies is a thickness-dependent property.
The ZnO(1010) VTF has a wurtzite structure at all thicknesses and is stable toward formation of oxygen vacancies. When compared to the ZnO(0001) VTF, the magnitude of the energy to form an oxygen vacancy at the surface is less sensitive to the thickness of the film.
Doping the ZnO(1010) VTF substitutionally with Ag, Au, or Cu facilitates oxygen vacancy formation, and doping with Al or Ga makes it harder to reduce the surface. The introduction of the dopant does not cause a large-scale change in the structure of the ZnO(1010) VTF. On the other hand, doping the ZnO(0001) VTF decreases the interplanar distances along the (0001) direction in the entire film. Regardless of the film thickness, the formation of an oxygen vacancy from the doped ZnO(0001) VTF is endothermic.
As we have already mentioned, the surface of the undoped ZnO(0001) VTF will have oxygen vacancies on it. If the film is used in an oxidation reaction, the reactant will take up oxygen by forming additional vacancies. Our calculations show that the formation of an additional oxygen vacancy is endothermic and we denote this energy by ΔE. This is the energy characterizing the oxidative power of the undoped VTF. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of the doped (0001) VTF is endothermic and we denote it as ΔEd. At reasonable oxygen pressure and not too high temperature, and in the absence of a reducing agent, the doped surface has a negligible number of vacancies. When the dopant is Au, or Ag, and or Cu, ΔEd < ΔE, which means that these dopants facilitate oxidation: the doped VTF is a better oxidant than the undoped VTF. Al and Ga dopants have the opposite effect.
Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism, doping ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power of the oxide surface and Al and Ga should decrease it. Thus, the oxidative power of the VTF can be altered substantially by doping, and the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies can be manipulated by changing the thickness of the VTF. If the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy at the surface is lower, one would expect that the temperature at which oxidation occurs in a temperature-programmed experiment will be lower. Often one assumes that if this temperature is lower, the oxide is a better oxidation catalyst. This is not necessarily true. To be a good oxidation catalyst the oxide must be able to react with gaseous oxygen and recover the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction. If this step is very slow the oxide will be a poor catalyst.
